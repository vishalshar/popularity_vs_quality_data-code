132`Size:4-Pack Wide Mouth Product Description Fermented foods are among the healthiest things we can eat… and with the Pickle Pipe, they are some of the easiest to make right at home. Start making your own sauerkraut, real pickles, kimchi (and more!) easily and effectively – without the hassles and costs of traditional methods. From the Manufacturer Home Made Fermented Superfoods Fermented foods like sauerkraut, pickles, and kimchi are loaded with probiotics and incredibly healthy for you. Make them in small batch Mason jars to try out new recipes, and be efficient with your ingredients. The Pickle Pipe is the easiest way to start making your own fermented foods today. How the Pickle Pipe Works As food ferments, it releases carbon dioxide in your jar. If not properly vented, your jar can actually explode! However, opening your jar will expose your ferment to mold-causing oxygen and other contaminants. The Pickle Pipe vents gas as needed, without letting anything in to spoil your food. Automatic Venting The patent-pending one-way valve automatically regulates the pressure in your jar. There is no maintenance or monitoring required, unlike traditional water-based airlocks. Super Simple Design It's just one piece. Screw it on with any standard Mason jar band, and that's it. Say goodbye to complicated multi-piece airlocks. Easy to Store & Clean The low-profile design lets you ferment in tight spaces. Pop your Pipes in the dishwasher to clean, or hand wash in seconds. There’s nothing easier. Join the Family The Pickle Pipe is part of the Masontops family of fermentation products. Pickle Pebble glass fermentation weights, and the Pickle Packer vegetable tamper complete the fermentation dream team. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Easy to use. How did you come up with the idea for this product? We are fermenters. We experienced first-hand the inconvenience of burping jars every day or maintaining water levels in 3-piece airlocks. We knew exactly the problem we were trying to solve. What makes your product special? Without the Pickle Pipe there is no way to ferment vegetables at home without checking in on them every day. This product makes home fermentation more accessible and enjoyable. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Meeting our customers before they were customers. Usually companies launch a product, then meet their customers. We had a unique opportunity to build a community and respond to their needs beforehand.

105`Product Description The ATLAS Throttle Lock is a mechanical cruise control that fits on nearly every motorcycle. It rotates with your throttle hand, is thumb activated and just over 1/4 inch thick. The ATLAS mounts between the throttle housing and rubber grip, taking up no grip space. Using a combination of pressure and friction, the ATLAS will hold your throttle in place with the push of a button. Overriding the ATLAS is as easy as twisting the throttle to adjust speed. The ATLAS bolts on in 2 minutes and requires no modifications for most motorcycles. It is made of heat treated, hardened stainless steel and held together with US Military grade rivets. Once installed, the ATLAS moves with you when you twist your throttle. You have the freedom to set the button at just the right angle so you are never reaching for the button - it is always right where you expect it to be. Each kit comes with two different sized clamp arms to accommodate different thicknesses of handlebars as well as three different sized friction pads to accommodate different thicknesses in the gap where the ATLAS mounts. The friction pads adhere to the stopper arm to apply friction to the throttle housing. To activate the ATLAS, simply press the button in and the stopper arm presses out and applies friction. With the ATLAS engaged, it is still possible to adjust your speed by rotating the throttle. To disengage, press slightly in, then down toward the ground. We are proud to say that every aspect of the ATLAS is sourced and made in the USA - including all the internal components. The ATLAS works great in all conditions whether you are cruising across the desert in the heat of day or traveling over a mountain pass in below freezing temperatures. Rain, sun, snow, mud... nothing stops the ATLAS from helping you take control on your next long ride! From the Manufacturer Universal Fit – Sell The Bike, Keep Your ATLAS The ATLAS Throttle Lock was designed to fit on nearly every motorcycle out there. Now, you can keep your throttle lock when you upgrade to a new motorcycle. Are you planning a ride in another part of the country on a rental motorcycle? Take the ATLAS with you! I bet you didn't know this, but we sell more ATLAS' to people with throttle locks than without. That's because we designed the ATLAS to confront all the problems posed by all previous throttle locks. On top of that, we offer a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee. If the ATLAS Throttle Lock doesn't work for you, send it back for a full refund. Maintain Full Control of Your Speed – All The Time When the ATLAS is engaged, you can rotate your throttle in any direction. The ATLAS will never "Lock" your throttle in place. It simply applies pressure against the throttle housing to hold your throttle in any given position. You can make incremental changes in speed and even rotate the throttle back to 0 mph in case of an emergency. The ATLAS will not accidentally disengage or slip. To disengage, press the button downward, towards the ground. Thumb Activated Intuitive Design The ATLAS Throttle Lock wasn't designed for the motorcycle – it was designed for the rider. The ATLAS is thumb activated and ergonomically positioned to work with any hand size. Works With All Throttle Tubes Each kit comes with 2 clamp arms. These clamp arms have 3 channels cut into them to adjust the clamp diameter for a perfect fit, every time. Works With Aftermarket Parts Measuring in at only 1/4 of an inch, the ATLAS doesn't take up any grip space, works with all kinds of hand guards and heated grips. Inspired from an Around the World Motorcycle Journey Dissatisfaction is a real motivator. I have been riding motorcycle for decades and have tried a variety of different throttle locks. I quickly realize the market offering of designs were more novel then functional. They may work well in a showroom, but are awkward, if not dangerous when cruising at 70 mph. I had a design for a completely different concept. One that wasn't built on the older designs that were available. Once we launched our Kickstarter campaign, and saw how receptive riders were to this new design, I knew we had a winner. I was surprised to find the majority of our buyers already had throttle locks on their bikes and they weren't satisfied. They wanted something better. Our goal of providing a safe, simple and functional throttle lock has come to fruition, and we couldn't be happier with the feedback we've received. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Motorcycle Cruise Control How did you come up with the idea for this product? The ATLAS, which stands for Adventure Touring Leaves All Signs, was born on the open roads of the world. It was dreamt up in New Zealand, modified in Australia and tweaked again in India. Throughout Europe, I was eager to attach his new invention to my bike and finally cruise with comfort and ease. Once home from our trip, I started prototyping and spent years tweaking the design to get everything just right. It was on the Autobahn in Germany where the logo was born. The white circle with three diagonal black lines signifies the "End of All Road Restrictions". You are free to enjoy the open road on your terms, with nothing impeding you along the way - discomfort and inconvenience included. What makes your product special? It's made in the USA out of hardened stainless steel. We have a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee as proof that we offer the best throttle lock solution on the market. The ATLAS is thumb activated and rotates with your hand as you accelerate. What has been the best part of your startup experience? I was blown away by the support we received from the motorcycle community. Without all of the support we received, we genuinely wouldn't have been able to make this product a reality. Additionally, crowdfunding has benefitted us in more ways than I could have imagined. Here are a few example: SEO rankings, organic shares, social proof of our product, instant design feedback, a paying test group, no debt... I could go on. :)

Now you can live your life on bike and not worry about your stuff. That will leave time for more fun, adventures and freedom. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Flexible, Weatherproof, Secure How did you come up with the idea for this product? The Buca Boot idea was born while cycling the streets of London. I was always going somewhere — to classes at the London School of Economics, to a museum, to the pub, or all three in a row. Every activity required me to carry different things. I felt like a pack mule taking it all on my bike. I started thinking … wouldn’t it be great if I could treat my bike the way that everyone treats a car trunk (or ‘boot,’ as they call it in Britain), where you can just toss a gym bag or an extra pair of shoes in the trunk, no problem? Over the last four years, I’ve enlisted various designers and engineers to realize my vision. We worked through iteration after iteration trying to nail the combination of features that make the Buca Boot different: security, weather resistance, and a flexible lid system. In 2013, the final team came together and made something we wanted to share with the world. What makes your product special? The Buca Boot is as beautiful as it is functional. No other product on the market offers our unique dual functionality - open basket and lockable trunk - and looks good doing it. What has been the best part of your startup experience? As many other entrepreneurs have experienced, it's a long road from initial idea to actual product. But seeing our baby out in the world is fantastic. The best experience is having people send us photos of the Buca Boot on bikes around the world. Sometimes we know whose bike it is but it's most exciting when we don't. It means we've brought something into the world that we're proud of and that others are finding useful. There's nothing better.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Metrics. Music. Style. How did you come up with the idea for this product? We used to work in a digital agency and often had a hard time gathering all the most important product numbers like app’s ranking, downloads and website stats. It simply took too long to gather them from different slow loading sites. We decided to solve this problem by creating a simple device that saves time, tracks key metrics autonomously and motivates the team. We believe that key information should radiate, people do not need to spend time on getting something important. What makes your product special? Most of the existing devices are personal and designed around the seeking information.

LaMetric Time makes it with style by shaping key information and pixel art into simplicity. As a result, the environment is getting more cheerful, intelligent and engaging.

We’re extremely grateful to our Kickstarter backers, supporters, and everyone who pre-ordered LaMetric Time from the first batch. Seeing the excitement of our first customers once they had hands on the device was super rewarding.
356`Product Description 3D Sound One headphones are much more than your classical audio headphones. Get immersed in sound unlike anything you have experienced before. Release the tone that is trapped in your head and let it embrace your surroundings. The spatial simulation of sound and the use of motion sensors produce an experience with unprecedented realism. Lose yourself into a multitude of surrounding sound sources adapting to the least of your movements. You’re totally immersed in your activity (video games, movies). Dive into the audio scene. From the Manufacturer $125171 raised with 589 backers. 3D Audio with Head Tracking : the most realistic experience Our patented 3D Audio technology let you experience multichannel surround sound content (5.1, 7.1) over headphones with unprecedented precision, as well as full 3D audio. Sound comes from everywhere around you and dialogues are clearer! 3D Sound ONE embeds a low latency and very accurate head tracking module for the most immersive and realistic experience. The 9 axis motion tracker captures tiny and large head movements (which are both very important for the auditor to « feel » where the sound comes from). It reproduces the sound sources in space in a virtual sound environment. The sense of wearing headphones disappears! Multichannel Audio Drivers and Mobile Media Player 3D Sound Labs Virtual Home Theater audio drivers for 3D Sound ONE are available for download from our website. They provide immersive surround sound, Digital Equalisation, and Virtual Room Acoustics to all applications with multichannel audio (5.1/7.1) outputs.

Our motion sensors are taking things one step further, delivering you a game experience of extreme realism.

The first portable home-cinema 3D Sound ONE lets you experience cinema-sound, with a headset, anytime, anywhere. This is your own portable home-cinema.

They are very light and have large “over the ear” cups with high-end foam paddings providing both strong noise isolation and comfort. They can be folded and stored in an elegant and robust casing for easy portability. Don’t leave your house without bringing your home theater! About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Innovative, Mobile, Comfortable How did you come up with the idea for this product? Xavier was working on new 3D sound formats. We quickly made the observation that the problem would not be to encode the sound in 3D but play it back. Today, when one thinks 3D sound, it is a home theater with many speakers. With new formats coming up, it means even more speakers and will become very cumbersome, expensive and definitely not mobile. We believe headphones are the best way to render audio in 3D. What makes your product special? The 3D Sound One headphones are not conventional stereo headphones but they reproduce sound in 3D. They are connected to an application that virtualizes speakers in space. For better realism, motion sensors send in real-time the position of the listener's head to be able to compensate the movements: the sound stays where it’s supposed to be, relative to the stage that the listener is currently viewing and listening. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part was when we hold the final product for the first time. It feels like meeting a newborn baby ;) The most challenging was to go from a concept to an indistrialised product in such a short time frame, when many competencies need to work together toward the same goal.

Alternatively, Nuimo can work together with your Android Phone, Android Tablet, iPhone or iPad to create a more seamless smart home. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Seamless Smart Home How did you come up with the idea for this product? We started building Nuimo because we love technology – but we didn’t love how we were interacting with it. Amid the hundreds of thousands of apps and hardware with massive screens, we wanted something simple – we wanted interfaces designed with humans in mind. That’s why we began building products, to create things that would engage the human senses and give the best experiences of technology through haptics, speech, gesture and vision. We believe in providing for the user exactly what they need in a micro-moment to create the most seamless experiences without added distraction. We began developing Nuimo as a way to solve our own problems-- we loved playing music but wanted a communal way to interact with it. So we got together and began to discuss what types of interfaces could solve our problems. After many, many rounds of user testing and feedback, Nuimo started to take shape. What makes your product special? We believe that great products come from great interdisciplinary teams. Nuimo was built by a team of engineers and designers who truly care not only about technology, but about technology’s ability to empower the user. We believe that to create a better smart home experience you have to put people at the center. That’s why we created Nuimo. With Nuimo, anyone can have access to the technology that they love without distractions; meaning your attention can stay focused on the people and the things that matter. We believe the approach of combining psychology of the users and design is the best way to produce products that truly address the needs of customers. This vision, combined with the highest standards for quality of materials and design, is what guided the design of Nuimo and what makes it special. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of our startup experience has been co-developing Nuimo and other products alongside our customers. Our early supporters have been the key factor in shaping Nuimo into the product it is today. From the beginning, we included them in the design process, working to understand their needs and build a solution specifically for them. Each time we consider building a new integration, we take into account the needs of our customers – making sure that they have a direct impact on the decisions that we make regarding Nuimo. Even as our customer base grows, we make sure to continue this practice of always keeping in contact with those who support us to make sure that Nuimo remains a product that was built with you in mind.

Life to Light How did you come up with the idea for this product? Cofounders Swapnil Bora and Corey Egan met as graduate school classmates at the University of Texas at Dallas in 2010. The two sat next to each other in class and during one particularly emotive conversation stumbled upon an idea for ilumi. They submitted their idea to UT Dallas’s annual business idea competition, and won. Then, the school sponsored the team to compete at a slew of national and international competitions and the duo came home with a suitcase full of awards and prize money. From there, cofounders Egan and Bora decided to put all funds into making their idea for ilumi a reality, and ilumi was born. What makes your product special? The smartbulb and smartlighting category is growing very quickly and there are similar concepts. What makes ilumi unique is our focus on delivering better lighting for better living rather than just an app controlled bulb that changes color. That focus on the customer has weighed into some really advanced technology, like building out the world’s first Bluetooth Mesh network, all of which help make ilumi simpler, brighter, and smarter than the competition and really a better lighting experience. Because of this, the ilumi product does not need a hub or Wi-Fi router to connect. It's a true plug and play system, that brings to the every day consumer an advanced wireless lighting control system that they can control right at their finger tips. The light programs included will allow each user to truly customize their experience. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of the ilumi startup experience has been following the evolution of an idea which was, at the time, completely unexplored territory. Four years later, ilumi holds six patents with several patents pending, secured an investment from Mark Cuban on ABC's Shark Tank, and ilumi is now available for purchase at several major online and brick & mortar retailers. ilumi has introduced a second generation of our product, and in January 2016 at CES announced the launch of two new consumer products: the Outdoor BR30 Flood Smartbulb and the Eclipse Remote Switch which will be available in 2016.

66`In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clanÍs warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnar_k has come, and itÍs the end of the world! ItÍs the VikingsÍ last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at OdinÍs side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar_k, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These ñGodsÍ Giftsî grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponentsÍ strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponentÍs actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!

304`The Obama presidential campaign was an innovation in American politics and American design. For the first time, a candidate used art and design to bring together the American people—capturing their voices in a visual way. The Design Director of the Obama campaign, Scott Thomas, has collaborated with artists and designers to create Designing Obama, a chronicle of the art from the historic campaign. Get the inside story on how design was used by the campaign, trace the emergence of ideas and images over the course of the election, and scope out the amazing art created by artists and grassroots supporters. It’s the definitive account of the vision of thousands of people across the United States -- all in one volume. Using the same grassroots fundraising model as the campaign, the book was created through Kickstarter, a new company dedicated to funding creative endeavors through small donations by committed individuals. Using the Obama fundraising model was the perfect way to insure the book’s quality and integrity. People around the country supported the book, funded its creation, and changed the way we think about publishing. Now you can be part of the revolution. The 336-page hand-crafted book is hardbound with an embossed sleeve, and printed in a vivid six-color process. Read more

Essential. How did you come up with the idea for this product? While out to dinner with my uncle, he took a black plastic comb out of his wallet, where it was awkwardly hanging out the side.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. DSLR Follow Focus How did you come up with the idea for this product? Looking to make a video for a product idea, we were introduced to Jake Snowden, a diy videographer and film student. After conversations with Jake about how expensive and specialized film and video equipment has become and brainstorming diy solutions for the industry, we began to narrow-in on an idea for a simple follow focus. After several prototypes and iterations were 3-D printed and field tested, we sought start-up funding for production of injection molded parts. FocusShifter was successfully funded on KickStarter in 2012 and again with an improvement to the design (added counterbalance) in 2013 and 2016. What makes your product special? FocusShifter is unique in its simplicity. It is fast and easy to set-up and use and attaches directly to your DSLR camera lens. There is no need for rails or other equipment. FocusShifter allows seamless shifting between focal points using hard or soft stops, but without the expense of a standard follow focus. FocusShifter is built for durability using high quality parts assembled in the USA. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Interacting with our customers has been, by far, the best part of our start-up experience. We have particularly enjoyed seeing the creative work of FocusShifter users and hearing stories from them about how FocusShifter has helped them with their projects. We’ve also enjoyed listening and sharing ideas about improvements that have been made to FocusShifter since we first launched (i.e. the balance counterweight and hard stops).

In this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of the game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. Created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel), Exploding Kittens is the most-backed Kickstarter project ever, and the most-funded game in Kickstarter history.

Also there is a smart touch sensor inside that allows to play with mixed LEDs and take really cool photographs. Isn't that awesome? What has been the best part of your startup experience? The most valuable thing is when you see how first customers (early adopters) interact with the just produced product and share their emotions out. In these moments you realize that impossible is absolutely nothing.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Gaming Home Decor How did you come up with the idea for this product? I want to sincerely express my appreciation to you and the hobby that has changed my life - board games! Is it weird to say that? Perhaps. But through all the friends I have met, all the colleagues I have connected with, all the strain my brain has endured at game night, and all the good times it all has brought, I feel that it has changed my life in a very positive way. So, I finally decided to create my own board game related project. I not only started my company Top Shelf Fun through my innate desire to be a part of this great hobby, but to bring something different to the tabletop/sofa! What makes your product special? I am fortunate that the Meepillow struck such a chord with the board game community. I had the right idea, at the right time (in an exploding hobby), and the right resources (such as Kickstarter) to execute. The board game market is thriving and there is a large black hole of gaming decor, so I was incredibly fortunate to see that. I can't wait to see what else people come up with! What has been the best part of your startup experience? Building a company from the ground up with the help of Kickstarter truly was a dream come true. I would not be here doing what I love if it wasn't for all the people that helped me bring them what they love. The board gaming community is the most supportive and knowledgeable group of people I've ever come to know. With their help I can accomplish anything. Stop by your friendly local game store today to see for yourself what this wonderful hobby has to offer!

It was back in 13th century when a flock of goats stumbled upon a bush of berries that made them go loco! Their shepherd decided to brew the berries and came up with the rich and flavourful drink we all adore nowadays! The brand is dedicated to the ones worthy of the praise – goats. ... crafted into a one-of-a-kind coffee mug.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Unique, Coffee, 2GO How did you come up with the idea for this product? I love coffee and I wanted to create a cool coffee mug to carry my coffee with me. Together with my team we came across the story that coffee was discovered by the goats. It took us 2 years to finish up the GOAT Mug project and to choose the right materials. After two years of designing the product I knew that it is so different that we need an approval of the Kickstarter community to make it come alive. People instantly loved the idea which was a great stamp of approval that we’re doing something right. What makes your product special? The GOAT Mug has a story a different shape and an incredibly smart solution on how you put it on the table and carry it around. It’s definitely not your average coffee mug.

On our way we had to solve many problems and we had to be aware of every small detail.

I would also like to thank our community who believes in us and loves what we do. Baa :)

The inspiration for Lily Trotters came to our founder Susan in 2011 during a 17.5-hour airplane ride to Africa for a vacation with her BFF and their daughters. Normally when flying, Susan would need to get up frequently and move her legs around. Wearing an (ugly beige) compression sock for the first time, she never felt the need to get up once in 16 hours! For Susan it was life-changing. Why would she ever put something else on her legs again? When she returned home, she searched for compression socks that were effective, yet beautiful and fun. Much to her dismay, they did not exist…so Susan embarked on an arduous but rewarding journey to produce the first ever high-performance designer line of compression socks, specifically sourced and made in the USA for women everywhere.

257`Product Description Don’t take care of this belt. It will take care of you. For fast and secure latching, the Quicky buckle exploits high-strength neodymium magnets and a unique auto-latching design. To buckle the belt, bring the two halves together, and they jump into place with a satisfying click. To unbuckle, simply push the ends together and twist, and the belt unlocks - great for getting your pants off in a hurry. Each belt is crafted in the USA and overseen by designer Michael Sargent. From the Manufacturer Overbuilt to Perform The Quicky combines rugged functionality with meticulous attention to detail to make for the best-working belt possible. Latching and unlatching couldn’t be easier, and adjustment is a cinch. The fit can be smoothly fine-tuned without having to remove the belt, and it stays put without slipping. We tested it (see video for details). Abuse This Belt It’s like the AK-47 of belts. Designed to work under extreme duress, the Quicky won’t let you down. Other quick-release belts work well when they’re new, but none are as rugged or long-lasting as the Quicky. Load it up, get it dirty, and wear it hard. It won’t jam or complain. Don’t take care of this belt. It will take care of you. Functional Comfort The sliding-bar adjustment mechanism holds tight while remaining easy to adjust, without having to undo your belt. The higher the tension, the tighter it grips. Precision Machined Buckle We start with a block of 6061-T6 aluminum alloy and machine away everything that doesn’t look like a Quicky buckle. Action Ready Premium nylon webbing, hard anodized coating, and a dust-tolerant design mean this belt is ready for whatever you throw at it. Make the Tool “If you don’t have the tool, make the tool.” For a man of action, the belt is a tool that does more than hold your pants up. We couldn’t find a quick-release belt that was rugged, reliable, and comfortable, so we made it ourselves from scratch, right here in America. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Better Working Belt How did you come up with the idea for this product? I was frustrated by the lackluster quick-release belts that were already on the market. Most were basically seatbelt buckles sewn onto a strap and called a belt, or they used a weak plastic buckle that was made somewhere in China for a few cents. Others used buckles made for safety hardware, so they were not necessarily designed for easy release, and they had a tendency to jam once they got dirty. I knew there had to be a better way, and after contemplating the idea for a while, I came up with the magnetic Quicky concept. Making it a reality would require dozens of prototypes, a Kickstarter project, and a sizeable investment in equipment, including a CNC mill and a couple industrial sewing machines. It was worth the effort though. Quicky continues to surpass expectations for myself and thousands of other satisfied users. What makes your product special? Heirloom quality. It means this belt is designed to last a very long time. Compare that to the “genuine” bonded-leather belt you pick up at the local big-box store. We’ve all seen those belts fall apart in short order. The Quicky is basically the opposite of that. What has been the best part of your startup experience? I’m fascinated with how tools get used outside of their original purpose. Personally, I’ve used the Quicky to hang a hammock, to tether my husky when we go camping, and once to pull a truck out of a ditch. Obviously a belt will be used to hold up your pants, but when people think outside the box and use it for something else, that’s what makes me smile. Getting to think outside of the box every day, and working with customers that do the same… It’s hard to beat.

We started the company because we couldn't find a truly natural and great tasting gum in the market. It turns out that the regular chewing gum you see on grocery store shelves is filled with artificial substances, including some of the same components used in the manufacture of car tires, plastic bottles, and white glue, as well as artificial sweeteners like aspartame. Consumers are kept in the dark about what they are chewing because the FDA allows conventional gum brands to hide up to 80 synthetic ingredients in the catch-all term "gum base" on the label. We knew we could do better. In New York, our gum chefs craft the best ingredients into the highest quality gum on the market. The result is a lightly sweetened, totally natural gum that’s better for your body and the environment. Simply Gum makes all natural premium chewing gum, without any plastic, synthetics, or artificial flavors. The result is a lightly sweetened, totally natural gum that's better tasting, better for your body, and better for the environment. Because we only use natural ingredients, our gum is not only better for your body, it's also biodegradable and better for the planet. Our innovative packaging includes post-chew wrappers to make it easy to dispose of when complete.

360`Product Description HeroBoys is a collection of superhero characters that set out to empower young boys ages 3-10. The creators, parents of two young boys themselves, invented the line for all boys to inject positive messaging and meaningful, educational content into a superhero landscape dominated by movie marketing related products. The characters, Blazer, Gusto, Rocko, StormSurge, Techno, and ThunderHawk, learn to work together and use their inherent strengths and talents (something that all children have) to help make a positive impact in the world. From the Manufacturer The Best of Both Worlds HeroBoys is a doll/action figure hybrid unlike anything on the market. Most 18-inch action figures are made from hard plastic and do not bend and the elbows and knees. HeroBoys heroes are unique in that their torso is made from soft compressed cotton fibers, giving our Heroes a soft, huggable quality. The limbs however are firm and bendable at the shoulder, elbows, hips and knees for full poseability and play. Heroes Meant for Children HeroBoys is the only line of post preschool hero related products that are focused on providing thoughtful, meaningful, age appropriate content for children. Most of today’s superhero content is immersed in the current Hero-Industrial Complex of PG-13 Movies, violent video games, and dark and morbid comic books. HeroBoys aims to provide positive encouragement and reinforcement of values though it’s comics in which children heroes come to together to do good in a world where adults have left a lot of room for improvement. Durable Construction These Heroes can stand up to the rough and tumble play of active children! Poseability Ready for action with 11 points of articulation! Stand Included Display stand included with each Hero- prefect for bookshelf, dresser or nightstand. There is a Hero Inside Every Boy We created the HeroBoys to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. AmericanGirl Meets Avengers How did you come up with the idea for this product? As parents, we struggled to find toys with meaning and value for our boys. They love Superheroes, but it seems almost all superhero related content is part of today’s Hero-Industrial Complex of major media properties targeted to broad audiences for movies, video games, and comic books. The content in this area for children in the crucial development years from 3 to 10 generally lacks thoughtfulness, value, or meaning. That is why we created the HeroBoys, a line of toys and comic books meant to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. What makes your product special? We are the only line of post preschool superhero related content truly for children and not part of the PG-13 Hero Industrial Complex that turns out superhero related movies of varying quality that are inevitably targeted for he broadest possible market and not concerned with development and age appropriate messaging for younger children. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The reaction from children when they read the comic books and play with the Heroes, they absolutely love them which is fantastic!

Think of it as that extra hand you always wished you had in the kitchen that you won’t be embarrassed to have at your table or anywhere else you serve your culinary creations! About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Design. Art. Function. How did you come up with the idea for this product? Trivae's creation story goes something like this...One day, three friends finally got tired of trying to figure out where to put the lids to their pots while stirring or adding more ingredients. Always afraid of ruining a countertop or burning themselves, they were on the hunt for something functional, but found nothing. So they decided to create it themselves - a product that would not only be useful for holding lids but would also fold flat for storage. And while they were at it, they added a few other tools...and voilà, Trivae was born! What makes your product special? Trivae is the ultimate, multi-functional kitchen tool and tabletop accessory. Not only does it solve the age-old problem of where to put your lid while cooking but its unique design allows it to change form and function easily. It’s art and function at work in your kitchen, your dining room and any other place you eat and entertain! What has been the best part of your startup experience? It has been incredible to watch the product take shape from the very first sketch through the countless months of development and the many setbacks along the way to having the first physical product arrive in our warehouse. But the absolute best part is being able to share Trivae with our customers and hearing about how it has made their lives just a little bit easier. We love knowing we had a part in that!

Its horn shape is a dedication to goats that discovered this elixir of life and it also lets you drink the very last sip. It comes with a set of 2 straps that allow you to carry your coffee, but at the same time reply to a couple of e-mails and carry around your newspaper. From the Manufacturer Inspired by the original story of coffee discovery ... The creation of GOAT STORY was inspired by the greatest discovery of all time – coffee!

The brand is dedicated to the ones worthy of the praise – goats. ... crafted into a one-of-a-kind coffee mug. It is not only the shape which makes it special, it is also the variety of materials that were chosen to suit different styles and preferences. We made sure to use top quality materials that are safe for you and will endure a long time. Because everyone needs their own dose of caffeine fix, we made it in two sizes 12 oz. and 16 oz. Horn shape The horn shape is a dedication to goats that discovered coffee and its incline also lets you drink the very last sip.

250`Product Description About Poor Choices From the funny cards written by comedians, to the look on your opponent’s face when you sabotage their character, to your friends acting out hilarious punishments, there is a lot to laugh about! Each round immerses you in a real-life or fictional scenario, and it’s your job to nominate a character from your hand that best suits it. There’s only one problem. Players sabotage each other’s characters with devastating traits, including yours. What may have been the perfect character becomes an unthinkably bad one. And if your character fails to impress, you’ll be stuck performing one of the humiliations while others sit back and watch. What Our Fans Say If you are a fan of CAH, you're going to love this game. The punishments are a great addition to the game as well. Highly recommend this game of you are looking for an awesome party game! - R. Hills This is a great game, the effort that was put into it is obvious, from the art work to the card stock. - Keith I was pleasantly surprised by how many characters and combinations can be made in this card game. Lots of laughs and humor. We didn't want to stop playing. - C. Wizgird Great game, awesome art. Perfect for fans of CAH! - Amazon customer From the Manufacturer $20,574 raised with 386 backers. Hours of Nonstop Laughter From the funny cards written by comedians, to the look on your opponent’s face when you sabotage their character, to your friends acting out hilarious punishments, there is a lot to laugh about. That’s what’s great about Poor Choices—there are so many things happening each round, it’s bound to make everyone laugh. Every round you play is the equivalent of doing 27 crunches, probably. Sabotage Your Friends One of the best parts of Poor Choices is sabotaging your opponents. It’s addicting—you look forward to it every round. Watching your opponent squirm (or worse) when they see the trait you gave their character is a deeply satisfying feeling. You don’t even need to be funny because we wrote the humor for you. You just get to take all the credit! 500+ Full-Color Casino Quality Cards Poor Choices comes with 504 full-color cards printed on top-of-the-line black-core paper. This means the cards will not only look and feel great, but they’ll also last a long time. There are so many possible combinations that it’s exciting even when you replay it over and over. It contains 168 characters, 168 traits, 112 adventures and 56 humiliations. Gorgeous Character Illustrations All 168 Character Cards feature an up close and personal illustration that gives each character a personality. In fact, we even turned some of our actual Kickstarter backers into characters for the game! The illustrations are sometimes cute, funny, creepy or silly, but they’re all incredible thanks to our ridiculously talented artist Neil Morley. Humor By Professional Comedians Comedians and writers from all over the world wrote the humor for thousands of cards. We spent what seemed like eternity narrowing it down the best of the best to create the funniest game possible. Some of the cards are hilarious, and some of them are downright disgusting. One thing is for sure: you’ll laugh your ass off. High Quality Entertainment Our goal is simple: create amazing products that entertain. That’s really it. We all like to escape reality and mess around every once in awhile—some more than others. We just make the things that let you do it. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Hilarious Card Game. How did you come up with the idea for this product? My family and I were playing a card game when my brother tried reading cards out loud with an accent. He couldn’t even finish reading the first card because the entire room was in tears from laughing so hard. This sparked the idea for what are now Humiliation Cards, and the rest of the game fell into place after testing many different game concepts. What makes your product special? As if being hilarious and super fun isn’t enough, it may also be the best-looking card game on the planet. On top of the cards being full color on both sides, every Character Card includes an amazing illustration of the character. It brings the characters to life. Neil Morley, the illustrator of Poor Choices, did nothing but design characters for three straight months, and it took the game to a whole new level. What has been the best part of your startup experience? We’re very proud of creating a great product, but the best part was hearing the funny stories and seeing the amazing feedback from our backers once they got the game. It’s a very cool feeling knowing that something you created is being enjoyed all over the world.

The Traveler is the perfect combination of sophistication and simplicity; everything you need from a notebook, and nothing that you don’t. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Notebooks for creatives. How did you come up with the idea for this product? When I had started a tech company a few years back, I spent a lot of time co-developing our enterprise product with our lead web engineer. We constantly were going over design mockups, algorithm designs, and wireframe sketches in various notebooks. There was a point at which I grew frustrated with how quickly pages would fall out and tear, and that there wasn’t anything out there that was specifically catered to the types of creative work I was doing in terms of the way the pages themselves were laid out. I looked for quite a while to see if any of the options out there today had a solution, but realized that there weren’t any. I decided that if it wasn’t available, then I might as well see if other people were having the same problems I was, and if they’d be interested in a new type of notebook that solved those issues. It turns out that there were plenty of people out there who were experiencing the same frustrations that I was. Code&Quill was born shortly after. What makes your product special? There are a handful of characteristics that separate our notebooks from others. First, our notebooks all lay-flat, meaning that the book won’t close in on you as you’re writing, and the pages don’t try to flip over, regardless of which side you are working on. Second, our pages are made with thick, 100GSM acid-free paper, which is to say that this isn’t the type of paper you’ll find in standard notebooks. They are meant to be more durable and won’t tear easily. Third, our unique page layout really focuses on the way we know a lot of people work, and provides some structure to your notes, without getting in your way. Many popular notebooks brands have always seen their products as temporary and disposable. We believe that your notebook should be a timeless archive that holds the inner workings of your mind during some period in your life. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part, by far, has been the feedback that we receive from customers. There is no better feeling in the world than receiving an unexpected email or call from one of our awesome users about how our products exceeded their expectations, or that their friends are all wondering where they can get one of their own Code&Quill notebooks. To have something that you’ve created be positively received by people you’ve never met is phenomenal.

Smart, simple, carefree How did you come up with the idea for this product? The inspiration for Click & Grow's current technology came from reading an article about NASA's plan to find effective ways to grow plants in space. I decided to try out different plant cultivation technologies to see if they actually work. Although it started out as a hobby for me, I soon developed a passionate interest in the topic and started exploring the subject. After testing the technologies I found that most of them were unsustainable or used excessive resources. So after some research, experiments and many tests, we finally developed the Smart Soil solution that takes care of most of the problems apparent with other technologies. The Smart soil really works! What makes your product special? Click & Grow's technology is easier and more effective than similar products out there. We believe growing plants indoor can also complement your well designed home and thats why we have also dedicated a lot of effort into designing a product that is not only effective, but also beautiful. What has been the best part of your startup experience? With this product the most challenging part was to combine functionality with great design. We wanted to make a product that delivers what it promises, but also looks great sitting on the windowsill or the table. Plant cultivation technologies tend to be messy- there are pumps, sensors, soil and wires to worry about. With the Smart herb garden I feel like we managed to keep the focus on the design but not compromise on the quality.
277`Review “World War 3 Illustrated is the real thing. . . . As always it mixes newcomers and veterans, emphasizes content over style (but has plenty of style), keeps that content accessible and critical, and pays its printers and distributors but no one else. If it had nothing more than that kind of dedication to recommend it, it would be invaluable. But it has much, much more.” —New York Times "World War 3 Illustrated deserves a place on the shelves of anyone who gives a damn about comics or the political art of the last three decades." —Nicholas Jahr, jewishcurrents.org "This is history recorded with a scathing precision. Morality meets hilarity. You find yourself shocked that you’re laughing." —Holland Cotter, nytimes.com“Reading World War 3 Illustrated is both a cleansing and an enraging experience. The graphics remind us how very serious the problems and how vile the institutions that cause them really are.” —Utne Reader“Powerful graphic art and comic strips from the engaged and enraged pens of urban artists. The subjects include poverty, war, homelessness, and drugs; it’s a poke in the eye from the dark side of America, tempered by what the artists describe as their ‘oppositional optimism.’” —Whole Earth Review “This is art—not marketing—on the newsstand. It represents the sort of creativity too rarely given an outlet in comics. It’s the best and longest running alternative comics anthology around.” —Comics Journal"Far ahead of its time, World War 3 paved the way for the more established forms of comics journalism now. . . . this is an indispensable collection of groundbreaking comics." —Publishers Weekly"Organized under categories and including a helpful time line, this book is sure to surprise, enlighten, educate, and inspire." —Henry Chamberlain, comicsgrinder.com"Reading through this strikingly designed book, one cannot help but admire those many young, often obscure and struggling, courageous comic book artists and cartoonists who, with unbridled passion, took on unpopular issues, bashed stereotypes, tore down walls and smashed icons." —Bill Berkowitz, truth-out.org"World War 3 is a useful subjective historical record. When looked at alongside other key comics documents, it's a window on two generations of alternative cultural and political ideas." —Steve Heller, the Atlantic"It is safe to say that nothing, in the annals of comic art, has ever resembled World War 3 Illustrated. Luckily for comic enthusiasts everywhere, this remarkable body of work is now collected in an oversized, chock-full volume." —Paul Buhle, Dissent"These comics are individual, raw, exceedingly biased, and will stay with the reader for a long time to come." —Gretchen Wagner, San Francisco Book Review Read more About the Author Peter Kuper is a cofounder and editorial board member of political graphics magazine World War 3 Illustrated and a teacher who has taught at New York’s School of Visual Arts and Parsons the New School for Design.

Major publications, including Gizmodo, USA Today, Engadget, Fortune, The Daily Dot, Mashable and Popular Mechanics have covered the launch of this innovative toy. And the response from consumers has been just as enthusiastic. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Active, Imaginative, Kids How did you come up with the idea for this product? I saw that there was a problem with toys that ended up sitting dormant on floors and in closets while kids had their eyes glued to the screen. The idea came to me to empower the intuitive imagination found in each and every child with active movement through the technology of a wearable. What makes your product special? Kids are more active with the Moff Band and feel encouraged to be creative. By using the universal language of movement, our wearable smart toy empowers each and every child to imagine. Also, the Moff Band is fun for the whole family – brothers and sister can play together and grandma can jump in anytime! What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of my startup experience has been the challenge. Specifically, at Moff we have challenged ourselves to empower kids to use their imagination by recognizing their 3D motion using only a wrist band. We feel like we have done a pretty good job so far of enabling all types of kids to get up, move and even learn a little bit. And we have enjoyed every minute of it. #productDescription { color: #333333; word-wrap: break-word; font-size: small; line-height: initial; margin: 0.5em 0px 0em 25px; } #productDescription_feature_div > h2.default { color: #CC6600; font-size: medium; margin: 0 0 0.25em; } #productDescription_feature_div > h2.books { color:#333 !important; font-size:21px !important; line-height: 1.3; padding-bottom: 4px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0px; } #productDescription_feature_div > h2.softlines { color:#333 !important; font-size:21px !important; line-height: 1.3; padding-bottom: 4px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0px; } #productDescription > p, #productDescription > div, #productDescription > table { margin: 0 0 1em 0; } #productDescription p { margin: 0em 0 1em 1em; } #productDescription h3 { font-weight: normal; color: #333333; font-size: 1.23em; clear: left; margin: 0.75em 0px 0.375em -15px; } #productDescription table { border-collapse: inherit !important; margin-bottom: 0; } #productDescription table img { max-width: inherit !important; } #productDescription table td { font-size: small; vertical-align: inherit !important; } #productDescription ul li { margin: 0 0 0 20px; } #productDescription ul li ul { list-style-type: disc !important; margin-left: 20px !important; } #productDescription ul ul li { list-style-type: disc !important; margin-left: 20px !important; } #productDescription > ul ul li { list-style-type: disc !important; } #productDescription ul li ul li { margin: 0 0 0 20px; } #productDescription .aplus p { margin: 0 0 1em 0; } #productDescription small { font-size: smaller; } #productDescription.prodDescWidth { max-width: 1000px } P.when('jQuery').execute(function($){ $("#productDescription table").each(function() { var width = $(this).attr('width'); if (width) width += 'px'; else width = 'auto'; $(this).css('width', width); var padding = $(this).attr('cellpadding'); if (padding) padding += 'px'; else padding = '0px'; $(this).css('padding', padding); }); });

123`Product Description Wise Walker gives you a place to stash that nasty bag while you finish your walk -- out of sight, out of mind, and out of your hands! From the Manufacturer $20,301 raised with 394 backers. An Elegant Solution to a Nasty Problem We all love our dogs, but we don't love carrying around that nasty bag of poo. Wise Walker gives you a place to stash that nasty bag while you finish your walk. We worked for more than a year designing, refining and finally perfecting the best possible solution to this problem. Wise Walkers are ultra light, durable, versitle and super easy to use. Our backers and customers rave about how much they love their Wise Walker... and we know you will to. Learning the Lessons of Entrepreneurship Wise Walker began as (and continues to be) a dad and two daughters learning the lessons of entrepreneurship. As a dad and a serial entrepreneur, I wanted to share my experience with (and love for) entrepreneurship with my girls. The opportunity presented itself on a walk with our dog Lola. After picking up Lola's "business", I suggested that they should at least carry the bag. But the idea of carrying around that nasty bag repulsed them -- "that's gross!". "See girls", I said, "that's what entrepreneurs do... they try to solve problems." So I challenged them to solve that problem. After many months of continuing that conversation, Wise Walker was the result. Fun Fact 1: We glued together our first prototypes on the kitchen table. Dozens of versions later, we finally had a product that people loved. Fun Fact 2: While weighing less than 2 ounces, Wise Walkers has enough space to hold up to nine large chicken eggs… as well as pocket for your keys, a cell phone some treats… whatever you like. Fun Fact 3: Team Wise Walker had our first business meeting in a jacuzzi while on a family vacation. The rule ever since has been that the girls get to pick where we have our meetings. Wise Walker is about the journey. For Team Wise Walker, the great entrepreneurial jouney continues. We hope that Wise Walker makes all the small journeys you take with your dogsevery day just a little bit better. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Stop. Carrying. Poop. How did you come up with the idea for this product? We took Lola for a walk one day. Like clockwork, Lola did what dogs do(o) on a walk. No one wanted to carry around that nasty bag while we finished our walk. That lead to a discussion about what entrepreneurs do -- i.e., they solve problems. Solving the problem of carrying around that nasty bag became our mission. What makes your product special? First and foremost, the Wise Walker solution is simple. It does everything you would want such a product to do… without over engineering. That keeps it light weight, highly functional and easy to use. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Annalise: Visiting the sewing shop. Sarah: Seeing the Wise Walker evolve and get better and better each time we learned something. Bob: Working with my daughters.

248`Nominated for 2014 GRAMMY Award : Special or Limited Edition Box Set Package The lost interviews of Howard Smith, 1969-1972. As a Village Voice journalist and radio personality, Smith was a central figure in the counterculture of New York City. In this capacity, he recorded scores of long-form conversations with rock stars and cultural icons of the time. Never intended to be heard unedited, the interviews are authentic and personal conversations with the most influential cultural voices of the time. The original audio reels then sat untouched in the back of Smith's loft for 40 years. Hundred of audio reels have now been digitized and restored, and are available for the first time. The box set is designed to invoke the experience of digging through the actual crates of reels. Beautiful, entirely original artwork was created in homage to the color palette, style and printing technology from that time. The booklet is filled with photos, letters and reproduced ephemera which was found among the reels. A timeline is included to give framework highlighting how closely album's releases and historical events were in relation to each other during this artistically unmatched time in our cultural history. The written copy, intended to give the listener a unique sense of being there themselves, was dictated by Howard Smith from his hospital bed.

64`Size:1 Rack + 6 Skewers Product Description Whether you are cooking kabob on outdoor grills or indoor ovens, there are a lot of tedious steps involved in turning each skewer separately. There is also a chance you may burn yourself attempting to turn each skewer. Therefore, to make cooking kebabs safer, quicker, and efficient, we are introducing 'SkeweRack', shish kabob rack system that allows flipping over all skewers simultaneously. As evident from the below video, SkeweRack can minimize the steps involved in turning all skewers and make cooking enjoyable. SkeweRack is not only for those who love to cook, but also for those who want their family/friends to be safe during cooking. SkeweRack is made with sturdy stainless steel flat skewers and easily fits on grills and inside ovens. From the Manufacturer Turn Over Six Skewers Simultaneously A ‘domino effect’ of SkeweRack to turn all skewers simultaneously makes kebab grilling easy, quick, and efficient. It is ultraportable and super cool. Durable & Sturdy Stainless Steel Design SkeweRack is made with sturdy stainless steel that is not only durable but also easy to use, store, and clean. Flat and Wide Skewers 7mm x 2 mm flat skewers keeps food from spinning/rolling when skewers are turned over No Food Sticking to Grate Tallest Rack on market that suspends food above the grill and keeps kabobs from sticking to the grate Grill Larger Food Chunks Wider gap between adjacent skewers allows cooking of larger food chunks The People You Grill For, Want You To Be Safe KonExcel is a committed to providing innovative grilling products that are aimed at making grilling easy, fun, and safe. We strive to deliver great quality products backed by excellent customer service. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Easy, Fun, Efficient How did you come up with the idea for this product? Most of us are well aware of the common issues the traditional kebab set, such as the off-balanced kebab rotate itself until the heavier side is on the lower side, also each skewer needs to be turned individually. This is not only tedious process but also takes long to grill all kebabs uniformly and safely. There are power driven kebab sets in the market that are very expensive and not portable. So, to tackle all these issues head-on, We came up with SkeweRack - a kabob set that is portable, safer, inexpensive, easier and fun to use. What makes your product special? Most unique feature of SkeweRack is that it allows to flip over six skewers simultaneously like a ‘domino effect’. It doesn’t require power and therefore can be used on grills and ovens. It is very durable and easy to clean. The flat and wider skewers keep the food from spinning when turned. Its taller rack avoids the kebabs from sticking to the grate. What has been the best part of your startup experience? First, the sheer thrill of taking something from a simple idea to a real physical product that is appreciated by customers is extremely satisfying. Second, as we took action to overcome challenges, more doors with solutions seem to open up.

335`Product Description ALCON : Military abbreviation for "All Concerned" and the foundation behind this backpack. This backpack is designed for you, the adventure seeker. Inspired by many of the tactical features you asked for, including quick trapdoor access, improved interior visibility, hidden dry storage pockets, modular patch system, full length side pocket, protective hood, a padded laptop pocket, and more. This backpack is comfortable, lightweight, and rugged enough for your next adventure. The accessory patch system is sold separately. All patches are designed to give you quick access to everyday items, interchangeable, and secured with industrial strength Velcro. From the Manufacturer $39,025 raised with 194 backers. Military Hardware We look at it as an investment not a purchase so on the Fidelis Co ALCON (backpack) we use some of the most advanced and durably constructed military components such as a 1.5” AustriAlpin COBRA buckle. The buckle is one-side adjustable for a varied size payload and with its quick release technology it is super-simple to operate with just one hand. Intelligent Design We thought long and hard about those everyday uses of your bag and how to make life simpler. Sometimes you just need to slip a folder or tablet quickly out – enter our intelligent pass-through top. With the slide of a zipper you have immediate access to the entire main compartment of the bag to pull out a single piece of paper or tablet to quickly reference. Who knows maybe you are in the back of the classroom and just don’t want to go through the loud process of opening everything up just to start taking notes. Always Prepared Instead of a conventional single piece of webbing hand carry strap we took the time to braid together 7’ feet of a continuous string of para-cord which is perfect for everyday use and available to you if you ever find yourself in need of all seven feet, for some MacGyver like activities. Designed for Activity Getting around on a bike is a common occurrence now and when you are in motion you need a place to put that U-Lock – other than stuffing it in your back pocket, we designed a 6.5 inch by 2 inch molle strap, with stitched channels to hold that lock securely. Added Security You won’t always need it but in case you do it is there, inside the front flap we stitched in a protective hood made of the best, light-weight rip-stop nylon. If you are caught in an epic downpour just unroll it from its own pocket and place it over your load. We call that piece of mind. Active Lifestyle Designed for the adventurer in us all the Fidelis Co ALCON, is that everyday backpack that will keep you well prepared on your journey from home to office to shooting urban explorer pictures at night and everywhere in between. If you were looking for something that was purely about functionality – get a grocery bag – if you want something that says something about who you are, what you believe in and how you carry yourself then choose Fidelis Co. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Intelligent, Precise and Active How did you come up with the idea for this product? The company began when I left the Marines and realized there were not many carry solutions that were just as effective on the weekend as they were on the weekday. Everything I looked at fit into the too military, too fragile or too Mt Everest category so when presented with a problem we decided to adapt and overcome by making our own. After, interviewing hundreds of people we arrived at our current designs. In our conversations we found a lot of people out there wanted something different than the corporate giveaway bag or whatever was left around from the past. These people care about looking their best without sacrificing functionality – we designed this for them. What makes your product special? We are not special because we make our bags in America, use the best materials and providing outstanding customer service but we have found those things matter to our customers so we thought we would mention them upfront. What makes our bag special is how we took the time to incorporate the best in tactically inspired features and design into bags that are appropriate for everyday use from the boardroom through the weekend getaway. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Anytime you create something out of nothing it is rewarding – but for us the most exciting part of the journey is hearing from customers about how much they love our backpack, weekender and other accessory bags. Every once in a while we will be out looking around the internet and we’ll randomly bounce across a customer blog post or review and read about how much they are in love with their bag because of its design, materials etc; that will make everyone over hear at Fidelis Co’s day!
95`Review Why Russia has the world's most beautiful bus stops … Architects may have felt creatively stifled in the old Soviet empire – but there was one place where their imaginations were encouraged to run riot: the bus stop. (Oliver Wainwright The Guardian)Perhaps it’s the low stakes of structures with no windows, no doors and no permanent inhabitants that allowed the designers the freedom to flex their creative muscles; the results comprise seemingly limitless variations of expressive concrete waves, colourful murals and mosaics, and bold polyhedral forms. Set against the backdrop of rural, often desert-like terrains, these diminutive structures stand out like contained explosions of creativity. (David Dick-Agnew Azure)Over 150 photographs of architectural exuberance dotting the streets and highways of the vast country...Although many of these structures are falling into disrepair from age and neglect, that they still exist is a testament to how meaningful they must have been in an otherwise homogenous built environment. Herwig's tenacity and devotion to accomplishing a project of this scale is extraordinary. (John Foster The Design Observer)Designed by individual architects, each bus stop proffers a glimpse of the artistry that still flourished in an era when uniformity was imposed and creativity was often suppressed. (Claire Voon Hyperallergic)Christopher Herwig’s weirdly evocative photographs show how the loneliest corners of the former Soviet Union were enlivened by whacky bus shelters…. Most alien of all are the radiant Gaudí knock-offs in the disputed region of Abkhazia, where Soviet elites once took their beach holidays. (Roland Elliot Brown The Spectator) Read more

These adorable, huggable pillows shaped like board game meeples come in Black, Blue, Green, Purple, Red, or Yellow to go with your game room, living room, or bedroom. Perfect for any gamer's home. From the Manufacturer What is a meeple, anyway? A "meeple" is a little wooden (or plastic) pawn used in modern day board gaming to represent a player. It originated in the wonderful tile-placement game Carcassonne. "Meeple" is believed to be a combination of the words "my" and "people." Since then, meeples have been used in countless other board games and have become the unofficial symbol of modern day board gaming. Today, meeples are not only used to represent people (players), but animals, creatures, monsters, and much, much more. Perfect For The Following Situations! Deck Building: Quite the building partner when it comes to deck building situations such as building a backyard deck, building a rooftop deck, and playing Dominion. Worker Placement: Fantastic for taking your spot in worker placement life activities such as boring meetings, house chores and errands, and playing games like Agricola. Pick Up & Deliver: Perfect to assist you in pick-up-and deliver situations such as delivering pizzas to hungry gamers, rushing to the hospital to have a baby, and playing games like Merchant of Venus. Tile Placement Activities: Excellent for accompanying you in a variety of tile-placement life activities such as installing a new bathroom wall, laying a new kitchen floor, and playing games like Carcassonne. Spin & Move: A wonderful companion to spin and move on the dance floor, on the football field, or in classic games like Twister. Incredibly Soft & Huggable Plush Pillow! The Meepillow is made with premium fabric and stuffing. It is the perfect shape and texture to decorate your home with. You won't believe how soft it is until you actually have one! The Iconic Meeple We truly are in a renaissance of board gaming right now. The gaming pendulum is swinging back to the analog side and away from the digital one. The hobby has exploded over the last decade and there is a game for everyone! The Ideal Size: 15" Tall, 16" Wide, 6" Thick. I could have gone smaller, but why?

Board games, action figures, comic books, pop culture memorabilia, and video games are just a few of my favorite things. When there is no room left on my shelves, the toys will walk the earth... About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Gaming Home Decor How did you come up with the idea for this product? I want to sincerely express my appreciation to you and the hobby that has changed my life - board games! Is it weird to say that? Perhaps. But through all the friends I have met, all the colleagues I have connected with, all the strain my brain has endured at game night, and all the good times it all has brought, I feel that it has changed my life in a very positive way. So, I finally decided to create my own board game related project. I not only started my company Top Shelf Fun through my innate desire to be a part of this great hobby, but to bring something different to the tabletop/sofa! What makes your product special? I am fortunate that the Meepillow struck such a chord with the board game community. I had the right idea, at the right time (in an exploding hobby), and the right resources (such as Kickstarter) to execute. The board game market is thriving and there is a large black hole of gaming decor, so I was incredibly fortunate to see that. I can't wait to see what else people come up with! What has been the best part of your startup experience? Building a company from the ground up with the help of Kickstarter truly was a dream come true. I would not be here doing what I love if it wasn't for all the people that helped me bring them what they love. The board gaming community is the most supportive and knowledgeable group of people I've ever come to know. With their help I can accomplish anything. Stop by your friendly local game store today to see for yourself what this wonderful hobby has to offer!

It removes with 1 hand in 1 second for the fastest, cleanest, quietest way to adjust for your temperature. Stuck in the lift line, started overheating, wind changed direction and now you're burning up? The Weatherneck solves those problems and a few more. The unique center mesh section allows you to draw breath even at full race pace through the fabric. The fabric is made from yoga pants material so it is exceptional at moisture management. High-Quality, high-strength magnets give you a tight, tough fit no matter how much dirt and muck you pick up along the adventure. From the Manufacturer $37,000 raised with 1,500 backers. A highly technical, breakaway balaclava for high octane outdoor activities. A tactical, modular approach. Only available on LAUNCHPAD A little fabric around your neck goes a LONG way to keeping you comfortable in cool climates. There are just a few small problems... 1. They don't come off! 2. They don't let you breathe 3. They get wet and disgusting 4. They are not size adjustable The Weatherneck is different Allows immediate removal with 1 hand in 1 second Provides superior 1-size-fits-all design. Integrates mesh center for easy ventilation both in and out. Reduces moisture build up by using high-quality USA made technical fabrics. Presents a quiet removal/application process for noise sensitive environments. Innovation through frustration THE STORY Innovation through frustration continues in the third stall. A few years ago I saw a photo of a euro pro cyclist in spring training wearing a neck warmer. I made one myself and found that a little fabric around the neck goes a very long way to stay warm. Since then, I've always had one thought, "These things are great, right up until they aren't." I like being protected from the wind, breathing warm air and getting heated up, but once I'm warmed up, I sometimes overheat. Then the ONLY thing I want to do was get the neck warmer off! I needed to remove my neck warmer quickly without stopping. I needed it to fit loose in some conditions and tight in others. I needed to reduce the moisture around my face and mouth. I needed to breathe through it easily (even at race pace). I had a PROBLEM so I created a SOLUTION. The Weatherneck design improves face shields and neck cuffs by utilizing powerful magnets and superior USA made fabrics to: Allow for immediate removal (magnets) Provide a superior one-size-fits-all design (see diagram below), this also allows a loose or tight fit depending on conditions. Manage moisture build up, allow easy ventilation and block wind without excessive bulk Allow quiet removal/application in noise sensitive environments* Center Mesh section allows easy breathing Maximizing airflow while still trapping heat was a tricky balance, our mesh selection was critical to making The Weatherneck function perfectly outdoors. Thick yoga pants type material on the sides The side fabric manages moisture unlike anything else, so you don't have to deal with that swampy feeling around your face. SUPER STRONG MAGNETS Incredibly strong magnets allow you to re-size, quickly attach and most importantly quickly remove The Weatherneck. I do, then I create My mission is to create products I know from firsthand experience will improve your outdoor experience. I ride bikes passionately so I know what works and what doesn't. The Weatherneck certainly applies to many other sports, so I always have an excuse to go snowboarding, skiing, or running outside. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Quick-release technical bandana How did you come up with the idea for this product? I was frustrated with other products on the market and their lack of adjustability. I also felt many of them were way over built for the type of activities I do in the outdoors. The Weatherneck is not meant to sit on the sidelines. The Weatherneck is for those who go all out. What makes your product special? The design of The Weatherneck is what's special. There is nothing quite like it on the market and it works. It really, truly works. Also, The Weatherneck is sewn right here in the USA with USA made fabrics. Our sewing supplier uses disabled workers to make our product a reality and at the same time giving a valuable workforce the chance to shine. What has been the best part of your startup experience? I simply LOVE seeing someone wearing or using my product in the wild. There is no better experience than seeing someone you don't know using your gear.

301`From School Library Journal Gr 10 Up—After an eclipselike phenomenon and a thrilling ride on The Star Express, "the most spectacular attraction" in the city of Alaxis, young Mary von Rathen has inexplicably started to lean. Having studied the mysterious phenomenon from his observatory on Mont Michelson, Dr. Axel Wappendorf theorizes that the Sun was blacked out by an "anti-planet" and proposes building a rocket ship to get closer to this strange planet. Driven from Paris by the harsh words of his critics, Augustin Desombres finds himself compelled to purchase an abandoned estate and to paint mural after mural and a young figure he cannot seem to put a face to. These three disparate stories intertwine in this graphic novel that first originated online in the 1980s and has been translated and published in English via a Kickstarter campaign. The narratives are set among The Obscure Cities, a group of separate cities located in an invisible world positioned directly on the other side of the Sun. Mostly black and white, with some color and even photography, Schuiten's artwork is wonderfully appropriate to the sci-fi genre and beautifully evocative. The images, some of which include full frontal nudity, support the text, especially in the sometimes clunky translation. The well-written story is propelled forward by the three main characters as they each try to make sense of the unexplainable and affect each other along the way. The science is incorporated in a comprehensible and fascinating way that will engage teens.—Erik Knapp, Davis Library, Plano, TX Read more Review The Leaning Girl Before dark energy and string theory entered the popular lexicon, the Belgian graphic novel wunderkind team of Schuiten and Peeters imagined how invisible cosmological forces might exercise their perplexing pull on a few select mortals in this fabulously original and haunting story, translated from the French. Mary Von Rathen, a charming sprite who drives her mother crazy with her boundless energy and insatiable imagination, embarks on the Star Express, an amusement park attraction that leaves her leaning at a constant diagonal unable to stand up straight. Somehow, this incredible premise leads to a perfectly logical denouement involving competing dimensional realities and invisible planets with powerful gravitational fields. In a subplot, after being lambasted by the ranking art critics of the day, painter Augustin Desombres seeks refuge in an abandoned manor house on a desolate plane. The paths of Mary and Augustin finally cross in a creative and sexual conflagration of quantum proportions. The sixth in the ongoing, futuristic Obscure Cities series, The Leaning Girl offers superbly intricate artwork, and the writing has a literary scope that extends well beyond science fiction and flirts with greatness. - Calvin Reid --Publishers WeeklyFavorite Books of 2014 Once again I feel like a character from Philip K. Dick s Now Wait for Last Year. Did someone slip JJ-180 into my buttermilk? At least I know that in this particular time-stream, I m supposed to be listing my Favorite Books of 2014. This is one of my favorite graphic novels (or whatever you want to call them) from the last decade. It is connected in my mind both with Glimmerglass and with Station Eleven (see below). In a note to readers of this English translation, Benoit Peeters writes that it may be precisely because The Obscure Cities the Schuiten-Peeters series in which this volume belongs is fundamentally so full of holes and destined to remain incomplete that it invites so much outside participation from our readers. I can attest to that, since I came to this installment without any context and was drawn deeply into it. - John Wilson --Christianity Today - Books & CultureIn a steampunk-influenced counter-earth, young Mary von Rathen suddenly stands off-kilter as if pulled by a different gravity. Professor Wappendorf readies an interplanetary rocket to investigate planet-threatening dangers, while an isolationist painter on Earth (depicted in photos) seeks his mysterious muse. All three meet in a Jules Verne-type center of the counter-Earth (Verne himself plays a bit part), and the mysteries are resolved. Schuiten's haunting inked linesimpersonate Victorian engravings and counterpoint Plissart's misty photos to give a beautiful nearly real quality. The counter-Earth locales are fully embodied with visual magic, including Mary's sometimes delicately sexual adventures. Yet even if it might seem to follow from the setup, the sad conclusion that life's responsibilities trump art, imagination, and love seems denied by the artfulness of the work itself. VERDICT: Bemusement for the eyes and mind, this sets a high mark for sublime art and imaginative plotting, even if one debates the resolution....It's a solid bet for lovers of philosophical, alt-world fiction. - Martha Cornog --Library Journal Read more See all Editorial Reviews
131`Size:SIZE F (Men's 11.5 - 13 USA) Product Description We are on a mission to transform how people move and feel in their shoes. Honey Soles Natural Cork shoe insoles are designed to make your everyday shoes feel like a pair of comfortable flip-flops. From the Manufacturer Make Your Shoes Feel Like Flip-Flops Made with sustainably harvested natural cork. Cork molds to the shape of your foot over time. It's the key to preventing bacteria and fungus from building up in your shoes. Honey Soles gives you the arch support and breathability you need for your favorite adventures, with or without socks. Naturally Anti-bacterial & Wicks Away Sweat Cork is an amazing material with a honeycomb cell structure that contains a waxy substance called suberin. Suberin naturally repels fungus and bacteria. The cork wicks sweat away from the feet, while the open-cell foam absorbs any vapor inside the shoe, preventing odor. Easy to Use It's simple: Honey Soles are inserted into the shoe, replacing your current shoe insoles. Honey Soles fit best in footwear with removable insoles. Arch Support Honey Soles are engineered to help with things like posture, alignment and over-pronation, which is the leading cause of plantar fasciitis. Shock Absorbing Honey Soles are durable and shock absorbing. Our proprietary foams help to disperse harmful vibrations that are commonly experienced when walking on hard surfaces. Sustainability: Thoughtful Design, Materials & Process We're using friendly materials, including recycled rubber foam and sustainably harvested natural cork. We tracked the origins of our materials and found a manufacturer with integrity. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Fresh. Style. Comfort. How did you come up with the idea for this product? We frequently wear our shoes without socks, and were getting frustrated with the excessive sweating, smelly feet and shoes that were literally falling apart. We researched the insole market, but the best insoles we could find were washable fabric inserts that absorb sweat like a sponge and required frequent washing. There were powders and sprays that eliminated odor, but required frequent use. Plus, none of these offered much in the way of arch support, so at the end of a day of walking around New York, our feet still ached. After understanding the problems first hand, we got to work and after months of testing different materials and prototyping designs, Honey Soles was born. What makes your product special? Honey Soles transforms your shoes to make them feel like a pair of flip-flops. It's a new standard for comfort. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Seeing people light up when they try on Honey Soles for the first time.
310`Color:Charcoal Blue Product Description LumoPack is the closest thing to charging your phone fast. Due to limitations restricting phone charging speeds, we developed a battery that can charge fast. Super Fast! After successfully being funded on Kickstarter, LumoPack is now available on Amazon! From the Manufacturer Accelerated Charge Times LumoPack can be charged at 140 watts - that's 14-28 times more than standard battery packs (5-10 watts). As a result, after just 6 minutes of charging, LumoPack stores enough power for a full iPhone 6 charge, and after 9 minutes, enough power for a Samsung Galaxy S6. LumoPack’s battery only needs 18 minutes for a full charge (6000 mAh). 3 Charging Methods Compared to most conventional battery packs, which only offer one way of charging (usually through a micro USB port), LumoPack comes with three different charging methods to maximize convenience for all your charging scenarios. The three types include: Micro USB Charger, Car Charger, and Wall Charger. The Micro USB Charger is the standard way of charging most battery packs on the market today. This method charges LumoPack at 10W (5V x 2A). This is convenient if you want to charge LumoPack through your computer. It can also be used as a back-up charger to carry with you. The Car Charger is made for your on-the go needs. Whether you are traveling in a cab, bus, or your own vehicle, the Car Charger offers an extremely portable method for you to charge LumoPack at its full 140W capability. The LumoPack Wall Charger is designed to charge LumoPack at 140W. However, the Wall Charger is bigger than both chargers above because it needs to pull a high 140W current from the wall. Accelerated Charge Times LumoPack can be charged at 140 watts - that's 14-28 times more than standard battery packs (5-10 watts). Extended Cycle Life LumoPack can sustain 1000 charge cycles, that's 2-3 times the industry standard today! Battery Coating & Safety MOF Technology Coats and Protects Lumopack's Battery cells to significantly reduce common lithium-ion hazards as the battery cells begin to degrade over its cycle life. Invest in a faster, safer, and longer-lasting product. LUMOPACK will change your expectations of charging! Lyte’s dream is to not only to create a next-generation battery pack; its larger vision is to remove the time constraints of charging all electronic devices. By leveraging their new and advanced technologies, as well as their strategic partnerships, Lyte Systems is committed to finding new and innovative ways for us to live a truly mobile lifestyle. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Fastest Charging Battery How did you come up with the idea for this product? In early 2014, Lyte Systems was founded by Gordon and Neiv through Loyola Marymount University’s incubator program. These two entrepreneurs were frustrated with wasting time being stuck to a wall, waiting for their devices to charge. Together they set out to free users from current battery constraints, thereby making mobile devices truly portable in the progress. After successfully finishing LMU’s incubator program as the top ranked project, Lyte’s team continued its development of the world’s fastest charging battery pack. Along the way, they joined up with Nivo Systems to utilize its groundbreaking Metal Organic Framework (MOF) technology, and also teamed up with a leading developer and manufacturer of consumer battery packs – Carku Technology. What makes your product special? LumoPack batteries are coated with a special material developed by Nivo Systems, Inc. known as Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). MOF represent an emerging class of materials that have attracted extensive interest because of their tunable porosities and versatile functionalities. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of Lyte's startup experience was working with a close close-knit Kickstarter community who was supportive throughout the launch.
343`Color:Walnut Product Description More music sources exist today than ever before…Spotify Connect, Bluetooth wireless technology, WiFi streaming, and Internet radio to name only a few. Duetto is designed with these in mind…a single “smart speaker” that delivers a world of musical content straight to your ears for a satisfying acoustic, aesthetic, and intuitive experience. Designed by audio veteran Tom DeVesto, Duetto is first and foremost a high fidelity stereo speaker. The foundation is a nearly half inch-thick MDF wood cabinet housing two ¾” soft dome tweeters and two custom 3” long-throw, 4- layer voice coil woofers with oversized magnets. The exterior is expertly crafted using one of several furniture-grade, real wood veneers, or a multi-layer piano gloss finish. The custom Digital Signal Processor (DSP), 60 watt RMS Class D digital amplifier, Qualcomm aptX audio, and 4 inputs supporting playback of hi res files result in faithful reproduction of your favorite songs. From the Manufacturer Simple, yet elegantly sophisticated Duetto is much more than just a radio… it is a “smart speaker”. It begins with a nearly half inch-thick MDF wood case housing, two ¾” soft dome tweeters and two custom 3” long-throw, 4-layer voice coil woofer with oversized magnet. The exterior is expertly crafted using one of several furniture-grade, real wood veneers, or a multi-layer piano gloss finish. The custom Digital Signal Processor (DSP), 30 watts per channel RMS Class D digital amplifier, Qualcomm aptX audio, and 4 inputs supporting playback of hi res files result in faithful reproduction of your favorite songs. Content need not equal confusion. With the touch of a preset button on the anodized aluminum front panel, Duetto will power on and begin playing your favorite saved station. Individual sources can also be saved to the presets, allowing Duetto to power on and immediately revert to Spotify Connect, Auxiliary, etc. Moreover, preset playback is independent and not limited to whichever source is playing at the time. Bluetooth wireless technology set up is a snap thanks to Near Field Communication (NFC). Artist and song information as well as album art is beautifully reproduced on Duetto's 3.2” TFT color display, and the artwork can even be expanded to fill the entire display. Filling your home with music is a task especially suited to Duetto. Our multi-room feature allows placement of multiple Duettos in a single room or in many rooms. Play the same source on all of your Duettos, or different sources on different Duettos. All of this may seem complicated, but Como Audio’s free app for iOS and Android is designed to take the mystification out of multi-room. Of course, a traditional remote is also supplied to control most of Duetto’s non-multiroom functions. Décor matching finishes Our beautifully hand-crafted real wood cabinets are available in a number of finishes to match a number of Décors. We don't believe that your music should come from non-descript black boxes in your home. Amazon DOT-ready We created this product to not only have a number of "on-board" sources, but we believe that many people would enjoy having Alexa at their beck and call. We've created a very simple way to add DOT and have all of your favorite Alexa features available to you. Handheld, ergonomically styled, remote control We believe that our customers won't be able to keep their hands off our products and mostly use the convenient controls. However, we also know that sometimes you need to make adjustments from across the room. Our APP In the spirit of keeping things phone-free, every Solo and Duetto comes with a remote control. That said, we do have a full-featured app: Como Control, which is an easy way to change things up from anywhere in the house. Available for iOS and Android. The app allows for: Switching between sources, Tune stations, Control volume, Multi-room control, Control EQ, and Play/Pause. Style, elegance, simplicity, and one-touch operation Leading consumer electronics Hall of Fame Legend and Visionary Tom DeVesto stayed true to a single-focused mission over the last 40 years, and that is to bring a new experience to the consumer electronics market – one that enhances and improves upon expectations. Whether he is introducing the theater experience to the home audiences with Advent and Kloss Video big screen TVs, or selling stereo systems direct to the consumer with Cambridge SoundWorks, or making high performance radios and music systems with great design and great sound reflective of another era with Tivoli Audio, Tom DeVesto never loses sight of the goal: make a high quality product that supports the latest technology — is simple to operate – has distinctive design – takes up a small amount of space – and doesn’t become obsolete. Millions of the products created by Tom DeVesto are used around the world today. He returns to the consumer electronics marketplace with a new Boston Massachusetts based company “Como Audio”. Here he will continue his goal of bringing high performance, vision, design and long lasting products to the consumer. Products that will, hopefully, continue to raise the bar on their expectations. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Streaming multi-room radio How did you come up with the idea for this product? We spent a year studying the state of the audio market worldwide. It became obvious that there has been a huge shift to streaming music and multi-room systems that can be controlled all over a home from one location. Smart phones and tablets have led to a profound change in the way music lovers obtain and share content. By virtue of being “connected” a smartphone or tablet can be the source for countless ways to steam music. We believe this is a great step in the evolution of audio. That said, counting on your phone or tablet to be the end all be all for all your music streaming is much less than perfect. Your phone is busy enough. We feel that you should be able to stream music without the need for an external device so we built the device inside the product. What makes your product special? Just press one button and start streaming music. You can use your phone for its intended purpose and make a call. We also think a product should look as good as it sounds so we use all metal and wood finishes to enhance the experience. We think having to live with the black and white solutions that most audio companies provide is unacceptable. So instead of trying to sell you 5 or 6 rooms worth of equipment we designed a product that you would really like to have one of. And, if you like it enough to buy more you can link them together to play the same music or different music in every room in your house using our custom app. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The Kickstarter experience was overwhelming. We received more than 500% in pledges above our goal. As an unforeseen benefit, we ended up in dialog with our customers while the product was in final development. We found this to be priceless.
374`Product Description DESCRIPTION: Darkrock Ventures is a worker placement game about mining and exporting in a hostile outer space. Players will be controlling a mining company working in harsh conditions to acquire the most credits. GENERAL INFO: A euro game for 1-5 players that plays in about 30-45 minutes. THEME: Science Fiction. Space is a hostile environment with a known alien presence. Resources are scarce and it is commonplace for companies to mine asteroids to acquire them. It is known that aliens raid these asteroids and therefore mining companies are geared accordingly in preparation of being attacked. Lives are lost in this line of work daily, but if you run a good crew you can make it out alive and rich! HOOK: Richly thematic euro incorporating dice and dice manipulation, with worker placement, resource farming and exporting. WINNING CONDITION: Highest Credits when the end of the game is triggered. Credits are acquired primarily from exporting minerals mined from the asteroid. MECHANICS: A round begins with rolling a set of communal dice that players will use in order to successfully mine the asteroid. Players then take turns placing workers throughout different space stations and on a mineral rich asteroid. After all the workers have been placed a third and more volatile Neutronium die is rolled and added to the community dice. A player starts their turn by rolling his/her Rig Dice, these represent the a power element of his/her mining equipment that is to be paired with the community Power Dice in order to successfully mine resources from the asteroid. Then he/she resolves all his/her workers. As soon as players begin exporting minerals, hostile alien ships begin patrolling and will attack every round making it more difficult to resolve all the workers successfully. Throughout the game, players will be increasing their worker count, gaining and spending credits (which are the victory points), gaining additional Rig Dice and acquiring explosive Neutronium bombs to protect them from the alien attacks. When 3 of the 6 resource nodes on the asteroid are void of minerals the end of the game is triggered. The round is finished and the player with the most credits wins the game. Darkrock Ventures also includes special 2-player game rules, as well as a Solo/Co-Operative variant, it's three games in one! From the Manufacturer High quality, independently designed, modern board games! 2-5 players (1-5 with Cooperative Variant) Ages 14+ ~30-45 minutes Darkrock Ventures uses high-quality cardstock with linen finish on the cards and box and has spot UV features on the board.

Our mission is to independently design, develop, and publish modern tabletop board games that are fun, entertaining, and intellectually stimulating. We built Magic Meeple Games on three core principles: Respect, Honor, and Fun. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Understandable, Sophisticated, Replayable How did you come up with the idea for this product? Darkrock Ventures was designed by: Michael Eskue, the designer of Council of Verona and For The Win. Developed by: Andrew Christopher Enriquez, Michael Coe, & Ian Stedman Illustrations by: Naomi Robinson Graphic Design by: Darrell Louder, Ian Stedman What makes your product special? Darkrock Ventures would not exist without the 961 backers who supported this project on Kickstarter. Thanks to their tenacity and support, we were able to make several enhancements to Darkrock Ventures to enhance its durability, aesthetic quality, and replayability up to and beyond that of other luxury hobby-store board games while still remaining easily accessible to those uninitiated into the tabletop hobby. What has been the best part of your startup experience? While Darkrock Ventures was the first game Magic Meeple Games as published, it is not the first game we have designed or developed, by far, nor was it the first Kickstarter campaign we were involved in, as Ian Stedman was previous published with his game Magnum Opus. It was very moving to hear the reactions from the backers who received their very own copy of what we created and to know that we did it on our terms, with the help and input of a very dedicated community of fans. We all created this project together, and we hope you will enjoy what we're working on next! Thank you for your support!

353`Product Description HeroBoys is a collection of superhero characters that set out to empower young boys ages 3-10. The creators, parents of two young boys themselves, invented the line for all boys to inject positive messaging and meaningful, educational content into a superhero landscape dominated by movie marketing related products. The characters, Blazer, Gusto, Rocko, StormSurge, Techno, and ThunderHawk, learn to work together and use their inherent strengths and talents (something that all children have) to help make a positive impact in the world. From the Manufacturer The Best of Both Worlds HeroBoys is a doll/action figure hybrid unlike anything on the market. Most 18-inch action figures are made from hard plastic and do not bend and the elbows and knees. HeroBoys heroes are unique in that their torso is made from soft compressed cotton fibers, giving our Heroes a soft, huggable quality. The limbs however are firm and bendable at the shoulder, elbows, hips and knees for full poseability and play. Heroes Meant for Children HeroBoys is the only line of post preschool hero related products that are focused on providing thoughtful, meaningful, age appropriate content for children. Most of today’s superhero content is immersed in the current Hero-Industrial Complex of PG-13 Movies, violent video games, and dark and morbid comic books. HeroBoys aims to provide positive encouragement and reinforcement of values though it’s comics in which children heroes come to together to do good in a world where adults have left a lot of room for improvement. Durable Construction These Heroes can stand up to the rough and tumble play of active children! Poseability Ready for action with 11 points of articulation! Stand Included Display stand included with each Hero- prefect for bookshelf, dresser or nightstand. There is a Hero Inside Every Boy We created the HeroBoys to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. AmericanGirl Meets Avengers How did you come up with the idea for this product? As parents, we struggled to find toys with meaning and value for our boys. They love Superheroes, but it seems almost all superhero related content is part of today’s Hero-Industrial Complex of major media properties targeted to broad audiences for movies, video games, and comic books. The content in this area for children in the crucial development years from 3 to 10 generally lacks thoughtfulness, value, or meaning. That is why we created the HeroBoys, a line of toys and comic books meant to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. What makes your product special? We are the only line of post preschool superhero related content truly for children and not part of the PG-13 Hero Industrial Complex that turns out superhero related movies of varying quality that are inevitably targeted for he broadest possible market and not concerned with development and age appropriate messaging for younger children. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The reaction from children when they read the comic books and play with the Heroes, they absolutely love them which is fantastic!
303`Color:Charcoal Blue Product Description LumoPack is the closest thing to charging your phone fast. Due to limitations restricting phone charging speeds, we developed a battery that can charge fast. Super Fast! After successfully being funded on Kickstarter, LumoPack is now available on Amazon! From the Manufacturer Accelerated Charge Times LumoPack can be charged at 140 watts - that's 14-28 times more than standard battery packs (5-10 watts). As a result, after just 6 minutes of charging, LumoPack stores enough power for a full iPhone 6 charge, and after 9 minutes, enough power for a Samsung Galaxy S6. LumoPack’s battery only needs 18 minutes for a full charge (6000 mAh). 3 Charging Methods Compared to most conventional battery packs, which only offer one way of charging (usually through a micro USB port), LumoPack comes with three different charging methods to maximize convenience for all your charging scenarios. The three types include: Micro USB Charger, Car Charger, and Wall Charger. The Micro USB Charger is the standard way of charging most battery packs on the market today. This method charges LumoPack at 10W (5V x 2A). This is convenient if you want to charge LumoPack through your computer. It can also be used as a back-up charger to carry with you. The Car Charger is made for your on-the go needs. Whether you are traveling in a cab, bus, or your own vehicle, the Car Charger offers an extremely portable method for you to charge LumoPack at its full 140W capability. The LumoPack Wall Charger is designed to charge LumoPack at 140W. However, the Wall Charger is bigger than both chargers above because it needs to pull a high 140W current from the wall. Accelerated Charge Times LumoPack can be charged at 140 watts - that's 14-28 times more than standard battery packs (5-10 watts). Extended Cycle Life LumoPack can sustain 1000 charge cycles, that's 2-3 times the industry standard today! Battery Coating & Safety MOF Technology Coats and Protects Lumopack's Battery cells to significantly reduce common lithium-ion hazards as the battery cells begin to degrade over its cycle life. Invest in a faster, safer, and longer-lasting product. LUMOPACK will change your expectations of charging! Lyte’s dream is to not only to create a next-generation battery pack; its larger vision is to remove the time constraints of charging all electronic devices. By leveraging their new and advanced technologies, as well as their strategic partnerships, Lyte Systems is committed to finding new and innovative ways for us to live a truly mobile lifestyle. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Fastest Charging Battery How did you come up with the idea for this product? In early 2014, Lyte Systems was founded by Gordon and Neiv through Loyola Marymount University’s incubator program. These two entrepreneurs were frustrated with wasting time being stuck to a wall, waiting for their devices to charge. Together they set out to free users from current battery constraints, thereby making mobile devices truly portable in the progress. After successfully finishing LMU’s incubator program as the top ranked project, Lyte’s team continued its development of the world’s fastest charging battery pack. Along the way, they joined up with Nivo Systems to utilize its groundbreaking Metal Organic Framework (MOF) technology, and also teamed up with a leading developer and manufacturer of consumer battery packs – Carku Technology. What makes your product special? LumoPack batteries are coated with a special material developed by Nivo Systems, Inc. known as Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). MOF represent an emerging class of materials that have attracted extensive interest because of their tunable porosities and versatile functionalities. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of Lyte's startup experience was working with a close close-knit Kickstarter community who was supportive throughout the launch.

It was served with a perfectly clear ice ball from a very expensive ice press that could only make one at a time and required that you started with a large clear ice block. We knew there must be a more efficient way to deliver this amazing experience at home- and so Wintersmiths was born. What makes your product special? Now anyone can easily make restaurant-quality large format cocktail ice in their home freezer with ordinary tap water with the Wintersmiths Ice Chest.

Brett, a mechanical engineer and product designer, sketched the idea for Sideclick and used at 3D printer to create the first prototype. Given the positive feedback we received from family and friends and the overall trend in streaming device sales, we decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to gage interest. We loved the collaborative atmosphere that crowdfunding provided and with the help of over 2,600 Backers, Sideclick became a reality. What makes your product special?

144`Product Description Accuse and defend your fellow townsfolk as you hunt down the witches of Salem. Act fast, before conspiracy turns you against your own. Salem is a strategic card game of deception built for 4-12 players, and is most suited for players aged 12-93. Estimated game time is 20-35 minutes. Game comes in antique-looking fake book box that can easily hide on your bookshelf. Successfully funded with $100K on Kickstarter in April 2015. GAME CONTENTS: 1 Faux Book Container 114 Cards (15 Town Hall, 39 Tryal, 60 Playing) 1 Hourglass 1 Manual (Includes character biographies) 14 Circle Tokens Players are given 3-5 Tryal cards which reveal the true identity of each player, "Witch" or "Not a Witch." Players then gather cards that they use to accuse or defend other players and to reveal their Tryal cards. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. Players can also use cards such as "Stocks", "Matchmaker", and "Asylum" to hurt their enemies or help their allies. One card, "Night", forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate. The other black card, "Conspiracy," forces all players to inherit a Tryal card from another player. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise "Conspiracy" may soon have the whole town turned evil. Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of "She's a WITCH!" will wake the neighbors. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground. From the Manufacturer The game box is an antique-looking faux book. Don't toss this game on top of a stack inside your messy game closet. Instead, disguise your Salem game on your bookshelf. Book remains closed with a magnet. Play as John Proctor, Samuel Parris, Mary Warren, and 12 other real people from Salem, Massachusetts. Jump right into the world of Salem as you play as one of the key personalities involved in the actual witch trials from 1692. Social Deception Card Game Salem builds upon the class social deception games of Mafia, Werewolves, Bang!, and Resistance, and twists things just the right amount. Rulebook Includes Biographies of all Characters Bring the game to life as you learn more about the real victims and accusers in the back of the rulebook. Raised $103K on Kickstarter Salem was crowdfunded in April 2015. We now sell the game all over the world. Simple, smart, sleek board games Facade Games is based near Provo, Utah and was founded by a husband/wife team. Our goal is to make board games with: Flawless, unique mechanics; Accessibility for the casual gamer; Original, interesting packaging; Beautiful illustration and design. Salem was our first project and raised over $100,000 on Kickstarter in spring 2015. We’re currently creating a pirate-themed game to be released on Kickstarter in fall 2016. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Find the Witches How did you come up with the idea for this product? We both grew up loving board games.

From the book box it arrives in, to the beautiful illustrations on the cards, to the suspenseful gameplay, Salem strives to be unique.

Review "One of the year s most exciting and historically significant archival projects, Kino Lorber s Pioneers of African American Cinema collects nearly 20 hours of feature films and short subjects created by and starring entrepreneurial black entertainers between the 20s and 40s. These race films run the gamut from musicals to melodramas to westerns, and showcase the talents of American masters such as Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams, Paul Robeson and Zora Neale Hurston. Given that most of these pictures played well outside any kind of traditional distribution system, they ve always been in danger of getting lost, which makes the preservation efforts behind this set all the more heroic. These are important documents of a truly independent cinema, produced outside of a Hollywood that had little interest in what these artists had to offer." -Noel Murray --LATimes.com

361`|Size:Large || Style Name:Long Sleeve Product Description The Hydration Shirt unlocks your true athletic potential, boosting your hydration by up to 40% and increasing your power output, endurance, and focus – making your body the best version of itself. Numerous exercise studies have shown your body wastes up to 75% of its energy and most of its water just fighting to offload heat. Our cutting-edge, made in the USA baselayer paired with rechargeable phase-change Inserts absorbs this heat at the pulse points before your body wastes so much precious energy and water. Think of the Inserts as radiators for your body, and the Shirt as a high-performance holster. This new, impossibly lightweight system is a revolutionary concept in athletic apparel, but the science is timeless, tried, and true. In fact, it is taught to all First Responders as part of their standard training. From the Manufacturer More Hydration = Higher Performance In clinical testing, Wearable Hydration Technology provided dramatic hydration improvements. Researchers brought 17 subjects in the lab and tested them both with and without our heat-absorbing technology. The result? When using Qore athletes had more endurance, and a whopping 40% less body water loss -- meaning more hydration, more reps in the gym, and more time on the field performing your best. Zero Athletic Compromise There are plenty of ways to stay cool or get re-hydrated, but none of them blend so seamlessly into your game. Nobody wants to have to leave the field or call a timeout when the chips are down. So leave those inferior solutions on the sidelines. Everything about the Hydration Shirt has been tested and designed with the you, the performance athlete, in mind -- giving you all the benefits of heat-absorbing apparel in a package that lets you stay as high-speed as ever. Premium Athletic Apparel Form fitting, athletic cut. A vented back mesh panel for breathability. Flat lock stitching throughout for zero-chafingmade. Integrated anti-odor technology. The latest in moisture-wicking. No expense was spared in crafting the Hydration Shirt. Rechargeable, Nearly Indestructible HydraQore Inserts HydraQore Inserts actually enhance your body’s natural systems by removing the heat that’s holding you back. Simply drop them in ice water for 15 minutes (a cooler or your fridge will work too) and they’re charged and ready. Keep recharging, they will perform the same on Day 3000 as they do today. At only 1.8 ounces a piece, not only will they not impact movement, you will forget you’re even wearing them. Stomp on them, twist them, run them over with a F-150, we’ve tried it all. Welded seams mean they come out looking and performing the same as ever. Made in the USA Qore Performance was founded by Patriots. We cherish the Constitution and our freedoms. As such, we take Made in the USA seriously because it is a reflection of our values. Made in USA means that every component and step in the manufacturing process is 100% American. All fabrics, threads, and other materials are manufactured by American factories. We take these raw materials and employ American workers to produce our final goods. No step in the process ever leaves our shores. Enhancing Human Performance through Wearable Thermoregulation Technology Human athletic activity produces heat. The human body is limited in its capability to combat this heat and, in doing so, wastes most of its water stores. Equipment traps heat and exacerbates this problem. The ensuing dehydration and overheating severely limit human performance. We have made it our mission to solve these problems. Our team obsesses over how to repurpose, reposition, and reinvent traditional equipment to unlock the true performance capabilities of the modern athlete. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Wearable Hydration Technology How did you come up with the idea for this product? Inspired by tried-and-true emergency responder protocols, our founder initially thought to combine first aid science with athletic base layers while on duty as a sworn law enforcement officer in the California desert. Faced with difficult terrain, a formidable adversary, heavy protective gear, and high altitude, he was looking to improve his odds in the field. Unwilling to add more weight to his kit, he realized that efficiently offloading heat to stay hydrated was the best way to boost his endurance, strength, focus and recovery. After the mission, he realized that solving this problem could have implications far beyond just law enforcement. Improving performance through hydration could help any human who sweats—especially athletes seeking a competitive performance advantage and the military. Armed with Otter Pops, a sewing machine he barely knew how to turn on, and his favorite compression shorts, he set out to build the first prototypes. What makes your product special? Athletes are constantly fighting dehydration, with nothing to help them except for drinks and contraptions on the sidelines. But the rate you shed water is far greater than the rate at which you can replenish -- until now. The Hydration Shirt is a state-of-the-art replacement for your existing baselayer shirt that actually works hardest when you work hardest, absorbing heat to give you an unparalled performance and hydration benefit without having to call a timeout. We developed our technology with input from professional athletes and competitors, elite tactical units, and top amateur athletes at leading universities. Our gear has been engineered and battletested to their demanding requirements; as a result, it has been endorsed and put into use by elite users across the spectrum. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Making products that really help people perform better, every single day.|

We met this challenge with the design of our patented filtration system which stops the process as soon as the filter is pushed down, so your last sip tastes as perfect as the first. We design products that make better coffee and tea, and are built to last. And we guarantee it. Friends for Life.|

"If a job is worth doing, it's worth doing right." Our mission is to empower the world by providing people with access to items that are created using a combination of tangible design and technology complement each other in aesthetics and function.

We believe that when you're feeling good and confident, with an underlying sense of cool, you are more enabled to enter what is referred to as a "state of flow". Through technology and design we can enable easier access to that state of flow where our thoughts merge with our creativity, and our work becomes play. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. High Quality Performance How did you come up with the idea for this product? I was almost hit by a car from the side while riding my bike at night. I had a front and rear facing light, but the driver still didn’t see me. With my heart racing from the near collision, the idea for the Nori Lights came to me instantly. I assembled a very rough prototype and uploaded a video of it online to show my brother. About a month later I noticed the video was getting lots of views, and I started receiving emails from people requesting the kits. That was when I began refining and improving the design. I decided to name it after my Grandfather, Nori. He always told me “If a job is worth doing, it’s worth doing right.” It gives me great joy knowing that thousands of people in over 40 countries around the world shout out his name with a big smile on their faces when someone asks how they got their wheels to glow like that. Nori Lights! What makes your product special? The Nori Lights design is very simple, but what makes it so effective isn’t just our light stripes, or our activating pods. It’s both of them, as they were specifically designed and optimized to work together. The unique UV leds in the pods emit a targeted wavelength that aimed at what our Nori Lights stripes are most reactive to. This and a few other properties of our materials allows for amazing efficiency with no compromise in performance. The Nori Lights will exceed your expectations, and not many products can offer that. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The feedback from our customers has been priceless. There’s no way I’m putting my grandfather’s name on something unless it’s the best. And when customers contact us just because they want us to know how much they love the product, and the impact it has had on them, no doubt, that’s been my favorite part of this journey so far.

It took us 2 years to finish up the GOAT Mug project and to choose the right materials.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Simple, Bright, Smart Where did you get the inspiration for your product? We had our lightbulb moment back in 2010 while Cofounders Corey Egan & Swapnil Bora were MBA classmates. We saw what was happening with LED lighting and mobility and realized that there was huge potential to improve and enhance how we interact with light on a daily basis. So we submitted an idea for ilumi into a school competition and won. From there we went on to crowdfunding, Shark Tank, and have now shipped tens of thousands of ilumi Smartbulbs across the world. What differentiates your product from similar products out there? When we designed ilumi, we designed it around the customer. The result of that is ilumi brighter, simpler, and smarter than any other light bulb and delivers an experience that puts smiles on people's faces. Tell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process. The most amazing and difficult part of a creation process is making decisions about what's going to be important to the customer and accurately predicting what they want and being able to deliver it. It really requires a tremendous amount of observation, listening, and empathy. For ilumi, we see that people really can perceive what good lighting is if they see it, but have very little tools and knowledge to be able to achieve good lighting. The process of creating a product that helps people achieve better lighting and being part of people's homes is the most rewarding part. See all Product description
169`Everyone has an opinion. The Metagame is a fun party game about sharing opinions on the most important debates of our time, like "which feels more like first love: The Mona Lisa or the Big Mac?" The Metagame includes culture cards that feature media, art, fashion and entertainment, and opinion cards that prompt lively chatter and lots of laughter. The Metagame is more than one game—it includes six unique games. Some of the games get you talking. Others are about thinking fast. Some games are strategic and others are just plain silly. Including 200 culture cards and 100 opinion cards, The Metagame scales from two to 33 players. Play it at a dinner party or a family gathering, at a bar or at school, or anywhere that humans gather. Some opinions on The Metagame include: "It’s a clever idea, it’s a beautiful box, it’s peerlessly modern, and it’s generous to the point that you're practically buying a format for games instead of a game. Oh, and it works. You can't play this game without having funny arguments and interesting discussions." - Quintin Smith, SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN " "A clever, colorful set of tools that let you pose interesting questions to friends, and debate the relative merit of a weird, wild array of issues." - Leigh Alexander, BOINGBOING/OFFWORLD "When you deal the Metagame deck, there are some wonderfully esoteric conundrums to be debated with the right mix of people and probably drinks." - Allison Meier, HYPERALLERGIC "There are six games. Each is different. Each will make you laugh." - Bernie DeKoven, MAJOR FUN
141`Product Description Preserved lemons are well-known in northern Africa as a key ingredient for many traditional dishes, including Morocco's famous tagines. Use the pulp and chopped peel for use in sauces, stews and seafood dishes. Auzoud's Preserved Lemons come from the Beldi variety, the most popular in Morocco. In addition to offering only the finest authentic Moroccan foods, Auzoud is committed to working with women and youth farmers from the High Atlas mountain region, supporting fair wages and sustainable harvesting practices. From the Manufacturer EASY TO USE Chop and add to sauces, stews, curries and tagine dishes. ADDS DEPTH TO ANY DISH Intense and very unique in flavor, not at all like using fresh lemon. ADDS DEPTH TO ANY DISH Intense and very unique in flavor, not at all like using fresh lemon. KEY INGREDIENT IN NORTH AFRICAN CUISINE Popular in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and beyond. TRADITIONALLY PRESERVED All natural lemons, salt-cured and pickled in lemon juice. Auzoud's mission is to empower Moroccan women and youth farmers as they obtain fair prices and a more sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families. In addition to offering only the finest authentic Moroccan foods, Auzoud is committed to working with women and youth farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive, saffron and argan farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Many of the farmers are single mothers hoping to send their children to school. Auzoud has been founded by the grandson of one such farmer. Our partner cooperatives are based on membership participation and fair prices, allowing women to feed their families and educate their children. Improving the socio-economic situation, health and education of women and youth has an immediate and lasting impact on the well-being of families and the preservation of the local culture and community. We are focused on expanding the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. More than lemons. How did you come up with the idea for this product? I was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud/auzoud means “olive” in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud’s waters contribute to the region’s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation...it has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping family and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma. After moving to the U.S. I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors’ land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region. Now we have expanded and are working with three cooperatives in Morocco. All cooperative members are small-scale farmers, many of them single mothers and young people hoping for a stable income to help their families. We hope you enjoy our products and share them with your family, as we do, and that you understand Auzoud to be an offering that unites our regions, languages, cultures and religions. As such, Auzoud's logo is the dove carrying an olive branch - a universal symbol of hope and peace - in reflection of this wish for shared prosperity and peace between our communities and across the world. What makes your product special? Completely unique in flavor, Auzoud Preserved Lemons add a layer of complexity to any dish! What has been the best part of your startup experience? By far the best part of our startup experience has been connecting and working closely with hundreds of small farmers from my home region. I love engaging with them and learning their stories. Like my grandfather, most of the farmers we work with have farmland that has been passed down for many generations. As they finally, now, receive fair pay for their products, many farming families are able to greatly improve their quality of life and transform local conditions by, for example, sending their children to school. We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute in this way!
364`Product Description Finally! A cool boy doll for all kids. Boy Story brings Action Dolls to the world: 18" boy dolls with adjustable ball-joints to join the action and fun with all the girl dolls out there. Action Dolls are cool. Action Dolls encourage pretend play and imagination. Action Dolls are for all kids. Action Dolls are just plain FUN. Our Action Dolls are designed to be cool, boyish, and diverse. Missing from mainstream 18" doll lines are detailed facial features capturing the uniqueness we love in children. Most 18” dolls limit changes to skin tone and hair color, and many children (especially boys) are not represented. Even the boy dolls out there, we found, often look like they are wearing makeup or are girl dolls with cut hair. Boy Story believes that children’s toys should be as diverse as the kids who play with them. This Action Doll comes complete with an adventure story, designed with brilliant illustrations to jump start the imagination. From the Manufacturer Action Doll Play: Fun + Teaches Empathy, Communication, and Nurture Kids learn best through play. That's why parents are seeking more and more opportunities to expose their kids to a wide variety of toys and activities that combine fun with learning. Boy Story's Action Dolls offer unique boy dolls to encourage all kids to engage in pretend and imaginative play. Doll play in particular has been shown by many studies to improve development of empathy, human connection, communication, and relational skills. Doll play also encourages development of fine motor skills through handling the dolls and playing with the accessories such as shoe laces, buttons, snaps, and zippers. Kids who play with same-age dolls experience heightened cognitive development through the use of descriptive words and adjectives, because their play engages with the dolls on a human level. Pretend play hugely benefits kids' development and should be offered to all children without stereotyped limitations. Boy Action Dolls Break Down Stereotypes and Build Gender Equality We've created our boy Action Dolls to help break down some antiquated stereotypes in play. Parents want their kids' toys to be as diverse as the world around them, and our Action Dolls help bring much needed diversity to play. We designed our Action Dolls and stories with care to celebrate racial diversity and help all kids feel comfortable playing with dolls. Fun is our number one mission! Kids have tons of fun running around with their Action Dolls, posing them in all different ways, and going on as many adventures as they can imagine. Buying an Action Doll for a special child in your life breaks down barriers and helps all our kids share the sandbox! 11 Joints & Ball Joints for Ultra-Poseability Each Action doll has 11 joints: Neck - Shoulders - Elbows - Wrists - Hips - Knees. The joints at the elbows, wrists, and knees are ball joints allowing for full 360-degree articulation. Your Action Doll can jump, kick, swing, and wave...basically anything you can imagine! High Quality Vinyl and Sculpted Hair Daring to be different from the other dolls out there, each of our Action Dolls is specially detailed to have his own unique look. The vinyl is scratch-resistant, phthalate-free, and durable. The sculpted hair and fine facial features can withstand lots of rough-and-tumble play. The bodies of the doll are made from a premium cotton twill that's unlike any other 18" doll! Detailed to Perfection - Meant for Play We have designed and engineered every detail of each Action Doll - from the top of his head to the bottom of his shoes! The dolls, clothes, and shoes are meant for lots of play and fun, so we expect them to get a little dirty! Our tough vinyl and resilient shoes easily wash clean with a cloth, and our clothes can be spot cleaned. Action Dolls - Giving Our Kids Choice in Play Boy Story is proud that our Action Dolls serve two purposes: promoting imaginative play and breaking down stereotypes. Foremost, they dish up a whole lot of fun for kids - after all, that's what toys are all about! At their core, Action Dolls promote imaginative and pretend roleplay. Boys and girls alike love Action Dolls - they fill a gap the toy market has left sparsely stocked for too many generations. The dolls are durable and able to join in countless adventures. From riding in bike baskets, to reading books in forts, to camping under the stars - these Action Dolls are meant to be life’s companions. But our Action Dolls also bring change to the toy market by breaking down stereotypes and adding diversity. They give kids more choice in their play. Kids deserve to have toys as diverse as the world they live in. Our approach to Action Dolls has been to promote gender equality through our product and our message. Our Equality Campaign features photos of kids just being kids - having good old-fashioned unrestricted fun with no stereotypes to hold them back. Our positive messaging encourages all kids to interact on a human level and develop those vital relationship and nurturing skills that dolls so importantly teach. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Dolls For All How did you come up with the idea for this product? The idea of Boy Story started while Kristen was pregnant with her second son in the summer of 2014. She wanted to buy a boy doll for her older son to help him get used to the idea of being a big brother and to have a companion to play with at times when mommy was busy taking care of the baby. But when she went to buy a boy doll, she was shocked at the market. Most dolls were either girls or baby dolls. There were no cool boy dolls out there. That was the beginning of the idea. But Kristen was working full time as a lawyer overseas, and there was no way she could start a business. That’s where Katie came in. Katie was so excited at the idea that she decided to risk it all by quitting her own job and working to get things started. With tons of strong will and determination, even without any prior business management experience, Katie relied on the guidance of Kristen and started up the company. We are now both working full time with Boy Story to make great products and a great company. What makes your product special? Our Action Dolls are a combination of poseable action figures and lovable 18" dolls. There are tons of nice girl dolls available for kids, but very few cool boy dolls. Our dolls' unique features were meticulously designed by us personally to celebrate diversity and introduce some boy dolls to the market. The clothing is modern and fresh, and the dolls have a look and feel that reflect their high quality. Our Action Dolls make kids, including boys, feel comfortable playing with dolls and give all kids a fun platform to develop important skills such as nurture and empathy. What has been the best part of your startup experience? One of the most amazing moments we have had in starting up Boy Story was when we actually received the completed prototypes of our dolls. It was one of those “dream come true” moments where an idea turned into something real. And the absolute best is when we see kids light up when they test out our Action Dolls. Kids are just amazing in their honesty and pure love for play. As soon as they get their hands on the dolls, adventures begin. And that makes our hearts so, so big.

6`Product Description Soma is better for you and better for the environment. The Soma new and improved filter reduces harmful contaminants frequently found in tap water like chlorine, mercury, copper and more. Our convenient Filters by Mail program delivers new filters to you automatically, so you always have fresh, clean water. The filter housing is made from renewable materials, resulting in a smaller carbon footprint. Every Soma purchase supports clean water initiatives around the globe led by our nonprofit partner, charity: water. From the Manufacturer Our Mission We believe clean drinking water is a basic human right. That’s why we’re a proud sponsor of charity: water and partner with them in their mission to bring safe drinking water to over 750 million people without access to it. Every time you buy a Soma filter, we donate to charity: water projects. These contributions go directly to sustainable, community-owned water projects in developing countries.

BETTER TASTE Simple, plant-based filter ingredients lead to a fresh taste that will make you want to drink more water. PLANT POWER Feel good knowing the Soma filter only contains coconut shell carbon and a plant-based casing. No added chemicals. EXPERT DESIGN Soma's filters are crafted by David Beeman, one of the foremost filtration experts with over 35 years of experience. We wanted to build something sustainable. Because polluting water while manufacturing products that enhance water wouldn’t make any sense at all. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Smart. Beautiful. Sustainable. How did you come up with the idea for this product? One night during a dinner party, our founder, Mike del Ponte was hesitant to put his cheap plastic “other brand” water filter on his nicely set table. Mike decided to pour his filtered water into a glass wine decanter. Unfortunately (or fortunately) as he did, the lid of the water pitcher fell off, causing water to gush all over the kitchen floor. As he cleaned up the mess, he thought, “Why can’t someone create a water filter that’s beautifully designed, easy to use, and made of sustainable materials?” Soma was born. The rest is water under the bridge. What makes your product special? Soma is the only water filter with 100% plant-based filtration.

We started the company because we couldn't find a truly natural and great tasting gum in the market. It turns out that the regular chewing gum you see on grocery store shelves is filled with artificial substances, including some of the same components used in the manufacture of car tires, plastic bottles, and white glue, as well as artificial sweeteners like aspartame. Consumers are kept in the dark about what they are chewing because the FDA allows conventional gum brands to hide up to 80 synthetic ingredients in the catch-all term "gum base" on the label. We knew we could do better. In New York, our gum chefs craft the best ingredients into the highest quality gum on the market. The result is a lightly sweetened, totally natural gum that’s better for your body and the environment. Simply Gum makes all natural premium chewing gum, without any plastic, synthetics, or artificial flavors. The result is a lightly sweetened, totally natural gum that's better tasting, better for your body, and better for the environment. If you love ginger candy or ginger chews, you'll love our ginger gum!Because we only use natural ingredients, our gum is not only better for your body, it's also biodegradable and better for the planet. Our innovative packaging includes post-chew wrappers to make it easy to dispose of when complete. Each order contains 6 packs with 15 pieces each, for a total of 90 pieces of gum.Regular chewing gum is packed with artificial substances that are potentially toxic, including plastic, aspartame, and BHT. Unlike conventional gum brands, Simply Gum uses all natural ingredients without ANY synthetics.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Educative, empowering, fun. How did you come up with the idea for this product? ”The original inspiration for SAM arose when my younger brother Samuel came over one night to cook for me during exams. He was surprised that all I had eaten for a week straight was noodles. He was frustrated and said, “you know cooking is not as hard as people think…” Slowly hiding the pasta I was about to prepare, I agreed. While he gave me fantastic advice on my diet, being an engineer, I was the one that had to help him when he had ideas for new products, apps or tried to fix something in his flat. After the third flat visit in one week, I told him “you know Sam, engineering is not as hard as people think…” It was in that moment I realised, that just like there are simple ingredients to make a meal, I needed to create a way to make the ingredients for any app, product or hack. Samuel inspired me to get to work on a technology that simplifies engineering so that we could give the powers of engineering to anyone that has an idea for an invention. I named my company SAM Labs after him, and we’ve been delivering people the ingredients to whip up any invention since 2015.” What makes your product special? “We designed the most innovative construction kit to give everyone the skills to shape the future with delightful technology.

25`Product Description Learning to hold and maneuver a bottle is difficult for most children. Slowly, the baby learns to grasp the bottle. At this point, we lay the baby on its back or in a swing or car seat and allow it to drink from the bottle. We use blankets and baby cloths to prop up the bottle so that it is angled toward the baby's mouth. This is known as "bottle propping" and has been shown to be unhealthy and potentially dangerous. We designed the TipMeNot to overcome this problem. The tripod design allows the bottle to sit comfortably on the baby's chest. It keeps the bottle from falling or rolling off the baby's chest. The baby is prompted to use her arms and body to tip and lift the bottle toward her mouth to drink from the bottle. This is difficult to do without the TipMeNot because of the weight of the bottle. The leaves of the TipMeNot create a fulcrum at the top of the bottle that shifts the weight of the bottle and the milk away from the baby's mouth. That is, the milk still sits at the bottom of the bottle.The leaves are curved away from the baby which allows her to easily tip the bottle toward her mouth. The fulcrum allows for tipping the bottle without having to lift and bear the full weight of the bottle. This allows the baby to learn to feed herself before she has the strength to fully lift the bottle. The TipMeNot allows the baby the ability to easily maneuver the bottle using her arms and hands (as opposed to just holding the bottle with her hands). Allowing your baby to easily maneuver her bottle before she has the dexterity to clinch the bottle effectively with her hands is essential to the early learning process. Lastly, the TipMeNot prevents spillage when the baby drops or pushes the bottle to the side. The tripod system keeps the nipple elevated, preventing the contents of the bottle from leaking. No more wet floors, bed sheets, car seat, etc. Rubber is FDA approved. So it is safe for teething. It is dishwasher safe. From the Manufacturer $2,236 raised with 72 backers. Healthy Learning Product TipMeNot is the only product on the market addressing the negative aspects of bottle propping while helping babies learn to feed themselves. Green Baby Shower Gift TipMeNot is the perfect baby shower gift.It's green - literally. Product and packaging are recycleable. Easy to hold. Stretches to fit most bottles. FDA approve rubber for teething. Benefits of the TipMeNot Learn to self feed without the spilled milk. Go ahead and chew away, it's safe for teething. It's dishwasher safe. No more dangerous bottle propping. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Help Baby Learn How did you come up with the idea for this product? My little girl was slow to learn to hold and feed herself with a bottle. Unaware of the negative effects, we proppoed her bottle with blankets and other devices. She developed earaches. We learned from the doctor that bottle propping was the cause. We looked for something to help her learn without bottle propping. We couldn't find anything. So we invented the TipMeNot. What makes your product special? It addresses a major health concern for infants, while making the learning process easier for baby and parents. It's a huge benefit to allow the baby to practice without worrying about the spilled milk. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Working together with my wife and brother to make our business a reality.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Intelligent, Precise and Active How did you come up with the idea for this product? The company began when I left the service and realized there were not many carry solutions that were just as effective on the weekend as they were on the weekday. Everything I looked for fit into the too military, too fragile or too Mt Everest category so we decided to make our own. After, interviewing hundreds of people we arrived at our current designs. We found a lot of people out there wanted something different than the corporate giveaway bag or whatever was left around from the past. These people care about looking their best without sacrificing functionality – we designed this for them. What makes your product special? By taking the best in construction, design and materials from mil-spec gear and pairing it together with a thoughtful urban feel we have been able to create a truly differentiated backpack that is just as appropriate for the weekend as the weekday. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Anytime you create something out of nothing it is rewarding – but for us the most exciting part of the journey is hearing from customers about how much they love our backpack, weekender and other accessory bags. Every once in a while we will be out looking around the internet and we’ll randomly bounce across a customer blog post or review and read about how much they are in love with their bag because of its design, materials etc; that will make everyone over hear at Fidelis Co’s day!

Connect two or more to change it up If your dog gets bored or wants a different challenge, connect multiple Odins together to change how they roll and bounce. Happy dogs and happy humans Ever since our dog, Odin, came into our lives, he’s shared his innate happiness with everyone who encounters him. The joy he so easily spreads inspired us to start Up Dog Toys with a mission to make happy dogs and happy dog owners. In the same way that Odin makes everyone's day better, we hope our products will make you and your dog's day better too. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Modern doggy fun How did you come up with the idea for this product? We wanted to make the perfect toy for our dog, Odin. He loved food and so loved to play with treat dispensing toys but they all were clunky in their own way. Either they rolled around too much and were loud on our hardwood floors, also knocking into our furniture around harder than we'd like, or they required a lot of upkeep and cleaning. At the same time, Michelle wanted to change careers and work with animals so this idea became a business and a new life for us. What makes your product special? We designed the toy to look different from any toy out there, but those looks came as a part of the functional design too. We feel that too many dog toys look alike and become eyesores in our home. Since dogs are such a big part of our lives at home, we want their things to feel like home too. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Seeing all the happy dog pictures and videos and the many emails and messages from kind people who believe in our dream and also had real problems solved through our toy. We love hearing stories about how The Odin helped people's lives better through making their dogs happier and healthier.

Avid traveler and foodie Anish Sheth began his career as an international finance lawyer.

What differentiates your product from similar products out there? All natural, Nongmo, Unique flavor options Tell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process.

It was fun to look back at my travels and decide what types of flavors would complement the peas we had found. The most challenging part has been finding the best and cleanest ingredients possible. Knowing the origin of each ingredient and micro-ingredient has been important to us and it is sometimes difficult to find the perfect ingredient for a particular product.|
178`Product Description Produced from naturally grown olive trees in Morocco's Atlas Mountains, Auzoud's olives and olive oil are sourced from a small farmers' cooperative that guarantees fair wages and sustainable harvesting practices. After watching his grandfather and other farming families struggle to bring their goods to market for a fair price, Auzoud owner Mejid Beraouz co-founded the cooperative to support better economic and social conditions for agricultural workers in his homeland. The cooperative seeks to unify and empower local farmers as they obtain fair prices for their olives and a more sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families. There are currently over a hundred cooperative members with many more farmers seeking to participate in the next harvest. One of the cooperative’s goals is to educate members about sustainable olive farming. To this end, Auzoud and cooperative members are working together to obtain organic certification for all current and new members. From the Manufacturer 100% ALL NATURAL EVOO Produced from naturally grown picholine olive trees in Morocco's Atlas Mountains. Never adulterated or mixed with other oils. HAND-PICKED & COLD-PRESSED Olives are hand-picked and taken to the local mill to be cold-pressed using traditional methods (with no chemical solvents or high heat), maintaining the original robust flavor and unique color. 100% ALL NATURAL EVOO Produced from naturally grown picholine olive trees in Morocco's Atlas Mountains. Never adulterated or mixed with other oils. HAND-PICKED & COLD-PRESSED Olives are hand-picked and taken to the local mill to be cold-pressed using traditional methods (with no chemical solvents or high heat), maintaining the original robust flavor and unique color. FAIR WAGES & SUSTAINABLE HARVESTING Sourced directly from a small olive farmers’ cooperative that guarantees fair wages and sustainable harvesting practices. Auzoud's mission is to empower Moroccan women and youth farmers as they obtain fair prices and a more sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families. In addition to offering only the finest authentic Moroccan foods, Auzoud is committed to working with low-income women and youth farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive, saffron and argan farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Many of the farmers are single mothers hoping to send their children to school. Auzoud has been founded by the grandson of one such farmer. Our partner cooperatives are based on membership participation and fair prices, allowing women to feed their families and educate their children. Improving the socio-economic situation, health and education of women and youth has an immediate and lasting impact on the well-being of families and the preservation of the local culture and community. We are focused on expanding the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. More than EVOO. How did you come up with the idea for this product? I was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud/auzoud means “olive” in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud’s waters contribute to the region’s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation...it has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping family and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma. After moving to the U.S. I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors’ land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region. Now we have expanded and are working with three cooperatives in Morocco. All cooperative members are small-scale farmers, many of them single mothers and young people hoping for a stable income to help their families. We hope you enjoy our products and share them with your family, as we do, and that you understand Auzoud to be an offering that unites our regions, languages, cultures and religions. As such, Auzoud's logo is the dove carrying an olive branch - a universal symbol of hope and peace - in reflection of this wish for shared prosperity and peace between our communities and across the world. What makes your product special? Auzoud All Natural Extra Virgin Olive Oil is made from a single olive variety, picholine, which is the most dominant in Morocco and recognized for its robust and complex flavor. Sourced directly from a farmers' cooperative in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, a purchase from Auzoud guarantees fair wages and healthy working conditions for hundreds of small farmers throughout the region. What has been the best part of your startup experience? By far the best part of our startup experience has been connecting and working closely with hundreds of small farmers from my home region. I love engaging with them and learning their stories. Like my grandfather, most of the farmers we work with have olive trees that have been passed down for many generations. As they finally, now, receive fair pay for their products, many farming families are able to greatly improve their quality of life and transform local conditions by, for example, sending their children to school. We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute in this way!
90`|Color:Blue || Style:Loog Electric Guitar Product Description The Electric Loog is cute and small, but it's not a toy: it's a real guitar, made out of real wood and equipped with a screaming pickup that sounds amazing whatever style you play. Because it only has three strings and a narrow neck, it’s easier for small children to form chords and to make sense of what they are playing. All Loog Guitars come unassembled, as we believe that building your own guitar is an experience that helps you bond with the instrument in a deeper level. It is also a bonding experience between parents and their children, who can build their Loog together and share their love of music. Loog Guitars pair with the Loog iOS app filled with video lessons designed to get you playing songs -not just scales or exercises- on day one. From the Manufacturer $70,007 raised with 469 backers. As Easy As 1-2-3 Playing songs on a traditional guitar can be a daunting task for beginners. That is why most teaching methods focus first on scales and don’t get into chords until well advanced into the course. Loog Guitars solve this: Because they only have three strings and a narrow neck, it’s easier for small children to form chords and to make sense of what they are playing. And to make things even easier, your Loog pairs with the Loog Academy app, loaded with video lessons that will get you playing songs on day one. Build. Bond. Play. Learn. When you build your own guitar you develop a deep connection to it. It's an experience that helps you bond with the instrument and learn how it works. It is also a bonding experience between parents and their children, who can build their Loog together and share their love of music. No special tools or expertise are required: take it out of the box and in just 15 minutes you will have built a fully functional, beautiful looking and sounding guitar. Music: The Gift That Keeps On Giving. Imagine coming home after work and asking your kid: what are we going to play today? With the Loog Academy app, kids and their families can unlock free songs and video lessons, designed for them to play together. Learn On A Loog. Play Any Guitar. Loog Guitars use the same first three strings -and tuning- of a six-string guitar. This is why everything you learn on a Loog can later be applied on a standard guitar. The transition is natural and seamless. An Instrument For Empowerment Playing a musical instrument helps kids benefit in almost every level of their cognitive skills: memory, mental processing speed, verbal fluency, creative thinking and focus. Loog Guitars make it fun, rewarding and engaging for them to learn how to play. Bonding through music used to be a big family activity. Today, it is increasingly rare. Let's change that together. “If you’re thinking of getting your kids interested in music, the Loog Guitar is perfect.” WIRED About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Fun and easy. How did you come up with the idea for this product? Loog started as an academic project in 2010 when Rafael Atijas developed the concept as his Master’s thesis at New York University. The idea was: what if a children’s guitar wasn't just small but also had other features that made it fun and easy to learn how to play? That’s how I came up with Loog Guitars: a line of 3-string kits that kids can build with their parents and, in that way, connect with their instrument at a deeper level. The 3 strings still let kids and beginners play chords and, therefore, any song. But, with fewer things to learn, it's easier to play and to make sense of what they are playing. The fact that The Loog Guitar was conceived in a university actually explains a lot about the company's culture: our main goal is not to make the most profit, but to offer a product that is unique and well-designed. What makes your product special? It allows families to bond through their love of music. We honestly think that that contributes in making a better world. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Getting emails and videos of families playing together with our guitars. A music teacher telling us that thanks to Loog Guitars a student with Aspergers syndrome was able to play, engage and perform in public. Learning that a 16-year-old from the Netherlands wrote and recorded a beautiful album with her Loog. All those things were very special to us. And getting to collaborate with Jack White’s Third Man Records on a special edition Loog Guitar was pretty rad too.|

How did you come up with the idea for this product? One night during a dinner party, our founder, Mike del Ponte was hesitant to put his cheap plastic “other brand” water filter on his nicely set table.

Distinguished by its clean, modern design, Soma also gives back by donating clean drinking water to those in need through charity: water. What has been the best part of your startup experience?

94`Color:Silver Product Description The Noke Padock is a Bluetooth enabled smart lock that unlocks with your iOS or Android phone to get rid of the need for keys and combinations. By using Noke and your smartphone, you'll always have easy access to all the important things in your life. In addition, you'll be able to share access to your possessions easily, safely, and securely. From the Manufacturer $652,828 raised with 6,108 backers. Share Access Using our iOS or Android app, Noke allows instant and secure sharing. You can choose permanent, one-time, or custom settings. Need to give Johny access to your locker while you're on vacation? With Noke, it's no problem. Long-Lasting Battery Noke is packed with a long-life battery that will last over a year of normal use. When your battery starts to get low, your app will warn you with plenty of time to replace it. When you need to replace the battery, it can be easily done without the use of any tools. Quick Click Access What if you forget your phone or your battery dies? With Noke, it's no problem. Our Quick-Click technology allows you to create a custom access code. If you're ever without your phone, simply key in those clicks through a series of long and short taps on the shackle and your Noke will instantly unlock for you. You'll never worry about being stranded again. Strong And Water-Resistant While Noke is an incredibly attractive device, it is designed to be strong. Using hardened steel and boron, Noke will stand up to the toughest environments. It is even designed to work in places where it may get wet. With four silicone gaskets to keep the water out and no external buttons, Noke can go where you go. About Us Noke is an IoT company based out of the greater Salt Lake area aimed toward innovating smart-locks of every kind, making locks an asset to consumers rather than a hindrance. The company was founded in late 2014 with the help of the Kickstarter community, which backed multiple successful campaign launches to make Noke's vision a reality. The Noke team has since doubled in size and works to make securing, sharing and tracking locks a seamless and convenient user experience. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Convenience Is Key Where did you get the inspiration for your product? Keys have been used to open locks for centuries. But keys have the same problems today as they did back then. They are easy to lose, they can be stolen, they are a pain to share, and if you share them, you must get them back. Sharing combinations has its own set of issues. The Noke was created to put those problems behind us. What differentiates your product from similar products out there? At Noke we aim to make things so intuitively simple that anyone can use our locks for virtually any security need. We value giving customers added capabilities to their locks that they didn’t necessarily know they even wanted. By using our Bluetooth enabled locks in conjunction with our Noke app, not only can you rid yourself of annoying keys and combinations, but you can also share and revoke custom access to your lock with friends and family, monitor the history of your lock, and track its location with the unique Noke GPS feature. We set out to give consumers every feature they could ever want, all in one attractive, easy-to-use padlock. Tell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process. The best part was receiving such positive feedback from buyers and backers on Kickstarter. We were excited about our product, but it was gratifying to see customers just as excited about it as we were. It's awesome to see the different ways people are usng the Noke and discovering new benefits every day. The most challenging part was hiring the right talent at the right time. It's always difficult to know when you're ready to bring on more personnel--too early and you can run into a cash-flow issue, too late and you can lose significant competitive advantage. We started looking for quality people a couple months before we needed them because it took so long to find the right talent. We want people who are as motivated as we are and are the best at what they do. We found them eventually, but if we would have waited to start looking until we needed them, it would have dramatically slowed our growth.
68`Product Description The Garbage Can Fly Trap allows users to discretely catch and eliminate house flies and fruit flies from kitchens, homes and outdoor areas. The trap doesn’t require chemical attractants, the use of unsightly flypaper, or chasing flies with a swatter. When full, the replacement cartridge can be released directly into your garbage via a quick release button on top of the trap allowing for hands-free disposal so there’s nothing disgusting to touch. 1.5" hole saw required for installation (not included). For use in plastic or metal garbage can lids. Patent Pending. From the Manufacturer How the Garbage Can Fly Trap Works Flies are naturally attracted to the scent of your garbage. Flies land on your garbage can lid and follow their "nose" into the trap and the cartridge located under the lid. The cartridge is lined with flypaper which prevents their escape. When you are ready to throw away the cartridge, push the quick release button on the lid to release the cartridge directly into the trash. Then snap on a new cartridge and you are ready to catch more flies! The cartridge is semi-transparent so you are able to see if replacement is necessary and it can last up to two months. Got Fruit Flies? In addition to house flies, the Garbage Can Fly Trap also catches fruit flies in your garbage can but the trap can also be installed into a smaller tabletop container for fruit fly abatement specifically. The disposable cartridge has a fine mesh screen well suited to trap fruit flies. When used just for fruit flies, simply bait your container with red wine vinegar (or your least favorite wine). Quick Release Cartridge Disposal The quick release button allows for hands-free disposal directly into your garbage. Never touch a disgusting trap full of dead flies again! Kitchen & Curbside Garbage Cans Use it in your kitchen and curbside garbage cans. For curbside garbage cans, affix the retaining ring to the underside of the trap for a stronger hold. Install in Almost Any Container The Garbage Can Fly Trap can be installed into a variety of containers including recycle bins, compost bins, pet waste receptacles and more. A Better Fly Trap At the Garbage Can Fly Trap, our mission is to help you maintain an environment in and around your home that is healthy for food preparation and consumption, because in our opinion, even ONE fly is too many! About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Discrete Fly Abatement How did you come up with the idea for this product? Dennis and I were eating lunch in our kitchen. It was a hot summer day and we had left our kitchen door open. As we sat at our kitchen table, we noticed a fly had come into the kitchen and landed on our garbage can. We watched it struggle for 10 minutes trying to get inside. We’re not even sure which one of us suggested it but one of us said, “We should drill a hole in the lid and let it in, but place a trap under the lid.” Almost immediately Dennis set out to make a prototype and 10 minutes after he installed it we had caught our first fly! AHA! …and the Garbage Can Fly Trap was born! What makes your product special? One of the great design features of the Garbage Can Fly Trap is that it requires no additional bait - it uses the fly’s natural attraction to your garbage as bait. House flies and fruit flies, land on the lid of your garbage can trying to get in. They walk into the trap and down where they are trapped in a flypaper lined cartridge. When you are ready to throw out the cartridge simply push the quick release button on the lid and the cartridge falls directly into the trash – so there’s nothing disgusting to touch or to look at for that matter. What has been the best part of your startup experience? If you want to see just how strong your marriage is, try bringing a new product to market while raising a 2-year old, and working full-time professional jobs! We did and we’re stronger for it. We also appreciate more deeply our unique contributions and how critical it is to have different skills sets when bringing a new product to market.

Store. Measure. Dispense. Where did you get the inspiration for your product? The journey to the Made started at 4:30 am while blearily trying to make my 4 month old daughter a bottle of formula. I was holding her, she was screaming, and I was spilling formula all over, when in the back of my mind I thought “This would be so much easier if the measuring tool were attached to the container”. Over time I realized that by attaching the measuring tool to the container, not just baby formula, but a variety of products could be more easily prepared. What differentiates your product from similar products out there? No other food storage container has a measuring cap. No other storage container is specifically designed to be portable, allowing the user to take it to the bulk aisle, camping, in the RV or anywhere else. Tell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process.

Store. Measure. Dispense. Where did you get the inspiration for your product? The journey to the Made started at 4:30 am while blearily trying to make my 4 month old daughter a bottle of formula. I was holding her, she was screaming, and I was spilling formula all over, when in the back of my mind I thought “This would be so much easier if the measuring tool were attached to the container”. Over time I realized that by attaching the measuring tool to the container, not just baby formula, but a variety of products could be more easily prepared. What differentiates your product from similar products out there? No other food storage container has a measuring cap. No other storage container is specifically designed to be portable, allowing the user to take it to the bulk aisle, camping, in the RV or anywhere else. Tell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process. The best and most challenging part of creating the Made has been finding, having and keeping the will to overcome all of the obstacles in the road to getting a great idea into something tangible,and that can help others.

139`|Color:Gray || Style:Go Hammock Product Description The Go! Hammock is the flagship product of startup company, Go Outfitters. The company set out to design the most comfortable hammock on the market and this amazing hammock is the result. It's called the GO! Hammock because it's designed to go anywhere with you and it can be set up in a snap. It's great for camping, hiking, picnics or just lounging in the backyard. The GO! Hammock eliminates uncomfortable pressure points by distributing the user's body weight more evenly than traditional hammocks. Its generous size allows freedom to move around and makes it easy find lots of comfortable positions! In order to reduce the curved body position that's associated with hammocks, experts recommend lying at a diagonal angle. To enable users to lie even flatter, the GO! Hammock is extra long and wide. With a length of 11 feet, it's much longer than most hammocks, this extra length helps flatten out the body position dramatically! At 70" wide, one can lie at an even greater angle in the hammock, flattening the body position even more! This is the first hammock in the world to feature Go Outfitters new fabric tensioning system that manages loose fabric and keeps it off of the user!

The 11' length allows for a flatter body position than shorter hammocks for a much better night's sleep. With a width of 70" the user can lie at a diagonal angle in the hammock for an even flatter body position. Fabric Tensioning System The GO! Hammock is the first hammock in the world with our new Fabric Tensioners! Large hammocks can sometimes have annoying loose fabric on the sides. To eliminate this problem, we designed removable fabric tensioners that pull the loose fabric out of the way. The tensioners make folds in the fabric, giving the hammock its unique shape Optional Ridgeline For a hammock to be as comfortable as possible it should be set up with a certain amount of sag. The optional ridgeline to set the sag of the hammock form maximum comfort every time.

To reconnect people with our environment. We see that our world is facing some serious issues in terms of food and water shortages, and we want to be a part of the change for the better. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Lowest Maintenance Aquarium How did you come up with the idea for this product? We're a team of aquarium enthusiasts and have been our entire lives. While doing research at the largest aquaponics farm in the nation, we learned we could use basil to filter the fish waste. With the same method, aquaponics uses 90% less water grows food 2x as fast in 1/2 the space with no pesticides or fertilizers. We spent years to perfectly implement aquaponics into an aquarium creating the ecoqube, the lowest maintenance aquarium ever. What makes your product special? The Aquaponics system makes owning a fish easier than a conventional fish tank. The fish's waste is used by the basil plant to grow and elminates the need for a water change. A few fish, some shrimp and a snail or two will give you the perfect balance for a low maintenance ecosystem. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Through creating the EcoQube, we've been able to introduce the concept of sustainability to hundreds of thousands of people and helped nearly 10,000 people bring nature into their homes. Now we have a team dedicated to helping all our customers succeed with creating their very own window to nature with the EcoQube

Simply stack modules and pair with sensors to bring an infinite number of projects to life About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Electronic building blocks How did you come up with the idea for this product? A few years ago, our founder was working at another company and was tasked with monitoring the temperatures of a server room. He got tired of getting up and walking to that room all the time so he created an Arduino project to do it for him. It worked, but the device was clunky and required tons of soldering and complicated coding. He decided to simplify DIY electronics and so Microduino and mCookies were created. As Bill Gates put it best, “I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it. What makes your product special? Each module is about the size of a quarter. They are magnetically stackable, which means users do not have to know complex coding or soldering to use the mCookie. Also, our wide array of peripheral sensors, modules, accessories makes DIY projects amazingly easy without the worries of compatibility. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The most stressful part of managing a startup is constantly worrying about whether it’s going to thrive or flop. When our Kickstarter received backing over 500% of our goal, that was a moment of validation from our fans and it was amazing.
16`Product Description BetterBack allows you to sit in perfect posture effortlessly.

As seen on TV/ Shark Tank, just unzip, fold around your back and knees, and have perfect seated posture in five seconds flat! Make every chair ergonomic with BetterBack. From the Manufacturer $2M raised with 55k backers. 15+ Minutes a Day BetterBack allows you to effortlessly sit in perfect posture, easing back pain—and preventing it. Wearing it for just 15 minutes a day can retrain your body’s default posture, so when you stand or sit without BetterBack, your posture is greatly improved. Make Every Chair Ergonomic Wear BetterBack at your desk, on a plane, watching a game or even while you meditate. Lightweight and portable, it makes every chair ergonomic. Wear it any time you have to sit. Great posture boosts your mood, confidence, motivation and overall health. Get next gen back support. BetterBack stabilizes your pelvis so you can’t slump, restoring your spine's natural curvature, and provides lumbar support. Wear it for as little as 15 minutes a day to achieve great posture when you stand or sit on your own. Or wear it all day long for back pain relief. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Comfortable. Effortless. Reliable. How did you come up with the idea for this product? A few years ago I was spending ~14 hours a day at work hunched over my laptop and I developed terrible sciatica pain. It was excruciatingly painful to sit for over a year. I tried dozens of products on the market to help me with my back pain, and while they all had great components, nothing was a full solution. A friend and I spent weeks tinkering with anything we could find to help get back support. The first version of the BetterBack knee pads was a cut out from the top of a mega sized protein bottle! Friends and colleagues would see me wearing early versions of BetterBack and ask to try it. I started getting messages all the time from friends begging to take it on a trip or to borrow it for just a few days. I decided to invest more time, money and energy into BetterBack, hiring two amazing industrial designers to help me take it to the next level. Throughout the design process, I spent Fridays pulling people off the street around San Francisco to have them try BetterBack. We had over 60 beta testers, multiple doctors and therapists involved, and 6 rounds of prototyping before kicking off our Kickstarter. What makes your product special? Lots of great things! BetterBack does more than provide lumbar support—it stabilizes your pelvis so you can’t slump. It also saves you hundreds on hundreds of dollars: instead of buying one ergonomic chair, you can make every single seat (from a chair to a bench to the floor!) ergonomic. We are a community from all over the world on a journey to a better back and would love for you to join us! Shoot us a note any time for back tips, advice or to share your story. We got your back. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of the startup experience, BY FAR, has been hearing all the amazing ways BetterBack has improved people’s lives. Probash in London shared “Oh wow, used it for an hour a day in the office for 3 days and the pain in my back that a physio could not get rid of in 6 months HAS NOW GONE!!!! I can feel some crackling in my neck too as my spine adjusts and realigns, but wow does my neck and back feel good!!!!!” Monica runs a tech company in the US and wrote “First day with my new BetterBack—my lower back pain is gone and my mind is blown”. And on and on …. so many incredible way BetterBack is helping people, just as it’s helped me. Feeling so grateful, inspired and energized to keep helping people have better backs and to live better!

205`Product Description A Penny Portrait kit is a fun way for kids and grown-ups alike to create a fantastic work of art and maybe learn a thing or two in the process! Each kit includes a poster of Abe Lincoln made from images of actual pennies. The poster is suitable for framing as is, but with a little effort, some glue, and 846 of your own pennies, you can have a truly unique work of art that you will enjoy for years to come. From the Manufacturer $1,874 raised with 124 backers. More than just a poster Each kit includes an 18 x 24 poster on sturdy card stock, a 12 page booklet with facts and info about Abe Lincoln, coin collecting, chemistry experiments with pennies, optical illusions and more. We also include an assembly tips and tricks guide, but rest assured it's as simple as 1. Put glue on penny 2. Put penny on poster. A truly one of a kind work of art If you've been shopping around trying to find the best place to buy a portrait of Abe Lincoln you can make from your own pennies, look no further! It'll take you a couple of hours, a bottle of glue and that old container full of pennies you've been wondering what to do with. It's a great activity to keep the kids entertained on a rainy day. If your kids can work with glue and pennies, (and you trust them not to eat either) then they are old enough to complete a Penny Portrait. The pics don't do this item justice. The way the poster shimmers and shines in person is just stunning. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Lincoln from Lincolns How did you come up with the idea for this product? I saw an article about a father and son who created a giant portrait of Abe Lincoln out of pennies. Their image was much larger and they used two shades of pennies. I thought other parents and kids might enjoy a project like this and went about trying to create an improved, easier to assemble version on my computer. Using four shades of pennies, I was able to decrease the size of the image to 18? x 24? (846 pennies) which seemed a bit more manageable. What makes your product special? Who doesn't love money and America? This item is so unique, you should probably order two of them. Although, I guess that would make the second one not quite as unique... But you should still probably order two just because they are so gosh darn American that nobody could possibly question your patriotism with two of these on your wall. At the very least, you should buy one or people might suspect you of being a communist. What has been the best part of your startup experience? I love it when people send photos of their finished portraits to my website, www.PennyPortrait.com. The happy faces of people who've taken the time to create their own little penny masterpieces is a constant delight to me. Also, I package these by hand (Made in America!) and so it allows me a lot of time to catch up on my favorite video series on Amazon Prime. (Yes, I'm blatantly kissing up to Amazon, but they sell a lot of portraits for me...)

370`Product Description HeroBoys is a collection of superhero characters that set out to empower young boys ages 3-10. The creators, parents of two young boys themselves, invented the line for all boys to inject positive messaging and meaningful, educational content into a superhero landscape dominated by movie marketing related products. The characters, Blazer, Gusto, Rocko, StormSurge, Techno, and ThunderHawk, learn to work together and use their inherent strengths and talents (something that all children have) to help make a positive impact in the world. From the Manufacturer The Best of Both Worlds HeroBoys is a doll/action figure hybrid unlike anything on the market. Most 18-inch action figures are made from hard plastic and do not bend and the elbows and knees. HeroBoys heroes are unique in that their torso is made from soft compressed cotton fibers, giving our Heroes a soft, huggable quality. The limbs however are firm and bendable at the shoulder, elbows, hips and knees for full poseability and play. Heroes Meant for Children HeroBoys is the only line of post preschool hero related products that are focused on providing thoughtful, meaningful, age appropriate content for children. Most of today’s superhero content is immersed in the current Hero-Industrial Complex of PG-13 Movies, violent video games, and dark and morbid comic books. HeroBoys aims to provide positive encouragement and reinforcement of values though it’s comics in which children heroes come to together to do good in a world where adults have left a lot of room for improvement. Durable Construction These Heroes can stand up to the rough and tumble play of active children! Poseability Ready for action with 11 points of articulation! Stand Included Display stand included with each Hero- prefect for bookshelf, dresser or nightstand. There is a Hero Inside Every Boy We created the HeroBoys to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. AmericanGirl Meets Avengers How did you come up with the idea for this product? As parents, we struggled to find toys with meaning and value for our boys. They love Superheroes, but it seems almost all superhero related content is part of today’s Hero-Industrial Complex of major media properties targeted to broad audiences for movies, video games, and comic books. The content in this area for children in the crucial development years from 3 to 10 generally lacks thoughtfulness, value, or meaning. That is why we created the HeroBoys, a line of toys and comic books meant to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. What makes your product special? We are the only line of post preschool superhero related content truly for children and not part of the PG-13 Hero Industrial Complex that turns out superhero related movies of varying quality that are inevitably targeted for he broadest possible market and not concerned with development and age appropriate messaging for younger children. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The reaction from children when they read the comic books and play with the Heroes, they absolutely love them which is fantastic!
337`Product Description Finally! A cool boy doll for all kids. Boy Story brings Action Dolls to the world: 18" boy dolls with adjustable ball-joints to join the action and fun with all the girl dolls out there. Action Dolls are cool. Action Dolls encourage pretend play and imagination. Action Dolls are for all kids. Action Dolls are just plain FUN. Our Action Dolls are designed to be cool, boyish, and diverse. Missing from mainstream 18" doll lines are detailed facial features capturing the uniqueness we love in children. Most 18” dolls limit changes to skin tone and hair color, and many children (especially boys) are not represented. Even the boy dolls out there, we found, often look like they are wearing makeup or are girl dolls with cut hair. Boy Story believes that children’s toys should be as diverse as the kids who play with them. From the Manufacturer Action Doll Play Encourages Development of Empathy, Communication, and Nurture Kids learn best through play. That's why parents are seeking more and more opportunities to expose their kids to a wide variety of toys and activities that combine fun with learning. Boy Story's Action Dolls offer unique boy dolls to encourage all kids to engage in pretend and imaginative play. Doll play in particular has been shown by many studies to improve development of empathy, human connection, communication, and relational skills. Doll play also encourages development of fine motor skills through handling the dolls and playing with the accessories such as shoe laces, buttons, snaps, and zippers. Kids who play with same-age dolls experience heightened cognitive development through the use of descriptive words and adjectives, because their play engages with the dolls on a human level. Pretend play hugely benefits kids' development and should be offered to all children without stereotyped limitations. Boy Action Dolls Break Down Stereotypes and Build Gender Equality We've created our boy Action Dolls to help break down some antiquated stereotypes in play. Parents want their kids' toys to be as diverse as the world around them, and our Action Dolls help bring much needed diversity to play. We designed our Action Dolls and stories with care to celebrate racial diversity and help all kids feel comfortable playing with dolls. Fun is our number one mission! Kids have tons of fun running around with their Action Dolls, posing them in all different ways, and going on as many adventures as they can imagine. Buying an Action Doll for a special child in your life breaks down barriers and helps all our kids share the sandbox! 11 Joints & Ball Joints for Ultra-Poseability Each Action doll has 11 joints: Neck - Shoulders - Elbows - Wrists - Hips - Knees. The joints at the elbows, wrists, and knees are ball joints allowing for full 360-degree articulation. Your Action Doll can jump, kick, swing, and wave...basically anything you can imagine! High Quality Vinyl and Molded Hair Daring to be different from the other dolls out there, each of our Action Dolls is specially detailed to have his own unique look. The vinyl is scratch-resistant, phthalate-free, and durable. The sculpted hair and fine facial features can withstand lots of rough-and-tumble play. The bodies of the doll are made from a premium cotton twill that's unlike any other 18" doll! Detailed to Perfection - Meant for Play We have designed and engineered every detail of each Action Doll - from the top of his head to the bottom of his shoes! The dolls, clothes, and shoes are meant for lots of play and fun, so we expect them to get a little dirty! Our tough vinyl and resilient shoes easily wash clean with a cloth, and our clothes can be spot cleaned. Action Dolls - Giving Our Kids Choice in Play Boy Story is proud that our Action Dolls serve two purposes: promoting imaginative play and breaking down stereotypes. Foremost, they dish up a whole lot of fun for kids - after all, that's what toys are all about! At their core, Action Dolls promote imaginative and pretend roleplay. Boys and girls alike love Action Dolls - they fill a gap the toy market has left sparsely stocked for too many generations. The dolls are durable and able to join in countless adventures. From riding in bike baskets, to reading books in forts, to camping under the stars - these Action Dolls are meant to be life’s companions. But our Action Dolls also bring change to the toy market by breaking down stereotypes and adding diversity. They give kids more choice in their play. Kids deserve to have toys as diverse as the world they live in. Our approach to Action Dolls has been to promote gender equality through our product and our message. Our Equality Campaign features photos of kids just being kids - having good old-fashioned unrestricted fun with no stereotypes to hold them back. Our positive messaging encourages all kids to interact on a human level and develop those vital relationship and nurturing skills that dolls so importantly teach. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Dolls For All How did you come up with the idea for this product? The idea of Boy Story started while Kristen was pregnant with her second son in the summer of 2014. She wanted to buy a boy doll for her older son to help him get used to the idea of being a big brother and to have a companion to play with at times when mommy was busy taking care of the baby. But when she went to buy a boy doll, she was shocked at the market. Most dolls were either girls or baby dolls. There were no cool boy dolls out there. That was the beginning of the idea. But Kristen was working full time as a lawyer overseas, and there was no way she could start a business. That’s where Katie came in. Katie was so excited at the idea that she decided to risk it all by quitting her own job and working to get things started. With tons of strong will and determination, even without any prior business management experience, Katie relied on the guidance of Kristen and started up the company. We are now both working full time with Boy Story to make great products and a great company. What makes your product special? Our Action Dolls are a combination of poseable action figures and lovable 18" dolls. There are tons of nice girl dolls available for kids, but very few cool boy dolls. Our dolls' unique features were meticulously designed by us personally to celebrate diversity and introduce some boy dolls to the market. The clothing is modern and fresh, and the dolls have a look and feel that reflect their high quality. Our Action Dolls make kids, including boys, feel comfortable playing with dolls and give all kids a fun platform to develop important skills such as nurture and empathy. What has been the best part of your startup experience? One of the most amazing moments we have had in starting up Boy Story was when we actually received the completed prototypes of our dolls. It was one of those “dream come true” moments where an idea turned into something real. And the absolute best is when we see kids light up when they test out our Action Dolls. Kids are just amazing in their honesty and pure love for play. As soon as they get their hands on the dolls, adventures begin. And that makes our hearts so, so big.
196`Product Description Produced from naturally grown olive trees in Morocco's Atlas Mountains, Auzoud's olives and olive oil are sourced from a small farmers' cooperative that guarantees fair wages and sustainable harvesting practices. After watching his grandfather and other farming families struggle to bring their goods to market for a fair price, Auzoud owner Mejid Beraouz co-founded the cooperative to support better economic and social conditions for agricultural workers in his homeland. The cooperative seeks to unify and empower local farmers as they obtain fair prices for their olives and a more sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families. There are currently over a hundred cooperative members with many more farmers seeking to participate in the next harvest. One of the cooperative’s goals is to educate members about sustainable olive farming. To this end, Auzoud and cooperative members are working together to obtain organic certification for all current and new members. From the Manufacturer ALL NATURAL From naturally grown picholine olive trees in Morocco's Atlas Mountains. HAND-PICKED & OIL-CURED Hand-picked and cured with sea salt and Auzoud EVOO. HAND-PICKED & OIL-CURED Hand-picked and cured with sea salt and Auzoud EVOO. ROBUST FLAVOR Traditionally harvested and cured to maintain robust flavor and meaty texture. FAIR WAGES & SUSTAINABLE HARVESTING Sourced from a farmers’ cooperative that guarantees fair wages. Auzoud's mission is to empower Moroccan women and youth farmers as they obtain fair prices and a more sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families. In addition to offering only the finest authentic Moroccan foods, Auzoud is committed to working with low-income women and youth farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive, saffron and argan farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Many of the farmers are single mothers hoping to send their children to school. Auzoud has been founded by the grandson of one such farmer. Our partner cooperatives are based on membership participation and fair prices, allowing women to feed their families and educate their children. Improving the socio-economic situation, health and education of women and youth has an immediate and lasting impact on the well-being of families and the preservation of the local culture and community. We are focused on expanding the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. More than olives. How did you come up with the idea for this product? I was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud/auzoud means “olive” in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud’s waters contribute to the region’s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation...it has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping family and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma. After moving to the U.S. I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors’ land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region. Now we have expanded and are working with three cooperatives in Morocco. All cooperative members are small-scale farmers, many of them single mothers and young people hoping for a stable income to help their families. We hope you enjoy our products and share them with your family, as we do, and that you understand Auzoud to be an offering that unites our regions, languages, cultures and religions. As such, Auzoud's logo is the dove carrying an olive branch - a universal symbol of hope and peace - in reflection of this wish for shared prosperity and peace between our communities and across the world. What makes your product special? Auzoud Oil-Cured Black Olives are sourced directly from a farmers' cooperative in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco. A purchase with Auzoud guarantees fair wages and healthy working conditions for hundreds of small farmers throughout the region. What has been the best part of your startup experience? By far the best part of our startup experience has been connecting and working closely with hundreds of small farmers from my home region. I love engaging with them and learning their stories. Like my grandfather, most of the farmers we work with have olive trees that have been passed down for many generations. As they finally, now, receive fair pay for their products, many farming families are able to greatly improve their quality of life and transform local conditions by, for example, sending their children to school. We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute in this way!

221`Product Description GOAT Mug is a one-of-a-kind coffee mug that was inspired by the first coffee discovery. Its horn shape is a dedication to goats that discovered this elixir of life and it also lets you drink the very last sip. It comes with a set of 2 straps that allow you to carry your coffee, but at the same time reply to a couple of e-mails and carry around your newspaper. From the Manufacturer Inspired by the original story of coffee discovery ... The creation of GOAT STORY was inspired by the greatest discovery of all time – coffee! It was back in 13th century when a flock of goats stumbled upon a bush of berries that made them go loco! Their shepherd decided to brew the berries and came up with the rich and flavourful drink we all adore nowadays! The brand is dedicated to the ones worthy of the praise – goats. ... crafted into a one-of-a-kind coffee mug. It is not only the shape which makes it special, it is also the variety of materials that were chosen to suit different styles and preferences. We made sure to use top quality materials that are safe for you and will endure a long time. Because everyone needs their own dose of caffeine fix, we made it in two sizes 12 oz. and 16 oz. Horn shape The horn shape is a dedication to goats that discovered coffee and its incline also lets you drink the very last sip. Easy to carry The Mug can be worn across your shoulders or attached to your bag thanks to the straps it comes with. 100% leak proof No worries about spills and stains, they won't happen. How to place it on the table, you might ask? Our most favorite feature of GOAT Mug is hidden in its holder. At first look it only serves as an insulator, but in 1-2-3 it turns into a stand so you can easily place it on any flat surface. Baa-wesome, right?! About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Unique, Coffee, 2GO How did you come up with the idea for this product? I love coffee and I wanted to create a cool coffee mug to carry my coffee with me. Together with my team we came across the story that coffee was discovered by the goats. It took us 2 years to finish up the GOAT Mug project and to choose the right materials. After two years of designing the product I knew that it is so different that we need an approval of the Kickstarter community to make it come alive. People instantly loved the idea which was a great stamp of approval that we’re doing something right. What makes your product special? The GOAT Mug has a story a different shape and an incredibly smart solution on how you put it on the table and carry it around. It’s definitely not your average coffee mug. On the contrary it’s a great conversation starter and get’s all eyes on you. What has been the best part of your startup experience? First it was just an idea and a big wish to make it come alive. On our way we had to solve many problems and we had to be aware of every small detail. We love coffee and design so I believe the GOAT STORY will soon surprise with more solution that will bring even more style to coffee drinking. I would also like to thank our community who believes in us and loves what we do. Baa :)

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Comfortable Functional Versatile! How did you come up with the idea for this product? Convenience on the go.

373`Product Description HeroBoys is a collection of superhero characters that set out to empower young boys ages 3-10. The creators, parents of two young boys themselves, invented the line for all boys to inject positive messaging and meaningful, educational content into a superhero landscape dominated by movie marketing related products. The characters, Blazer, Gusto, Rocko, StormSurge, Techno, and ThunderHawk, learn to work together and use their inherent strengths and talents (something that all children have) to help make a positive impact in the world. From the Manufacturer The Best of Both Worlds HeroBoys is a doll/action figure hybrid unlike anything on the market. Most 18-inch action figures are made from hard plastic and do not bend and the elbows and knees. HeroBoys heroes are unique in that their torso is made from soft compressed cotton fibers, giving our Heroes a soft, huggable quality. The limbs however are firm and bendable at the shoulder, elbows, hips and knees for full poseability and play. Heroes Meant for Children HeroBoys is the only line of post preschool hero related products that are focused on providing thoughtful, meaningful, age appropriate content for children. Most of today’s superhero content is immersed in the current Hero-Industrial Complex of PG-13 Movies, violent video games, and dark and morbid comic books. HeroBoys aims to provide positive encouragement and reinforcement of values though it’s comics in which children heroes come to together to do good in a world where adults have left a lot of room for improvement. Durable Construction These Heroes can stand up to the rough and tumble play of active children! Poseability Ready for action with 11 points of articulation! Stand Included Display stand included with each Hero- prefect for bookshelf, dresser or nightstand. There is a Hero Inside Every Boy We created the HeroBoys to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. AmericanGirl Meets Avengers How did you come up with the idea for this product? As parents, we struggled to find toys with meaning and value for our boys. They love Superheroes, but it seems almost all superhero related content is part of today’s Hero-Industrial Complex of major media properties targeted to broad audiences for movies, video games, and comic books. The content in this area for children in the crucial development years from 3 to 10 generally lacks thoughtfulness, value, or meaning. That is why we created the HeroBoys, a line of toys and comic books meant to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. What makes your product special? We are the only line of post preschool superhero related content truly for children and not part of the PG-13 Hero Industrial Complex that turns out superhero related movies of varying quality that are inevitably targeted for he broadest possible market and not concerned with development and age appropriate messaging for younger children. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The reaction from children when they read the comic books and play with the Heroes, they absolutely love them which is fantastic!

How did you come up with the idea for this product? Adam Badawy and his wife were always on the road for business. Hotels and airports never had enough outlets to charge all their devices.

The sleek design is a powerhouse charger that is designed to go along with all your electronic devices. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Creating CHARLIE was a whole new ball game. I created CHARLIE from concept to design to consumer's hands. The sense of total and utter ownership is very exciting. After having gone through the challenges of prototypes and design engineering, I now hope to mentor other inventors. From patents to factory inspections - it is truly and exciting process. When we exceeded our goal on Kickstarter it was really amazing to experience how much support everyday people gave us. It's a delicious moment in life when you can taste success after cooking and slaving for years. I'm a really humble man so this has been a great journey.

325`Product Description Finally! A cool boy doll for all kids. Boy Story brings Action Dolls to the world: 18" boy dolls with adjustable ball-joints to join the action and fun with all the girl dolls out there. Action Dolls are cool. Action Dolls encourage pretend play and imagination. Action Dolls are for all kids. Action Dolls are just plain FUN. Our Action Dolls are designed to be cool, boyish, and diverse. Missing from mainstream 18" doll lines are detailed facial features capturing the uniqueness we love in children. Most 18” dolls limit changes to skin tone and hair color, and many children (especially boys) are not represented. Even the boy dolls out there, we found, often look like they are wearing makeup or are girl dolls with cut hair. Boy Story believes that children’s toys should be as diverse as the kids who play with them. From the Manufacturer Action Doll Play: Fun + Teaches Empathy, Communication, and Nurture Kids learn best through play. That's why parents are seeking more and more opportunities to expose their kids to a wide variety of toys and activities that combine fun with learning. Boy Story's Action Dolls offer unique boy dolls to encourage all kids to engage in pretend and imaginative play. Doll play in particular has been shown by many studies to improve development of empathy, human connection, communication, and relational skills. Doll play also encourages development of fine motor skills through handling the dolls and playing with the accessories such as shoe laces, buttons, snaps, and zippers. Kids who play with same-age dolls experience heightened cognitive development through the use of descriptive words and adjectives, because their play engages with the dolls on a human level. Pretend play hugely benefits kids' development and should be offered to all children without stereotyped limitations. Boy Action Dolls Break Down Stereotypes and Build Gender Equality We've created our boy Action Dolls to help break down some antiquated stereotypes in play. Parents want their kids' toys to be as diverse as the world around them, and our Action Dolls help bring much needed diversity to play. We designed our Action Dolls and stories with care to celebrate racial diversity and help all kids feel comfortable playing with dolls. Fun is our number one mission! Kids have tons of fun running around with their Action Dolls, posing them in all different ways, and going on as many adventures as they can imagine. Buying an Action Doll for a special child in your life breaks down barriers and helps all our kids share the sandbox! 11 Joints & Ball Joints for Ultra-Poseability Each Action doll has 11 joints: Neck - Shoulders - Elbows - Wrists - Hips - Knees. The joints at the elbows, wrists, and knees are ball joints allowing for full 360-degree articulation. Your Action Doll can jump, kick, swing, and wave...basically anything you can imagine! High Quality Vinyl and Sculpted Hair Daring to be different from the other dolls out there, each of our Action Dolls is specially detailed to have his own unique look. The vinyl is scratch-resistant, phthalate-free, and durable. The sculpted hair and fine facial features can withstand lots of rough-and-tumble play. The bodies of the doll are made from a premium cotton twill that's unlike any other 18" doll! Detailed to Perfection - Meant for Play We have designed and engineered every detail of each Action Doll - from the top of his head to the bottom of his shoes! The dolls, clothes, and shoes are meant for lots of play and fun, so we expect them to get a little dirty! Our tough vinyl and resilient shoes easily wash clean with a cloth, and our clothes can be spot cleaned. Action Dolls - Giving Our Kids Choice in Play Boy Story is proud that our Action Dolls serve two purposes: promoting imaginative play and breaking down stereotypes. Foremost, they dish up a whole lot of fun for kids - after all, that's what toys are all about! At their core, Action Dolls promote imaginative and pretend roleplay. Boys and girls alike love Action Dolls - they fill a gap the toy market has left sparsely stocked for too many generations. The dolls are durable and able to join in countless adventures. From riding in bike baskets, to reading books in forts, to camping under the stars - these Action Dolls are meant to be life’s companions. But our Action Dolls also bring change to the toy market by breaking down stereotypes and adding diversity. They give kids more choice in their play. Kids deserve to have toys as diverse as the world they live in. Our approach to Action Dolls has been to promote gender equality through our product and our message. Our Equality Campaign features photos of kids just being kids - having good old-fashioned unrestricted fun with no stereotypes to hold them back. Our positive messaging encourages all kids to interact on a human level and develop those vital relationship and nurturing skills that dolls so importantly teach. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Dolls For All How did you come up with the idea for this product? The idea of Boy Story started while Kristen was pregnant with her second son in the summer of 2014. She wanted to buy a boy doll for her older son to help him get used to the idea of being a big brother and to have a companion to play with at times when mommy was busy taking care of the baby. But when she went to buy a boy doll, she was shocked at the market. Most dolls were either girls or baby dolls. There were no cool boy dolls out there. That was the beginning of the idea. But Kristen was working full time as a lawyer overseas, and there was no way she could start a business. That’s where Katie came in. Katie was so excited at the idea that she decided to risk it all by quitting her own job and working to get things started. With tons of strong will and determination, even without any prior business management experience, Katie relied on the guidance of Kristen and started up the company. We are now both working full time with Boy Story to make great products and a great company. What makes your product special? Our Action Dolls are a combination of poseable action figures and lovable 18" dolls. There are tons of nice girl dolls available for kids, but very few cool boy dolls. Our dolls' unique features were meticulously designed by us personally to celebrate diversity and introduce some boy dolls to the market. The clothing is modern and fresh, and the dolls have a look and feel that reflect their high quality. Our Action Dolls make kids, including boys, feel comfortable playing with dolls and give all kids a fun platform to develop important skills such as nurture and empathy. What has been the best part of your startup experience? One of the most amazing moments we have had in starting up Boy Story was when we actually received the completed prototypes of our dolls. It was one of those “dream come true” moments where an idea turned into something real. And the absolute best is when we see kids light up when they test out our Action Dolls. Kids are just amazing in their honesty and pure love for play. As soon as they get their hands on the dolls, adventures begin. And that makes our hearts so, so big.

Our goal is to provide a growing variety of building blocks over time, both in hardware and software, so kids (and adults!) can learn and have fun. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Build, Program, Play How did you come up with the idea for this product? At the robotics lab at UC Berkeley, we were working on designing robots after real creatures. Kamigami are really unique in the way they move, and it's part of why they are so fast and dynamic; the base is actually a robotic simulation of how bugs move! We kept hearing again and again that there was a market for this, people were delighted by how they looked. But we didn't just want to make a pretty toy, we wanted to make a smart toy. We felt the design could be a cool entry point for people who are interested in robotics and hardware, and the programming interface is a great entry point into coding. We loved the idea of making robotics accessible to more people, especially kids. What makes your product special? The design and the option to program your own games. We wanted to build a toy that fostered nonlinear play. Toys should channel imagination, not replace it. There are a lot of video games and things out there that can do this, but we wanted to bring it into the real world. Kids design games in their heads all the time, this is about channeling those ideas into physical form and seeing them come to life before your eyes. Robotics is a great avenue for that. We wanted to do more than just have people sit there and drive a cool robot. This is about being engaged and interacting. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Watching what a kick people get out of this. When we see kids' faces light up because they realize they have just built a robot with their own hands, it's pretty motivating. We've also heard it's a great parent-child project, and that's great to think about as well. More than anything we've been really grateful for the support. We are so happy watching how much fun people have with these guys.

143`Product Description The Solar Shower of the Future is Here! Imagine enjoying the comfort of hot pressurized water on your motorized travels. Road Shower is like adding plumbing to your vehicle rack. With the Road Shower you can have instant and easy access to pressurized water wherever you go without the hassle of propane, pumps, or long set up times. Hot or cold, the Road Shower has many uses: from the camp hose for dishes, a pressurized jet to rinse off dirty gear, a gentle spray for the pets, or for extra drinking water. From the Manufacturer Enjoy a hot pressurized shower at your car. Road Shower can be adjusted for a nice gentle spray that is perfect for an afternoon shower. Pull the trigger harder and get plenty of pressure to get out the shampoo quickly. Road Shower uses the renewable energy of the sun. The sun heats the black surface on the outside which heats the water on the inside. The water temperature rises 12-20 degrees per hour on a warm sunny day. The Road Shower works well using gravity for washing hands or cleaning spills. However you can add pressure to it by pumping it with a hand pump, a CO2 cartridge pump, a tire inflator or a compressor. When pressurized, you can squirt a jet of water up to 60 feet. Clean off your dirty gear. Great for surfing or beach use. Get that sand off of your feet and your boards before putting them back in the vehicle. You can have a high pressure jet of water. Road Shower has enough pressure to get the job done, whether it is rinsing your kayak, or washing your hair. Pressurize it Easily High Pressure: Can be pumped with a bike pump, tire inflator, or a compressor up to 20 PSI. Proven Pressure Relief System Safe: A pressure relief system is built in for safety. It is a radiator cap which have been used for decades to prevent over pressurized radiators from exploding. Simple and Reliable Rack Mounting System Road Shower is rugged and has been used on 4x4 roads all over the US. It is simple to attach to most rack systems.Can be mounted to: VW Vanagons, Westfalia Vans, Sportsmobile Vans, Campers, MacGregor 26 sailboat, Vehicle factory racks, A cabin, Kayak rack, Bike rack, Luggage Rack, Yakima, and Thule Racks. Provide an easy to use shower and cleaning system for use from a vehicle. We have continued to improve the rack mounted solar shower through our own use and the feedback of our customers. Our mission is to continue to improve our product and add more products in the future by carefully listening to our customers. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Rack Mounted Shower How did you come up with the idea for this product? The 120 mile White Rim Trail in Utah’s Canyon lands inspired the creation of Road Shower. On the White Rim trail, which is a vehicle supported mountain bike ride, we would ride into camp, dusty, dirty, and sweaty. We would fill up a solar shower, the plastic bag kind, and try to find a convenient place to hang it. This is not easy in the desert with few trees. Then, since it was already getting late, we would take a cold shower, since there was not enough time to heat the water. The year before we tried tying the solar showers to the top of our cars, but you can imagine, they didn't last long up there, and we lost one, and one got punctured. Even when you have it tied up somewhere, the pressure isn’t very good, and the nozzle is hard to work with soapy hands. Also filling them up by yourself is not easy. So in 2007, I set out to make a better solar shower that heats up while you drive. I came up with a rack mounted pressurized solar shower. You mount it on your car rack. It is as sturdy as mounting a bike rack. What makes your product special? There are actually plenty of products you can buy to shower on the trail. You probably have seen the options. The solar shower bag is the ubiquitous, affordable route. It’s cheap, compact, and fairly foolproof…when the forecast will heat water. Then there are the heated, pressurized options. They’re a lot more diverse, and range from complex under-the-hood, permanently plumbed systems to hand-operated pressurized stovetop cylinders to powered pump systems with adjustable heat settings. Unfortunately, many such systems have gone overboard on complexity (or have not gone far enough to produce a foolproof set up). That’s the way a lot of invention works; simple, elegant ideas with a few flaws are picked up by a marketplace of “improvers”. Before you know it, that simple idea has morphed into complex niche-oriented derivations. That’s the product failure that Joel Cotton tackled when he created the Road Shower. Cotton is a Coloradan who, in 2007, began translating his frustrations and ideas into a series of ABS prototypes that bridged the gap when it came to heating wash water on the trail. The Kickstarter-funded Road Shower retains the simple, sun-heated concept of a shower bag but adds the durability, increased capacity and fixed convenience of a rack-mounted, 5-gallon capacity aluminum cylinder as its container. The second key difference is the unit’s approach to flow, a novel pressurizing system already elevated by its mounting. Cotton, an avid cyclist, realized that simple bike pumps could quickly add the psi that other systems lacked (or weakly tried to add through hand pump systems; e.g., Zodi systems). And that’s just one area of core simplicity that the Road Shower attempts to harness. The other—the beauty and power of a solar-powered system—means it’s most ready to use when you’re most ready for it. Meaning the sun has done its job on the water, and it’s done it on you. When the sun is relatively abundant and air temp is reasonable, that all works out perfectly, since your workout or drive is done about the time the water is also done (heating, that is). As you rack your mountain bike or finish setting up camp the Road Shower is ready to provide the clean up. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Seeing people love the product and share it with their friends on Facebook, Instagram, etc. It has also been great to see people discover uses and applications for Road Shower that we did not imagine. It is now very popular on Westy camper vans, and all kinds of vintage trailers. We get calls from around the world, as the idea keep spreading.

267`Product Description The year is 1123. A new count has arrived to oversee the surrounding countryside. As word spreads, people have begun to flock to the settlement. The time is right for Blankenburg to expand into a flourishing town. In Builders of Blankenburg, you are one of many people working to build up the town and earn prestige in the eyes of the count. Prestige is earned by building structures throughout the town, but to do so you’ll need enough silver to purchase the proper resources with which to build. Pay attention to the citizens of the growing town. If you build what they’re looking for, you’ll have a steady stream of income. Builders of Blankenburg introduces the novel citizen track, an ever increasing populace who seek different places to live and work, while also serving to determine the length of the game. But beware, new events and visitors each turn can disrupt your best laid plans. Make your imprint on Blankenburg to become its most prestigious builder and earn the key to the town! From the Manufacturer Unique City Building Strategy Game Builders of Blankenburg adds a new twist to city building strategy. The citizen track requires you to think not just about what you’re building, but who you’re building it for. You must heed the citizen’s requests in order to generate income that allows you to continue building. New citizens arrive each turn providing more income potential, but also hastening the end of the game, which occurs when the town is full or either structures or citizens. Family Friendly, Intuitive Rules The best games are those we can play with both our gamer friends and our family. Though deeper strategies are possible as you play more, the intuitive rules allow casual gamers and children to enjoy Builders of Blankenburg as well. Each turn consists of four phases: Bidding, Building, Income, and the Marketplace. This logical progression of gaining resources, using them to build, then earning income from what you built, makes sense and is easy for all types of players to learn. Interactive Bidding Every turn of Builders of Blankenburg features a simultaneous bid for resources. This allows an opportunity to try and claim the most in demand resources, or to prevent opponents from gaining what they need. Wise bidding will help you save your silver and every coin counts later in the game. Critical Acclaim Builders of Blankenburg has generated excellent reviews from both professionals and the gaming community. Board Game Quest compared it to a fine vintage of wine, noting that it is "a game that breathes new life into the building-construction euro-style with its distinctive gameplay." Area Control There are four different districts in which to construct in Builders of Blankenburg. Each district can accommodate different structures and each is limited in size. A tight game can be decided not only by what you build, but by where you build it. A Board Game for Everyone Cobblestone Games is all about bringing people together through board gaming. Builders of Blankenburg draws you in with its beauty, captures you with its simplicity, and brings you back for more with the depth of strategy available. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Bidding and building How did you come up with the idea for this product? Most city building games seem to focus on the buildings and how they interact, but never pay any heed to who actually stays there. I had an idea for a game where success would require paying attention to the populace as you build your city. Nothing prevents you from building structures nobody is asking for, but doing so will impact you income, just like in real life. What makes your product special? I love games that can be played by the whole family, yet still offer enough strategy for gamers to enjoy them as well. Builders of Blankenburg lands in that sweet spot. During the play testing in development, I actually started with my wife and daughter, later expanding play testers to include other casual gamers and blind play testing with gamers at local shops. The end result is a board game that appeals to everyone. What has been the best part of your startup experience? My favorite part of being a startup is when the first feedback from Kickstarter started rolling in. These are people who don’t know me or owe me anything, and have anonymity, but they came out on their own saying great things about how they enjoyed the game so much. It makes it all worthwhile.
231`You know what's sucky about regular charades? Maybe it's the clues, the bored looks, the silence, all while your pals wonder, "Why are we friends with Mark again?" Well, no more sad sackness for you, Mark. Because now there is God Hates Charades, the acting and guessing party game that plays in thirty minutes and is so full of pop culture and awfulness that it makes Lucifer himself blush.
349`Product Description AnyMote Home turns your phone or tablet into the hub of your home control, allowing you to connect to all your InfraRed, WiFi or Smart Home devices and control them from a unified dashboard. Say goodbye to launching one app for each of your devices, or picking up one remote for each of your TV, Set Top Box, Xbox, connected lights & many others! From the Manufacturer $151,436 raised with 1,692 backers. All your devices. One dashboard. Always free to make your own UI or use our predefined templates, you'll truly be in control of all your devices with a single tap. Through ingenious use of 2016 technology and features, you can now control everything without even having to unlock your phone or look at the screen. With gestures as simple as you want them to be, buttons as large or colorful as you want them and remotes as simple or complex as you like them, AnyMote Home gives you back the power to personalize everything. Your voice: with great power comes great responsibility It's never been easier to control everything: AnyMote Home integrates with Amazon Echo for full home control through your voice. Did you enjoy asking Alexa about the weather or asking her to turn on your lights? Now she can also turn on your TV, switch to your favorite channel, control your Set Top Box, Apple TV, Roku, etc.. Thanks to our proactive integration approach, even your devices that will never get Alexa integration directly can be controlled now through your voice. Love your Sonos? So do we, so we went ahead and made it voice-enabled through Alexa. It also works seamlessly with all your lights, TV, plugs, media players, and many others! Smart Rules. We invented them. In 2012 we brought 'Mute on Call' to people's phones, and everyone loved it. In 2014 we made it available for 99% of home devices. Now, we're bringing this feature to ALL your connected electronics: Speakers, TVs, DVD Players, Media Players, etc. One command sets the scene You haven't seen true home control power until you've seen AnyMote's Macro features. A single command can trigger a chain of events that unify the things around you like never before. Your TV, Apple TV, A/C, Nest, WeMo, Philips Hue and others are no longer single selfish devices, but now work together for you. Your phone has the smarts. Use them. Your phone already knows when you are home, when you go to sleep, when you're gaming or just browsing. Turn all these into triggers that make your devices work for you, without even having to interact with them. Since no “cloud” is involved, everything works instantly and offline! Your devices don't work together, but they all work with AnyMote AnyMote's goal is to make it easier for you to control your devices with the AnyMote app than it is with the official apps or plastic remotes, and everything it does works towards that goal. Before AnyMote Home, even with the world's most harmonious universal remote you had to reach for a few other apps or remotes to interact with your devices. Never again. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Control. Everything. Easier. How did you come up with the idea for this product? Everybody loves smart homes, and we probably love them more than most. However, the smarter your home gets, the more you have to put in to make it work for you rather than alongside you. Since InfraRed devices don't look like they're going away anytime soon, we thought it was unfair to have all this new and old tech stay in the way of full home control. Nobody else was working on something to solve this problem, and that is how the first version of AnyMote was born. What makes your product special? Most importantly, with AnyMote you can truly control both your InfraRed and WiFi devices like they were all built by the same manufacturer. Users should not care about who made the device, what technology it uses, or what protocols it supports. And then there's the customization: do you want your buttons to be bigger? No problem! Does grandma want the Food Channel button to be big and red? No problem. Voice commands? Alexa handles it for you. There's almost nothing you can't change to your liking. What has been the best part of your startup experience? AnyMote has grown along with its users' needs, and that made it cater to ranges of people we never imagined. It was absolutely amazing for us to find out that it's used by one of the first astronauts to go around the moon, by grandmas and nephews alike, by bar owners and smart home lovers, and even by disabled people. There's nothing better than seeing that in a small, often non-obvious way, you're improving someone's life.

Sideclick offers a simple and affordable all-in-one solution to juggling multiple remotes or using expensive and over-complicated universal remotes. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Simple Streaming Solution How did you come up with the idea for this product? Having grown frustrated at the price of our monthly cable bill, our family became cordcutters. We started researching streaming devices and decided on a Roku device. We loved the simplicity of the remote but hated how we were always searching for a different remote to power ON/OFF the TV and a third remote to control the volume on our Sound Bar. Brett, a mechanical engineer and product designer, sketched the idea for Sideclick and used at 3D printer to create the first prototype. Given the positive feedback we received from family and friends and the overall trend in streaming device sales, we decided to launch a Kickstarter campaign to gage interest. We loved the collaborative atmosphere that crowdfunding provided and with the help of over 2,600 Backers, Sideclick became a reality. What makes your product special? Sideclick offers a simple and affordable all-in-one solution to juggling multiple remotes or using expensive and over-complicated universal remotes. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of our startup experience is the collaborative atmosphere and general support we received from our backers. Their patience with design delays and all of the positive feedback we received once the product was delivered made all of the challenges of product development worthwhile. Another best part of our startup experience is the feeling that we are living the American dream. We have created something together as a family that solves a basic problem. Despite the many many challenges we have faced, we continue to proceed as if success is inevitable. Our family, friends, and backers have allowed us to retain the optimism required in creating a new business.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Premium. Wireless. Receiver How did you come up with the idea for this product? There’s been a revolution in the way people access music today. The advent of smart devices (Smartphones, Tablets, Mac, PC etc.), music streaming services (Spotify, Pandora etc.) and digital music files (Mp3, Flac etc.) has made it more convenient to access limitless library of music anywhere we go. Left behind in this transformation are the traditional Hi-Fi audio systems, legacy stereo receivers and music docks that can be found in virtually every home. Even though the traditional audio systems deliver far superior sound quality, they don’t allow access to the full range of music streaming options. The audio quality of most wireless products isn't very inspiring and their limited range can be frustrating. We at Auris wanted to find a way of having it all – convenience and fidelity. It is from this inspiration that bluMe was born. What makes your product special? bluMe features all the good stuff that's important for a wireless product to be of any real use. Overall ease of setup, aptX low latency coding, stunning audio quality, lack of dropouts and high interference tolerance are features that make our system better than most Bluetooth receivers currently on the market. bluMe features higher signal-to-noise ratio due to the inclusion of a 24-bit high-performance DAC. Most Bluetooth implementations have very limited range, usually within just one room. With careful signal management circuitry and antenna tuning, bluMe presents a superior solution that will reach more than one room with no degradation in audio quality. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best experience so far has been receiving so many positive comments from happy customers! Our creations are a part of our commitment to our consumers and we strive and work on to diligently improve upon their experiences and much more.|

I want to sincerely express my appreciation to you and the hobby that has changed my life - board games! Is it weird to say that? Perhaps. But through all the friends I have met, all the colleagues I have connected with, all the strain my brain has endured at game night, and all the good times it all has brought, I feel that it has changed my life in a very positive way.

I am fortunate that the Meepillow struck such a chord with the board game community. I had the right idea, at the right time (in an exploding hobby), and the right resources (such as Kickstarter) to execute.

What has been the best part of your startup experience? Building a company from the ground up with the help of Kickstarter truly was a dream come true. I would not be here doing what I love if it wasn't for all the people that helped me bring them what they love.

Back then we were a group of geeks who enjoyed staying at home doing our own stuff. Going outside to eat was kind of torture in winter. Then one crazy idea came out: why not make some flying bot to pick up the ordered food? That’s where we entered the “drone” field. But big ones were quite expensive regarding the cost so it turned out to be the small kit copter we have right now. But it’s cute, is’t it? So why 3D printing? Good question. ""Design, Make and Share"" is our slogan. We believe that digital fabrication will eventually revolution the future manufacturing and 3D printing will be the leading tech. By 3D printing, Flexbot looks can be changed by users because they can download to print or design their own customized frames. Participation from user is important for us. Sharing is where the fun comes from and it’s where the product lies. What makes your product special? It is among the first 3D printed copters in the world. Flexbot comes as a kit with all the components unassembled so that we can get our hands on the parts and have fun.

Just come and enjoy the happiness of designing, making and sharing. What has been the best part of your startup experience? What's life without whimsy?

OmieBox makes you a lunch packing Hero Moms and dad make, on average, 180 lunches per child each year. These super parents are on a mission to pack a variety of nutritious lunches. And it’s no easy task. They worry about preservatives, sugar content, hitting the four basic food groups, not to mention the persnickety whims of their children. They even go so far as trying to make lunch fun. But much to their dismay these carefully crafted lunches come back uneaten or as a big heap of unidentifiable leftovers. Warm, unwrapped cheese sticks. Half-eaten mushy sandwiches. Squished strawberries that have drained into their child’s back pack. There’s nothing simple about a child’s lunch. Which is exactly why we designed a bento lunch box that protects all of that hard work and love that mom and dad put in. A bento lunch box designed to keep all food items separate and leak free. A dual insulation system that keeps the hot foods hot and cold foods cold. An integrated thermos food jar that is shallow and wide, perfect for little hands.

So that when your child opens their lunch, it’s exactly what you intended it to be, a fun, healthy lunch made with love and care About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Healthy School Lunches How did you come up with the idea for this product? When my son started preschool, I was on a mission to pack healthy and delicious lunches for him. But no matter what I packed, he just didn’t eat his lunch. Day after day, he hardly ate anything, and I was worried sick that he wasn’t getting the nutrients he needed. What I realized was that making a great lunch is only half the equation. Lunches have to taste good and look good for kids to want to eat it. What makes your product special? We've re-imagined the lunchbox to make lunchtime healthier and easier for kids and parents. Parents pack about 180 lunches a year per child - that's a lot of lunches! It's easy to fall into a lunch rut and that's where OmieBox comes in - the built-in insulated bowl and the versatile design makes it easy to send a wide variety of yummy, nutritious lunches. What kids eat at lunch matters for their health and well-being, and OmieBox wants to simplify the process as much as possible for parents. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Making a meaningful difference in people's lives. Theres nothing more rewarding than receiving emails from happy parents telling us that their kids are eating more & eating healthier at school.

It attaches easily to dashboard trim and can be removed easily. Mounts your smartphone in seconds with one hand. We approached the mounting of a device from a new innovative angle. Instead of relying on mechanical arms that spread with gears and springs, we took a much simpler approach using the natural laws of physics and utilized the simple weight of the phone. This makes it much faster to operate, leaving any completion behind. In addition we focused on the flat smooth surface of the glass screen to stabilize the device. Something that has never been done before. Various types of installations 3/4"x3" flat area on the dash trim is required to mount. Please identify this area on your vehicle prior to ordering.

Game-changing smartphone mount How did you come up with the idea for this product? Out of frustration of my phone on my seat, I went to my local store and all I could find was archaic mounts that where unstable and time consuming to attach my phone. I used it for about a week and said to myself, there has got to be a better way! That's when I looked around at my dashboard for the optimal place to mount my phone. When I identified where I wanted it, I then came up with the unique way to attach the phone (in my mind of course). I then formed my first prototype out of heat activated mold-able plastic and mounted in my car. It work as planned. I then went on my computer and designed a more aesthetically pleasing version. After about 300 3D printed prototypes, which took about 3hrs each. The final working design was complete. What makes your product special? It is so simple and fast to use. There is nothing on the market you can secure you phone in seconds. No moving parts. Low profile. What has been the best part of your startup experience? When we launched on Kickstarter we had nothing but positive and encouraging support. The most rewarding experience as an inventor, is when people want your invention!

The first 3Doodler was a clumsy-looking, hand-assembled, device, with the words “3Doodler” etched onto its side in green and red in felt tip pen. The 3Doodler Start was a natural progression for us, creating a kid-safe and friendly device specifically for young creators! What makes your product special? The 3Doodler Start was specifically designed for young creators who love to express themselves through the things they make. The 3Doodler Start is also the first 3D printing pen on the market to be truly kid-safe and friendly. There are no hot parts! Designed to be as simple to use as possible, kids can can pick up the 3Doodler Start and get creating within minutes. The 3Doodler Start works wirelessly for up to an hour, and can also be used with a range of 3Doodler accessories, including our themed DoodleBlocksTM - simple templates for super Doodles! What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part has been building a vibrant and creative community! Starting with our first Kickstarter campaign, we have always put community front and center. Hundreds of thousands of units later, it's thrilling to see what our community has been doing with the 3Doodler, and how they have shared with and inspired each other (and us!). Their creations are all over social media sites and on our website, and extend from craft and design, through to innovative hacks and fixes, and into a never ending array of educational uses. With 3Doodler Start, that creativity and community will now embrace a whole new generation!

From the Manufacturer What is a meeple, anyway? A "meeple" is a little wooden (or plastic) pawn used in modern day board gaming to represent a player. It originated in the wonderful tile-placement game Carcassonne. "Meeple" is believed to be a combination of the words "my" and "people." Since then, meeples have been used in countless other board games and have become the unofficial symbol of modern day board gaming. Today, meeples are not only used to represent people (players), but animals, creatures, monsters, and much, much more. Perfect For The Following Situations! Deck Building: Quite the building partner when it comes to deck building situations such as building a backyard deck, building a rooftop deck, and playing Dominion. Worker Placement: Fantastic for taking your spot in worker placement life activities such as boring meetings, house chores and errands, and playing games like Agricola. Pick Up & Deliver: Perfect to assist you in pick-up-and deliver situations such as delivering pizzas to hungry gamers, rushing to the hospital to have a baby, and playing games like Merchant of Venus. Tile Placement Activities: Excellent for accompanying you in a variety of tile-placement life activities such as installing a new bathroom wall, laying a new kitchen floor, and playing games like Carcassonne. Spin & Move: A wonderful companion to spin and move on the dance floor, on the football field, or in classic games like Twister. Incredibly Soft & Huggable Plush Pillow! The Meepillow is made with premium fabric and stuffing. It is the perfect shape and texture to decorate your home with. You won't believe how soft it is until you actually have one!

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Gaming Home Decor How did you come up with the idea for this product? I want to sincerely express my appreciation to you and the hobby that has changed my life - board games! Is it weird to say that? Perhaps. But through all the friends I have met, all the colleagues I have connected with, all the strain my brain has endured at game night, and all the good times it all has brought, I feel that it has changed my life in a very positive way. So, I finally decided to create my own board game related project. I not only started my company Top Shelf Fun through my innate desire to be a part of this great hobby, but to bring something different to the tabletop/sofa! What makes your product special? I am fortunate that the Meepillow struck such a chord with the board game community. I had the right idea, at the right time (in an exploding hobby), and the right resources (such as Kickstarter) to execute. The board game market is thriving and there is a large black hole of gaming decor, so I was incredibly fortunate to see that. I can't wait to see what else people come up with! What has been the best part of your startup experience? Building a company from the ground up with the help of Kickstarter truly was a dream come true. I would not be here doing what I love if it wasn't for all the people that helped me bring them what they love. The board gaming community is the most supportive and knowledgeable group of people I've ever come to know. With their help I can accomplish anything. Stop by your friendly local game store today to see for yourself what this wonderful hobby has to offer!

359`Product Description 3D Sound One headphones are much more than your classical audio headphones. Get immersed in sound unlike anything you have experienced before. Release the tone that is trapped in your head and let it embrace your surroundings. The spatial simulation of sound and the use of motion sensors produce an experience with unprecedented realism. Lose yourself into a multitude of surrounding sound sources adapting to the least of your movements. You’re totally immersed in your activity (video games, movies). Dive into the audio scene. From the Manufacturer $125171 raised with 589 backers. 3D Audio with Head Tracking : the most realistic experience Our patented 3D Audio technology let you experience multichannel surround sound content (5.1, 7.1) over headphones with unprecedented precision, as well as full 3D audio. Sound comes from everywhere around you and dialogues are clearer! 3D Sound ONE embeds a low latency and very accurate head tracking module for the most immersive and realistic experience. The 9 axis motion tracker captures tiny and large head movements (which are both very important for the auditor to « feel » where the sound comes from). It reproduces the sound sources in space in a virtual sound environment. The sense of wearing headphones disappears! Multichannel Audio Drivers and Mobile Media Player 3D Sound Labs Virtual Home Theater audio drivers for 3D Sound ONE are available for download from our website. They provide immersive surround sound, Digital Equalisation, and Virtual Room Acoustics to all applications with multichannel audio (5.1/7.1) outputs.

Comfortable and Convenient 3D Sound Labs headphones have been designed to be extremely comfortable to wear, a priority when playing games or watching movies. They are very light and have large “over the ear” cups with high-end foam paddings providing both strong noise isolation and comfort. They can be folded and stored in an elegant and robust casing for easy portability. Don’t leave your house without bringing your home theater! About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Innovative, Mobile, Comfortable How did you come up with the idea for this product? Xavier was working on new 3D sound formats. We quickly made the observation that the problem would not be to encode the sound in 3D but play it back. Today, when one thinks 3D sound, it is a home theater with many speakers. With new formats coming up, it means even more speakers and will become very cumbersome, expensive and definitely not mobile. We believe headphones are the best way to render audio in 3D. What makes your product special? The 3D Sound One headphones are not conventional stereo headphones but they reproduce sound in 3D. They are connected to an application that virtualizes speakers in space. For better realism, motion sensors send in real-time the position of the listener's head to be able to compensate the movements: the sound stays where it’s supposed to be, relative to the stage that the listener is currently viewing and listening. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part was when we hold the final product for the first time. It feels like meeting a newborn baby ;) The most challenging was to go from a concept to an indistrialised product in such a short time frame, when many competencies need to work together toward the same goal.

Essential, Fresh, Simple Where did you get the inspiration for your product? The original idea behind GIR was to take a fresh, simple approach to product design in general. We wanted to start by perfecting a single product - the Ultimate Spatula - and then expand into other product categories that deserved a double-take: cycling gear, bar tools, apparel, you name it. It seems like we’ve hit on on something big in the kitchen - our fans respond to fun, smart innovations that disrupt the status quo in an otherwise saturated marketplace. What differentiates your product from similar products out there? We’re not interested in gadgets for gadgets' sake. GIR is about products that take something that's always been "good enough," turn it on its head, and make a statement with a new design that not only solves a problem (big or small, obvious or sneaky) but makes everyone happy at the same time. That's the universe we’re exploring. Tell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process. The original GIR Spatula was born in 2012. After thousands of hours in the kitchen using two-piece spatulas and similar utensils that just didn't cut it, we decided to create a category-killing tools that solved the problem for good. One Kickstarter campaign and hundreds of rave reviews later, we're keeping the faith by staying true to the Get It Right mission.
315`Color:Perforated Black/Black Colorway Product Description After losing my bulky wallet and realizing I didn’t need most of what I was carrying around, I developed a wallet featuring Micro-Suction technology that can be attached to any smooth, flat surface. Named after my hometown in Illinois, the Rockford Wallet can be used as a traditional wallet by attaching an ID card on the Micro-Suction side OR a phone wallet by simply pressing the Micro-Suction side to the back of most smartphones. The Micro-Suction technology allows the product to be removed and replaced without losing suction and will never damage or leave a residue on the surface. Made up of millions of microscopic suction cups, Micro-Suction uses atmospheric pressure to suction the target surface, NOT AN ADHESIVE. Just use a damp cloth if it becomes dirty and it will suction like new. It works on any smooth/flat/non-porous surface including glass, plastic, and metal and feels like Velcro for smooth surfaces. Why be limited to just a wallet? Why not have the option to attach it to your phone or simply use as the ultimate minimalist wallet. From the Manufacturer Use #1 Attach to Smartphone with or w/o a case. The Rockford Wallet attaches to most smartphones & can hold up to 4 cards & 10 US bills folded in half. You only need a smooth, flat, nonporous surface and the Micro-Suction will attach like Velcro for glass-like surfaces. The Micro-Suction allows the user to remove and reattach over and over without having to commit like most 3M backed phone wallets. Will never damage or leave a residue on the target surface. You’re never committed to any one phone or case. Remove and reattach as many times as needed! Stop buying a new wallet case every time you get a new model phone or case. Use #2 Minimalist Wallet When not attached to anything the Rockford Wallet can hold up to 4 cards in the pocket, 10 US bills folded in half, PLUS present an ID on the Micro-Suction side. Stop wasting time trying to pull out your ID from behind that cheap plastic window. With the Rockford wallet, there is no need to remove your ID from your wallet because there isn't anything covering the ID like most wallets. This is truly the only multi-functional wallet on the market today! Multi Function Attach to a phone or remove and use as a stand-alone wallet. Can be reapplied over and over- indefinitely. feat. Micro-Suction Technology Micro-Suction is acrylic foam that is made up of millions of microscopic suction cups, collectively creating a very strong vacuum that attaches to any smooth/flat/non-porous surface. Best described as Velcro for glass-like surfaces. When dirty just clean with water and will attach like new! Handmade in USA We are VERY proud to say all products & packaging are sourced and hand-assembled in the USA. We design & create products that simplify your life.

Excellence is oxygen. We put people first in EVERYTHING we do, we understand you are the only reason we exist. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Rethink your wallet. How did you come up with the idea for this product? A few years back I lost my wallet and spent months remembering/replacing everything. I wasn't going to let that happen again, so after looking for a nice wallet I could attach to my phone I only saw permanent solutions with 3M backing. There had to be a better solution... After weeks of testing and development I realized Micro-Suction was the best solution to back my wallet. When you want to keep everything together you can attach it to your phone. If you just want a wallet it can be that too, just peel off and you can attach an ID to the Micro-Suction making it a super slim minimalist wallet. The Rockford wallet has become the ONLY multi-functional wallet on the market. What makes your product special? Every wallet is handmade by the founder/creator Joshua Stebbins. EVERY product we ship exceeds our high standards of quality and is backed with a Limited Lifetime Warranty. If you have any feedback or issues we make it our mission to make it right.

What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of my startup experience has been working so closely with our customers & the constructive feedback we receive. There have been three major design upgrades that have come from user feedback. Because we design & manufacture in-house, the turnaround time to engineer the solution, test, and ship is very minimal. TLTR: WE LOVE OUR CUSTOMERS!

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Fastest Charging Station How did you come up with the idea for this product? We wanted a fast charger that can charge everything in our homes. Almost all our family members had a Smartphone and most of our homes had a couple of tablets (some had iPads and other Android) and iPods. In total, we wanted a charger that has more than 6 USB ports and can charge almost any type of device. We started looking for a multi-port USB charger, but our search on Amazon and other places yielded chargers that had either limited USB ports or limited charging current. Also, these chargers were designed for particular brands like Apple, Samsung etc. and most of them were supporting optimal charging in an intelligent and brand independent way. This is where the idea of OctoFire came from. What makes your product special? OctoFire is industry's first octagonal (patented design) 8-port USB charger of its kind, which can supply fast charging current of 2.1 Amps per port. It is the only fan-less charger with highest rating of 16.8A / 84W that can charge 8 iPads simultaneously. OctoFire's unique design gives freedom from wire clutters and it smartly detects the connected devices to provide optimal charging current. What has been the best part of your startup experience? We have been creating unique products with our full focus towards benefiting the customers. During the initial journey of OctoFire idea to the product, we faced lots of challenges and beating these challenges was the best part of our experience. These challenges have always motivated us to work little more than what we could have done at that moment. We feel very product to make the OctoFire project a reality.

It's a genuine miracle that a comic this beautifully unique exists at all." - James Kochalka"Longstreth's deceptively simple drawings of this harsh world filled with axes, ropes, pulleys, and levers, a place where you must bend nature with your bare hands to survive, have a layered intricacy that looks like something that should be carved on a medieval cathedral. One of my favorite books to spend time with." - Jeff Smith"Alec Longstreth is the most generous and enthusiastic cartoonist I've ever met, and his work brims over with that same contagious energy.

Avid traveler and foodie Anish Sheth began his career as an international finance lawyer.

What differentiates your product from similar products out there? All natural, Nongmo, Unique flavor options Tell us about the best and most challenging parts of the creation process. The best part of creating our products was certainly all of the taste tasting that was involved. It was fun to look back at my travels and decide what types of flavors would complement the peas we had found. The most challenging part has been finding the best and cleanest ingredients possible. Knowing the origin of each ingredient and micro-ingredient has been important to us and it is sometimes difficult to find the perfect ingredient for a particular product.|

There is Nothing More PRECIOUS than Quality Time with Family and Friends When Ethan (10 years old) and I (just OLD!) set out to create Magicka Mayhem, our goal was simply to create a game that father and son would both enjoy equally. Magicka Mayhem is our effort to make that dream a reality – and from all the wonderful feedback we have received from our rapidly growing community, it looks like we have succeeded! Thank you to EVERYONE that contributed to make this game the best that it could possibly be! About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Funny Card Game How did you come up with the idea for this product? The Making of Magicka Mayhem by 10 year-old Ethan Erickson One day while my slightly immature gamer friend (AKA ‘dad’) and I were playing Magicka on the PC when the self-designated Family Prison Warden (i.e., mom) wagged her finger and said, “you two are much too addicted to your digital devices,” before returning her blood-shot eyes to her Facebook Timeline. ‘Dad’ said something like, “Seriously. When the Zombie Apocalypse happens, we’ll be more likely to die of BOREDOM than being eaten by Zombies.” And that’s when it hit me! We needed a way to play Magicka even if there was a power outage or the Zombie Apocalypse actually happened or mom banned our electronic devices or, worse, we had to go to grandma’s house where her idea of ‘advanced technology’ is a phone that doesn’t PLUG INTO THE WALL!!!!! That’s when I got to work on the game. The rest is Kickstarter history! THE END What makes your product special? We are a family of gamers. Unfortunately, we rarely come across a game that is just as much fun for the kids as it is for the grown-ups (i.e., the ones with the money!) – a rare exception being one of our family favorites, Munchkins by Steve Jackson. Magicka Mayhem was created with the ENTIRE FAMILY in mind – from the less game-savvy younger children to the grizzled ‘old farts’ looking for something a little more challenging. The final product is the perfect blending of youthful imagination (and a wee bit of potty humor!) and the efforts of many seasoned gamers (i.e., a TON of our amazing Kickstarter Backers!). We think you will LOVE this game as much as we do! What has been the best part of your startup experience? First off, our experience working with Paradox Interactive (the publisher of the PC versions of Magicka) and Arrowhead Studios (the original crafters of the Magicka universe) has been AMAZING! Their love and dedication and passion for our crazy idea has been incredibly inspiring to us both as gamers and as budding entrepreneurs. Without their support, NONE of this would have been possible. The best example of Paradox Interactive’s boundless support was when they invited Ethan to launch our Kickstarter on-stage with the CEO of Paradox Interactive, Frederik Wester, at GDC (the world’s largest game developer’s conference). As Ethan’s parents, my wife, Daley, and I were simply over-the-moon (and a bit scared!) to see our son in front of a huge crowd of press and streaming to thousands of people around the world. It is an experience that we (and Ethan) will NEVER forget!!! Also, our experience with Kickstarter and our SUPER INCREDIBLE AMAZING Backers has been phenomenal. Not only did nearly 1,000 people go out on a limb and Back our game with cold, hard cash, a great many of them also Backed the game with hours of their precious time (when they could have been playing other games!). Whether it was feedback about the artwork or suggestions for card layout or recommendations regarding the text or playtesting the game with their family and friends or actually helping us with some of the more daunting aspects of design, printing, shipping, etc., our wonderful Backers contributed as much to the amazing final product as Ethan and I did! Thank you, beautiful Backers! We hope you enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed MAKING IT FOR YOU!!! We must also say that working with the team at Amazon LaunchPad has also been a fantastimazing experience! As a father it is important for me to instill self-confidence, a strong work ethic and a need to contribute back to the world in our children. I personally feel that entrepreneurship is an amazing vehicle to develop all of these vital traits. I cannot imagine a more powerful set of tools in the hands of young people than Kickstarter and Amazon LaunchPad. It is truly a Brave New World!

That’s when I got to work on the game. The rest is Kickstarter history! THE END What makes your product special? We are a family of gamers. Unfortunately, we rarely come across a game that is just as much fun for the kids as it is for the grown-ups (i.e., the ones with the money!) – a rare exception being one of our family favorites, Munchkins by Steve Jackson. Magicka Mayhem was created with the ENTIRE FAMILY in mind – from the less game-savvy younger children to the grizzled ‘old farts’ looking for something a little more challenging. The final product is the perfect blending of youthful imagination (and a wee bit of potty humor!) and the efforts of many seasoned gamers (i.e., a TON of our amazing Kickstarter Backers!). We think you will LOVE this game as much as we do! What has been the best part of your startup experience? First off, our experience working with Paradox Interactive (the publisher of the PC versions of Magicka) and Arrowhead Studios (the original crafters of the Magicka universe) has been AMAZING! Their love and dedication and passion for our crazy idea has been incredibly inspiring to us both as gamers and as budding entrepreneurs. Without their support, NONE of this would have been possible. The best example of Paradox Interactive’s boundless support was when they invited Ethan to launch our Kickstarter on-stage with the CEO of Paradox Interactive, Frederik Wester, at GDC (the world’s largest game developer’s conference). As Ethan’s parents, my wife, Daley, and I were simply over-the-moon (and a bit scared!) to see our son in front of a huge crowd of press and streaming to thousands of people around the world. It is an experience that we (and Ethan) will NEVER forget!!! Also, our experience with Kickstarter and our SUPER INCREDIBLE AMAZING Backers has been phenomenal. Not only did nearly 1,000 people go out on a limb and Back our game with cold, hard cash, a great many of them also Backed the game with hours of their precious time (when they could have been playing other games!). Whether it was feedback about the artwork or suggestions for card layout or recommendations regarding the text or playtesting the game with their family and friends or actually helping us with some of the more daunting aspects of design, printing, shipping, etc., our wonderful Backers contributed as much to the amazing final product as Ethan and I did! Thank you, beautiful Backers! We hope you enjoy the game as much as we enjoyed MAKING IT FOR YOU!!! We must also say that working with the team at Amazon LaunchPad has also been a fantastimazing experience! As a father it is important for me to instill self-confidence, a strong work ethic and a need to contribute back to the world in our children. I personally feel that entrepreneurship is an amazing vehicle to develop all of these vital traits. I cannot imagine a more powerful set of tools in the hands of young people than Kickstarter and Amazon LaunchPad. It is truly a Brave New World!

You can rain fiery ouchies on your mortal enemies, protect yourself (or those luckiest enough to call you 'friend') using Elemental Shields or heal yourself (or your Wizards-in-arms) from injury.

You can rain fiery ouchies on your Wizard enemies, protect yourself (or those luckiest enough to call you 'friend') using Elemental Shields or heal yourself (or your Wizards-in-arms) from injury. And if you don’t like to get your hands dirty you can Summon Elementals to do your destructifying for you! WATCH OUT! Your Spell Could Get Mayhem-ified!!! After every Spell there is a chance that the target of your Spell will trigger a Mayhem Card draw. Mayhem Cards can cause your Spell to... Blow up in your face… Save your bum from disaster… or make you pee your pants with laughter. NOTE: Creators of Magicka Mayhem are not responsible for damage caused by peeing. ;-) Summon Powerful Creatures to Fight at your Side Summoning Elementals is the preferred method of destructification for lazy Wizards. Can you blame them? Why get your hands dirty when you don’t have to?!? Summoned Elementals include the strong and powerful Earth Elemental, the too-hot-to-handle Fire Elemental, the cold-as-ice Frigid Elemental or the guy with the 'electric' personality, Lightning 'Rob'! There is Nothing More PRECIOUS than Quality Time with Family and Friends When Ethan (10 years old) and I (just OLD!) set out to create Magicka Mayhem, our goal was simply to create a game that father and son would both enjoy equally. Magicka Mayhem is our effort to make that dream a reality – and from all the wonderful feedback we have received from our rapidly growing community, it looks like we have succeeded! Thank you to EVERYONE that contributed to make this game the best that it could possibly be! About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Funny Card Game How did you come up with the idea for this product? The Making of Magicka Mayhem by 10 year-old Ethan Erickson One day while my slightly immature gamer friend (AKA ‘dad’) and I were playing Magicka on the PC when the self-designated Family Prison Warden (i.e., mom) wagged her finger and said, “you two are much too addicted to your digital devices,” before returning her blood-shot eyes to her Facebook Timeline. ‘Dad’ said something like, “Seriously. When the Zombie Apocalypse happens, we’ll be more likely to die of BOREDOM than being eaten by Zombies.” And that’s when it hit me! We needed a way to play Magicka even if there was a power outage or the Zombie Apocalypse actually happened or mom banned our electronic devices or, worse, we had to go to grandma’s house where her idea of ‘advanced technology’ is a phone that doesn’t PLUG INTO THE WALL!!!!!

263`Product Description These innovative and elegant pot clips for spatulas and spoons and various other stirring utensils save them from the day to day tortures in the kitchen. They save your wooden spatulas from burning, prevent plastic ones from melting, and save metal ones from getting too hot, so you can be rest assured your precious utensils will stay protected for a long time. You just need to slide them on your utensil handles and clip them onto the rim of your cooking utensil. This way your spatulas, spoons, turners etc. stay thermally insulated from the hot pots and pans and save them from the intense heat. The clips are 100% food grade, made of FDA compliant silicone, and they are heat resistant up to 570F or 300C. No more worrying about leaving your spatulas unattended and find them burnt later on. The clips are thoughtfully designed keeping cleanliness in mind. Unlike other pot clips, there are no nooks and crannies where food can get stuck which can lead to mold over a period of time. Also, silicone, by nature is anti-microbial. These utensil clips are completely Dishwasher Safe. The utensil holder also prevents messy drips on the stove and countertop since it practically eliminates the need for a spoon rest and having to constantly take your spatulas back and forth between the stove and the spoon rest. This also saves that precious countertop space. Slide them onto serving spoons and prevent them from sliding into serving dishes or food. Clip them onto the cooking utensil rim and then put the lid on to keep it open just a little to prevent hot contents from boiling over. Each set contains various size clips to fit most utensil handles. Small clips can be used for spatulas with thinner handles and Large clips will mostly fit the thicker, rounder varieties. From the Manufacturer Common Cooking Woes Everyone knows how agonizing it is to hold that untouchably hot metal utensil handle, how frustrating it is to see that wooden handle with scorch marks and how ugly your melted plastic utensil handle looks because its been resting on the edge of the pan that has been on the stove for too long. Not to mention the melted plastic from spatula heads getting into your food! Also, does the spoon slipping into the serving dish sound familiar? How about those messy drips when you move your spoon from the pot to the spoon rest? Arghh.. Single Minimalist Solution Not only does the Snug prevent spatulas from getting too hot, it also stops serving spoons from sliding into food and keep that pot lid a little open to stop contents from boiling out. Use them for Spatulas Help spatulas from getting hot, melted or burnt. Use them on Serving Spoons Stop the spoons from sliding into food and making a mess. Use them for Lids Prevent hot contents from boiling out. Why the Snug is best suited for the job? The Snug is totally up to the job as it is made of FDA compliant, food-grade silicone, which is dishwasher safe and heat resistant up to 570F (or 300C), which is more than what you need for it to rest on your hot pots and pans. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Innovative, Must Have, Elegant How did you come up with the idea for this product? Everyone knows how agonizing it is to hold that untouchably hot metal utensil handle, how frustrating it is to see that wooden handle with scorch marks and how ugly your melted plastic utensil handle looks because its been resting on the edge of the hot pan. Being foodies, we spend a lot of time in the kitchen and we wanted to put an end to this ubiquitous problem. This is when we started drawing the picture of a simple yet elegant gadget in our mind, this one single solution, that will take care of all the above problems, and after many design iterations, the Snug was born. What makes your product special? The Snug is special because not only does it take care of many of the above problems; it has a very minimalist design. Very close attention was paid to ensure there are no nooks or crannies in the design where food might get stuck leading to molds. This also makes cleaning the Snugs a breeze. It is also 100% silicone and also does not use any metal or springs, so there is no risk of rust or scratching your precious pots and pans. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of our startup and Snug development experience has been the interaction with various users and customers including our Kickstarter campaign back in 2013. It is the most awesome feeling to get so much support, encouragement and positive reviews from all the Snug customers.

Tejas Shastry, Mike Geier, and Alex Smith met in a Northwestern University entrepreneurship class during their engineering PhDs. The trio wanted to solve a problem that most people experience — their smartphones and wearables run out of power at the worst time. As active urbanites, they explored the possibilities of capturing their own energy from daily activities to charge their smartphones, then engineered a solution to do just that: the AMPY MOVE motion-charger, a portable smartphone battery that charges from kinetic energy. The three entrepreneurs formed a start-up team of designers and engineers to fabricate AMPY MOVE prototypes at Northwestern’s Segal Design Institute. What makes your product special? Unlike other devices on the market, you are able to charge AMPY MOVE solely through motion. It doesn't have to be extensive motion either; keeping the device in your bag or purse will allow it to generate power. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Definitely customer enjoyment. When you are able to bring a product to the market that people actually use, that gives the whole team a lot of satisfaction.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Socks With Benefits How did you come up with the idea for this product? The inspiration for Lily Trotters came to our founder Susan in 2011 during a 17.5-hour airplane ride to Africa for a vacation with her BFF and their daughters. Normally when flying, Susan would need to get up frequently and move her legs around. Wearing an (ugly beige) compression sock for the first time, she never felt the need to get up once in 16 hours! For Susan it was life-changing. Why would she ever put something else on her legs again? When she returned home, she searched for compression socks that were effective, yet beautiful and fun. Much to her dismay, they did not exist…so Susan embarked on an arduous but rewarding journey to produce the first ever high-performance designer line of compression socks, specifically sourced and made in the USA for women everywhere. Lily Trotters was born! What makes your product special? Finally— a SEXY HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPRESSION sock for WOMEN. Built STRONG enough for a MARATHON or just another marathon day.

The absolute best part about starting Lily Trotters has been the overwhelming feedback we have received from product testers and customers. Having women write to us just to thank us for developing these socks and to tell us their personal stories has become part of our journey. To continually hear that our designs are loved and that our socks perform well is so gratifying. We are so happy to deliver a sock that helps women live better and to feel connected to a large and growing sisterhood.|

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Simplifies Ironing Completely How did you come up with the idea for this product? After spending hours ironing shirts for the week and fighting frustration with pesky collars, I knew there had to be a simpler way to flatten collars. I wanted a way to quickly spot treat a garment only where ironing was needed and without the need of an ironing board. The initial design focused on just ironing shirt collars, however, this quickly expanded to address other difficult locations to iron. The final design provided a small and simple solution that allowed for quick touch ups in the hard to reach areas, but could transform its wings for more detailed coverage when needed. What makes your product special? Collar Perfect provides a simple and compact ironing solution that provides quick touchups without the use of an ironing board. Whether you need a quick touch up for full garment care, ironing garments can be done quickly and easily. Collar Perfect also has six heat settings, 110v or 220v electrical support, rotating power cord, and adjustable wings for touch ups on the fly. What has been the best part of your startup experience? We wanted to create a device that was simple and quick to use, and but in a small and compact size. It was a real challenge, because creating the functionality to provide for quick touch ups and traditional ironing while supporting a wide range of heat settings was a difficult challenge. We managed to achieve that goal by allowing the wings to pivot and including a floating heating elements to provide maximum surface area coverage. This design allowed us to create a small and compact sized unit that made it simple and easy to use.

276`Product Description Made in the USA LucidBrakes are inertial BRAKE lights made originally for bicycles because bikes don't have brake lights - or if they do, it requires altering your bike in some way to get them to function. We invented a solution to both of these problems - creating the LucidBrake - the anywhere brake light! LucidBrake mounts to whatever you are riding or driving and because it uses *SmartBrake Technology, it just knows what to do without having to be hooked to anything. The award-winning LucidBrake uses the latest technology to detect motion, adjust to how it is mounted, and react appropriately. Think how insecure you are if you know the brake light on your car is out - you wouldn't drive a car without brake lights - so now you don't have to ride a bike without a brake light anymore. LucidBrakes: * are BRIGHT brake lights with 2 braking modes (emergency/flashing and normal/steady). * have 4 awareness beacon modes. * are motion-sensing brake lights. No wires or altering of the bike is necessary! * mount to anything metal or plastic. They simply press-on because they were designed with a flat back * are wires-free - deceleration-detecting brake lights. * have 8 BRIGHT LEDs arranged in the iconic octagon shape of a stop sign. * are waterproof - their circuit board is completely coated and the clip-on cover is to help direct the light. * turn off and on automatically - there is no on/off switch. * use 2 AAA batteries - rechargeable batteries work well too. ***Not included - recommend using rechargeable batteries. * are the most innovative, easy-to-use brake lights ever invented. Do you - or anyone you know - ride bicycles in groups or in traffic? GUARANTEED: LucidBrake is backed with a 1-year total satisfaction guarantee. AWARD WINNING: Named Invention of the year at the Davinci Institute Inventor's Showcase. * * * * * - I bought two of these brake lights before they were even finished being built. I live in Northern Ireland where the average rainfall is +/-50 inches a year. Visibility can really suck but these lights really do work!!! ~John/Northern Ireland * * * * * - I highly recommend the motion sensing Lucid light to any motorcycle rider who wants to be better seen by the driver behind him and give early warning to them of his brake application. My Lucid light has been operating perfectly for close to 2 years now. ~Barry/Texas From the Manufacturer LucidBrake's flat back allows mounting almost anywhere LucidBrake's 100% hands-free design lets you "set it and forget it" for maximum safety and efficiency. LucidBrake's advanced motion-sensing circuitry is at the core of its computerized operation, with no wiring at all, and not even an ON/OFF switch to remember. When you park, it sleeps. When you ride, it blinks. When you brake, it instantly lets other drivers and riders know, with red light bright enough to be seen at several thousand feet distance. It really is that simple and easy to use. You choose the blinking action, by rotating LucidBrake to one of four orientations as you press to attach it to your bike, backpack, or helmet. From bright blinking to slow blinking, or steady dim mode to no light at all while racing, these modes cover all known requirements for European standards and discerning bikers everywhere around the world. An advanced three-axis algorithm lets LucidBrake ignore most bumps and rotations to detect braking action, again with no wiring or connection to your braking system at all. As a result, LucidBrake recently won "Invention of the Year (2015)" at the DaVinci Institute Inventor Showcase in Colorado, in the heart of biking country. LucidBrakes can be used on many type of vehicles LucidBrakes have been engineered and fine tuned for use on bicycles, whether mounted on the bike, your backpack, or your helmet, but almost daily new uses are being discovered and reported to us. The flat back and unique Dual Lock connectors allow LucidBrakes to be mounted almost anywhere For example, a Segway dealer in Germany sent us a video showing a LucidBrake working exceedingly well, mounted on a Segway. Several motorcyclists report successful use of LucidBrakes on their bikes, although we don't suggest their use on motorized vehicles that normally by law are required to have wired brake lights. Add the LucidBrake to enhance your normal street-legal braking lights. LucidBrakes work very well on golf carts, especially when they are mounted up high along the back roof edges where they can be seen well. We are negotiating to provided more Lucidbrakes for golf carts in areas where there are large numbers of these. Note that most golf carts do not normally have brake lights. Long loads, such as ladders or lumber sticking out the tail end of a truck are a great place to put a Lucidbrake. The blinking helps other driver take notice, and when the brakes are put on, the light lets you know. Again, if there are laws about hanging flags or other warning devices, we recommend these laws are carefully followed, but a LucidBrake can add to the safety factor. Many other LucidBrake uses are coming to light on a daily basis, such as scooters, motorized wheelchairs, Ginnys (popular in Europe) and many other applications too numerous to mention. Have a creative use where an ultra easy-to-use brake light would enhance your safety? We'd love to hear about it. LucidBrakes are very bright - can be seen 1000s of feet away LucidBrake's eight(8) ultra-bright LEDs are 40 lumens bright during braking, for maximum attention-getting warning aimed at drivers and riders behind you. LucidBrake's unique faceted snap-on cover is designed to transmit some of this light in all directions, even forward, to help protect from side collisions too. LucidBrake's choice of four mounting orientations lets you set one of four bright blinking beacon modes that flash between braking events, so drivers and riders can see you while in motion as well as braking. A Segway dealer in Germany has found that LucidBrakes work great on these state-of-the-art devices, and other uses are being discovered almost daily. LucidBrake's primary design and tuning is targeted towards the hundreds of millions of bicycles around the Earth, but people are discovering they can be used a lot of other places as well. Supremely easy to install - just press it on There is zero wiring involved to install a LucidBrake. You simply attach your LucidBrake using the same Dual Lock connectors (invented by 3M) to install metal siding on buildings in Minnesota. Peel and press to install your LucidBrake on your bike, backpack, or helmet, install two AAA batteries (rechargeables work fine), and simply ride! There's not even an ON/OFF switch, because LucidBrake sleeps when you park, blinks when you ride, and flashes eight ultra-bright LEDs when you put on the brakes. Would you drive a car without brake lights? Of course not! So why in the world do we ride bicycles without brake lights? The answer lies in the complexity and low reliability of wiring lights to a bicycle's braking system. It just hasn't been worth the effort... until now! LucidBrakes are so easy to install and use that we've placed them on the ends of long loads, as a temporary replacement for tail and brake lights on trailers, along the top edges of golf carts, and many other unique places where safety is enhanced. Waterproof circuitry - even runs underwater! We designed the circuit board with no moving parts so that we could encase it in a clear coating that would protect it completely. The above picture is a LucidBrake submerged in a bowl of water. Where this is not the recommended use for the LucidBrake, we just wanted to demonstrate that it stays on and will work great even if it is in very adverse weather. We thought way outside the box to create LucidBrakes, and in the process we removed all complexity and provided great reliability to create a true brake light for your bicycle that's super easy to use, and super reliable too. The Dual Lock connectors are also waterproof and let you take your LucidBrake with you if you desire, or move it between bikes or locations with ease. Battery replacement is a breeze. Just remove the snap-on cover to access the non-corrosive, all-weather battery clips. En-"light"-ening the world for safety and fun LucidLights, LLC invented the LucidLight first, a single row of LEDs that you sweep from side to side to paint light on air. It is an amazing device and it has 64 possible 'modes'. One night, we programmed a brake light in one of those modes and realized how great a product a motion-sensing brake light could be and how many lives it could save. We spun off the LucidBrake product because we saw a need in the cycling community, not just for a brake light, but for a very bright beacon and brake light combined! Our products are all LED or light-based. The LucidBrake will save lives. More products coming from the LucidBrake family are on their way! We intend to keep manufacturing products that both entertain and serve a practical purpose - for 'safety and fun'! About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Wires-free Brake Light How did you come up with the idea for this product? The idea for LucidBrakes started at an outdoor music concert one warm summer evening. Several small gadgets based on LEDs were being sold, and it was fun to watch the colorful LEDs flashing throughout the crowd. During a burst of high energy music, a flash of insight and motivation surged through John, the inventor, leaving the thought that he could do something so much more impressive. In his vision he saw people waving LED sticks to paint messages and images in thin air and knew one day that vision would be real. After many weeks of tinkering and experimenting, LucidLights became a reality! This fun product, not on the market yet, lets you paint up to 64 different messages in thin air using advanced motion sensing circuitry, a tiny computer chip, and no moving parts other than you, the user. We tried it out at the county fair, and the kids swarmed to us like moths to a porch light. But the story doesn't end there. One day while working on enhancements to LucidLights, in a flash of insight that was definitely an "AHA!" moment, it occurred to John that the same circuitry could be modified slightly to create a no-wires brake light for bicycles. LucidLights are a lot of fun, but LucidBrakes can save lives and prevent injuries to some of the hundreds of millions of bicyclists around the world. As the lowest hanging and most important fruit, we shifted gears to bring LucidBrakes to market first. What makes your product special? If there's one important concept behind LucidBrakes, it's that we didn't hold back on "thinking outside the box" during it's conception, research, design, and product development steps. It truly is a very unique invention unlike any other bike lighting product on the market. Here's why... The main circuit board is all solid state, with no moving parts, no switches, and no connectors. The entire board is sealed in the latest silicone coating used to protect solar panels on rooftops for over 20 years. It keeps all the weather and water out, but lets the light through very well. The only thing projecting outside this coating are the battery clips, and they are made of the same corrosion proof metals used for industrial kitchen utensils. You can drop a running LucidBrake in water and it keeps on flashing! (We don't recommend this, as the batteries will wear out faster in water.) The multifaceted snap-on cover is made from injection-molded clear polycarbonate plastic that's very tough. The inside surface is etched lightly to diffuse the light a calibrated amount, and to route some of the light out the sides and even forward for greater visibility in all directions. The center of this cover provides an ideal surface for optional printing of custom logos, which we are doing for some corporations, clubs, and other groups. An interesting feature of the LucidBrake cover is that it is intentionally not air tight. In fact, you'll notice small gaps near the edges, where any small amounts of water that get inside will drain through. This prevents fogging, keeps the unit clean and clear, and avoids any long term issues with gaskets wearing out or covers cracking or hazing over. The LucidBrake's flat back works with 3M's amazing Dual-Lock connectors to allow mounting just about anywhere, such as on a backpack or helmet. Dual-Lock holds metal siding up on buildings in Minnesota, so it works well to attach the very light-weight LucidBrake to many surfaces. You can attach it directly to your seat post or other bike parts, or if you prefer a more standard clamping action, it attaches exceedingly well to the face of any low-priced reflector that in turn is clamped to your bike's frame. We designed LucidBrakes to be mounted just about anywhere! Perhaps the most important feature of Lucidbrake is its simple operation. Just attach it and ride. No need to remember to turn it on or off, as it sleeps when you park, blinks when you ride, and flashes brightly when you brake. The two AAA batteries last many months when parked, and a long time when you ride. Any type of AAA batteries, including rechargeable, work great. We did indeed meet our goal of simple-to-use operation and 100% satisfaction-guaranteed, long term durability. What has been the best part of your startup experience? There are many challenges for a startup such as LucidBrake, and there are many greatly rewarding events too. From day one, we made the decision to think outside the box to create an innovative new product unlike anything else on the market. In late 2015, LucidBrake won "Invention of the Year" at the prestigious DaVinci Institute's Inventor Showcase, and that was the greatest (so far) startup experience we've experienced. Suddenly, the desire to think differently was rewarded. We knew we were on the right track, and all the questioning and wondering about the decisions we were making came into sharp focus. We knew then that LucidBrake really will be helping make the world a safer place! The best part of moving forward without fear to get a startup going is what you learn in the process. We've gained valuable experience and knowledge about many topics, ranging from electronics and plastics design, to 20-year-lifetime waterproof coating technologies used for solar panels, and a host of other design and manufacturing issues. Perhaps our most important new knowledge is about marketing and getting the word out to the world. The most ingenious and useful new startup product won't get out into the world if nobody knows about it! We appreciate the opportunity to play a part in Amazon's Launchpad program. It is a huge, positive step in our efforts to spread the word, and without doubt this tops our list as one of the best parts of our startup experience.

Piper’s mission is to empower the inventors of tomorrow by giving them the tools to build creatively today. When we were young, we were encouraged to ask questions and challenge assumptions. This led us to pursue world-changing ideas and desire to make the world a better place than we left it. We believe it’s important to encourage kids’ curiosity from a young age. We are creating products that inspire kids to see the world as malleable rather than static; to see technology as pieces and parts brought together by a higher vision rather than magical devices handed down from above. We believe that with the right tools and inspiration, anyone can become a creator. We are making the tools to inspire the inventors of tomorrow. What will you create? About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Empowering future inventors! How did you come up with the idea for this product? Several years ago, our team united around a common goal of creating products to make the world a better place. To do this at scale, we had to teach ourselves programming, electronics, and many other skills. These experiences taught us that learning the actual concepts is not difficult. Building a circuit or writing a line of JavaScript is not that difficult in itself. The difficulty comes from feeling intimidated by the task and from the perception of technology being too complex to master. The problem is actually an internal one. This is especially true for kids who are given iPads, computers, and phones to consume from a young age: they never see how technology actually works. Kids believe that technology works by magic, and later in life, when the opportunity to learn or build something tech-related comes up, they feel intimidated. With LEGO and Minecraft on the other hand, you can get started right away. It’s easy. This ease leads to confidence, which in turn leads to incredible creations. We wanted Piper to be the tool that allowed kids to create with code and electronics as simply as they place LEGO bricks or craft a diamond helmet in Minecraft. We created Piper to inspire the next generation of inventors and creators. What makes your product special? The Piper experience starts with assembling your wooden components into a computer case, which serves as your exploration base for crafting unique electronic modules into real, working gadgets. Piper gives you the ability to create with the latest, most advanced electronics components and concepts right out of the box. All Piper Computers come equipped with PiperUniverse, a revolutionary teaching system designed by Princeton and Stanford scientists to use the power of Raspberry Pi Edition of Minecraft to teach programming, engineering, electronics, and critical thinking. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Every single day, there are thousands of kids all over the world who change their perception of their abilities and what they believe they are capable of by building with Piper. Seeing the difference we make in the lives of these kids is both exhilarating and humbling.
39`Color:Black Product Description The Sansaire lets you turn any pot or container into a professional-grade sous vide water bath. Previously, sous vide cooking was only available to the world’s best restaurant chefs. Now, thanks to its exquisite design, unbeatable performance, and affordable price, the Sansaire allows any cook to achieve perfect results, every time. From the Manufacturer $823,003 raised with 4,084 backers. What is sous vide? Sous vide is a cooking method that uses precise temperature control to achieve perfect results, every time. Foods are cooked evenly from edge to edge, to exactly the doneness you want. And, because foods won’t overcook while they hang out in the water bath, dinner is ready when you are. The world’s best chefs rely on sous vide, and now, you can too. What are people saying? WIRED: “…smart, sleek and simple.” Food & Wine Magazine: “Professional-grade but hundreds of dollars less than restaurant models” Popular Science: “…handsome and highly usable.” CNET: “The Sansaire… is set to become an everyday house-hold kitchen appliance.” These identical steaks were both cooked to an internal temperature of 52°C / 125.6°F. The steak on the top was cooked on a cast-iron skillet. The steak on the bottom was cooked sous vide, as evidenced by its edge-to-edge even doneness. These salmon fillets were cooked to 48°C / 119°F. The fillet on top was gently steamed, yet the outer flesh has toughened and the natural color of the fish has is faded. The fillet on the bottom was cooked sous vide – its flesh is delicate and vibrant, yet fully cooked throughout. Because the proteins in egg yolks and egg whites gel at predictable temperatures, you can achieve the exact consistency you prefer, whether you’re cooking one egg or three dozen. The egg on the top was produced by meticulously following highly rated instructions for a “perfectly poached egg.” The egg on the left was cooked sous vide at 65°C / 149°F. Resources to get started Cooking sous vide is a little different, so we’ve created an online guide to help you get started using the Sansaire. Warning: following these procedures may result in superhuman cooking ability. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Make Perfect Easy How did you come up with the idea for this product? The Sansaire has been years in the making. Scott first learned about sous vide cooking in 2009, when the only immersion circulators available were designed for laboratory use and cost upwards of $1200. Inspired by the idea that it shouldn’t cost that much money to heat water, Scott created his $75 DIY Sous Vide Machine, which has been published in MAKE Magazine and built by thousands of enthusiasts. After years of tinkering, Scott and Lukas teamed up to design the world’s best looking sous vide circulator at an affordable price. On August 6th, 2013, they launched the Sansaire as a Kickstarter campaign. They hit their funding goal of $100,000 in the first 13 hours of the campaign, and by the end of the 30-day funding window, had raised $823,003, setting the new record for the #1 most-funded food project in Kickstarter history (at the time). Since then, tens of thousands of home cooks in over 65 countries have made added the Sansaire to their kitchens. What makes your product special? Cooking with the Sansaire gives any home cook the results – and confidence – of a trained chef. On a stovetop, in an oven, or on a grill, you’re cooking with temperatures that are much higher than you ever want your food to reach. If you turn your back for a moment too long, your steak can end up as a tough, gray mess. The Sansaire uses precise temperature control to achieve perfect, repeatable results that you just can’t replicate through any other method. Foods are cooked evenly from edge to edge, to exactly the doneness you want. And, because foods won’t overcook while they hang out in the water bath, dinner is ready when you are. No more stress of watching the kitchen timer, no more anxiety of accidental overcooking. Just perfect results, every time. What has been the best part of your startup experience? It has been so rewarding for us to see how home cooks all over the world are using their Sansaires. We adore watching the #Sansaire feeds on social media and learning new, creative uses for our tools. More than anything, we love it when a user posts a photo and says, “This is the best [dish] I’ve ever cooked!”

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Analytic, accessible, enjoyable How did you come up with the idea for this product? My office was next to a golf ranch, however around November-December, it would become too cold for playing. I could see from my window, that during the winter months, nobody would play, and I thought: what else they were doing? Personally, I always stopped playing during the winter season and when spring came, I was always rusty and needed a long time to come back to where I left off the previous year. That’s when I decided to develop an enjoyable training tool for times when going to the ranch or course isn’t an option. What makes your product special? With our 3 patents, the sensors and the app are the first of its kind and take the practicing to a whole new level. Smartgolf is a swing trainer that offers active feedback and analysis to improve your technique and game. With golf being a time consuming sport, where a round can take up to 4 hours, we invented a high-tech club that would enable every golfer a new way to practice their swing and play golf, without the hassle of depending on the weather or spending much time. With Smartgolf, we can simulate a practice that is fun and resembles a real golf game, in your office or house. The accessibility to play wherever and whenever you want with enjoyment, has a huge impact on your practice and will give you the utmost benefits. Hitting dry shots in the air might not always seem to be fun. However, our simulation can provide you both, fun and useful feedback. What has been the best part of your startup experience? I would say the most challenging and best experience was collaborating as a team to jump the wall and sometimes break through the ground. This project has required countless hours of working overtime and spending more time with the coworkers than with the family. We all managed to pull the same direction and accomplished our goal! It’s an experience contributing to the evolution for golf.

We wanted to build something sustainable. Because polluting water while manufacturing products that enhance water wouldn’t make any sense at all. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Smart. Beautiful. Sustainable. How did you come up with the idea for this product? One night during a dinner party, our founder, Mike del Ponte was hesitant to put his cheap plastic “other brand” water filter on his nicely set table. Mike decided to pour his filtered water into a glass wine decanter. Unfortunately (or fortunately) as he did, the lid of the water pitcher fell off, causing water to gush all over the kitchen floor. As he cleaned up the mess, he thought, “Why can’t someone create a water filter that’s beautifully designed, easy to use, and made of sustainable materials?” Soma was born. The rest is water under the bridge. What makes your product special? Soma is the only water filter with 100% plant-based filtration. Distinguished by its clean, modern design, Soma also gives back by donating clean drinking water to those in need through charity: water. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The most difficult part of designing the Soma Pitcher was finding the perfect wooden handle. We needed something that is both beautiful and durable, so oak as a wood species was always at the top of our list. The challenge was finding a wood supplier in the U.S. committed to sustainable practices and detailed craftsmanship. Fortunately, we found the perfect partner in Southern Oregon.|

And the response from consumers has been just as enthusiastic. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Active, Imaginative, Kids How did you come up with the idea for this product? I saw that there was a problem with toys that ended up sitting dormant on floors and in closets while kids had their eyes glued to the screen. The idea came to me to empower the intuitive imagination found in each and every child with active movement through the technology of a wearable. What makes your product special? Kids are more active with the Moff Band and feel encouraged to be creative. By using the universal language of movement, our wearable smart toy empowers each and every child to imagine. Also, the Moff Band is fun for the whole family – brothers and sister can play together and grandma can jump in anytime! What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of my startup experience has been the challenge. Specifically, at Moff we have challenged ourselves to empower kids to use their imagination by recognizing their 3D motion using only a wrist band. We feel like we have done a pretty good job so far of enabling all types of kids to get up, move and even learn a little bit. And we have enjoyed every minute of it. #productDescription { color: #333333; word-wrap: break-word; font-size: small; line-height: initial; margin: 0.5em 0px 0em 25px; } #productDescription_feature_div > h2.default { color: #CC6600; font-size: medium; margin: 0 0 0.25em; } #productDescription_feature_div > h2.books { color:#333 !important; font-size:21px !important; line-height: 1.3; padding-bottom: 4px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0px; } #productDescription_feature_div > h2.softlines { color:#333 !important; font-size:21px !important; line-height: 1.3; padding-bottom: 4px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0px; } #productDescription > p, #productDescription > div, #productDescription > table { margin: 0 0 1em 0; } #productDescription p { margin: 0em 0 1em 1em; } #productDescription h3 { font-weight: normal; color: #333333; font-size: 1.23em; clear: left; margin: 0.75em 0px 0.375em -15px; } #productDescription table { border-collapse: inherit !important; margin-bottom: 0; } #productDescription table img { max-width: inherit !important; } #productDescription table td { font-size: small; vertical-align: inherit !important; } #productDescription ul li { margin: 0 0 0 20px; } #productDescription ul li ul { list-style-type: disc !important; margin-left: 20px !important; } #productDescription ul ul li { list-style-type: disc !important; margin-left: 20px !important; } #productDescription > ul ul li { list-style-type: disc !important; } #productDescription ul li ul li { margin: 0 0 0 20px; } #productDescription .aplus p { margin: 0 0 1em 0; } #productDescription small { font-size: smaller; } #productDescription.prodDescWidth { max-width: 1000px } P.when('jQuery').execute(function($){ $("#productDescription table").each(function() { var width = $(this).attr('width'); if (width) width += 'px'; else width = 'auto'; $(this).css('width', width); var padding = $(this).attr('cellpadding'); if (padding) padding += 'px'; else padding = '0px'; $(this).css('padding', padding); }); });
306`Product Description These innovative and elegant pot clips for spatulas and spoons and various other stirring utensils save them from the day to day tortures in the kitchen. They save your wooden spatulas from burning, prevent plastic ones from melting, and save metal ones from getting too hot, so you can be rest assured your precious utensils will stay protected for a long time. You just need to slide them on your utensil handles and clip them onto the rim of your cooking utensil. This way your spatulas, spoons, turners etc. stay thermally insulated from the hot pots and pans and save them from the intense heat. The clips are 100% food grade, made of FDA compliant silicone, and they are heat resistant up to 570F or 300C. No more worrying about leaving your spatulas unattended and find them burnt later on. The clips are thoughtfully designed keeping cleanliness in mind. Unlike other pot clips, there are no nooks and crannies where food can get stuck which can lead to mold over a period of time. Also, silicone, by nature is anti-microbial. These utensil clips are completely Dishwasher Safe.

What has been the best part of your startup experience? We love it when we receive emails from users who tell us how Vigo is helping them stay safe at the wheel. Whether it is for professional drivers who are on the road more than 10 hours a day, or for people with narcolepsy who tend to doze off while driving, or for those buying Vigo for their loved one to ensure they are safe on the road, the outpour of emails from people who are happy with what we have creative is extremely fulfilling.
369`Product Description HeroBoys is a collection of superhero characters that set out to empower young boys ages 3-10. The creators, parents of two young boys themselves, invented the line for all boys to inject positive messaging and meaningful, educational content into a superhero landscape dominated by movie marketing related products. The characters, Blazer, Gusto, Rocko, StormSurge, Techno, and ThunderHawk, learn to work together and use their inherent strengths and talents (something that all children have) to help make a positive impact in the world. From the Manufacturer The Best of Both Worlds HeroBoys is a doll/action figure hybrid unlike anything on the market. Most 18-inch action figures are made from hard plastic and do not bend and the elbows and knees. HeroBoys heroes are unique in that their torso is made from soft compressed cotton fibers, giving our Heroes a soft, huggable quality. The limbs however are firm and bendable at the shoulder, elbows, hips and knees for full poseability and play. Heroes Meant for Children HeroBoys is the only line of post preschool hero related products that are focused on providing thoughtful, meaningful, age appropriate content for children. Most of today’s superhero content is immersed in the current Hero-Industrial Complex of PG-13 Movies, violent video games, and dark and morbid comic books. HeroBoys aims to provide positive encouragement and reinforcement of values though it’s comics in which children heroes come to together to do good in a world where adults have left a lot of room for improvement. Durable Construction These Heroes can stand up to the rough and tumble play of active children! Poseability Ready for action with 11 points of articulation! Stand Included Display stand included with each Hero- prefect for bookshelf, dresser or nightstand. There is a Hero Inside Every Boy We created the HeroBoys to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. AmericanGirl Meets Avengers How did you come up with the idea for this product? As parents, we struggled to find toys with meaning and value for our boys. They love Superheroes, but it seems almost all superhero related content is part of today’s Hero-Industrial Complex of major media properties targeted to broad audiences for movies, video games, and comic books. The content in this area for children in the crucial development years from 3 to 10 generally lacks thoughtfulness, value, or meaning. That is why we created the HeroBoys, a line of toys and comic books meant to use children’s love of superheroes to celebrate adventure, imagination, and limitless potential, while reinforcing positive values, values we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. What makes your product special? We are the only line of post preschool superhero related content truly for children and not part of the PG-13 Hero Industrial Complex that turns out superhero related movies of varying quality that are inevitably targeted for he broadest possible market and not concerned with development and age appropriate messaging for younger children. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The reaction from children when they read the comic books and play with the Heroes, they absolutely love them which is fantastic!

Smallest Wireless Scanner How did you come up with the idea for this product? Frequent trips to the library’s scanner sparked an idea: a smaller-scale scanner—minus the wires—would make it easy to capture images anywhere. Preserve photos digitally, get organized, or shrink some paper piles all with a personal scanner you can take anywhere. Our core technology relies on years of research on robotic algorithms and computer vision. We're a spin-off from ETH Zurich – one of the top engineering schools in Europe – and still retain close relations to academia for further advancing our technology. In addition to the software capabilities, we have consolidated several years of experience in ramping-up mass production for high quality consumer products. Our team has already worked with leading manufacturing companies to produce the world's first scanning mouse and several hundred thousands of our products are used today in over 140 different countries in 20 different language regions. What makes your product special? It's the fastest scanner at hand and always works. As easy as pressing a button, PocketScan starts the scan. Anything you scan is wirelessly transmitted and instantly displayed on the screen. Scanning feels just like painting. Thanks to its unique design and sophisticated illumination, PocketScan works even in bright sunlight or low-light environments to produce consistent, clear, and high quality results. Just wipe this hand-held scanner over any text or image, and it sends a high-res image to your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. Kids’ artwork, documents, recipes, or just a part of a page—all look much clearer than a pic from your phone, thanks to built-in illumination. Even artwork, large books, and other images that aren’t completely flat get scanned beautifully. That can’t happen on glass or with a camera. Scanned text has some extra features, too. You can open and edit it in Word. Or work on scanned tables in Excel. This smart scanner can even translate text for you. What has been the best part of your startup experience? We had the chance to run a Kickstarter campaign for PocketScan, which has proven to be highly successful. We were overwhelmed by all the feedback and interest in PocketScan, after all seeing our idea take off and also learning why, was an amazing experience. Getting all the direct and honest feedback from our backers was very valuable and crucial for driving the the development of PocketScan and creating a truly unique scanning experience.
264`David Riker's critically acclaimed feature film debut is a moving tribute to the struggles and hopes of Latin American immigrants in New York City. Filmed in the nineties over the course of six years, LA CIUDAD creates an unforgettable portrait of immigrant life in a collection of four stories about love, hope, and loss: a day laborer paid to gather bricks from an abandoned lot meets a tragic end; a young man newly arrived from Mexico falls in love with a girl from his home village; a homeless puppeter dreams of a better life for his daughter; and a seamstress is in desperate need of money to send home for her daughter's medical treatment.
289`Product Description Auzoud Organic Saffron is ethically sourced from a women-run farmers' cooperative in Morocco that guarantees fair wages and sustainable practices. From the Manufacturer CERTIFIED ORGANIC USDA Organic Certification guarantees the highest quality. SUPPORTS NORTH AFRICAN WOMEN FARMERS Grown by a women-run farming cooperative in Morocco. CERTIFIED ORGANIC USDA Organic Certification guarantees the highest quality. HAND-PICKED Harvested at sunrise when the flowers naturally open. FAIR WAGES & SUSTAINABLE HARVESTING Farmers are paid fairly and harvesting sites are preserved. Auzoud's mission is to empower Moroccan women and youth farmers as they obtain fair prices and a more sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families. In addition to offering only the finest authentic Moroccan foods, Auzoud is committed to working with women and youth farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive, saffron and argan farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Many of the farmers are single mothers hoping to send their children to school. Auzoud has been founded by the grandson of one such farmer. Our partner cooperatives are based on membership participation and fair prices, allowing women to feed their families and educate their children. Improving the socio-economic situation, health and education of women and youth has an immediate and lasting impact on the well-being of families and the preservation of the local culture and community. We are focused on expanding the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. More than saffron. How did you come up with the idea for this product? I was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud/auzoud means “olive” in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud’s waters contribute to the region’s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation...it has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping family and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma. After moving to the U.S. I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors’ land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region. Now we have expanded and are working with three cooperatives in Morocco. All cooperative members are small-scale farmers, many of them single mothers and young people hoping for a stable income to help their families. We hope you enjoy our products and share them with your family, as we do, and that you understand Auzoud to be an offering that unites our regions, languages, cultures and religions. As such, Auzoud's logo is the dove carrying an olive branch - a universal symbol of hope and peace - in reflection of this wish for shared prosperity and peace between our communities and across the world. What makes your product special? Auzoud Organic Saffron is sourced directly from a women-run farmers' cooperative in the countryside of Morocco. A purchase with Auzoud guarantees fair wages and healthy working conditions for hundreds of small farmers throughout the region. What has been the best part of your startup experience? By far the best part of our startup experience has been connecting and working closely with hundreds of small farmers from my home region. I love engaging with them and learning their stories. Like my grandfather, most of the farmers we work with have farmland that has been passed down for many generations. As they finally, now, receive fair pay for their products, many farming families are able to greatly improve their quality of life and transform local conditions by, for example, sending their children to school. We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute in this way!

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Comfortable Functional Versatile! How did you come up with the idea for this product? Convenience on the go.

From the Manufacturer Premium Materials Make A Better Case The patented design and exclusive materials make jimmyCASE uniquely functional and efficient. Our exclusive elastic fabric holds a bunch of cards tight and never stretches out. Old-school leather wallet cases stretch out, and plastic wallet cases don’t stretch at all to hold many cards. Our Magic Elastic is just right – easy to use and not fussy at all. Holds 6 Cards & Cash The Magic Elastic Pocket never stretches out and holds up to 6 cards and cash, tight. Shake it, they won't fall out. Also stretches to hold bulky items like car keys. Fast & Easy Card Access It’s easy to access all your cards, just push them out with your thumb.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Magic Elastic Wallet-Case How did you come up with the idea for this product? I designed jimmyCASE in my Los Angeles garage. For years, I thought it would be great to carry my cards on the back of my iPhone and get rid of my wallet. I found the cases available were neither functional nor stylish. The leather cases stretched out and the plastic cases could only handle a couple cards. The folio cases had annoying flaps that would get in the way. I found a weaving mill in Los Angeles that could make custom elastic fabric for jimmyCASE – perfect to hold cards tightly. I made the first 1,000 jimmyCASEs by hand in my garage, then after a successful Kickstarter, moved into a professional factory in East Los Angeles. What makes your product special? To make the perfect wallet case, we re-invented the wallet. Most wallet cases look like leather wallets glued to the back of iPhone cases. Our Magic Elastic pocket performs better than leather. It molds to the size of your cards and holds them tight and never stretches out. You can put in six cards this week and one card next week and the jimmyCASE will hold the single card tight, every time. The genuine mahogany wood core is super strong, gets more beautiful with age. What has been the best part of your startup experience? We get a kick out of making a premium product by hand in the USA and sharing it with customers throughout the world. We love hearing from customers who have tried other cases and then landed with us to stay. Super Cool.

Roadie Tuner is the ultimate guitarist's tool Roadie is sleek, easy to use and, most importantly, extremely accurate.” — Guitar World Magazine “During my time with Roadie, my handheld and pedal tuners haven't seen the light of day and the manual peg turner has lost its place in my gig bag permanently.” — Gizmag “The Roadie is nicely built, highly accurate, and easy to use. I’ve been using standard audio-based tuners for years and this is the first time that my guitar has sounded well and truly in tune.” — Techcrunch About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Quick. Accurate. Magical. How did you come up with the idea for this product? It all started back in college when we met in a band playing music. During band practice, Bassam had to change tuning often between songs, which was not an easy task to do on a 12 string instrument. So we thought, “How come a product that eases the hassle of tuning doesn’t already exist?” Eventually what started off as a challenging project to solve a personal need ended up to be a great journey to develop a professional guitarist’s tool. After years of research and development, Roadie came to life. What makes your product special? Roadie completely automates the tuning process, reducing the human error and making tuning a quick, accurate and fun experience. Roadie is versatile: you only need one Roadie to tune all your guitars, ukulele, mandolin, banjo etc. Roadie is an all-in-one tool: tuner, string winder, and string doctor. This is what makes Roadie a one-of-a-kind product in the market. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The journey of bringing Roadie from prototype to product has been a thrilling ride for us and so far the best part of our startup. The Kickstarter crowdfunding experience was incredible, tripling our funding goal with more than 2000 backers. Following this, the excitement of launching a product for the first time to excited and welcoming customers. We were delighted to see a community of backers supporting us early on and believing in Roadie. Then we had to manufacture our first production, so we moved right next to our factory and made sure to build a great team and good relations with our suppliers as we knew they are the foundation for building an awesome product. Finally, after shipping and delivering Roadie to over 55 countries worldwide, it was priceless to see our backers respond positively and passionately about their Roadie experience.

We started the company because we couldn't find a truly natural and great tasting gum in the market. It turns out that the regular chewing gum you see on grocery store shelves is filled with artificial substances, including some of the same components used in the manufacture of car tires, plastic bottles, and white glue, as well as artificial sweeteners like aspartame. Consumers are kept in the dark about what they are chewing because the FDA allows conventional gum brands to hide up to 80 synthetic ingredients in the catch-all term "gum base" on the label. We knew we could do better. In New York, our gum chefs craft the best ingredients into the highest quality gum on the market. The result is a lightly sweetened, totally natural gum that’s better for your body and the environment. Simply Gum makes all natural premium chewing gum, without any plastic, synthetics, or artificial flavors. The result is a lightly sweetened, totally natural gum that's better tasting, better for your body, and better for the environment. If you dream of maple sugar candy and are looking for a sweet treat, our xylitol free gum is perfect for your sweet tooth. Because we only use natural ingredients, our gum is not only better for your body, it's also biodegradable and better for the planet. Our innovative packaging includes post-chew wrappers to make it easy to dispose of when complete. Each order contains 6 packs with 15 pieces each, for a total of 90 pieces of gum.Regular chewing gum is packed with artificial substances that are potentially toxic, including plastic, aspartame, and BHT. Unlike conventional gum brands, Simply Gum uses all natural ingredients without ANY synthetics.
84`Size:under 40 pounds Product Description The We Leash is the first in a line of products that enhance the human-dog bond, products based on the principles of NYT Best Selling Author and Canine Assistants Founder Jennifer Arnold’s Bond-Based Approach. With one handle for you and one for your dog, the direct connection is between your hand and his mouth. This design reduces the feeling of restraint while increasing the opportunity for interaction, all while not compromising the safety of being on a leash. In addition to the obvious unique features of the leash, the We Leash is made with an uber-comfortable neoprene handle and slight stretch for you and an organic plush handle for your dog. Various attachable organic plush toys sold separately. From the Manufacturer Restraint Reducing Design Lessens Unwanted Behaviors The We Leash consists of two lines, a connection line between your hand and your dog’s mouth, and a safety line between your hand and your dog’s harness. The connection line is shorter than the safety line. This restraint reducing design lessens dogs’ anxiety while on leash. Less anxiety means less unwanted behaviors and more enjoyable walks for both you and your dog! A Cooperative Leash With Benefits Beyond Your Walks With one handle for you and one for your dog, when using the We Leash the direct connection is between your hand and your dog’s mouth. When you move your hand, your dog feels it, and when he moves, you feel it. It’s like holding hands with your dog. The We Leash connection allows your dog a feeling of secure attachment and a sense of control that will reap benefits beyond your actual walks. A Neoprene Handle And Slight Stretch For You In addition to the obvious unique features of the leash, the We Leash is made with an uber-comfortable neoprene handle and slight stretch to make walking with your dog a comfortable, interactive experience Organic Crinkle-Filled Plush Toys For Your Dog Dogs love our toys! We Toys are interchangeable with the handle that is included with the We Leash. Our toys are designed to the highest quality and safety standards: organic plush, stuff-less bodies, and non-toxic crinkle filling for safety, while enticing designs encourage fun for you and your dog. Simple Snap Together Design If ever your dog chooses not to hold his toy or handle, the two lines simply snap together creating a “regular” leash. You can unclip the toy and we have provided a carabiner for convenience near the human handle where the toy, handle or Binkie can hang. We For Dogs Makes Products That Enhance The Human-Dog Bond We For Dogs makes unique, dog-centric products that are designed to enhance the human-dog bond, emphasizing our values of kindness, communication, connection and charity. All We For Dogs products are created to make living together more enjoyable for dogs and the people who love them. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Cooperative two-way leash How did you come up with the idea for this product? While thinking of ways to eliminate the feeling of restraint caused by leashes, I knew that meant I would have to keep dogs from ever feeling pulled by the leash. I started by tying a toy on a rope and tying that to a leash. It worked beautifully . . . until it fell off. Not giving up on the concept, we developed what is now the We Leash. What makes your product special? There are no other leashes on the market that focus on the relationship between people and their dogs. The We Leash allows you to interact with your dog while on a walk and the restraint reducing design lessens dogs’ anxiety while on leash. Less anxiety means less unwanted behaviors and more enjoyable walks for both you and your dog. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Kickstarter was a great way to launch. You sit with an idea, and then develop it into a prototype, and then test it, knowing you think it is something the world needs. But, to turn an idea into a product, for us, it took people, complete strangers, to validate our idea with their support and wallets. Hours after launching the Kickstarter, we knew we had an idea worth making, that was gratifying!

31`|Color:Black || Size:Medium Product Description Speakeasy Briefs are an innovative combination of fashion and function. They offer a style that says, “you should see me in my underwear,” while providing a pocket that says, “it’s none of your business what’s in my underwear.” From the Manufacturer My mind is blown! What would I use this pocket for? We aren’t here to tell you how to live, that’s not our style. We just want to make sure no one else is telling you how to live either. The Speakeasy pocket is ideal for carrying items that you don’t want other people to take from you. Common examples include: your passport, wallet, keys, cell phone, and flask. Bring the Party to Your Pants Speakeasy Briefs were designed to carry a 6 oz flask comfortably above the "family jewels." No more $10 beers in your music festival future! Scoreboard: You - 1 Pickpockets – 0 Protect your passport and other valuables as you travel abroad. The Speakeasy Briefs large front pocket is an ideal place to protect your passport from pickpocketers while traveling. Avoid the condom hunt! Nothing kills the mood faster than scrambling for protection. Legends come prepared! The Ultimate Groomsmen Gift! Will you be wearing your Tuesday morning underwear for the biggest party weekend of your life? Didn’t think so. Speakeasy Briefs lets you and your groomsmen party in style all wedding weekend long. Solving problems - One Pocket at a Time Music festivals are not for the faint of heart. The combination of beautiful people, great music, and delicious beverages can leave a man with very difficult choices about how to spend his precious time and money. We continually experienced this predicament first hand: forced to decide between quenching our thirst in the beer garden or enjoying the musical performances we had traveled so many miles to see. But out of this Sophie's choice, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, new fruit was born! Speakeasy Briefs: stylish men's underwear with a secret pocket, providing the perfect solution to an imperfect world of pat-downs and $11 beers (we've been to the grocery store -- we know what beer costs music man!) Sourcing the finest fabrics known to man, and using the craftsmanship of a master Venetian tailor, Speakeasy Briefs prototypes were born. But would anyone else recognize this necessity? Was the world ready for these game-changing garments of legend? The good people of Kickstarter answered that question with a resounding - Yes! At Speakeasy Briefs, we want to make sure our customers never get caught with their pants down. Legends come prepared! About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Legends Come Prepared How did you come up with the idea for this product? Jeff and I were at the Coachella Valley Music Festival, and wanted to go grab a drink and watch the Red Hot Chili Peppers perform. We had to wait in line for 45 minutes to get a drink, and by the time we got to the front of the line, we realized we were being charged $11 for a beer. The festival wouldn't let us leave the beer garden to go watch the show until we completely finished our drinks. We thought it was ridiculous that we were being price gauged so aggressively by a festival that we'd paid so much money to attend, and that we couldn't even enjoy a drink inside the festival while watching our favorite bands play. With that, Speakeasy Briefs were born! What makes your product special? When we made Speakeasy Briefs, we wanted to create a high quality product that would keep our customers feeling great throughout a long day of dancing in the sun. With that goal in mind, we sourced a modal/cotton/spandex blend of fabric that is usually reserved for much more expensive underwear ($50-$60). While it raised our costs, it has resulted in over-delivering on quality to our customers. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Bringing a fun and funny product into the world is incredibly rewarding. Our customer feedback has been amazing, and we are consistently surprised by all of the interesting ways our customers find uses for the pocket.|

The outside is unlike almost anything you’ll likely see on the street today.” - Samuel Gibbs, The Guardian. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. You’ll stand out How did you come up with the idea for this product? We got fed up. We had all been in the smartphone world since the early days, and we missed the feeling of excitement and innovation. Instead of originality and big changes, everyone has been copying features and phone designs from each other the past few years. Everything is incremental now, but there is so much more that can be done. Big things. So we designed the Nextbit OS to take Android to the next level and show the possibilities of a cloud connected future. And we designed Robin as a phone that would stand out from the crowd. ¶ What makes your product special? You don’t run out of storage. By merging cloud and onboard storage, Robin seamlessly backs up your apps and photos. When you need space it intelligently archives the stuff you’re not using. And if you ever want anything back you can easily restore items when you need them. Robin does this all automatically, so you never have to worry. And Robin does this in a way that won’t drain your battery or eat up your wireless data. Plus, it looks pretty great. What has been the best part of your startup experience? What people say when they see Robin, not just back on Kickstarter, but now every day in people’s hands has blown us away. We set out to build a phone that we’d be proud to use, something that wasn’t just great software or specs, but truly different design. Being a startup means we didn’t have to make the usual compromises that older brands face. We could take a new path. Everyday we get to come to work knowing we’re making a cooler future for ourselves and our fellow users.

Lightsocket smart projector How did you come up with the idea for this product? Many ideas start simple, just like this one. During a brainstorm session in March of 2014 someone came up with the thought ‘what if we could make a projector that you could screw in your light socket’. The interesting thing is what happened after this thought. Everybody started sharing ideas on where they would place Beam in their house, and almost everyone thought of a different location. We were no longer limited by the traditional spots and could now freely dream up places where we would love to have a screen. Everybody made it their own personal solution, instead of one pre-defined setup. Here we decided that besides just screwing the projector into light sockets it should also be able to be placed on a flat surface. So we added a small flatness on one side that stabilizes Beam. What makes your product special? Normal projectors are big and bulky and you want to get it out of sight as soon as you're done using them. We designed Beam in a way that it will be a part of your interior. This combined with our software creates an unique product that will show you the right information at the right time! What has been the best part of your startup experience? Developing the product from an idea to a fully working concept was a something that we as a team enjoyed a lot! Also seeing the Kickstarter community pick up our baby as well as they did was awesome!

We aimed to be thoughtful creators to make it easier for everyone to be thoughtful in what we leave behind. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. YOGA FOR BOTTLES How did you come up with the idea for this product? Like so many growing families, we began to notice a growing collection of not quite empty bottles of shampoos, conditioners, lotions, liquid soaps, etc. taking over the bathroom and kitchen counters, cabinets and shower/sinks. The problem became even more evident when bottles, with product still in them, piled up in the trash, as they could not be properly placed in the recycling bin. I confronted my husband and young children about this flagrant waste. They responded by saying that they would violently shake and squeeze bottles when they felt a lot of stuff was stuck at the bottom, but nothing would come out, so they gave up. I was fed up and set out to buy something that could solve the problem, but was surprised that there were no practical solutions. I visited several salons and discovered they were just as frustrated, stockpiling almost empty bottles, wasting space and losing hundreds of dollars in product. They concurred that there was no sensible solution. What makes your product special? It is a labor of love from our family to yours. Our youngest, who himself aspired to be an inventor, suggested we “invent” the solution to finally, completely and easily get everything out of bottles so that we could save money, free up space and properly recycle. I thought it could be a valuable learning experience for our children to follow through with this, but had no idea what we were all getting ourselves into. For the last three years, our family has been dedicated to creating the coolest and most versatile upside down bottle efficiency system possible. From the feedback, we succeeded. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Early on I had left a couple of prototypes at an Aveda Salon for the stylists to try out. When I checked in a week later their exuberence brought me to tears. One of the stylists who had been struggling to adhere to recycling requirements and use every last drop of expensive product beamed "It's the perfect invention!". It was incredibly validating. Later Allure magazine was sent some prototypes and wrote an article stating "It's kind of Genius." Reactions like this let us know we are following through with what we intended, making everyday life a little easier and the world a little better. This is the best part by far!

65`Product Description The Structure Sensor is the first 3D sensor for mobile devices. Simply clip it to a compatible mobile device, and you can instantly enable a completely new set of possibilities. Capture detailed, full-color 3D scans of objects or people. Capture every measurement in a room in just seconds. Or play mixed reality games where virtual elements are locked precisely to the real world around you. Designed for iPad and iPhone, yet hackable to be used with Android, Windows, Mac, Linux and other platforms too. From the Manufacturer $1,290,439 raised with 3,515 backers. Space: the final frontier for your mobile device. Until now, the physical space around you has largely been untouched by software. With the Structure Sensor attached to your mobile device, however, that all changes. Instead of taking flat two dimensional pictures of people and things, you’ll capture precise, full-color 3D models of them. The games you play will no longer be relegated to your device’s touchscreen; instead, they’ll integrate and interact with the real world around you. And, by giving your device 3D vision, you’ll be able to do incredibly practical tasks, like capturing every single measurement of a room in just a few short seconds. From the research lab to your living room The Structure Sensor is one of the most sophisticated accessories ever developed for mobile devices. Along with the Structure SDK, it brings cutting-edge computer vision capabilities to the iPad or iPhone you already own. In a decade, the 3D applications and capabilities enabled by the Structure Sensor will be taken for granted on our devices, much like how we expect a great color camera now. But you’ll get to experience - and show off - the future of spatial computing first. 3D Scanning Easily capture anything from a small object to your favorite relative as a precise, full-color 3D model. Mixed Reality Peer into a future where what you do in the real world controls the experiences you have in virtual worlds. Indoor Mapping Simply stand in the center of the room, press one button, and capture every measurement all at once. A developer’s dream The Structure SDK for iOS is our way of taking care of the basics so developers can get straight to publishing incredible applications with Structure Sensor. Need precise 6-DoF positional tracking? Volumetric reconstruction? Real world occlusion? Our APIs have you covered. Prefer to develop at a low level? You'll have direct access to the same raw data and low-level controls on the Structure Sensor that we do. For developers using platforms other than iOS, the Structure Sensor offers compatibility via OpenNI for Windows, Linux, Android and OS X. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Mobile 3D vision How did you come up with the idea for this product? We were inspired by devices like the Microsoft Kinect, and the new kinds of experiences it enabled for both developers and consumers. Our goal was to extend what began with the Kinect to the most popular mobile platforms used by hundreds of millions of people around the world. What makes your product special? There’s really nothing else quite like the Structure Sensor. Its form factor makes it easy to add depth sensing to nearly any mobile device, while its powerful SDK enables applications that have never before been possible. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Prior to creating the Structure Sensor, Occipital was purely a software company. With the introduction of the Structure Sensor, however, we needed to recreate ourselves as an integrated software-hardware company. That has proven to be both one of the most challenging as well as one of the best parts of the creation process. We cut no corners in creating the Structure Sensor, and we’re proud of what we’ve made, as well as what we’ve become capable of as a company in the process.
283`|Color:Gold || Size:For Him Product Description Your feet pound the path. Your breathing is deep but steady. As you lengthen your stride the trees along the path become a blur. Then, a hundred yards ahead of you, you spot the blockade—three people walking abreast and chatting cheerfully. They probably don’t even realize they’re blocking your path. You clear your throat, but the pedestrians are engaged in conversation and do not hear you. What do you do? It feels rude to shout, and even ruder to barrel your way between them. Runbell lets you communicate your presence in a polite way. The clear ring of the bell cuts through traffic and conversation noise to get the attention of others who share the trail or sidewalk. From the Manufacturer Simple Yet Ingenious Runbell lets you alert pedestrians, bicyclists, and other joggers that you are drawing near, without having to shout a verbal warning. It produces a bright, clear “ring! ring!” that cuts through ambient noise. It is also a more polite solution than a warning shout or a last-second, grunted, “Coming through!” Adjustable to Your Fingers We designed Runbell to be slightly oversized, to fit even large hands comfortably. Two pairs of silicone inserts are included with every Runbell, so you can reduce the ring size to fit YOUR finger perfectly. On cold days, leave out the insert and wear Runbell over your gloves. Fit Your Fingers Slide Runbell onto your index and middle finger. Adjust with the removable silicone inserts. Ring Ring Reach with your thumb, and push the hammer forward or pull to the side. Release, and enjoy Runbell’s signature ching! Say "Thank You" After passing people, be sure to thank them for giving you room. Raise your hand, wave your Runbell, and say, “Thank you!” Elegant Gear for Urban Sports Enthusiasts Our products encourage a more effective sharing of public spaces. Runbell brings the sound of music to jogging paths in cities around the world making these paths safer for pedestrians and runners alike. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Handheld Running Bell How did you come up with the idea for this product? In August 2011 while living in Tokyo, my son was born (Kevin here). All of a sudden I had a lot less time on my hands. To maintain my fitness regimen while juggling the demands of work and fatherhood, I started jogging back and forth to the office every day. The streets of Tokyo are constantly bustling with crowds. Amid the noise and commotion, I discovered that a gentle "sumimasen"—or “excuse me”—often doesn't work, and anything more aggressive is considered rude. At first, I started running with a universal bike bell. With the bike bell in hand, I could warn and pass pedestrians no matter which route I took home. Over the next year I designed Runbell, launched on Kickstarter, and started production after successfully fundraising our startup capital. What makes your product special? A wearable bell for runners is the first ever created and the only one like it on the market. What has been the best part of your startup experience? I love using the finished product, the result of thousands of hours of hard work.|

For me, the CLEVERFIT “Aha Moment” happened on an early morning several years ago, when reaching for my stack of assorted fixed size stays, I inadvertently scattered them on the closet floor. While crawling around collecting them, I thought, “Wow there has to be a better way to get a proper looking shirt collar, than wasting time searching through this cluttered pile of inferior tiny plastic strips everyday.” That experience ignited a spark in me to create the world's greatest collar stay solution. My goal was to engineer a collar stay that would save valuable time, solve common collar appearance problems and add structure and stability to all shirt fabric types. And after years of engineering and multiple prototypes, CLEVERFIT became an amazing reality! What makes your product special? CLEVERFIT is not a niche product, but a universal problem solver for millions of men around the world. Traditional fixed collar stays are precut by manufacturers to be undersized, leaving weak zones at the top section of the collar where it joins the neckband. This allows the collar to become disfigured, sink inward or flip during normal daily wear or best described as "Sloppy Collar Syndrome." CLEVERFIT is the only collar stay in the world which can be adjusted to support the entire underside of the collar, providing the correct amount of length and strength for every fabric type. CLEVERFIT's line of site quick adjustment gives you the exact size match in seconds. So reach for any shirt in your closet and have confidence that with CLEVERFIT, "The Perfect Size is Just a Click Away!" What has been the best part of your startup experience? The most rewarding part of my startup experience has been the amazing feedback we have been receiving from CLEVERFIT customers worldwide. It has been a long and challenging journey over many years to develop and perfect CLEVERFIT. And nothing is more exciting or satisfying than seeing your idea truly helping people solve everyday problems.

207`For aspiring comedian Donna Stern, everyday life as a female twenty-something provides ample material for her incredibly relatable brand of humor. On stage, Donna is unapologetically herself, joking about topics as intimate as her sex life and as crude as her day-old underwear. But when Donna gets dumped, loses her job, and finds herself pregnant just in time for Valentine's Day, she has to navigate the murky waters of independent adulthood for the first time. As she grapples with an uncertain financial future, an unwanted pregnancy, and a surprising new suitor, Donna begins to discover that the most terrifying thing about adulthood isn't facing it all on her own. It's allowing herself to accept the support and love of others. And be truly vulnerable. Never failing to find the comedy and humanity in each awkward situation she encounters, Donna finds out along the way what it means to be as brave in life as she is on stage. Anchored by a breakout performance from Jenny Slate, OBVIOUS CHILD is a winning discovery, packed tight with raw, energetic comedy and moments of poignant human honesty. Writer/Director Gillian Robespierre handles the topic of Donna's unwanted pregnancy with a refreshing matter-of-factness rarely seen onscreen. And with Donna, Slate and Robespierre have crafted a character for the ages - a female audiences will recognize, cheer for, and love.

It comes with a set of 2 straps that allow you to carry your coffee, but at the same time reply to a couple of e-mails and carry around your newspaper. From the Manufacturer Inspired by the original story of coffee discovery ... The creation of GOAT STORY was inspired by the greatest discovery of all time – coffee! It was back in 13th century when a flock of goats stumbled upon a bush of berries that made them go loco! Their shepherd decided to brew the berries and came up with the rich and flavourful drink we all adore nowadays! The brand is dedicated to the ones worthy of the praise – goats. ... crafted into a one-of-a-kind coffee mug. It is not only the shape which makes it special, it is also the variety of materials that were chosen to suit different styles and preferences. We made sure to use top quality materials that are safe for you and will endure a long time. Because everyone needs their own dose of caffeine fix, we made it in two sizes 12 oz. and 16 oz. Horn shape The horn shape is a dedication to goats that discovered coffee and its incline also lets you drink the very last sip.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Unique, Coffee, 2GO How did you come up with the idea for this product? I love coffee and I wanted to create a cool coffee mug to carry my coffee with me. Together with my team we came across the story that coffee was discovered by the goats. It took us 2 years to finish up the GOAT Mug project and to choose the right materials. After two years of designing the product I knew that it is so different that we need an approval of the Kickstarter community to make it come alive. People instantly loved the idea which was a great stamp of approval that we’re doing something right. What makes your product special? The GOAT Mug has a story a different shape and an incredibly smart solution on how you put it on the table and carry it around. It’s definitely not your average coffee mug. On the contrary it’s a great conversation starter and get’s all eyes on you. What has been the best part of your startup experience? First it was just an idea and a big wish to make it come alive. On our way we had to solve many problems and we had to be aware of every small detail. We love coffee and design so I believe the GOAT STORY will soon surprise with more solution that will bring even more style to coffee drinking. I would also like to thank our community who believes in us and loves what we do. Baa :)
54`Product Description Ignite your creativity by unlocking the secrets of the Old Masters and reaching your full artistic potential with the LUCID-Art Camera Lucida! Like magic the LUCID-Art reflects an image of anything onto paper or canvas; just draw or paint over the image to quickly make an accurate sketch. More versatile than an art projector and works from life. From the Manufacturer Fun and Exciting! The LUCID-Art Camera Lucida will send shivers of excitement down your spine and you will quickly see why the old Masters might have found this kind of device so useful. The LUCID-Art Camera Lucida retains all the magic of the classic device, while offering all the solutions with a much larger, more stable and brighter image. You can even adjust the brightness of the image as needed. This transforms the camera lucida from a neat device into an indispensable art tool. Draw What You See! When you look through the LUCID-Art Camera Lucida you see whatever is in front of you reflected over your paper; you can draw right over the reflected image to get an accurate sketch: leaving you more time to develop your art without being frustrated by the technical elements. Solving the Lighting Problem The LUCID-Art eliminates all the traditional lighting problems with the camera lucida by incorporating two shatter proof optical filters that can be placed in the LUCID-Art; interchanged and combined to create nine brightness levels instantly without any lighting changes. This feature makes a huge difference-it’s like night and day! Solving the Image Size Problem The LUCID-Art is light, compact and portable, yet you still get a jumbo sized image because we discovered a new way of increasing the size of the image without increasing the size of the mirrors and maximize the size of the image at every height. Solving the Image Stability Problem The LUCID-Art has the more stable mirror type lucida image and is supported by a solid mechanical arm that is steadied by a second diagonal cross support arm; thus, eliminating wobbling and giving you the most stable image possible, while ensuring that the support arms will not get in your way as you draw. The image is still a virtual image, so it will move if your head moves, but you will have a solid place to anchor your head. And if you move your head or want to take a break, then you can easily line your marks back up with the image and continue drawing. Make Everyone an Artist, and Every Artist a Master! Making the magic of the Old Masters relevant again through workmanship, innovation, and new applications. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Best Lucida Ever How did you come up with the idea for this product? I leaned about the camera lucida while taking a college painting class, and immediately started thinking up ways to build on and improve the devise. And with some directions from my professor I built my first camera lucida out of salvaged crates that I pulled from a trash pile at work. I spent years working, researching, experimenting, building camera lucidas, and selling my various creations to artists all over the world. This allowed me to fund my efforts and test the effectiveness of my work while incorporating the input and ideas I got in the process of making them. Here is a video link to the full story: https://youtu.be/DZNRT9lNZ8o What makes your product special? The camera lucida was one of those magical techniques used by the Great Masters, such as Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, which had been all but lost. The old models had some annoying problems: their image was small, dim, and unsteady. Additionally, a decent unit was expensive. These issues caused people’s interest in the device to quickly dissipate. With the LUCID-Art I worked to make the best camera lucida possible and retain the device’s exquisite characteristics, while offering solutions to the problems: a much larger, brighter, and more stable image. My model even allows you to adjust the brightness of the image. These improvements transform the old-world camera lucida into a contemporary, indispensable, art tool. What has been the best part of your startup experience? I love the process of invention. Pacing back and forth, scribbling down ideas in the middle of the night. Build. Test. Smash. Repeat. Until the vision in my mind becomes a reality. Then when people from all over the world experience what began as just an idea, and that gets them going on their own creative pursuits—the circle is complete.

116`Product Description Auzoud Organic Cosmetic Argan Oil is ethically sourced from a women-founded cooperative that guarantee fair wages and sustainable practices to protect the argan forests of southwestern Morocco. Many argan sources use illegal deforestation, contributing to the degradation of the argan tree. To better safeguard and sustain this endemic tree, this cooperative sources their argan oil from a monitored and protected UNESCO world heritage site. Great for treatment of all skin and hair types. From the Manufacturer CERTIFIED ORGANIC USDA Organic Certification guarantees the highest quality. PERFECT FOR ALL SKIN AND HAIR TYPES Deeply moisturizing for all skin and hair types. SUSTAINABLY HARVESTED Cultivated on a protected UNESCO World Heritage site. SUPPORTS NORTH AFRICAN WOMEN FARMERS Grown by a women-run farming cooperative in Morocco. TRADITIONALLY PREPARED Hand-pressed to maintain unique moisturizing qualities and golden color. Auzoud's mission is to empower Moroccan women and youth farmers as they obtain fair prices and a more sustainable livelihood for themselves and their families. In addition to offering only the finest authentic Moroccan foods, Auzoud is committed to working with women and youth farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive, saffron and argan farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Many of the farmers are single mothers hoping to send their children to school. Auzoud has been founded by the grandson of one such farmer. Our partner cooperatives are based on membership participation and fair prices, allowing women to feed their families and educate their children. Improving the socio-economic situation, health and education of women and youth has an immediate and lasting impact on the well-being of families and the preservation of the local culture and community. We are focused on expanding the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. More than argan. How did you come up with the idea for this product? I was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud/auzoud means “olive” in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud’s waters contribute to the region’s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation...it has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping family and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma. After moving to the U.S. I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors’ land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region. Now we have expanded and are working with three cooperatives in Morocco. All cooperative members are small-scale farmers, many of them single mothers and young people hoping for a stable income to help their families. We hope you enjoy our products and share them with your family, as we do, and that you understand Auzoud to be an offering that unites our regions, languages, cultures and religions. As such, Auzoud's logo is the dove carrying an olive branch - a universal symbol of hope and peace - in reflection of this wish for shared prosperity and peace between our communities and across the world. What makes your product special? Auzoud Organic Argan Oil is sourced directly from a women-run farmers' cooperative in the countryside of Morocco. A purchase with Auzoud guarantees fair wages and healthy working conditions for hundreds of small farmers throughout the region. What has been the best part of your startup experience? By far the best part of our startup experience has been connecting and working closely with hundreds of small farmers from my home region. I love engaging with them and learning their stories. Like my grandfather, most of the farmers we work with have farmland that has been passed down for many generations. As they finally, now, receive fair pay for their products, many farming families are able to greatly improve their quality of life and transform local conditions by, for example, sending their children to school. We are grateful for the opportunity to contribute in this way!

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Perfected Elegant Simplicity How did you come up with the idea for this product? While living in a tiny Paris apartment, surrounded by great food and art, I was disheartened by the burned coffee poured out of moka pots used in almost every home. I said to myself that there is a need for a micro sized device that produces great espresso shots as good as those from the great lever machines. The Nomad is the realization of this vision. Traditional espresso machines for home or for business are exceedingly big, heavy, complex, expensive, and difficult to use. Home machines produce inferior results and they still occupy too much precious countertop space in those tiny Paris apartments. The Nomad has a small foot print, needs no electricity, operates manually, and produces optimal brewing conditions time after time without frustrating failures. Even users with no espresso making experience can successfully make great espresso shots, right away the very first time they put their hands on the Nomad. What makes your product special? For some users it is the stunning design ("an absolute work or art"). For others it is the ease of use and the quality of espresso produced ("My opinion is the espresso is better than most espressos in cafes, hotels or restaurants"). For others it is the combination of everything that creates the Nomad Experience ("If perfection is possible....that's my Nomad"). The Nomad works and looks like nothing before it. It is a completely new design concept that defines a whole new coffee making experience. The Micro Lever architecture is a radical rebirth of the classic lever machine that miniaturizes and simplifies the whole concept while retaining the best features of the manual lever water pump. A water pump directly operated by hands enables live monitoring and instant control of the brewing pressure, which yields superior results. However, trained expertise in the precise grinding and tamping techniques is required to pull a successful shot of espresso with the classic lever machines. To get rid of the training requirement and make it easier for the novice users, we invented the True Crema Valve, which compensates for grinds and tamping variations to assure a perfect emulsification of beneficial oils that makes up the beautiful crema of an espresso shot. The Nomad is simply the most dramatic development in manual lever espresso machines in over 50 years. It has a completely new look, feel, size and operation. As users pump the lever, watch the pressure gauge, adjust the pumping speed, seeing the golden crema fill the cup and taste the coffee, it becomes an addicting personal connection between man and machine - it is the Nomad experience - and like no other. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Seeing users using Nomad for the first time pulling top notch espresso shots rivaling those from trained baristas and seeing the Nomad becoming an indispensible part of their coffee lifestyle. During the Kickstarter campaign there was much skepticism that a simple small device could produce great espresso shots that would rival those made by trained baristas using advanced professional machines. However, once they received their Nomads the doubters became converted enthusiasts and reported how shocked they were at the superb results produced by their Nomad. "I have to say, best Kickstarter project I've received, and the only Kickstarter project that delivered exactly what they promised, I am pleased to say Nomad has exceeded my expectation of ... how you don't need an expensive industrial machine to pull a very nice cup of espresso." "this is one of the most professional products I've received from Kickstarter. Beautiful design and build, well packed and a pleasure to use. I have quite a few coffee machines including a La Pavoni Lever and this is so much easier to use and produces a great crema" " I feel confident that I can make lattes better than the best coffee shop here in Vancouver, and you can use that as a testimonial" "This isn't just a well-designed espresso maker; it's a work of art"

367`Product Description Do you know that sharing with others, expressing our opinions, and joining a community are all actions that generate money? Smart Money Maker is a collaborative card game for 2-6 players that illustrates the rules of collaborative consumption. The New Economy is based on a simple concept:circulating assets earns returns. Profit is generated by sharing personal resources. The goal of the game is to pay for all debts inherited from the old economy. The sum of the debt is higher than the sum of cash available! Consequently, players must collaborate. They receive a portfolio of cards that represent the New Economy models as, for example, car or house sharing, recycling, and using free services online. These New Economy cards have a virtual value and can be traded in for cash when they are used to pay off debts. After the whole deck has been used, if all of the debts have been paid off by the players, the player who has the most cash wins the game. To start, each player draws one debt card, two banknotes, and four New Economy cards. After dealing these cards, the dealer then shuffles the remaining cards, except for the banknotes, and places them in a deck. The banknotes are kept face up on the table, separated by value. Each player begins his or her turn by drawing one card from the deck and then playing one card at a time. The first player must put down a debt card. Then, in a clockwise direction, all players must take turns contributing to the payment request or putting down a new debt card. When a player fully pays off a debt, he or she will be able to collect the New Economy cards on the table traded in for cash. When the deck has no remaining cards and if the players are able to pay off all of the debt, the winner is the player with the most banknotes! However, even with player collaboration, it is still possible that the players will not be able to pay off all the debt cards. In this case, the game is the winner! 1. Does this game play best with two or more players? The game can be played with 2 to 6 players. The rules are the same regardless of the number of players. The purpose is to engage in conversations about collaborative consumption. It’s already fun with two players, and with more players, you can create different strategies to win. 2. Is there a second edition of SMM yet? No. Currently, only a first and limited edition (only 300 copies!) is available. But I invite customers to download the updated rules from my website (http://www.laurencehumier.com). 3. How long does it take to learn the rules? It only takes five minutes! By watching this video created by Bearded Meeple, a game reviewer, you will get a quick overview of the rules. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDkTvBjOxFw From the Manufacturer Advantages of the New Economy The old capitalist era was based on the accumulation of money and goods. In the late 1990s, a New Economy related to the dissemination of information and digital technologies was born. Today, the pennywise who follow the rules of the old economy keep their assets out of circulation, earning low returns, paying taxes, and running losses. In the New Economy, the one who moves their investments wins. Engagement for Collaborative Consumption Smart Money Maker is a tool starts conversations in family households or among company colleagues about online reputation, new models of income, and saving money via the use of collaborative platforms. During the game, it is interesting to observe the different attitudes of the players regarding the debts to be paid off. Some players are spenders, savers, wise, enterprising, individual, or collaborative! Smart Money Maker is a game as well as a team-building tool! What you get The playing cards comes in a beautiful serigraphy packaging shaped as a match box that contains the 154 cards. Limited edition Smart Money Maker is a first edition made in Italy. Buy what you know Updated rules and a free print-and-play version can be found at http://www.laurencehumier.com. High-quality products, personally curated! I am a Belgian-born, Milan-based designer and engineer. For the last 15 years, I've been working closely with Italian manufacturers. I personally curate every detail of the concept, illustrations, and fabrication of my projects. My ability involves translating a concept into a product, providing communication services and products, education, and the creative industry. I debuted at an international level when one of my creations was included in the permanent collection of New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Collaborative Card Game How did you come up with the idea for this product? A couple of years ago, I read an article in an economic journal describing how Google creates wealth with a stream of information, just like banks generate it with a stream of money. I thought that most people try to accumulate money and goods while keeping their assets out of circulation. In the New Economy era, those people earn low returns, pay taxes, and run losses. So I have invented a card game based on a simple concept: profit is generated by sharing personal resources. During the summer of 2015, I developed the rules and illustrated the cards. I have organized different game evenings with friends and expert players to proof the game. We had a lot fun! Last November, I had a prototype of the game made in order to launch a Kickstarter campaign. The project was successfully funded! What makes your product special? The idea of using cards rather than a digital app is meant to touch a larger audience across generations that are not digitally savvy but could benefit from the collaborative economy. The game is for anyone from 10-99 years old. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Testing the game with friends, backers, and expert players! We had a lot fun! It’s an exciting feeling to participate in a new game and see it come into existence! Through those playing evenings, I've learned a lot. I was invited to OuiShare Festival in Paris last May to present the game to collaborative economy enthusiasts! By visiting my website, you can download an upgraded version of the rules.

55`Color:White Product Description Turn any dimmable bulb into a smart light with emberlight Socket. Just screw in a bulb - that's it. No complex wireless hub to install and configure. From the Manufacturer Keep your style Use your existing bulbs. Full brightness control of any mix of incandescent (max. 40W) and dimmable CFL or LED bulbs. Set the mood A single tap creates any mood with pre-set light levels. Set the mood by dimming a group of sockets with a single touch. Simplicity No hub, no wires, no starter pack. We use a combination of WiFi and Bluetooth LE to make the setup process very simple. You can setup all of your emberlight Sockets on your WiFi network at the same time in less than a minute. Security Connected devices are either simple or secure. It's rare that you can find a product that has both. We've got experts on our team that have found a way to achieve simplicity at a high level of security. Uptime Connected devices are either very responsive, or they offer remote access via the internet. We wanted both, so we incorporated Bluetooth LE and WiFi. When you are nearby the Socket will detect that and "fall forward" to Bluetooth for control directly from your phone. When you walk away, it will "fall back" to WiFi to allow access from anywhere in the world via the internet. Simple Smart Lighting At emberlight, we think home automation should be simple, versatile and approachable to everyone. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Simple. Secure. Useful. How did you come up with the idea for this product? We saw that many "smart home" solutions were incredibly hard to install, set-up and use. We wanted the promise of smart lighting, but also wanted to retain control of the quality of the light source. Putting the connectivity into a light socket seemed like a very logical and elegant approach. What makes your product special? We've built a team based on diverse expertise, experience, and passion. We want you to share in emberlight's vision to bring simple and versatile smart lighting to every home. What has been the best part of your startup experience? We are a small team and all of us have enjoyed stretching ourselves in our own fields, while learning about the rest of the team's areas of expertise.

40`Product Description Back to the Roots is on a mission to Undo Food. In a college class, we learned mushrooms could grow entirely on spent coffee grounds. After watching hours of how-to videos and turning our fraternity kitchen into a big science experiment, we eventually decided to give up our corporate job offers to instead become full-time mushroom farmers. What started as curiosity about urban farming has turned into a passion to Undo Food and reconnect families back to where it comes from. From the Manufacturer $248,873 raised with 4,097 backers. Includes all this and more! This 3-gallon fish tank is a closed-loop, self-cleaning ecosystem. Using the science of aquaponics, the fish waste naturally fertilizes the plants above and, in turn, the plants clean the water for the fish. Great for small pet fish and growing fresh, organic herbs. The Water Garden includes: *Fish tank and gravel *Organic seeds and grow stones *Natural fertilizer *Coupon for a Betta fish *Fish food *Silent, submersible water pump Designed and manufactured in the USA "Yes please!" ""Fresh herbs and lettuces with no watering or fertilizing, plus a pet fish? Yes please!"" --Cooking Light ""It's a match made in ecology"" --Better Homes and Gardens ""This is a must have"" --Food Babe ""A parenting homerun"" --goop.com The Self-cleaning Cycle 1. Fish produce ammonia-rich waste which can become toxic for your fish if allowed to accumulate. 2. Beneficial bacteria in your Water Garden converts the ammonia into nitrates. These naturally occurring bacteria grow really well in your plant pots. 3. Nitrates are amazing food for plants! As the plants continuously uptake the nitrates as nutrients for growth, they are also cleaning the water for your fish. The Science Inside Aquaponics is a closed-loop, sustainable farming method that combines traditional aquaculture (raising aquatic animals) and hydroponics (growing plants without soil). It uses 90% less water than traditional farming. Did You Know? *Aquaponic farming goes as far back as Mesopotamia (Mesopotamians are also known for farming the world's first cereal crops) *Aquatic plants and aerators are typically added to aquaponics system to increase oxygen and reduce algae build up.

About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Handheld 3D Creation How did you come up with the idea for this product? In Spring 2012 our 3D printer had almost completed a 14-hour print when it missed a line, leaving an unplanned gap in the print. A small error had ruined hours of work, and we were going to have to start again. Then inspiration hit: “what if we just took the head of the printer off and filled in the gap?” A day later the 3Doodler was born. The first 3Doodler was a clumsy-looking, hand-assembled, device; a collection of gears, a heater unit, and the printer-head of our now dismantled 3D printer. The words “3Doodler” were etched onto its side in green and red in felt tip pen. The 3Doodler Create is the third generation of this product, and it just keeps getting better and better! What makes your product special? The 3Doodler Create is the latest version of the world's best selling 3D Printing Pen.

However, they have one thing in common; they’re all sweet. And sometimes, sweet just won’t satisfy. The idea was born during a 3 hour airplane ride; 2 hours since lunch and another 3 hours before dinner. A glass of tomato juice in hand from the flight attendant and a choice between pretzels, chips or the SWEET snack bar brought along for the trip. The salty snacks naturally taste great with juice, but who needs empty calories? Why isn’t there a guilt-free, nutritious, savory snack bar on the market that tastes great? The idea of Savory Harvest was born. What makes your product special? We combine healthy nuts and seeds with vegetables and zesty spices. This is truly savory, not just adding some spices to a sweet snack bar. What has been the best part of your startup experience? We are foodies at heart. Eating for inspiration, experimenting in the kitchen, and sampling with customers for feedback to get to that Eureka moment - "This taste great, like Sriracha!"

The Dual Snap design makes it easy to both detach the Fob from your belt loop and detach individual keys from the Fob. From the Manufacturer Entirely Handcrafted in USA The Dual Snap Key Fob is constructed from a single piece of vegetable-tanned leather, hand-cut from one of our rugged, full grain Steer hides. We stamp and finish it using simple hand tools for an entirely handcrafted product, proudly Made-in-the-USA. As Secure As It Is Functional Heavy-duty steel hardware makes this Dual Snap Key Fob as secure as it is functional. All-Natural Vegetable-tanned leather is meant to break in over time and become more supple with age and use. We use only vegetable-tanned leather because it is completely all-natural and develops a unique and beautiful patina that is entirely your own. Friendly Additionally, vegetable-tanned leather is friendly, requires skilled craftsmen to produce and dye, and smells like leather, not chemicals. All of this ensures our Multi Tool Cases are of the highest quality and craftsmanship and will not wear away with age or use. No Thread Stitching Over time, the heat and friction from pulling your wallet out of your pocket and putting it back in, fray thread which is why most sheaths fall apart.

We guarantee our products for life because it ensures we'll never cut corners. If your product fails, it's our responsibility.

We strive to achieve this higher standard in all that we do, every day, and we appreciate your business and will never take it for granted. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Simple, Stylish, American How did you come up with the idea for this product? My wallet fell apart... Again. And I was sick of having to replace it every couple of years. So, I decided to make a wallet that could last forever, or as long as I wanted to keep it. My wallets always fell apart at the seams. While leather is incredibly durable and thread stitching can withhold a tremendous amount of pressure, I recognized that thread stitching does not hold up well against the constant friction that results from pulling your wallet out of your pocket and putting it back in. I started experimenting with different designs for a new wallet, one of which was made from a single piece of leather to reduce the number of seams in my wallet. I had to simplify the design, which allowed me to work with thicker leathers to enhance it's overall durability and strength. Then, instead of using thread stitching, I secured the wallet using metal rivets, which have an equally strong hold against pressure, but hold up even better against heat and friction, which actually just polished the metal heads of the rivets securing my wallet. Now I apply that design concept to any products I create to ensure long-lasting durability. What makes your product special? To me, the coolest thing about my products are how unique they looks with rivets and no thread stitching. Don't get me wrong, I love that they are ultra-durable and high-end as well, but before we had our success with Kickstarter, any time I'd pull out one of my designs, people would notice it and it was an instant conversation-starter. I loved that. After Kickstarter, I got a ton of E-Mails from backers who had similar experiences with their products where they would pull one out and people would just notice it, because it's so unique. Now that our Brand has become more recognizable, when people see one of our products they know it's an American Bench Craft design without having to look at the inside tag or find the logo. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The responses I get from customers. Our products don't just look different than most other leather goods, but they feel different too. We get a lot of E-Mails from leather enthusiasts who receive their product and are impressed with the high quality leather we use. They just rave about it and how it's about time someone started making leather goods designed to never fall apart. It's been over two years since we sent our first batch of wallets out to our original Kickstarter backers using our riveted construction design concept and we still get random E-Mails from people praising how well the wallet has held up and how it's going strong and they are adding it into their wills. It's gratifying and makes the whole experience worthwhile.

104`Color:White Product Description Tired of constantly replacing your USB chargers? Put a stop to broken cables with Snakable. Snakables' are beautifully designed USB cables for Apple devices, that have rotating armor protection at the connectors, to protect the cable's fragile joints from over-bending. Easily frayed and broken cables, a once common occurrence is now a thing of the past with our exclusive, patent-pending design that incorporates a moving strain relief system for advanced protection. From the Manufacturer Ball-Joint Strain Relief System Snakable takes aim at the “USB Cable Epidemic” with its armor, that protects the cable at it’s fragile joints, allowing it to bend and flex, without over-bending and breaking. Snakable’s armor is a ball-in-socket joint system, which keeps the internal wiring from bending beyond a 60 degree bend radius, where the jacket, and internal wiring, begin to feel the majority of stress movement. Users are still able to obtain 90 degrees of flexure, without risking damage to their cable, as the fragile areas (the connectors) are protected. Made For iPhone iPad iPod (MFI) Certified Snakable cables are MFI Certified by Apple and guaranteed to work seamlessly with all of your compatible gear with a lightning port. Including iPhone, iPod, and iPad. What does that really mean? It means never again see the dreaded "This Accessory May Not Function Properly", but more importantly it means your device is safe from cheap uncertified components and materials that can decrease performance and potentially damage your expensive device. Slim Connector Fits Most Cases Snakable Lightning cables' slim connector, allow a comfy fit inside most device protective cases. Including the Otterbox and Lifeproof, which are notorious for being non-compatible with anything other than Apple standard cables. 4 Foot (1.2m) Cable Length Standard cables are an incredibly short 3ft in length, leaving us always looking for just a little more. While 6ft cables are great by the nightstand, they aren't always practical. Snakable cables come in at standard 4ft, not too long and not too short. Goldilocks' approved! 3 Year Warranty We aren't saying Snakable is indestructible, we just promise that you will get what you paid for. A cable that will hold up to normal use and not break on you. Our dedication to excellence is shown through our 3 year warranty that is included with every cable. The USB Cable Reinvented Snakable takes aim at the issue of easily broken USB cables (Sound Familiar?) with its armor that protects the cable at it's fragile joints, allowing it to bend and flex, without over-bending and breaking. Snakable's armor is a patent-pending ball-in-socket joint system, which keeps the internal wiring from bending beyond a 60 degree bend radius, where the jacket and internal wiring begin to feel the majority of stressed movement. Users are still able to obtain 90 degrees of flexure, without risking damage to their cable, as the fragile areas (the connectors) are protected. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Beautiful. Armored. Cable. How did you come up with the idea for this product? Snakable came from years of frustration due to buying USB cables, sometimes in bulk, to replace the poorly designed cables I seemed to always find. But really it came down to one night when I was fixing a cable for my fiancé. I thought to myself, with all the advancements in technology, why hasn't the issue of easily broken USB cables been addressed? I drew a quick sketch that night, with a design based on the way snakes move. More specifically, the plastic toy snake, that are given away as prizes at carnivals. Some time later I decided to bring the design to Kickstarter and let the community decide whether or not Snakable were to become a reality. What makes your product special? A quick search here on Amazon will yield thousands of search results for USB cables. What makes Snakable special is the patent-pending ball joint assembly. Snakable is the only cable on the market to utilize a moving strain relief system. There are other cables on the market that claim to be "Heavy Duty", however those strain-relief methods utilize static (non-moving) extension. Snakable truly relieves the strain from your connector by moving with your cable, while others simply stiffen the cable along the connector. What has been the best part of your startup experience? Being a crowdfunded startup allowed for the unique experience of interacting and working with people from all walks of life, from all around the globe. The Snakable Kickstarter campaign has 1,335 backers from over 97 countries. It is very humbling to realize that a product you dreamed up is sitting in cars, living rooms, offices etc., all over the world. Its more so, that those backers put their hard earned money into Snakable, not really knowing if or when they were going to receive a working product. Its pretty amazing really, I still keep in touch with many of our backers.

That’s why we’re a proud sponsor of charity: water and partner with them in their mission to bring safe drinking water to over 750 million people without access to it.

FILTER FACTS The Water Quality Association has tested and certified the Soma filter to NSF/ANSI Standard 42 requirements for the reduction of chlorine, taste and odor. We wanted to build something sustainable. Because polluting water while manufacturing products that enhance water wouldn’t make any sense at all. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Smart. Beautiful. Sustainable. How did you come up with the idea for this product? One night during a dinner party, our founder, Mike del Ponte was hesitant to put his cheap plastic “other brand” water filter on his nicely set table. Mike decided to pour his filtered water into a glass wine decanter. Unfortunately (or fortunately) as he did, the lid of the water pitcher fell off, causing water to gush all over the kitchen floor. As he cleaned up the mess, he thought, “Why can’t someone create a water filter that’s beautifully designed, easy to use, and made of sustainable materials?” Soma was born. The rest is water under the bridge. What makes your product special? Soma is the only water filter with 100% plant-based filtration. Distinguished by its clean, modern design, Soma also gives back by donating clean drinking water to those in need through charity: water. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The most difficult part of designing the Soma Pitcher was finding the perfect wooden handle. We needed something that is both beautiful and durable, so oak as a wood species was always at the top of our list. The challenge was finding a wood supplier in the U.S. committed to sustainable practices and detailed craftsmanship. Fortunately, we found the perfect partner in Southern Oregon.|

We started the company because we couldn't find a truly natural and great tasting gum in the market. It turns out that the regular chewing gum you see on grocery store shelves is filled with artificial substances, including some of the same components used in the manufacture of car tires, plastic bottles, and white glue, as well as artificial sweeteners like aspartame. Consumers are kept in the dark about what they are chewing because the FDA allows conventional gum brands to hide up to 80 synthetic ingredients in the catch-all term "gum base" on the label. We knew we could do better. In New York, our gum chefs craft the best ingredients into the highest quality gum on the market. The result is a lightly sweetened, totally natural gum that’s better for your body and the environment. Simply Gum makes all natural premium chewing gum, without any plastic, synthetics, or artificial flavors. The result is a lightly sweetened, totally natural gum that's better tasting, better for your body, and better for the environment. Because we only use natural ingredients, our gum is not only better for your body, it's also biodegradable and better for the planet. Our innovative packaging includes post-chew wrappers to make it easy to dispose of when complete. Each order contains 6 packs with 15 pieces each, for a total of 90 pieces of gum.Regular chewing gum is packed with artificial substances that are potentially toxic, including plastic, aspartame, and BHT. Unlike conventional gum brands, Simply Gum uses all natural ingredients without ANY synthetics. Do you dream in peppermint tea? Do you live for mint candy? Look no further, we have the perfect minty treat for you.

The Moff Band was an overnight Kickstarter smart toy sensation, and its initial funding goal was met within just 48 hours. Major publications, including Gizmodo, USA Today, Engadget, Fortune, The Daily Dot, Mashable and Popular Mechanics have covered the launch of this innovative toy. And the response from consumers has been just as enthusiastic. About the Startup Describe your product in 3 words. Active, Imaginative, Kids How did you come up with the idea for this product? I saw that there was a problem with toys that ended up sitting dormant on floors and in closets while kids had their eyes glued to the screen. The idea came to me to empower the intuitive imagination found in each and every child with active movement through the technology of a wearable. What makes your product special? Kids are more active with the Moff Band and feel encouraged to be creative. By using the universal language of movement, our wearable smart toy empowers each and every child to imagine. Also, the Moff Band is fun for the whole family – brothers and sister can play together and grandma can jump in anytime! What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of my startup experience has been the challenge. Specifically, at Moff we have challenged ourselves to empower kids to use their imagination by recognizing their 3D motion using only a wrist band. We feel like we have done a pretty good job so far of enabling all types of kids to get up, move and even learn a little bit. And we have enjoyed every minute of it. #productDescription { color: #333333; word-wrap: break-word; font-size: small; line-height: initial; margin: 0.5em 0px 0em 25px; } #productDescription_feature_div > h2.default { color: #CC6600; font-size: medium; margin: 0 0 0.25em; } #productDescription_feature_div > h2.books { color:#333 !important; font-size:21px !important; line-height: 1.3; padding-bottom: 4px; font-weight: normal; margin: 0px; } #productDescription_feature_div > h2.softlines { color:#333 !important; font-size:21px !important; line-height: 1.3; padding-bottom: 4px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0px; } #productDescription > p, #productDescription > div, #productDescription > table { margin: 0 0 1em 0; } #productDescription p { margin: 0em 0 1em 1em; } #productDescription h3 { font-weight: normal; color: #333333; font-size: 1.23em; clear: left; margin: 0.75em 0px 0.375em -15px; } #productDescription table { border-collapse: inherit !important; margin-bottom: 0; } #productDescription table img { max-width: inherit !important; } #productDescription table td { font-size: small; vertical-align: inherit !important; } #productDescription ul li { margin: 0 0 0 20px; } #productDescription ul li ul { list-style-type: disc !important; margin-left: 20px !important; } #productDescription ul ul li { list-style-type: disc !important; margin-left: 20px !important; } #productDescription > ul ul li { list-style-type: disc !important; } #productDescription ul li ul li { margin: 0 0 0 20px; } #productDescription .aplus p { margin: 0 0 1em 0; } #productDescription small { font-size: smaller; } #productDescription.prodDescWidth { max-width: 1000px } P.when('jQuery').execute(function($){ $("#productDescription table").each(function() { var width = $(this).attr('width'); if (width) width += 'px'; else width = 'auto'; $(this).css('width', width); var padding = $(this).attr('cellpadding'); if (padding) padding += 'px'; else padding = '0px'; $(this).css('padding', padding); }); });
220`|Style Name:With Coffee Filter || Color:Matte Black Product Description The smell of freshly ground beans. The rising steam. The rich flavor of those first sips. A truly great cup of coffee has the power to transport and inspire. Yet when on the go, we often settle for a convenient cup that falls short, a harried hustle out the door, a crowded commute, a day of back to back meetings, chasing after the kids.

They get beneath the grinds and filter twice, leaving all of the flavor and none of the grit. A Truly Great Cup of Coffee Wait 3 to 4 minutes, then press and serve. You can adjust the amount of coffee and time to change the strength of your coffee for personal preference. Reward Yourself with Great Taste Combined with our patented filtration that stops extraction as soon as the press is pushed down, this means your beverage will not only be hot when you want it, it will taste perfect when you're ready to enjoy it!

We design products that make better coffee and tea, and are built to last. And we guarantee it. Friends for Life.|

We wanted to mount our iPhones to our bikes so we could use the navigation app while riding. After searching around for a good solution we became frustrated that there was not a decent solution that offered a secure, convenient way mounting a phone to a bike. As the saying goes, if you can't find something that meets your needs you have to go make it yourself. So we did exactly that. What makes your product special? Two things make Quad Lock the best system on the market. One, it's the lightest, strongest and most secure iPhone mount available! The patented dual stage lock is so secure you don't need a lanyard and its strong enough to lift 100Kg! Two, the Quad Lock case. It looks and feels like a normal case but its impact resistant and has the Quad Lock mount recess built into the back so it's always ready for action. Just attach it to any of the Quad Lock mounts and you're set for cycling, running, driving, taking photos or just living everyday life with your iPhone securely by your side! What has been the best part of your startup experience? The best part of our startup is making products which people love. At first we thought it might just be the Kickstarter community sharing their enthusiasm for a product they backed but as time has gone by more and more people email us or drop into the office just to say how much they appreciate the design and quality of the Quad Lock products.

Electronic building blocks How did you come up with the idea for this product? A few years ago, our founder was working at another company and was tasked with monitoring the temperatures of a server room. He got tired of getting up and walking to that room all the time so he created an Arduino project to do it for him. It worked, but the device was clunky and required tons of soldering and complicated coding. He decided to simplify DIY electronics and so Microduino and mCookies were created. As Bill Gates put it best, “I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it. What makes your product special? Each module is about the size of a quarter. They are magnetically stackable, which means users do not have to know complex coding or soldering to use the mCookie. Also, our wide array of peripheral sensors, modules, accessories makes DIY projects amazingly easy without the worries of compatibility. What has been the best part of your startup experience? The most stressful part of managing a startup is constantly worrying about whether it’s going to thrive or flop. When our Kickstarter received backing over 500% of our goal, that was a moment of validation from our fans and it was amazing.
