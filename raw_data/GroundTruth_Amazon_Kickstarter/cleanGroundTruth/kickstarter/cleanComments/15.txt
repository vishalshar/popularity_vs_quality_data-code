@diana paredes i just messaged you with additional information on your nanohold order!
@jon pang i am so happy that you like your nanohold! you made some excellent points! thanks! and, yes! we do have a website www.nanohold.com
i haven't received it, do you have a tracking number???
actually you don't need to clean it every time you take out from your pocket. you just need to put the plastic card (supplied) back on to the nano pad after using it before you slide your phone into your pocket. i thought that is quite a common sense thingy for a product like this. furthermore it's quite obvious that some users didn't read the instructions before using it. i ordered 10 and gave some to my friends as gifts and so far all of them love this product and asked if they could get it on their own. as such can i check if there is any website that my friends can look out for to order nano pads?
@elias cotton so sorry you haven't received it yet! you should have yours by now since you are in the us. i just messaged you to verify some of your information!
i'm in the usa and still waiting to get my shipment.
@liao zhiwei the nanosuction surface does accumulate dirt, lent, oils, etc. as you use it. this is why we include the nanohold protective cover. it is very important to use this cover card to protect the nanosuction surface, this way you will not need to clean it before each use.
@santy muliawan great!  @rasmus barner it is definitely on the way, hopefully it will arrive soon!
got mine. tried on my phone. worked well. put my phone in my pocket. and has never worked since. peeled it off and threw away. that's $9 down the drain. even if cleaning it would helped, i wouldn't clean it every time i take the phone out from my pocket.
still waiting on mine :-(
mine arrived today - jakarta, indonesia
@andre breiler thanks for the feedback! great suggestions! we will definitely look into the indicator idea!
@john anthony mariquit @luigi bertini great to hear! hope you enjoy your nanohold!
got mine today. based in italy.
got mine last week. works fine. one note for improvement, it would be nice if it could be removed from the device again too. for the moment i've stuck two nanoholds back to back which are holding an rasperypi to the wall in the kitchen. i don't know how easy it is but would be cool to have some indication (e.g. colour change or electrical change which could be picked up by nfc) when it is about to fall off. similar to some suction cups which show a red indicator.
got mine today.  based in singapore.
@de your order was mailed out on 26 october 2015. it is on its way to you! it should arrive within 35 days of being mailed. it was sent in a standard, white, business envelope (not as a parcel), so it should arrive with your normal mail! thanks!
hi, haven't received yet. i am based in india, any update on the same ?
@siegfried if the nanosuction surface gets dirty, use cellophane tape to clean it! cellophane tape is the best cleaning method, other than that you can also try dripping water on it and rubbing it with some water to get the dirt and particles up then dab it with a cloth to remove them, finally let it air dry the rest of the way.
thanks for the great feedback @rowland van rijn, @josh, @chi wong, and @frosty froze!
hy i dont checked out for what the card was..no i know that.. ;-) is there any option to clean the nano side on mobile phone?
gotim in canada a week ago.
got mine today. backer from uk. great product
thank you (:
awesome product, thanks!
@alexandre lejeune --glad the tape worked for you!  @mario peric -- great to hear! thank you for supporting u! @chris cheung -- wonderful! so glad to hear that! also, happy you got it in a reasonable amount of time; its great to have feedback on how long they take to arrive in the various countries!
got the mail on friday @ hk  works great!
works well,thanks
thanks for your answer i have try to clean with cellophane tape and this results is very good my phone weight 220g and the nanohold function very good
@alexandre lejeune they do start accumulating dust, dirt, oils, and other debris as you use them. this is why it is important to use them on clean surfaces, use the cover when not in use, and clean with a damp cloth or by using cellophane tape to remove particles that are clogging the nanosuction cells.
@david all australia orders were mailed out october 16, so you should be getting yours soon!
@ 張鐘允  我不知道天将需要到达的具体数量。它应该到达在7至35天。 (i do not know the exact number of days it will take to arrive. it depends on the postal services. it should arrive in 7 to 35 days.)
@benjamin gelhard  glad you are enjoying it! nanoholds do have a strong suction for the first use! if anyone is worried about this, you can rub your hand on the nanosuction surface before your first use. you could also dab it a few times on a counter top or your clothing before your first use. you won't want to continue doing this as it clogs the nanosuction cells, they will naturally clog after your first use, this is why you should clean your nanohold and use the cover, but it will help it not stick really hard the first time!
the ideas is very good but after 2 utilisation the nanohold began a nest dust
anyone from australia receive theirs yet? i'm eager to get mine but no luck yet :p
台灣要多久可以收到
got mine a week ago in canada and just put it on today. works amazing and isn't even sticky which was surprising. almost got it stuck on my window the first time i tried it :). thank you!
@jac-y-do  you should receive yours soon! uk went out today!
@rick friesen  wonderful! glad you received yours! happy nanoholding! @adrian sullivan excellent! we are so happy you love your nanohold! and, we are glad you pledged too!
@john anthony mariquit   hopefully it won't get lost! just know it will arrive with your normal mail (like a letter), not as a parcel. maybe this means it will have a better chance of arriving! but if you don't have it in 35 days, let us know and we will figure something out!
@sergio castro jr.  you may not get yours the day other people in your country get theris (we mailed them out by country), but you will get it soon! if we have your mailing address as of today, your order will be mailed out today (if it hasn't already)! so you should get it in 7 to 35 days (depending on where you live, etc.)! thanks!
@ofir tapiero it is on its way! today, the last of the orders are being placed in the mail!
still waiting for mine in the uk... cant wait!!!:)
love love love using these. so glad i pledged.
received my nanoholds today in calgary alberta. so far, exactly as advertised. well done!
can't wait to get mine (hope it doesn't get lost in singpost which is known to have lose parcels that don't have tracking numbers from time to time).
hello nano hold team!!! i turned in my response with my shipping information alittle late like around 1 week ago because i was logged out of my email and didn't see the notification to respond to it sooner! i just was wondering even if it takes longer for me to still receive my reward! thank you!!
how can i know if my nanohold was sent to me?
@cedric maillot juillet it is on the way! don't forget, it was mailed in a standard, white business envelope (not a package) and will arrive with your normal mail. it should be there very soon! @durai wonderful! we can't wait for you to test it either! let us know what you think! enjoy!
@cuvellier great! they don't stick everywhere, but they do stick to many things! glad you are having fun testing it out! @vÉdeau wonderful! you're welcome (big you're welcome)! and thank you for supporting us!
@siegfried you are very welcome! thank you for supporting us! we are glad to make you happy! @yaming651130 not a problem! i am updating our shipping logs with the new info i get every day! we are scheduled to finish mailing out all of the nanohold this week! i will post another update when i have mailed everything out!
received mine yesterday. can't wait to test it :)
not receive mine .�
i have receive mine ! big thanks :)
just received mine and i just can't stop to test it everywhere (i found one place where it can't stuck ;) ) but it's so amazing how well it work
i forgot to follow up the update and just complete the survey today, when will i receive the item? thank you!
thank you the first project which delivered just in time! :-) you made my wife and me happy!
@diana paredes  we will post an update once all the orders have shipped!  -jenna faulkner and the nanohold team
@travis macaraeg  great idea to add a some layers so the nanohold is the same height as the edges of your case. glad your nanohold is working well! we provide the card so you have something, but the clear cover works too, or any similar material or card! when i go out of town, i often put my hotel key-card on it, this way i don't loose the key, and it keeps the nanohold clean! a friend laminated a picture and uses that! as long as you keep the nanohold safe and clean, it should keep working!  happy nanoholding!
@ruth haisma, @kb, @daniel peel  thanks for the awesome feed-back and kind words! glad you like it!  happy nanoholding!
received my yesterday... it's great!  thanks.. not my first backed... but my delivered product! great job guys... love the retail packaging it came in as well.
received my nanohold. love it ! now i get the use for th card that was with it. thank you ! btw your project is a great example of how kickstarter projects should get run.
i received my 2-pack yesterday. i had to add a couple of layers of tape to the back of my case because the "ridged rear defenders" (ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/71mqnhlgcwl._sl1500_.jpg) are thicker than the nanohold. the nanohold so far works well. i will use the clear plastic cover, not the thicker card, to protect the nanohold when not in use.
hi, how do i know if my order has been shipped?
got mine today....love it!
@boyce the great thing about nanohold is that it will continue working as long as the nanohold surface is clean. when the nanohold's nanosuction surface fills with dirt, dust, oils, etc., it limits and sometimes prevents the suction of the nanohold to the desired surface (window, counter, mirror, whiteboard, etc.). this is why it is important to use the cover we provide when you are not sticking your device up, and it is equally important to clean the nanohold surface regularly. if you do these things, the nanohold should continue to work! thanks for your question! please let me know if i can help you with anything else! happy nanoholding :) jenna faulkner and the nanohold team
whats the lifetime of nanohold
kickstarter has collected the fund from my credit card on 20 sep already. trust me, they are a lot more efficient than you think in fund collection... ;-)
kyle truong, as we mention in the campaign, nanohold works best on flat-backed devices. it will allow you to stick your phone to flat, nonporous surfaces...this means it will work on some walls, but not all walls. thanks and happy nanoholding! jenna faulkner  and the nanohold team
hello, i have a little concern due to the curved back of my htc e8. will nanohold safely stick my phone to a wall?
hey all,  no questions...checking out the questions here i may not know to ask.
@nick martin thank you for backing nanohold. we recommend two or more nanoholds for tablets depending upon the weight of the device. remember that suction is temporary. to answer your question directly, with a two or more clean nanoholds on a recommended surface, like glass the nanohold will hold a tablet. michael  the nanohold team
hi, would this carry the weight of the new ipad pro? thanks for your time - it's much appreciated.
@abdulwahab nanohold will ship on time.
since you got over your goal are you still confident you'll shit our reward on time( october )? or maybe early november?
@chris kron yes, you should leave the nanohold on and use the cover to keep it clean.
when i attach the nanohold on the back of my phone, can i leave it there permanently (maybe covered by some foil, until needed again)?
@creator: now that more than twice the funding goal has been achieved, have you given a thought an any possible stretch goals?
@durai: our fulfillment process does not allow custom mixing of white and black. you could order a 2 pack (1 white and 1 black) and a 1 black for the same amount or approximately the same amount.
@creator: i have backed for 3 pack. is it possible to opt for 2-black and 1-white nanoholds?
for any tablet, use at least 2 nanoholds. for heavier tablets use three. it is important that you keep your nanohold clean and choose your surface carefully so that the maximum amount of suction cups can work. always test your device on the surface before letting go of your device. if the nanohold is not snugly attached to the surface, do not let go of your device. also, nanohold, like all suction, is temporary. do not use for permanent or long-term applications. be smart and enjoy your nanohold safely.
may i know how many piece nanohold is needed to provide sufficient holding power for an ipad air 2? thanks
this is michael from nanohold. we provide a plastic cover (like a very thin credit card) to help keep your nanohold clean. nanoholds can be trimmed with scissors if needed. the credit card size fits most smartphones without trimming. the key to the strength is the number and condition of microscopic suction "cups" attaching to a flat, smooth, nonporous surface. best surfaces are glass, mirrors, metal, plastic, whiteboard, tile, stainless steel, and screens. during normal use it will pick up some debris in the suction cups. the key is to keep the nanohold strong is to clean out the debris regularly and keep it covered between uses. clean by wiping it with a damp cloth or paper towel, or by using cellophane tape for a waterless method of cleaning. a clean nanohold can hold a smartphone on any of the surfaces described above. the duration of hold over time is dependent upon the above factors.
great product in terms of strength how hutch can each one hold comfortable over an extended time period? will there be some kind of protect film that's offered to keep the film from being damaged once applied to a device? would it be recommended to cut them to fit if their too big for an application? thanks
