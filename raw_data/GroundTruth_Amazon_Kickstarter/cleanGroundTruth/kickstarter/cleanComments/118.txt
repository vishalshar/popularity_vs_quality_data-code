waiting for my balance 8% refund
got an email saying that they've sent the mini adapters to amazon and along with a full discount coupon code. i'm quite impressed by this.
still awaiting my refund too
nao ne?
no mini adaptor, no product, no refund yet, nothing. :(
no mini adapter as promised - yet. i'm still waiting and being hopeful that it will arrive.
hi guys if problem is with display port, no problem. drop this port, and finish product. open campaign with this "new product" and may be many people thinks ok.... the people likes this option can transfer donation to this new campaign
i don't receive the mini adapter... who got it?
i will be considerate, however being respectful requires receiving respect! i was an early backer to this project, my expectations have been mismanaged relentlessly, and i am beginning to suspect that crowdfunding is beginning to be a place where people raise money for vaporware, and completely fleece in the unsuspecting public. at this point, these people are not even responding to e-mail when you screenshot, and attach receipts, promises, shipping dates, and other such credentials… if no one is holding these people accountable — how is this a sustainable business model? if you announce a september ship date, don't tell me in october it's going to be late, told me in august! if i ran my business this way, and other people were just as flaky about their pledges, not one thing would ever get funded… beware of this group!
these guys are trying to raise money on yet another site for another "to be released" project just terrible ... how about deliver the first project? we are excited to let you know that zus is officially live. we just launched zus crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo. we're now over 160% funded and could use your support. get in on some awesome early bird reward packages. check out the campaign here and learn more about zus: http://igg.nonda.co.
how will i get my discount? the card i used is no longer valid
why not drop mini display port?
the honesty is sincerely appreciated!  i still love the idea of this product, and hope, you can find a solution.  i'd still love to purchase this product if/when you have a working solution for sale.  best of luck!
hope you find the solution, and are able to develop the hub. as some of the others, my credit card number has changed and i haven't received the mini adapter. thanks for your efforts.
anybody has not received mini adapter so far like me? i am in taiwan. leave a comment to them but got no reply for several days...
hello, i haven't been receiving any emails since i had it changed. please send me information for a refund. thanks!
hey nonda folks. i'm happy to wait until you iron out the kinks. the majority of options to create a multi-plug unit for the new macbook are frankly ghastly. your hub+ is good looking and i'm in no rush. feel free to hold onto my cash and i'll happily wait till you've got a solution in place. thanks
thanks for your honesty and the decision to refund all the backers due to the chipset problems. please let us know asap if you have found a solution that is fully working!
people who have received their mini adapter in the states, was it delivered by ups or usps?
Ну а хуле... Крутили в банке миллион долларов полгода...
a very responsible team for your upfront on the issue. i believe the team had also felt down on not getting the product to the market, but i doubt anyone of you should feel out .  knowing how honesty your team is, i am there to support you once you manage to find a way to the problem and make it to the market. thank you , for a trusted team like you, should always stay shine and proud  of.
i received my mini adapter this week. it looks and works as advertised, very happy with it. if this is an indication of the final built quality of the hub+ then i'll be back when nonda have a production unit available. a disappointing bump in the road, but hopefully they can smooth out their technical issues.
respect your decision! really appreciate the nonda team's hardwork! looking forward to support your next product!
same problem as others - credit card i used has been changed in the meantime. would appreciate a solution to change details and obtain refund to another card.
haven't receive the mini adapter yet. appreciate the decision and refund, although i really don't mind waiting.
i appreciate the decision that has finally been made. unfortunately, like others, the credit card i used at the time has been replaced (due to a security compromise).  i will need to provide you with a new one for refund.  all the best
thank you so much for letting us know. i was fine with being able to wait, still am. i feel your decisions are fair and just. this is still a great idea and can't wait to see it when it is all done and working good. hang in there.
like everyone else, i appreciate the information and your plan for refunds.  not to add to your problems but have all the mini adapters been sent?  i have not received mine yet?  is there someone to contact?
nonda, thanks for making it right.  your decision was undoubtedly difficult to make. i'll continue to back this to get it to market if you can figure out how to let me do that.
thanks for your honesty and the commitment to do a full refund. you are a credit to the kickstarter community. i look forward to back you guys again when you have a stable chipset.
thank you for the frank and honest update on the current situation, and the challenges you are facing, and appreciate the gesture of sending out the usb a to c mini adapter earlier on. if you are able to get the hub+ working with a suitable chipset then i will be back to support you. in the meantime i wish you every success.
i am impressed by your honesty, this only brings one thing that i openly declare as your best fan, i hope that even with the drawbacks this project ends well and we can all enjoy your product and future you will do. mood, i prefer not return anything and could ye continue with the project in the most comfortable way that you could. sure the return is the only measure? thank you very much, wait your news.
hey nonda team, i had received my mini adapter. .. looks great works as expected! thank you for the refund... just a question: if it is 'just' an issue with the display port... why not leave it away? for travelling i just need a unit that allows charging and at best data transfer at the same time. but i'd opt for a unit that allows switching between the two as well. just a thought. i hope you get it all done the way you originally hoped for yourself all the best harry germany
salute the creators for the honest statement. would just like to find out how will the refund go for people who have their credit card number changed due to security reasons. thanks!
lots of respect for your integrity.  i also plan to buy when hub+ gets a more definitive launch date - it truly has a great specification.
disappointing, tarnishing the trust on nonda. do you think near future you can come up with solution without backing?
very honest and difficult decision to make.. as you have lot all you time / money / effort and an additional 8%  of refund loss... i am sure you guys will be back soon and most of us here will support you in projects u venture into ..
well done!  never got such a honest statement. never seen that somebody reacts so responsibal. i will definitely buy your product when it is available.
i appreciate the decision that has finally been made. unfortunately, like others, the credit card i used at the time has been replaced (due to a security compromise). looks like i'll be launching a pm to nonda, and hoping for the best...
hi, i want to refund. please refund for this. can you revoke credit card payment?
these things take time -- often much more time than expected.  the integrity in your difficult decision is a great lesson to all in business as to how we all should behave.  i wish you the best and i'm looking forward to purchasing many of your final product(s).
how can we check which card we use?
it's nice on their part to include the adapter for free. however, i haven't even received it. i hope i will. i understand the delay. they, like most humans, kept ar it when they were having issues, it's very difficult to admit defeat.
i have cancelled the card i used for this, please let me know how to obtain my refund. i send you a private message as well. thank you.
about time they fessed up to the bull s#@t promises that they made! 4 months after indicated delivery, this probably should have happened 2 months ago!
i guess we all have our answer. fortunately there are others even here at kickstarter that have had the same issue with the chipsets, but have managed to work through it.
it looks like nonda has posted an update and they are going to refund everyone their money.  well that at least saves me the trouble of having to contact my cc company.
it is a good gesture to offer full refund as stated in updates.
i just requested a refund. if it doesn't happed i'll go through my cc company and since no product was given for the money, the refund should happen. one way or another a refund will be done.
@dale thanks for the tip! i was issued a refund thanks to the steps you provided. i don't know about you guys but i backed this project because they set the delivery date as the month that the campaign would end, which is a sign that they are confident that the design is done and they could handle the production quickly. after all the delays, it's clear that the estimated delivery was placed aggressively as a scammy way to look like they were ready to ship immediately when they weren't even close. every month that their product is delayed, the value goes down. at this point, it makes much more sense to just wait for a known brand to make a hub or the adapters that you want. additionally, after the september 1st "surprise!" update, i never received my mini adapter. this is one of a few campaigns that i've backed recently that is making me turn my back on kickstarter.
hey guys, i'm on the same problem as you, and i think right now the situation is just unacceptable. we need to act and do something, otherwise we are just going to loose our money. what do you think about creating a facebook page or even a webpage to start to claim for our money?
i never received my 2 mini-adapters. what the heck is going on. i was so mellow about all of this and not i think i may hab=ve to contact my cc comany about not getting a product for my purchase.  please let me know what's up asap
guys really appreciate the mini adapter as a thank you. it works great. however i am little concerned that we haven't had an update in over a month and this project is significantly sliding. some news and a proper update would be nice. i don't want this turning into another agent smart watch disaster
i have not received the mini-adapter, nor any information on further delay. you are far from being serious.
with no updates and not a single piece of the product in hand, i have to assume it's a scam. gonna start a facebook campaign with nonda as worst kickstarter mistake ever...
i used the "contact us" page to request a refund.  i have no desire to wait any longer for this project.  turns out owc's usb-c dock is now delayed a month and they raised the price $30 to $159.  my guess is that everybody is simply waiting for thunderbolt 3 to utilize the usb-c connector and will manufacture docks using that chipset instead.
:( never received my mini adapter either.
yeah, a month and a half and no response for teh individuals who backed his project.  i am requesting a refund now as well.
i am waiting for my delivery, but i received my usb-c -> usb converter. any updates?
reporting project and demanding refund (if ronda.co comes back up).
i am surprised that kickstarter hasn't contacted nonda and said they have to respond after so many negative comments about kickstarter
fellow backers.  a post a few days ago referred to their facebook page.  i couldn't find it but their main website (ronda.co) is says feb 2016 shipping so we know its at least until feb 2016.  this may start a flood but i did contact them via the contact us and asked for a refund (less the 8% fee that kickstarter takes).  dan replied and agreed.  i confirmed an email from kickstarter and the credit back on my credit card so they are offering refunds.  not sure what will happen if more backers want out then they have cash but passing it on. they are clearly updating their main website with new products (funny in a bad way) but won't post on kickstarter anymore.
when will we get a update its been 6 weeks.
i am waiting ...
got the adapter today in india
where is the promised delivery?
the mini ucb-c to usb adapter sucks. connector is loose and only connect to usb 2.0 speed. where i use the original apple usb-c to usb adapter it was running at usb 3.0 speed n
sigh.
"nonda is founded in palo alto by several big fans of smart hardware. our vision is to become the ultimate platform for smart hardware. company culture efficient communication, straight forward, no bs.     transparency, 100% mutual trust.     strive for excellence, 1% improvement every day.     fairness, reward based on contribution.     enjoy, have fun. " completely no fun at all.
thank you so much, nando, for the $100 lesson in "never back a kickstarter product project again." it was painful but at least i only had to do it once. i can see now that kickstarter exists as a friendly-faced virtual platform where unethical individuals make promises that aren't true and can't be kept to attract funding, then scam backers out of their money without any consequence whatsoever. just to recap: you promised in june that shipments would begin this past july. and now, months later, let's get real: you have no idea if this product will ever ship. and you completely stopped updating backers 6 weeks ago. i blame kickstarter, too, for their "innocent bystander" posturing, offering no help to scammed backers, when they made this product a "staff pick," giving it far more exposure than it ever would have had on its own. suggestion: before you award a project the coveted "staff pick" status, make it contingent on the creator(s) refunding all money if promised project deadlines are missed by x amount of time. in the meantime, thanks kickstarter for continuing to allow this creator to blatantly lie right here on their kickstarter page, by promising an estimated "october delivery" for new pre-orders geez. those folks would be lucky to get delivery by summer '16. there is no accountabilty on kickstarter whatsoever. i will take this up with my credit card company's fraud department and i suggest other backers do the same. if enough people start complaining about kickstarter fraud to cc companies, they will stop allowing cards to be used--the income they gain from kickstarter backings will not be worth the trouble for them to continue.
delivery is unusually slow . how can i wonder whether the ringing is . katsuke kitamura
it looks like all of us we are beeing scammed by nonda. with one nice video they got almost 1 m dollars not bad.
what are you doing with the 800k you collected? party? vacation? please tell us who this with kickstarter is working, i also want to start one so that i got money for my dreams. i believe, 250k would be enough for the moment.
the least nonda could do is to let us know if your mini-adapter has shipped. i messaged them but received no reply. and we were told of an update at the end of this week.
when i bought my macbook, i also bought from amazon a leicke hebron usb type-c 3.1 hub.  works well though 2 disadvantages: no power and no video. other than that, it means i can connect stuff to the macbook. it's not the hub+ but it is helping me through the delay.
thomas thinking about getting the refund too. it's been such a long time now plus there's hardly any (none at all) information for us backers when we can expect (if at all) the hub.
agree with bernd w. website now saying feb 2016, 8 months after the date we were told. i have decided to take the refund (minus the 8%)
checked what`s going on with the project today and was not amused to find the new shipping date on the nonda website... and no update post about this... as a backer i must admit that i`m pretty disappointed about not being informed about this. guys, you write stuff like this on your own website.... maybe it`s time to also act this way! especially the "no bs" part reads like a practical joke now... "company culture efficient communication, straight forward, no bs. transparency, 100% mutual trust. strive for excellence, 1% improvement every day. fairness, reward based on contribution. enjoy, have fun."
i haven't receive mini-adapter as well. i reported this project under the "campaign" tab hoping the creator can provide us with an update. any feedbacks would be appreciated.
still no mini-adapter even though you said it would be coming in september, i'm still rooting for you and wishing you well, but please don't send me something that doesn't work. i'm willing to be patient so that you can fulfill your promise to deliver an excellent product. looking forward to receiving it. good luck.
hello, i received the usb-c adaptator but not the hub. is this normal? thanks for the feedback.
hydra-dock is having the same issues, yet they are posting updates to let those that backed them know where they stand.  i feel like nonda is buying time trying to get past the time limit of when a cc won't honor a request to get your payment back
shipping time takes to long. what is the problem? why can't you manufacture? keep us informed otherwise it's just about collecting interests on our money....
from faq: if the problems are severe enough that the creator can't fulfill their project, creators need to find a resolution. steps should include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy backers.
i too would like my money back.... this is a joke.  i have been relying on this product in order to be able to use the $2,000 computer i bought in april.   i expected to be using it in july... waiting three months is marginal... six months is ridiculous; will it be 7, 8?
any update folks? been a month since we heard anything and you really need let us know what's going on. july was a long time ago. please let us know when we can expect something for backing this project..,
@nonda, the mini usb adapter you gave us costs only us$2 in taobao, china. i also found some china manufacturers are producing usb type-c hub with 3 usb 3.0 ports and a charging port in taobao website. are you waiting to get oem products from them? are you scamming our money?  state feb 2016 shipment for pre-order in their website. do not reply kickstarter backers the shipment date. what does it mean? a scam! shame on you! @backers, is there any american backer with deep sense of justice standing up to talk with dan, nonda? either ask him to reply or call for cop/fbi.
i gave them the benefit of the doubt as delays can happen.  now that it's almost mid october with not a single update, they have lost all credibility.   either it's a scam or they found out that it doesn't work and then decided to run or don't know how to say, sorry we totally f'ed it up.  anyone know if kickstarter gets involved or are we out our money.  it was a "staff pick"!!!
i haven't received my hub yet. when can i expect it? when can i expect my pre order t be shipped?
can kickstarter help step in to help get refunded? this is ridiculous!!!
the mini-adapter has a very tight fit. it works with most usb devices i have plugged into it so far but my trusty usb key. admittedly the key may be at fault (since i can plug the other devices) but i have never had the issue on any computer. @creator maybe build a little more tolerance in the next generation
also, on the hub+ page of nonda.co, they say "deliver in february 2016".
from nonda facebook page; another update today.... looks like it's blown out to february...  hi, i understand your feeling. to be honest, we cherish your support. but at this point, we do not have a solid ship date as to when the hub+ will ship. we are rescheduled for feb 2016, however, we have not set a solid date at this point and there might be a possibility that the date may be pushed back. if that should happen, we will do our best to keep everyone updated as well as offer refunds if needed. i'm terribly sorry for any inconvenience caused!  best regards, dan nonda customer support
i haven't received my hub yet. when can i expect it?
where is my hub+ ???
hi folks, for the mini adapter, please ensure that a snap sound is heard when you put it in.
received my mini usb adapter in australia, looks good and works well, looking forward to the actual hub
when can i expect my pre order t be shipped?
i will my money back!
honda, is this the way how you do business? i want my refund
scam
fuck
i got scam...kickstarter is my last place to do business
i have been waiting for the last three months and i am getting sick of this b.s what a rip off company. i trust you at first but you are bunch of liar and thief. you took my money and never send me the product. fucking piss me off.
## nonda says ## thanks for reaching out. our campaign for the hub+ on kickstarter has been delayed. the first update we posted about the delay dates back to june 8th and our most recent update also discusses this delay. we will be posting an update on kickstarter very soon with updated shipping information. here are the links in case you missed the updates: (most recent on top) https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1315535 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312 we are truly sorry for the inconvenience this delay has caused. our engineers are very focused on making sure all the technical aspects of the hub+ are in perfect working condition before proceeding with manufacturing. we are very grateful and thankful for your continued support during this important time of our project. if you have any further questions about this or anything else relating to the campaign, do not hesitate to ask. best regards, dan ## kickstarter says : ## hi there, travis here with kickstarter support--thanks for reaching out and taking the time to share your experience with us. projects that launch on kickstarter are often very early in the development process. this gives backers an opportunity to be a part of the creative process from the beginning. it also makes backing a project on kickstarter very different from purchasing an item in a store. project creators on kickstarter choose an “estimated delivery date” when crafting their rewards. this date serves as an early estimate as to when the creator may be able to fulfill, but could slip based on the demands of a given project. when delays do occur, they’re often in order to maintain or improve the quality of the project’s end result. still, a project creator is expected to be respectful and keep their backers in the loop. when a creator is communicating, we hope that backers are able to return that respect by being patient and supportive. often, the most productive thing a backer can do is to cheer a creator on despite bad news or delays. still, if you have questions or concerns regarding the status of a project, we encourage you to post in the comments section, or even message the creator directly. to message a project creator, visit the project page and click on the creator's profile image. this will open up their bio page where you can click the blue "contact me" link to send them a message. thanks for being a thoughtful backer and part of the kickstarter community. best, ## i say ## my solution to be patient is to forget about it and one day when it comes, i'll know good luck guys
@llkka give it a nudge in, it'll be fine. i thought the same about mine. it works fine. just push it in.
i recieved the mini-usb adapter today. it looks nice but is completely unusable. it does not go fully in (shape and size is not perfect usb-c) and the connection breaks immediately if you push it a bit sideways. it can not be used for disks etc that requires a stable connection. extremely poor quality and makes me wonder how bad will the more complex product be...
i also tried to convince them to give us an update - at least some information ... seems, that they do not understand the need to communicate with their supporters ... this is what they wrote to me: "we do not have a solid ship date as to when the hub+ will ship. once we have a firm update, we'll post it on the kickstarter immediately!" (funny enough, that on their site, they provide estimated shipping dates for new customers) seems that we cannot expect any update quite soon ... i really do not know, what to say more ...
hey guys, i have spoken to dan at nonda explained to him that nonda need to give an update on here even if its to say they are working on the hub and are hoping for a feb release. i think the main issue isnt that we dont have the hub as many of us can wait.. its the lack of communication that has rattled everyone. so hopefully we get a response/ update soon.
@kevin hanson: i haven't received mine, and i live in socal.
thanks, nonda. i am from vietnam and have received your mini adaptor and it looks great. i do look forward to your hub+. please keep us posted.
i have not received anything to date, and no updates here for weeks. what a shame, i could buy a very similar device now no problem from numerous sources. this was not worth it.
any news? this is becoming ridiculous... we all need an adapter for our laptops and quite frankly, a lot of us are done waiting. can we please get commitment on a delivery date or a refund option? thank you.
anyone in california get the mini adaptor? i have not.
just sent complaint to kickstarter, hope there's some action taken by kick-starters for this situation
i don't want a refund - i want the hub but it is possible to report to ks that nonda aren't communicating sufficiently. i don't know how to on the phone but j found it online at the bottom of the campaign page.
give us the exact day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
receive mine adapter few weeks ago. but what abt hub+? no news is bad news.
in arabic we say اشترى سمك في موية!! meaning "i bought fish still in the sea".. this was risky. i learned my lesson. i want my money back �..  give us commitment, replies, or at least compensation.. feb sounds so ridiculous!!
website says it ships in february 2016.  really, nonda?  the general public knows before the early adapters?  isn't this the opposite of what kickstarter is supposed to be?  answers, please.  whatever it is you tell us is better than absolutely nothing. http://www.nonda.co/products/usb-c-hub-for-apple-new-macbook-12-plus
really disappointing that there is no response from nonda. this being my first pledge, i will be very hesitant doing this in the future. on a sidenote; i work for microsoft, and we announced display dock today at the windows 10 devices event in new york. it is a usb-c hub with pretty much the same ports as hub+, except i couldn't see a memory card reader. i'm not entirely sure about its capabilities. but these ports should all be standard.
reposting this. christian said it all correctly well nonda, as you have logged on since my last post i can only assume that you have chosen to ignore the post since you have chosen not to reply. so i thought i would try and contact you directly. it's a real pity after 6 attempts to call you, all that seems to be on the other end is a recorded message asking me to call back during business hours (which i was already doing). (if anyone else wants to try, their customer service number is +1 (650) 289-8845.) kickstarter better start doing something about these guys, it is a bloody disgrace, and an embarrassment to everything that kickstarter is meant to stand for. not to mention leaving a lot of disenfranchised consumers that may not come back and support genuine projects.
everyone is waiting for you. update and give us any information please.
has anyone in the usa received their adaptors? east coast? nyc?
@nonda, i have just clicked into kickstarter and found nonda "last login oct 6, 2015". you have checked kickstarter webpages and knew how angry all the backers are. you need to respond now.
finally recived the adapter in hong kong: our local gadget stores have had versions of these for a few months all ready. wheres the hub?
well nonda, as you have logged on since my last post i can only assume that you have chosen to ignore the post since you have chosen not to reply.  so i thought i would try and contact you directly. it's a real pity after 6 attempts to call you, all that seems to be on the other end is a recorded message asking me to call back during business hours (which i was already doing). (if anyone else wants to try, their customer service number is +1 (650) 289-8845.) kickstarter better start doing something about these guys, it is a bloody disgrace, and an embarrassment to everything that kickstarter is meant to stand for. not to mention leaving a lot of disenfranchised consumers that may not come back and support genuine projects.
i've got nothing. when is it coming????
it is disappointing to come here day after day, and week after week, and see no replies from nonda.  it seems that there is a lack of respect for backers here and i think that is something that kickstarter should be concerned about.
since nonda did not honor the delivery date they have offered to ship the adapter and hub to my new destination out of the usa for free...i really think ronda is a genuine company, and they have hit some bumps and have to delay the release....i do agree however with all the backers....take 2 minutes every few days and let us know you care by sending us updates....atleast we will be in the loop and not feel frustrated good luck nonda
this is a joke! the tag line next to you post button say "be respectful and considerate".  i ask how can the backers be respectful and considerate, when we are not getting the same from the project team we have backed? there has been a serious lack of communication, and the backers should be refunded if the project can't provide solid information regarding the progress of the project. this is my second post requesting information, the third certainly will not be respectful and considerate.
nonda: clear communication, please!  we'll understand the delay if there's trouble in manufacturing - people just want a clear update.
i have just received the mini-adapter. it is useful and i'm glad you're shipping those not too far behind schedule. still it is no substitute for the hub which will offer a video port as well! could you please update on us on the delivery dates. if the situation has not changed since begining august (the last update unless i'm not mistaken), i would still welcome a status report.
@nonda: i really don't know why the delivery date has been changed to feb next year on your website without any update to all backers. do you respect and considerate your backers?  you have manpower to update the website but doing nothing to us. are you trying to get more cash from pre-orders? i am trying to convince myself it is not a deception. your behavior is telling me in the other way. you need to update us now!
ok, i just receive the adaptor after i go home, looks like great, can't wait for the hub.
just received (italy) my mini usb-a adapter, it seems well done. i don't have my macbook yet so i cannot try. can't wait for the hub. any updates on delivery?
@nonda: why it it so hard to give us all an update? this is now really going to be ridiculous! on your website (in your video) you still say: "if you back us today, we'll be ready to deliver on time" ... so, go to your keyboard and give us an official update (will take only 5 minutes to write a few lines ...). thank you in advance!
no package from adapter ck@taiwan.. it's a hard time..
i'm still waiting to receive anything. no usb adapter no updates.
i haven't received anything yet@hong kong.
starting to lose confidence i'll ever see this thing. i admit , looked to good to be true when i pledged . never got the adapter early either .
i don't know how i'll feel when i receive this product. excitement that it's finally here, or disappountment for the anguish this product has caused for others.
seriously this is getting ridiculous. no updates after so long! and we didnt pay so much for just a usb-c converter! and now you guys are telling us we will not see hub+ on this year? seriously?
"our engineers are very focused on making sure all the technical aspects of the hub+ are in perfect working condition before proceeding with manufacturing..." that means it won't be in production any time soon. seriously don't think we will see our hubs in 2015. the usb-c to usb adapter won't make people any happier.
hi all, wrote to nonda - got the following reply today: "our campaign for the hub+ on kickstarter has been delayed. the first update we posted about the delay dates back to june 8th and our most recent update also discusses this delay. we will be posting an update on kickstarter very soon with updated shipping information. we are truly sorry for the inconvenience this delay has caused. our engineers are very focused on making sure all the technical aspects of the hub+ are in perfect working condition before proceeding with manufacturing. we are very grateful and thankful for your continued support during this important time of our project." i'm really curious how the whole things works out. really do hope that there will be a hub+!! thomas
@stephen their message said "please expect an update at the end of next week."
hi, i leave the us on 10/14/15. would love to have an update before then so i can make alternative plans if necessary.  will the hub be delivered by the 14th of october? thank you!
well, i say, from an est standpoint in the usa, i give until tomorrow to hear, if not i also am going to my cc and stating to recoup my payment as there was no product
why should they produce or send anything? they have the 800k and hopefully a lot of fun on the beach. never again kickstarter
i just received the c to a mini adapter@hong kong. this is great,fast & small. waiting the main hub,please update.
well at least were getting something, just kidding :-) i can assume there might be some delay, that seems to be normal over here and of course it's not a retail store. the least thing that noda could do it gives us regular updates, how small they even might be. we trust you guys to invest in you’re idea, the least thing you could do is inform us about the status…
i just got my usb-c to usb-a mini adapter  @ hong kong!!
best move at this point, ask your credit card to fight this and refund it. being late in a kickstarter project is juts normal, being this late and with no confidence at all on a final delivery date is just not acceptable .
check the company website---they say january.  eve told me february.  whichever it is we're talking 3 or 4 months.   simply, not acceptable. that's too bad.  but it refund time.
jasper---i'm in total agreement with you
it's now-----february. i don't think they have any idea what they're doing.  maybe hoping for "divine intervention."
best move is to dispute this with your credit card company, amex has already refunded my money as well as several others that trusted this company. bottom line is that the charge needs to have product exchange hands to stick.... hence the lame we'll send you a gift for waiting ... refuse the gift ( product) and dispute. i am sorry if this sounds harsh to some very talented people at nonda giving this there best beta effort... but i'm sick of this kickstarter bs ... not this time
so i haven't received a thing yet - at this point just a darn post card with an update would be welcome.
waiting for that.... @hong kong
i'm also in the same situation - waiting for the more important supply
i have the same situation with annla. just received a mini adopter (c to a) in taiwan only. we are still waiting for the main hub~~~so exciting! wish nonda team can overcome the problems and make it asap!
received the c to a mini adapter(taiwan), waiting the hub....
i think the situation is as follows: they discovered a major problem with their pcb design. they are looking into the possibility to have it fixed without going back to the drawing board. but it won't work. so either they push production of the product with some key features missing, or production is set back. and it will be probably the last one. they will promise something that you will have it prior to xmas. but it will not. another delay which is not foreseen yet will come up and the eventual production date will be februari - just like i predicted back in august. it's sad to see this problem occurring time and time again on kickstarter, but founders consistently fail to see how long proper product development takes. does it really matter while there still aren't any alternatives on the market?
i still have not received mine.
i just received the c-to-a adapter.  any updates on the hub?  so many people are asking about it, please do reply.
i just asked for an update.  they replied with "excuse me?" this does not look good.  i'm sure they are having trouble.  i think its a good time to get what i can.
i am getting very concerned that i should contact kickstarter as well as my credit card company...there has not been any updates
dears, my product delivery was listed as july 2015... an 3 months later, when do you expect to deliver the product. please provide a response.
828 bryant st. in palo alto, ca is a medical/dental office.  i am very concerned because of this as well as a lack of update.  i have yet to receive my adapter.  nonda team--this is very suspicious--please provide an update.
please update!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
still nothing.  would like a status update.
i just received my gold adapter and i am loving it.  thank you very much,  looking forward to the hub!
wanted weiwei wen :(
still hopeful that this is just a production/shipping delay...hope to receive a package soon.
@ chris how is a fundraiser spam exactly!
my estimated delivery is listed as july 2015. here is what my site shows: pledged may 26 2015 estimated delivery jul 2015 funded jun 16 2015 any thoughts here on when i should expect my product?
oops.  i meant "unlikely that its all a sham".  hopefully i am not wrong.
i assume they encountered some issues in manufacturing.  that happens and to be expected if you are funding a kickstarter project.  hopefully they will give some kind of update soon.  i noticed they are offering pre-orders to the masses for october delivery.  (assuming late october).  unless they are really doing a long con, its likely that all their update videos and selling pre-orders are all a sham so i am still hopeful.  in another month, my view may change if the situation doesn't improve.
hi team nonda, looking at the posts there a bit of frustration among the backers.  me. ... i'm not frustrated. .. i'm sure you are all focused on delivering an exceptional product. that's what i want.  yeah there are other 3c port hubs in the market now. ... i have not seen a better design yet. like the rest i'm looking forward to your next update.
hi, im early backpacker from hong kong and i didn't have receive any usb-a adaptor yet. could you please provide the tracking number?
thanks for your spam and hijacking the thread laura. i'm sure yours is a very worthwhile cause, but please find somewhere else to seek funding.
this has nothing to do with nonda, but i got fed up with all the refund comments and seeing that nonda isn't delivering. i currently have a fundraiser up for the refugee children in kos.  please take a look, share and donate (where possible) thank you, if any one donates please follow the fundraiser as i update it regularly (unlike nonda)  and will have images up when we have paid for all of our components for our party bags. all donations are going to greek charity kos kindness. thank you ;) http://gogetfunding.com/putting-a-smile-on-the-faces-of-syrias-children-in-kos/ thank you! laura
all way waiting
spoke to eve from hub+ support who suggested they are waiting for their engineering to provide an update next week. i expect the company will then provide a further update and hope it is a confirmed delivery date for production units. at this rate, will be an updated macbook before the hub+ gets released.
no updates on the actual hub+ since the end of august. it's almost october. i, along with the rest of the people commenting here, would really just like an update on what's going on. i hope the nonda team hasn't forgotten about us!
got the adapted, would rather the hub though...
this is a big deception!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hey, i get only a usb c to usb adapter and no hub!!!!!!!!! is this a joke????????
hi guys , an update please . if there is any technical issue, my colleagues in the uk can help you .
@chris, i read your message and i am really astonished ... i also do not want to get a refund if nonda is able to deliver the product - even if it takes another 1-2  month. @nonda: i just want to have a clear communication about that!! on your website, it is still possible to order the hub+ but some kickstarter bakers are receiving a message, that you will refund the kickstarter pledge?? i personally think, there a re plenty of people out there, who would understand, if there is a delay. but you have to communicate that!!! _please_ give us an update! regards sebastian
so without prompt, i just received the following message. did anyone else? nonda says: hi there, in light of the extensive delay with the delivery of the hub+, we have decided to go ahead and honor your refund. before i do that, i want you to be aware of the fact that the refund will be for 8% less of the total amount pledged because of kickstarter fees that we have already been charged for your pledge. once i receive your confirmation to go ahead and refund the amount less 8%, i will do that as soon as possible. best, eve does that suggest that hub+ will not be delivered? i didn't ask for a refund, i did ask for an update.
got my mini usb adapter, it looks amazing. :) just wondering, is it at all possible to order the hdmi one as well? i see that they're on the website as part of the hub bundle, but the usb adapter is a separate purchase (while the hdmi one isn't.) thank you!
have not got any piece either......where is my hub……
this is what i got on my message from nonda: nonda says: hi there, the mini adapters are being shipped in batches for those who ordered one.  if you ordered one and have not yet received the mini adapter, then it is still on its way. please stay tuned for an update that will be released by the end of next week in regards to the hub+. thank you for your patience and sorry for the delay. thanks for your patience. eve so technically, eve says, there will be another update end of next week, not sure what is update about though..... running out of patience....
i'm in nj. i didn't get any adapter or hub. are you guys making it for yourselves only? please ship or provide an option for a refund. if stuff happens and you're behind schedule.... communicate! that's all we really want!
hey, where is my hub. this is bs you took my money and i have not receive the hub. please don't send me any link or video. i don't trust your company at all.
please be punctual and honesty. no sounds came out since the early of september. either post out the latest schedule or make the refund available for every backers.
got the mini usb-a adapter today! love it & thank you! :)
until now, i still get nothing! when will hub+ and mini-adaptor be shipped? (germany)
anyone from california? address to nonda is 828 bryant street, palo alto, california, united states
hello team, what happened now? energy fizzled out after collecting the money?  please keep us posted what is happening and let us know the delivery date. we supported nonda all the way from the beginning and don't disappoint us now.
your website says october. when in october?  is this bs?
it's almost been a month without an update. what is going on? please----try to be honest and upfront on this!!
i don't know how about you guys but tomorrow i go to the bank and make a claim for refund, no contact, no shipping in september, total waist of time. i just want my money back thats it.
hi guys,  i am looking for a sd card which will fit nicely into the slot.  can you advise on the hub+ sdxc card reader dimensions and if at all possible which ones of the transcend jet drive will fit the best? http://www.amazon.co.uk/computers/dp/b00wgarjis/ref=pd_sim_sbs_147_6… thanks in advance ps got the min adaptor and all working so thank you.
today(27/09/2015 japan) mini-adaptor comes.thank you.i wait for the hub+ patiently.
got nothing till now ...(hk)
usa backers: if nonda have some part of company in usa, because sure 3/4 parts as in china, ¿can usa backers report to usa authorities nonda is fraud? maybe now this the only way...
################## important to nonda ##################### sent you a respectful and considerate message on september 23rd, 2015 but still no reply. could you be respectful and considerate and reply to my message?
i was hoping i could sync up my new iphone with my new macbook. we've been waiting this long and still the adapter seems to have issues as people have reported. it seems to me that even the adapter was way behind schedule and a b grade adapter was shipped out to appease the crowd.
until now,i still get nothing,even the adaptor.(taiwan)
@ alfred van der schagt check the "fix/instruction" from rupert marlow ;- i checked the instruction but that didn't work for me. the adaptor goes in all the way but there is still the issue that i don't have a good connection.
hi everybody ...received my mini adaptor 2 days ago ( paris france ) .thanks . just make us a great hub+ & all the delay frustration will fade away. cheers.
hello, nonda. when i ask what i can receive my order?
@ alfred van der schagt check the "fix/instruction" from rupert marlow ;-)
hello, nonda. i am wondering how can i tracking my order ? is it possible to check it ? thx !
ramon lam  i am having the same issue as you. i hope we have a "monday morning" product and that the hub will not be produced on a monday. hope that we will get a working version of the mini adaptor.
got it today in thailand!!!! thank you for any response. please update for hub+......
just received mini-adaptor in greece. thanks....any updates on mini usb?
@rupert marlow, lol :-) that's it, thanks!
i have received no mini-adaptor nor is there any information...we are coming up on october, when the second wave of hub's was too be delivered, and yet some have not even received the "surprise" thank you of teh adaptors.  i agree with christian, a reply and information is way over due.
no feedback to backers might be a sign, that this thing is blown up? no feedback is also a sign of no progress! i'm preparing for a loss.
for those having an issue with the adaptor connection, is it pushed in all the way so flush with the side of the macbook with a decent 'click'? i thought mine was faulty, but it just needed pushing in all the way - this was a little stiff at first but working fine now.
i received mini-adaptor, but when shipped hub+?
@alfred van der schagt, well i don't know what you're issue is but mine wont stay "connected" in the usb port of the mac. when i connect the adapter the light goes on (that seems to be a good thing ;-) however when i release it, the light goes out and the usb drive gets disconnected :-( not sure why, the dimensions looks the same as the apple adapter, anyone else that have this issue? however the adapter it self looks very nice, but it would be even cooler if it works ;-)
am i the only one having issues with the mini adaptor ???
i received mini-adaptor, thanks! (japan)
nonda is kidding me i guess. i want to get the usb.hub, because i`ve spponsored it with my money and now i get the usb-adapter only...
received my mini-adaptor, thanks! (switzerland)
dear nonda, i think by the amount of comments on this wall that its time for an update to your backers. be it good news or bad news by going silent you are starting to turn off many backers. the community at large will be supportive if things are not going in the right direction and no doubt you will loose a few along the way. projects generally go south for a while, but keeping a high level of communication will keep everyone happy and informed on progress. the funny thing here as i write this post, by posting a comment it asks me to be respectful and considerate, so in turn we ask you to do the same to us!!
total surprise
people that said that they received the mini adapter, were you notified by nonda that it was shipped or was it a surprise?
i've messaged nonda and gotten no response. this is way to long to go without an update after pushing the ship date back months!! we need a refund option! the june refund deadline is ridiculous since the hub was supposed to ship in july and still hasn't!!! get your shit together nonda
yes the usb-c to usb-a mini-adaptor arrived today. and it works well for me.
i thought the adaptor was too long when it came and thought the connections was weak too - it's just a bit stiff to begin with. it'll fit flush and connecting it gets a little easer with a few uses but with a little nudge, mine clicked into place fine. it did feel a little scary giving it the first push! i am very happy with it and used it on a shoot today actually. the hub is late and there are obviously issues. an update would be nice though.
nothing received so far. i am beginning to doubbt there is anything worthwhile out there!
received!! usb-c to usb-a mini-adaptor 25.09.2015 in indonesia... i'm a happy camper...
nothing arrived... what's joke is that? 25 days without an update, in the first the hub should be ready at juli and that was the reason i have spend the money because my macbook was delivered only some weeks before. then was promised that it will be delivered to customers in september. now it's nearly october and we don't even know if you've just only on hub that works, madness!!!
i want to go a little bit more into detail. the adapter looks great, the color is nice but ...., the c-plug is to wide. if i compare it to the original plug from apple there is a big difference. as a result of this the plug does not make proper contact. if i punch the adapter up i get a proper contact and as long as i hold it in that position it works. the moment i let it go the contact is gone. i think this is a serious quality issue that should be looked at as soon as possible. if the cable to the hub will have the same issue it will not work at all.
received my adapter today but it does not work at all, s little movement is enough to lose contact and when i have contact the macbook doesn't recognize anything. i really hope that the hub is not the same quality because then this will be one big disappointment. please tell me what to do with the faulty adapter
whoopwoooii, the mini adapter arrived today  (netherlands). still very anxious and waiting for the rest.  one step closer to the rest...
today received mini adapter in the netherlands.
update please.
am also in the netherlands and not received anything yet.
just received my usb-c to usb-a adaptor a day ago. thanks for sending this item ahead of the rest. keep them coming :)
any updates to the project?
dear nonda, when did you start shopping to europe? didn't receive my adapter yet. and i'm definitely one of the first backers. did anyone else in the netherlands receive one? i really need something to connect my macbook.. waiting really patient for months but getting a bit frustrated.
i don't receive the mini-adapter? when can i receive the hub? there isn't any update after 9/2.
did i just pay 80 $ for a connector :( which by the way i'm yet to get ....
we're almost into october---what is going on?!!!!!! at the rate you guys are working this product will be obsolete by the time we get'em. these comments are not going away---you're screwing us!!!!
received!!  usb-c to usb-a mini-adaptor 24.09.2015 in korea. when can i get　hub&hdmi adapter。。。。。
@bedkowski, calling someone a peasant is rude. you don't have any power over cancelling your order. nonda is in charge and as of now, they aren't allowing anyone to cancel their orders. you will likely have to wait until you get it to refund it probably with a shipping cost, but by then you will have been appeased and will likely not return it. case point, this is not a ponzi scheme, i'm sure you remotely have no clue what one actually is and you throw words around at an attempt to make yourself seem intellectual, which has failed.
it looks like the adaptor (very slow, and probably cheap) was sent to appease revolting peasants. ponzi scheme in the making? if, if?!, nonda reads this - if i do not get a shipping confirmation of the hub by monday, sept.28 - i will cancel the order, and want my money back.
received my usb-c to usb-a mini-adaptor 22.09.2015 in sydney. hopefully the hub is coming very soon...
hey nonda, looks like people are getting really frustrated! im hoping for your sake that the next update is "production has started and shipping will begin on x" otherwise i think people will revolt....
on monday i will go to the bank if i didn't get update and start chargeback.
just a quick question i did not receive the adapter i believe it was on my pledge could you please check. thanks again for the gesture it is appreciated
i have not received mini-adaptor yet. what's going on, nonda?
just refund it. i bough the apple adapte because i have to use my mac with usb. i think my new mac will be old when your adapter arrives.  you have missed  "dead line" many times and "deadline" is the most critical thing in this business.i will never buy your product even though you made a fantastic product after this because you are "the shepherd boy".
what are you doing with backers money????? fuck chinese productors, are you waitting for money changes yuang dollar euro.... the people pay for hub and you ship a shick usb adaptor cost 5€.... the patient is finish
received my adaptor today. thanks team.
*first batch backers first
i'm sure that the mini-adapter was shipped out to the first batch backers. this was a bit disappointing as i assumed it would be sent out to everyone.
adding to the list of frustrated backers - sill no mini-adapter either... please advise and update those who desire to see this in our hands - work is ramping up and this is desperately needed for travel. thank you,
hi, i believe we all deserve an update on the shipping dates. i have been waiting for this hub which seems like an excellent idea and the design looks great but the wait is becoming a real issue since i need to travel and work with my macbook a lot. can you let us know what the issues are and allow us to have a definite date for shipping or to cancel our orders....
updates? is it in production or not? if not we must be getting close to getting our money back!
where are updates? has production even begun yet?
r u still in?
no support, no information about shippment… i'm really disapointed. please allow us to refund and tell other people when they get reward!
hi guys, i haven't received my mini adapter yet. is there a way to track whether it was sent out or not?
received my mini adapter over the weekend by recorded mail :)
have not received my mini adapter
given delay upon delay, i think you should start to consider refunds for anyone who wants to cancel their order so we can move on and buy an available alternative. this is becoming a little ridiculous.
plz   i am be crazy to see this great hub+ on my hand when i get my oder plz plz update me thanks i am waiting
just a thought, will the sd reader support the uhs ii cards. no worries if not - would just be a bit of a bonus if that was the case... the mini adaptors fits snugly - very tight at first and looks great. however, the transfer speeds are pretty slow. with an uhs2 sd card reader, and 71.32gb of data, the transfer took close to 30 minutes but with a cheap (£5) amazon adaptors, under 10 minutes!
20 days without updates, any news nonda? i need the hub+ ;-)
great! received the usb-c to usb-a mini adapter!
which time i can receive the mini adaptor? i live in taiwan, you said that it will be soon,  i want to know what time did you send out be mini adaptor?
the hub + when can delivery?do you have any in production, or you don't have a technical solution。
mini adaptors arrived this weekend. thank you. looks very well made and i'll be using it next week while working away. any news on the hub?
i am leaving for kenya in 2 weeks. if i do not get the hub before that i will have to buy one from amazon, that are readily available. i will, of course, cancel the order for yours. please confirm
it's been 1 week since the shipping update deadline for the mini adapter. an update would be very much appreciated.
just received the mini adapter thanks nonda!
oh no... i almost forgot i've back this project...
clearly the hub will not be shipping in september, if the mini adapters are not shipped yet there is no way that nonda will be able to send out the hub+
i wish the company would not waste any time on the mini adaptor... i don't think any of us care. just focus on the hub+.
thx lukasz, thats the truth....
thats it we don't want to wait longer! please allow us to cancel pledge, you said september we have mid of september and message from you we don't have any updates at this time, many other companies allready start to sell their usb-c adapters, cables, etc. please tell us when you will ship our rewards or we want to cancel!!!
would be very surprised to see the hub shipping within 2015. should have just got the apple hdmi/usb adapter and call it a day.
meanwhile i have bought the macbook early2016 edition with usb 3 d....
hi all! unfortunately, we do not have any further updates at this time! any updates we get, we will definitely share with everyone. currently, we are working extremely hard to make sure the mini adapter shipment goes smoothly. more news to come soon! stay tuned and again, thanks to everyone for your support and patience. you guys are the best!
0 (zero) responds from nonda since 7 days, just want to congratulate you customer support :)
it's a little tedious how kick starter projects are invariably delayed. even large companies like apple have supply chain difficulties; kick starter projects could take a cue from that and under promise timelines....
i am still waiting too! when i realky  get this  hub? thank you  arnaldo from japan
first problems as circuit, after this,  problems as software after this 3 diferent times to confirm data shipping (for win time) and now 1st batch and 2nd batch, whats up, money than backer number 714 as not same like 2546?, or you will tray first hardware with first 800 backers, after this correct errors, and after this ship final device???? thats crazy an shame. i think when you start campaign you don't have any devoloped circuit and any thing only 4 or 5 pictures about hub+. the global contribution as near 1k$, and with this money a lot enginerging can devoloper circuit with 5 or 8 layers, 5 conectors and controllers for conection. finish your work and ship for all people. nonda = designed and made in china
when you plan to ship hub+ ? how long we need to wait??
hello, i recently changed my address. please get back to me so we can make sure i receive my hub+! thanks.
let us know your shipping date..!!  we want to know where is our package..!!  please~~  eric.
plz  i am  still waiting when i get this great hub  plz tell me i am from kuwait plz tell me
hi, i left a us address at the beginning, changed to my german address in the meantime but will be back to the us sept. 28th to oct. 17th. if you would ship during that period of time i could switch to the us address again. but i am not sure about it now... otherwise it will miss me as it is a hotel address. andreas weyer
do you really have a product and ship in december 2015?

i have a q, you said mini adapters are shipping in the coming weeks and delivery of hub+ in september but there is 3 weeks left in the month? i just want to make sure i have an accurate expectation, very excited
hi, for some reason i didn't get my product, even though it says that the delivery estimation is july 2015.... any reason ? thanks, ilit
@ stephen didonna: sorry, we are not planning on selling the case on its own, at this point. i apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.
thanks again. i found the survey, and i think it was my fault before...
a question, i realized the stretch goal for the case was not made, but will it be available for purchase at some point?
if you are shipping the mini adapters in the coming weeks, then surely the hub will be delayed until october...?
@ dr. christoph lichtenberg: i am terribly sorry that you continue to have problems locating your survey. unfortunately, i do not have any other suggestions on how to find it. if you believe it is because you are accessing the german site, then you might need to contact kickstarter for help navigating that site -- we do not have access to the german site. also, check this link with kickstarter's faq on how to access your survey: https://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/backer+questions… @ lambros karavis: sorry, we cannot re-open our campaign on kickstarter to allow for any changes on pledges. unfortunately, we will not be able to do that. sorry for the inconvenience. etd of the hub+ is unchanged. we are aiming for september delivery for all backers, with the mini adapters shipping in the next coming weeks. when we receive more news about shipping, we will release it via updates. thanks for your patience! if you need to change your address, you can do so directly on your survey.
looking forward to hub+ delivery. i may need to change delivery address for hub+ and mini usb adapter due to travel commitments. can you please confirm delivery dates and whether you can accommodate different delivery addresses now that mini usb is being shipped early?
can you please confirm latest etd (expected time delivery) as i may want to change delivery address for hub+ and mini usb-a adapter depending on delivery dates?
a solution to those wishing to cancel? there are some backers who may want to order additional hub+ items. is there someway of arranging an "exchange" so buyers can be matched with those wishing to cancel?
thanks for your quick reaction. but i was on kickstarter.com yesterday and tried again today, minutes ago. there is no survey. maybe there is a problem with the german version of the site or something like that?
haha also just watched your video today, "if you back is today we'll be ready to deliver on time"
@ nikhil: the reward you selected actually does include the mini adapter so you will be receiving one. just to let you know, we are not providing the mini adapters for free. those who purchased one will get it.
i would like to request that i receive a usb c to usb adapter free as well. i placed my order in may and the option was unavailable.

thank you this is, it is  above and beyond. you get in to a kickstarter because you want something to be built if you want a sure thing goto amazon. i think you are handling the delays with grace and transparency and it is appreciated.
i tried to order a battery version when the email to denote was released and then looked at my account and it states a non-battery version...please update.
i thought so as well but for me the trick was not to use the kickstarter app but the website.  maybe this helps some of you guys out?
there ist no survey button in my german account.
as others stated, there is no way to enter a "survey".
there is no option to access the survey from the directions you have given. someone needs to beta test your instructions before publishing them to the backers. please notify me when the survey link is truly available.
..and by the way- the fact that many kickstarter projects have a really bad project management doesn't improve the the fact that this one is not managed well either.  although many people here seem to think that this is an excuse.  "if other people are not able to hold their deadlines why should we?" poor, really.
only problem here is that there was promised to solve an issue everyone has. the macbook has no ports. it still hasn't any. i learn to live with that as i own the macbook for quite a while now. the trick to this kickstarter was to get a stylish solution fast. it still is a stylish solution. but a delay of 100% and counting (not even a shipping date) is bad project management and nothing else. i don't need a chicken dance. i want the product i backed.
how to cancel and get refund ? i wanna cancel it..please help.
in the survey i had no opportunity to include my postal address and i can't add it now for some reason, so presumably no 'gift'. do i assume i have to make pre-order like everyone else? is it because i live outside the us and only pledged the minimum?
@davidhayek said: "the macbook is getting an update to support thunderbolt so this product is now obsolete before even shipping" not having updatable firmware may hasten obseletion.
hi. got your message abou survey but he survey button is not there in my account. can you advise pls
hi! amazing news!! just one question. what is the new expected delivery date for the hub+? thanks
i say again ... if you think this is a bad kickstarter, you must be brand new and you should adjust your expectations. when you back a project this early in the development process, schedules are always "best, optimistic guesses". things happen and delays occurs. these projects should be judged by one factor and one factor only: communication. @nonda has done a terrific job keeping us apprised every step of the way. if only every project provided their communication! as for shipping dates, how about we wait until testing is completed and then worry about those? i don't accept the entire "kickstarter is not a store" argument, but it is a different kind of store. you get to be a part of the product development process. if you can't handle the kickstarter/product development process, you should probably stay off kickstarter. you are going to be miserable and you are going to make the rest of us miserable as well.
@ lukasz krawczyk: i am very sorry that this has been such an inconvenience for you. we are also very disappointed with the delay. just to let you know, the reason we ended up being so delayed is because the technical specs of the hub+ were changed in the middle of the campaign. after receiving feedback from many backers in the very early stages of the campaign, it was obvious that everyone preferred usb 3.0. updating the hub+ caused significant delays. this is truly cutting edge technology which takes time to perfect. like we have shared in the past, our engineers are more concerned with making sure the product is in perfect working condition instead of rushing through it with the chance that it might not work. we understand how frustrating this long wait may be for you and we are truly sorry for this.
sometimes we cannot wait. and if someone promise you something fast, and tell you that they have working product, they should have it ready for manufacture, not in alpha stage. many other kickstarter campaign have a longer wait time and that's ok, because i know that i need to wait. here we should have hub+ in june now is september and still not shipped not even shipping information. this start to be ridiculous....
geez i don't know why people continue to mistake kickstarter for a storefront. people, we backed a project that is seeing delays... okay... that's no problem. there are no hints of fraud, and they're doing their best. you can't ask for a refund if you're a vc and fund a company. it's not ethical to ask for a refund in this case. be patient. the product will come, and when it does, hopefully it lives up to the hype!
hello to all our wonderful backers! check out the latest update that was just posted. here is the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1341045 @ david hayek: i am so terribly sorry. you have actually missed the deadline to request a refund. that was on july 9th 11:59 pm pacific time. if we would continue to honor refunds, our project could be seriously affected, including possibly being delayed even further. here is the link to the update about the refund deadline in case you missed it: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561 we are very sorry for this inconvenience and we truly appreciate your patience.
i will also consider chargeback on my mastercard… im really disapointed, we have september and no information, about shipping dates… so long delay...
i would like a refund, luckily i purchased this with american express. please give me the procedure to receive the refund ... i'd hate to go the charge-back route but will if required. the macbook is getting an update to support thunderbolt so this product is now obsolete before even shipping
i am one of your early backers and with a 12" macbook with no hub to connect other devices!!! when oh when will we see a delivery date? i am a very patient person normally but this will be the last kickstarter project i will ever look at! with your continued delays and reading other comments nando have have broken their contractual obligations again and again and therefor we, as backers who would have requested a refund should have that option extended by right! common contractual law should be answered by common sense and do the decent thing!
thanks for the steady stream of updates! on another note: comments on kickstarter are getting as bad as comments on youtube.
if they don't know the situation, please do not commit the delivery at the first hand then have reasons for delay
my first and last time backing a kickstarter project and a $100 lesson learned. the lesson? kickstarter is a place where dishonest, unethical "companies" make promises they know they can't keep to get access to your money. when i pledged in june, nando was promising a first wave shipment in july, clearly a known lie in retrospect, since they still can't offer a firm ship date as we approach september. even worse, the lying continues. nando is giving its new online order customers an estimated ship date of october, which they know can't happen--if it could, they'd have a firm ship date by now for their 800+ backers whose orders have to be fulfilled first. i hope that kickstarter realizes that allowing unethical practices like this with no recourse for backers does lasting damage to the whole kickstarter ecosystem.
d'oh! sorry - i see you've already answered the firmware question. i'm worried that the firmware will not be updatable. if the hub is found to be incompatible with any of the thousands of possible monitors it may be used with, one can imagine that the only solution would be for people to send the hub back to nonda - an expensive and time consuming process for your wide range of international buyers. would it be difficult to make the hub's firmware user-updatable? i've seen simpler devices with firmware that can be updated.
hello, thanks for the update. i can understand the need to get the firmware right - this has made me think to verify that the firmware will be user updatable? i guess it is possible that some kind of display configuration may not end up being compatible with the hub, and nonda cannot test against every possible display before shipping. i would be grateful if nonda would confirm this, and also that nonda is committed to releasing firmware updates after shipping if necessary? thank you, thomas
thanks for the update guys. it's good to show progress. amazing work! for the impatient folks (including myself), perhaps you can give an etd best case scenario and worst case scenario? i know hardware projects are complicated with things that are out of your control (i have done several projects myself). but a range of etd will be good so that we can better equip ourselves with something else and not expecting the hub+ to arrive so soon. you guys have done a good job so far, so keep it up! cheers
i am with @alexfeinman  this is kickstarter, not a store.  i would rather have an excellent product and wait a few months than a crappy product immediately.  i am glad that they are keeping us updated and that the updates are showing progress.  keep up the good work @nonda!
really....we should not complain about a two month delay??? according to the info at the start the prototype and testing were competed by end april. now we are supposed to be impressed that we get a video showing that it works? when we pledged early we were told early pledge would bet shipped by end june. i personally will be happy if i get mine by end september when i begin to do a lot of business travel. i do not have a lot of use for it before then. i do not think those that are "bitching about the delay" should be criticized. no one knows their situation. i think the folks at nonda should be more forthcoming about when these will ship and stop issuing useless updates. the photo of the "manufacturing" of the mini adapter was certainly impressive.
to people bitching about the delay: you really don't want to rush them. even though this is called a hub, it is an extremely tricky piece of hardware/software. it's an emerging technology. the underlying electronics has not been in mass production for more than a few months. the fact that they can show a working device is unbelievably good news. have some bloody patience or go and wait for amazon to start selling something like this - good luck with that
would it be possible to share whether you are using ti or cypress usb part?
yet another prototype video. do you guys have any updates on the production of the final product? how much delay is that metal casing going to cause?
update #21 has just been posted!
i sincerely hope you're being honest this time with september, and if you are, you better be ready to fill all of the orders!
hi guys, shall we wait until x'mas ? pls kindly share the updated schedule
very very bad, once again, i can't accept your delay, is it just a sorry can regardless of the backers feel?i was so disappointed to you.where is your integrity
i hope you will ship second batch also in september otherwise you will lie and disappoint us. if not we want extend refund period. wait for your reply.
thanks for the reply. hope everything goes smoothly from here. cheers!
this is absolutely not been bad, i haven't even been on the main site, and i'm aware of all the updates, which cannot be said about most kickstarters.  @nonda, great job keep the updates coming the squeaky wheels will be mysteriously quiet when you deliver a great product.
wow guys. if this is your idea of a "bad" kickstarter, you really haven't been around much.
you guys were my first project backed on kickstarter ... and probably the last .... there is a limit on how long you can make people wait ... i would have never backed you up if i was thinking that you wouldn't respect your timeframe ....  you re very unprofessional and your answers are soooooo condescending !!!! nothing has been produced yet and still you can't refund backers ... be assured  i ll get my money back !!!
@ bryan lau: i am terribly sorry for the frustration this delay has caused you. please understand that our engineers are extremely focused on delivering a high quality product in perfect working condition. the entire company is more focused on making sure it is working exactly as it should instead of rushing it out with the chance that it might not work the way it was intended to. i understand your immediate need for it, but there are a few thousand others who would much rather make sure the thing works instead of having it now. again, we are truly sorry about that. we are not purposely delaying the project. it is a work in progress and unfortunately, sometimes perfection takes time. @ troylee: and the reason we missed the deadline is because we listened to our backer's feedback about wanting usb 3.0 instead of 2.0. the design of the hub+ was changed in the middle of the campaign leading to this delay. again, we are sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you.
funny thing is, @nonda said we can't refund because we missed the deadline. but we want refund because nonda missed the deadline...
by the way, to whoever is responding on the comments. to say that not many take the time to appreciate you is..... a ridiculous statement. you are running a business and the people here support you by putting in money into  your business. they are not here to make you feel better by posting kind comments.
i'm not into "verbal violence," but i do think you guys are way past the acceptable time frame to deliver this hub. ok, so this is the most technologically sophisticated hub ever in history. but it's still a hub. personally, i've gone from enthusiastically telling people about this project, to being vaguely embarrassed about it. yes i know i missed the refund date. no need to send the link again.
i am waiting for your good. could you give me a timeline? thanks.
stay tuned for our next update which should be posted within one week. again, thanks for your patience! @ navdeep virk: very well said! @ shanna booher: we do not have any further updates at this time. please read our last update for the latest information. thanks!
@nonda - i'm in the 2nd batch of backers, when is that (probably) shipping? thanks!
fast internet and things like amazon have been detrimental to the patience of people. convenience is traded for lack of a humane quality. please let them make a fantastic product. verbal violence will not speed up the process.
@ anindita ghosh and @ craig newmark: it's not really a "pop up". it will just open up the next page. sorry if it was a little unclear. once you click on the "hub+" on your backed projects, you are there. the survey tab should be the middle one.
folks. there's no pop-up per directions below
and as per your earlier comment cannot find the change shipping address as no "pop-up window appear"
keep up the good work and update on all the progress... creating anything new has never been easy.. all the best! i have to change the delivery address due to the delay. please send a mail/url on which i can change the delivery address
@ lemont washington and @ craig newmark: first batch shipping is only for early bird backers. anyone else is part of second batch shipping. if you are unsure, please check your survey which has all information regarding your pledge and your selections.  take note of your backer number and which reward tier your selected to know which batch you are in. it will clearly say "early bird" if you were part of the first  900 backers. to find the survey, please follow these instructions: 1. log in to your kickstarter account  2. select your profile icon at the top right corner and you should see a drop down menu appear. 3. select "backed projects”  4. then select the hub+ project. you should see a pop-up window appear.  5. click on "survey" which is located between the "reward" tab and the "messages” tab. @ lemont washington: in regards to changing your address, you can change it following the same instructions from above. the shipping address field can still be updated, go ahead and change it right on your survey. @ taha dawoodbhoy: yes, you are an early bird backer, meaning you are part of first batch shipment.
hey, please don't post any more video or pcb board. i just want the product.
i hope this products not scam on my $100 buck
i have never had one kickstarter item ship on schedule, seems to be a trend.. some never ship at all... there should be some recourse or compensation for delays beyond 30 days to the people that support these items... the crafty marketing always seems to portray items as way farther along than reality... never again
please let me know what delivery batch i'm in. thanks!
after all this delay you still don't even have a prototype to show us? so far all i'm seeing is dongles and pcb boards. i guess i should have gone for the apple adapter, at least i could have gotten it 2 months ago. just wait guys, 1 month later they are gonna have something else unexpected happening and another delay. i wish i could get a refund, but they won't give me one.
so i'm not one of the first 900 backers but i got an early bird spot because someone who had it canceled their pledge and i switched my pledge to the available early bird spot. does that mean i'm in the first shipment batch?
it takes too long to waiting for a hub . i am afraid that i sell the macbook before i got the hub
well i expected this to have shipped already. i'm moving to another address and by  the time september rolls around it will be different. is there a way for me to update my shipping address?
any idea when i'm going to receive my unit? i am unsure what my backer # is. when is the second batch going out?
@dan havens: lol! you definitely are part of first batch shipping! :-) @ phillippe van gorp: first batch shipping is only for early bird backers (the first 900 backers). anyone else is part of second batch shipping. if you are unsure, please check your survey which has all information regarding your pledge and your selections. take note of your backer number to know which batch you are in. to find the survey, please follow these instructions: 1. log in to your kickstarter account 2. select your profile icon at the top right corner and you should see a drop down menu appear. 3. select "backed projects” 4. then select the hub+ project. you should see a pop-up window appear.  5. click on "survey" which is located between the "reward" tab and the "messages” tab. @ adnan akbar and @ ging saldajeno: we do not have a solid shipping date at this time. please read our latest update which contains the most up to date information. thanks!
when am i going to receive my hub+?
when i receive in my hand tell me date  ply
can you please let me know what batch i am in?
so im guessing i'm in the first batch :)
@ weetom: i am so terribly sorry. you have actually missed the deadline to request a refund. that was on july 9th 11:59 pm pacific time. if we would continue to honor refunds, our project could be seriously affected, including possibly being delayed even further. here is the link to the update about the refund deadline in case you missed it: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561
sorry to say this, but can i quit now? i am losing patience waiting, honestly.
@ thomas pinder: actually, no. the hub+ will not have the ability to update firmware. if there are any problems with the functionality of the hub+, our customer support will definitely work with you to find a solution. @ stephen didonna: please read the update we posted yesterday which states that our shipping timeline has been pushed back to september. however, you are part of 2nd batch shipment, which means the august delivery date did not apply to you (that was for early backers only). either way, i am sorry it has been delayed so long. it will definitely be that much sweeter when the product is finally in your hands! thanks very much for you patience. if you have any other concerns or questions, feel free to message us.
i was wondering if yo are still looking at an august shipping date? end of month i imagine.
hi, thanks for the progress update. just wanted to confirm that we'll be able to perform firmware updates after we've received the hardware? thank you, thomas
@sam: you have actually missed the deadline to request a refund. that was on july 9th 11:59 pm pacific time. we posted an update on july 1st with this deadline and unfortunately, you missed the deadline. here is the link to the update in case you missed it: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561
i am sorry guys but unfortunately i have to cancel my order , i understand that there could be some delay but more than 3 month means only show that you was a bit presomptious. good luke to you but meanwhile your competitor are making great job and i need my hub before december.thanks to make the refund asap.cheers
this is pretty common for kickstarter projects- to be delayed 3-6 (sometimes more) months. i've backed probably 6 or so projects and these guys seems (so far) to be doing a pretty good job of keeping us updated, and this delay doesn't surprise me at all. i'll be happy if we get it by november honestly.
hello everyone! please check out an update that was just posted with important information about hub+ testing and manufacturing. here is the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1315535 @ sangkap chin and @ kenny park: i will send you an inbox message to address your questions about changing shipping information.
what's latest? any updates would be very much appreciated. i'm beginning to see unprofessionalism on your part here...
i have to change my address to get hub+. when is the date estimated? and how can i change my information?
it doesn't matter if it will be shipped in december... at least communicate your backers. keep us in the dark is unprofessional.
@nonda: 3 days ago you said that in a couple (2?) of days you would come with an update, when can we expect it? you also stated (3 days ago) "we do not have solid shipping dates at this time as we are still in the early stages of testing and manufacturing".. you are still in the early stages of testing??? i would hope you would be producing now if you want to ship beginning of september.  i mean, you should be shipping now. i find it hard to believe that you cannot give a date when we can expect it. i don't believe you will be shipping in september if you are still in the early stages of testing.
when will it ship?
@nonda  unfortunately our temporal office wiil be move to the new one. so i hope to change my delivery address. is it possible?   here is my new address     nuevo sur gran cludad 225    avenida revolution 2703,    la ladrillera, 64830 monterrey,n.l,mexico thanks, eric.
@mike the owc one is more of a dock than a portable dock. something you place on a desk and leave there.
so owc has announced a usbc dock that looks better that this. and it ships in oct. i wonder if ronda will ship before that or are they still  making silly videos instead of taking care of the backers.
yeah guys, a lot of us our waiting to know when we'll get it - i'm sure i'm not the only one who's held off buying the official hub for this but it doesn't seem like you're even close to shipping? if it's going to be a 'christmas present' that's fine, just let us know so we can make alternative arrangements and actually get some use out of our new macs... at the moment you've got almost a million bucks and i've got a glorified ipad...
keep it update, please.
i never got what i paid for.  it says it will ship july but until now i did not get it.  can somebody help me.  i paid 108 dollars and it should be shipping to canada
please stay tuned for an update we are releasing within the next few days with updated shipping information! thanks for your patience. @bruce: the july shipping date was our original target date, which we unfortunately, did not meet. we do not have solid shipping dates at this time as we are still in the early stages of testing and manufacturing. we are releasing an update within the next few days with updated information regarding the progress. please stay tuned and thank you very much for you patience.
when will you shipping?
"for those of you asking which shipping batch you will be part of, first batch shipping is only for early bird backers (the first 900 backers). anyone else is part of second batch shipping. if you are unsure, please check your survey which has all information regarding your pledge and your selections. to find the survey, please follow these instructions. thanks! " the dates shown on different pledges all show a delivery date of july 2015.  can you make it clear to us when we'll be receiving ours? can you let us know the 2nd batch ship dates?
waiting for the shipping ...
when can ship ? is august now .
dear sir,  i still do not received your product, what's wrong?
please my "hub +" tell me what time to be shipped.
@ rodrick tan: once the campaign ended at midnight pst on 6/15, you actually cannot change or increase your pledge, including adding an hdmi adapter. also, we are not selling the adapter on its own.  sorry about that. @ nick chou: please stay tuned for an update we are releasing within the next few days with updated shipping information! thanks for your patience.
hi nonda, it is a long time to update the latest situation.everything gonna be fine?
hi nonda, may i ask if it's possible to add an hdmi adapter to my backing? i just realized that i mistakenly backed the $86 reward, and not the $93 reward. thank you!

hi nonda can you tell me if i am in the 1 or 2. batch, and when will you start sending out. have a great day ev
@nonda: i prefer to get my hub+ in september, (i've no idea wat my nummer is). but we have vacations in august en will be gone for almost two weeks. thanx!
dear nonda   -team, i have remained silent because i do understand that developing a new product does take time. i much appreciate you take the time it needs to deliver a product that lives up to the high quality that apple users are used to and that works perfectly.  thank you for the updates! i am truly looking forward to the growing possibilities in using my macbook that come with the delivery of this product! :-)  greetings from germany!
can you tell me the difference in weight/size of the battery vs non-battery versions? (if this is on the site somewhere, please excuse my ignorance for not finding) also, will the hub+ be able to utilize the apple usb ethernet adaptor? i'm just trying to get my ducks in a row prior to receiving... excited about the device!
hi there, would appreciate if @nonda can share with us the realistic schedule . otherwise it keeps floating and people will lose patience and trust. thanks.
hi @nonda am i in 1st or 2nd batch shipment please? best wishes.
@ shanna booher: you are part of second batch shipment. you are backer #6981!
@nonda - can you tell me if i'mpart of the first batch or 2nd? thanks!
@ grant goodale: first batch shipments is early bird backers (the first 900 backers), which you are a part of! :-) @ miguel vázquez: our project has been delayed by at least 1.5 months. please read the updates we posted in regards to the delay. here are the links: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561 thanks to everyone else for your words of encouragement!
you mention 'first batch' and 'second batch' in your comments on schedule - is the first batch early bird backers? or is it more about the size of the production run than when we backed the project? thanks for (over)communicating with us - excited to see the finished product.
@nonda thank you for the regular updates!
good day , and you have time available to begin to send or how much longer we will continue waiting
@nonda: i'm glad i've backed you. i've all confidence that you'll deliver this great product as soon as you can. thank you and good luck!
agree with richard y'all have done a great job in updates 1.5 month delay is not bad for a tech thanks for all the hard work
thank  you for the regular updates.  hope all is going well in production and nonda is still finding time to work on the next amazing gadget.
@richard kennedy: thanks! you very much are part of the "silent majority" since not many people take the time to recognize our hard work and thank us for our efforts. it is comments like yours which really keep us going and help us see the silver lining. again, thank you! @ sota hatano: the campaign ended on june 15th. the original delivery date was scheduled for july. however, we have been delayed, which i am sure you are aware of. @ mike formento, @ uwidme and @ shinkang kim: per our update posted on june 8th, we are experiencing a 1.5 month delay.  our current timeline shows first batch shipping will be in august and second batch shipping will be in early september. sorry for the delay. in case you missed it, here are the links for the updates: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561 please stay up to date with the latest information by reading all updates we post.
i banked you on jun.16th.
when wil it be delivered? it's already august!!!
schedule update please
simply i have a question wether it  true or not that this project was estimated to finish by june, the original target date. though i know this is a kickstarter project that is not run by a professional to keep its due date. anyway, keep up the good job!
@nonda: thank-you for keeping us up to date as to the development process for the hub+.  it's very exciting to see this amazing device begin to take shape.  as part of the "silent majority" of backers, i just wanted to say that the kindness and grace you are showing people in this campaign is exemplary.  you are obviously very nice people, and are "bending over backwards" to make everyone happy.  anyway, i just wanted to send my gratitude and let you know that people do see how hard you are trying.  thanks again :)
it is starting to look like this is a project that we should not have backed. it is starting tom look like all nonda can do is chicken dance.
@ ron watson, @ peter chang and @ carina schloesser: per our update posted on june 8th, we are experiencing a 1.5 month delay.  our current timeline shows first batch shipping will be in august and second batch shipping will be in early september. we are still currently running tests on all the hub+ components. sorry for the delay. in case you missed it, here are the links for the updates: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561 please stay up to date with the most latest information by reading all updates we post. @ fahad hussain: we have not finalized those details yet as we are still in the testing stages of the hub+. if you want, you can change your address now to the po box and if it needs to be changed after august 1st, we will definitely work with you. just reach out to us.
hi, can you tell we when i will be expecting my hub+? regards, carina
hi,  i like to find out when will i be expecting the hub+  or when will you guys be ready to ship.. thanks !
we do not have direct delivery at home by our local postal service in uae. are you guys sending the hub through courier service or normal postal service. in case it is normal postal service then i need to remove my address and have to add po box number for delivery. please reply in both cases asap as i can change the address only before 1st of aug.
when can i expect to receive my hub? you have my money and your deadlines for delivery keep constantly changing…??
@lu: no, we do not have a firm date yet. @douglas: you picked space gray with no battery. you can view your selections directly on your survey for the hub+ here on kickstarter.
can you tell me what the status of which version of the hub+ you have me listed for?
hi nonda, do you have a firm plan upon the delivery to enduser? we have waited for sucha long time.
@bettie: you have actually missed the deadline to request a refund. that was on july 9th 11:59 pm pacific time. we posted an update on july 1st with this deadline and unfortunately, you missed the deadline. here is the link to the update in case you missed it: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561 @ adnan akbar: per our update posted on june 8th, we are experiencing a 1.5 month delay.  our current timeline shows first batch shipping will be in august and second batch shipping will be in early september. sorry for the delay. in case you missed it, here are the links for the updates: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561 please stay up to date with the most latest information by reading all updates we post. @ hiro kawakita: you can change your shipping address directly on your hub+ survey on kickstarter. you have until august 1st to change the address.

delivery time in september is so long time.  please refund  to me . thank you
@heo seon young and @kyra: our current timeline is still showing estimated shipping dates will be august/september for 1st and 2nd batch. unfortunately, we do not have a more solid timeline at this point. fingers crossed, if all the testing mentioned on the last update goes smoothly, we will have more detailed information very soon. thank you very much for your patience.
hi guys, just wondering how you are going with rough ideas of when the hub's will be shipping out? i know you said in a previous post that you're still running on schedule, are you referring to august? i'm in aus and hoping to receive this hub before a month long os holiday, is this looking likely? otherwise i will need to look for another adapter for the meantime. thanks !
when can i begin shipping? geolro which came out june delivery finished the ships are devised so far.
happy monday, backers! @guatam kaul: you can change your address directly on your survey for the hub+ on kickstarter. you have until august 1st to do so. @ alfred hoffstadt: at this point, there is no way to change your selection or information. however,  we will send a final confirmation before shipping begins to allow for updated preferences and information (different colors, battery vs non battery, email address, phone number, etc). i have also added a note to your account so we are aware of your request in advance. @robert silva: we actually are not offering the case for individual sale. sorry about that.
will we be able to buy the case for the hub+?
how can i change the colour from silver to spacegrey ? thank you for your answer !
how do i change address!
@paul: we are still on track with the same timeline mentioned on our update that was posted on june 8th. at this point, we do not have exact dates. however, we will have more details in the next coming weeks. in case you missed the update, here is the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312
agreed @ thomas pinder! recycled packaging please. preferably without that crappy hard plastic that companies like apple use!
i agree with @edward hor and @laura - the packaging is unimportant (although i'd personally prefer simple paper based packaging that could be recycled, rather than plastic that end up in a landfill). thank you for keeping us updated with progress, and keep on going - complex projects always have components that are trickier than first estimated.
i know the delay always happens on kickstarter.  but, is there any schedule of production to let us know the progress now? thus, we backers can know the target date for shipment well. thank you.
good afternoon to our wonderful backers on this beautifully sunny california day! check out our latest update about the pcb board of the hub+. here is the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1296142
the delay is not that of a big problem to me, but i think you should give us more detailed status updates at least once a week!
i honestly forgot i back this. delays happen on ks on almost every project. i'm still waiting on one to deliver that funded 2.5 years ago. most ship within a year of their original projected date, so give it some time.
agree, any updated status?
hello, are there any news since the last update of july 1?
is it possible to change the delivery address? if so, when is the latest i can do that?
reading the comments about the delayed delivery and asking for refunds is so disappointing.  nonda should be congratulated on working to deliver something that apple ought to have designed and released with the macbook!  apple's loss, our gain. personally i'd rather wait that little bit longer and receive a product that that meets or exceeds expectation, than expect it to be rushed out "on-time" and be disappointed with a device that doesn't work as is intended. more than that, if apple charge more than half the cost of this device for a simple vga or hdmi port plus a solitary usb, what would they have charged for this neat little package?  that saving alone has surely got to be worth the short wait? honestly, great job nonda, i just wish i'd ordered two!
manufacturing process updates!!! if you have delayed project  is not problem, but don't know nondateam, ¿are working? or in holidays??? please update process for know the reasons in delays, thats the minium for backers ¿no? thanks ;)
can i change address for receiving?
when can i get this staff？
how do i request a refund ?
@ kenneth lam: once the campaign ended at midnight pst on 6/15, you actually cannot change or increase your pledge, including adding an hdmi adapter. also, we are not selling the adapter on its own.  sorry about that.
hello can i add the hdmi adaptor?

"marie poisson's comment honestly is rather ignorant and honestly i'm offended. i'm trying to be respectful and considerate but that is a generalized statement that is rude and inconsiderate. chinese manufacturers typically go day-to-day with these projects, and if you'd actually read their updates, it says there is an engineering delay. that does not say "manufacturing delay." don't just blame it on the chinese when it has nothing to do with the chinese." @allen lee, sorry if i offended you, but i was not talking about all chinese people, and manufacturers. having backed a ton of projects on ks, i know that delays are often caused by design, engineering, and logistic problems (mostly creators fault; which is the case to date here), but also by manufacturing problems (mostly from chinese manufacturers, because they are nearly the only ones to do small to medium electronic orders like the ones on ks). that is why i used the term "many", and not "all". again, i was not talking about all chinese people, and manufacturers.
@ michael zhang: i just sent you an inbox message.
hi, pls check my payment was settled and post address is complete. tks
just a friendly reminder to send us an inbox message about any issues relating to your survey or pledge including requesting a refund. thanks! the last day to request a refund is july 9th 11:59 pm pacific standard time. @ryan choi: i will inbox message you in regards to your refund!
how do i request a refund ? because, i will moving house in mid of sep, i can't wait anymore, please cancel my order if you can delivery to me before 10 sep. here is in uk
hello everyone! we hope you all had a great weekend (long weekend for some of us!). just a friendly reminder to send us an inbox message about any issues relating to your survey or pledge including requesting a refund. thanks! @ james lightfoot: you were debited for your pledge at the end of the campaign on june 15th. @ waqas: sorry we are not doing partial refunds as a goodwill gesture. if we did that, the manufacturing of the hub+ will be highly affected, possibly delaying things even longer. however, unlike many other projects, we are offering a full refund to those who want to back out completely. the last day to request a refund is july 9th 11:59 pm pacific standard time. @黄鹏: the last day to request a refund is july 9th 11:59 pm pacific standard time. it will be your responsibility to formally request a refund on or before that date and time. @ dan havens: you have been right by our side since the very beginning! we truly thank you for your support! you are the best :-) @ allen li: thank you for your insightful comment. we are also very disappointed with the delay and we are doing everything in our power to get this product out to our backers.
although i'm not terribly amused by this delay in shipping, this is kickstarter and delays like this are expected. for example, the earin project was due to ship....like early 2015....and it's late 2015 and we have no earins shipped yet. so...i'm okay with it. no refund required. partial refunds would hurt a startup like this and i'm already pretty excited about this project given how fast in relation to the release of the 12-inch macbook. however, the backer/former backer 黄鹏 has a point. as a person who used to do business in china, "loss of credit" is not the best term to describe what he's talking about. more like a loss of face and loss of trust between the consumer and the seller. if he promised this pre-order would ship between this date range, then the consumer will leave a negative rating(loss of trust) and the seller's reputation would be damaged. marie poisson's comment honestly is rather ignorant and honestly i'm offended. i'm trying to be respectful and considerate but that is a generalized statement that is rude and inconsiderate. chinese manufacturers typically go day-to-day with these projects, and if you'd actually read their updates, it says there is an engineering delay. that does not say "manufacturing delay." don't just blame it on the chinese when it has nothing to do with the chinese.
i want to thank you for the communication it's key in any project like this. i am amazed at the offer of a refund this is kickstarter and the risks are well known  your offer is above and beyond. i will stick it out and look forward to a the arrival of my hub+ some day tbd in the future.
ever pledge on ks? and by the way, many delays in ks projects are due to problems at chinese manufacturers, so providing lessons on "loss of credit" in china is not the way to go.
we pledged in august to customer delivery, if you cannot make our products received in august, we had to take the refund. in china, the loss of credit is a very serious matter, and we have always believed: losing credit is the biggest bankruptcy, we will have to pay more to let customers do not get angry, to restore our credit. i hope we'll have a chance to cooperate. if you cannot ensure that we receive the goods in august, itboyhp@gmail.com and wll360247998@gmail.com choose a refund.
do we get a partial refund as a goodwill gesture. the 2 month delay is very inconvenient. as my laptop will arrive in a few days i will have to order the apple adapter in the interim (costing more money)
well.. i want to rethink about it. forget the refund. i will wait for hub+.
i want to refund it. please send me a message about refund.
hi can you confirm when the money will be debited from our accounts?
i'm going to leaving u.s. soon. i want to change my shipping address. please check inbox.
thanks for the updat nonda ;)
@daniel: there will be no problem with changing your shipping address. i will send you an inbox message to give you more details on how to do that. @choi jungkwon: refund issued! sorry to see you go, but we understand. @laura: first batch shipments are scheduled to start in mid-late august. second batch shipments in september. transit time, on average is about 10 days. we, unfortunately, do not have exact shipment dates at the moment. however, we will release that information as we get it in. i thank you for your patience! :-)
well said @edward hor! i don't care about the packaging as long as my hub arrives undamaged i'm good. if shipping starts in mid-late august what are the expected delivery times for the uk? will it be a week or two or even four? i can't wait for my hub i'm too excited!
how can i refund it? i can't found menu..
hi. i will move from norway to grand canaria in mid august. do you think there will there be any problems with the shipping? is it the same shipping cost?
not sure about others but i would rather not get retail packaging if it helps get the adapter in to our hands sooner. :)
@youngjoo kim: i replied to your inbox message. @kevin: well said! wish everyone was as understanding as you! thank you. @michael chen: yes, you can update your address directly on the your survey. just go back into the survey and change it there. you have until august 1st to do that.
hi, quick question, my address has changed since i first filled out the survey, is there a way to provide an updated shipping address?
i can't believe people are asking for a refund.  anyone asking for a refund should stop using kickstarter asap!  this small delay is nothing.  i backed projects like the agent watch which is two years delayed and probably will never see the light of day. that project owner will not even consider refunding anyone's money either. shame on you for being so unreasonable.
i am leaving us in three months so can i get refund? please check your inbox.
good afternoon! please check out our latest update on the progress of the hub+! here is the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1270561 @tyler martin and @黄鹏 : i have sent you an inbox message in regards to you refunds. @xavier tee, @uwidme and @sergio pedrei: we do not have an exact shipping date finalized yet. please read our latest update for further information. @yuk choi tam: unfortunately, we are not shipping the mini adapters before the hub+ because it is not efficient to split up the shipping. i am sorry for the inconvenience. we are working as fast as we can.
can u send the mini adapter first?
where is my hub+ ?
can you give a rough shipping date as to when it will ship in aug?
shanna booher, the difference this time is that many of us are actually stuck with a lovely macbook that badly needed something like the hub+ in the first place, to make it completely useful. timing was crucial in this project and if you see the number of backers for this project, it will prove that the demand for such a product at the time that it was announced was a key reason this project succeeded with such a huge support. delays are obviously inevitable and also part of the kickstarter experience. but in the case of this project, painful. many reputable companies have in fact announced their own usb-c hubs and they will all ship around the time this ships. many of us travel constantly and won't be in the same place when the product finally ships. so all in all, the delays in this project will be felt more strongly than many others that we all have backed...
lol a 1.5-3 month delay is nothing in kickstarter world. i just got notice that a product i back in march 2014 is starting to ship....it was supposed to ship in june 2014, this is a year delay. i've backed other projects that were 4-8 months delayed. the only time i got a project right on time it was an app for my iphone, so no packaging, customs, molds to build, rebuild and perfect etc etc. expect delays in kickstarter-world, but also hope for products all your friends will envy, from designers that love their stuff so much they're excited to answer your questions and help you along the way!
yes! is important update project progress please. but some delays is not problem when  new product comes to market. this is not a shop online is the start of things ¿when the best projects in paloalto arrive in exact date?  go go go  ���update progress please
please update exact progress
i'm going to have to ask for a refund too. sorry to give up on this for now, i will definitely check back in a few months and i might buy one then if you have them available.
how to apply for a refund? we can't wait till august, we buy because you promised july shipments.
@kwangkyoonpark and @jomthana: yes! the short usb-c cable will be included. @marie: you are just an expert at kickstarter! :-)
@jon echo: sorry to see you go, but we completely understand. refund issued. @henry chan: per our update posted on june 8th, we are experiencing a 1.5 month delay.  our current timeline shows first batch shipping will be in august and second batch shipping will be in early september. sorry for the delay. please make sure to read all the updates we post as we did notify all backers of the delay back on june 8th. in case you missed it, here is the link for the update: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312
@henry read comments, and updates. you will know! and by the, way, this is kickstarter ("not a store" blablabla). delays are to be expected ... always!
agree with kwangkyoonpark
are you providing a short usb-c to usb-c cable for connecting a macbook to the hub?
start shipping yet? i go to taiwan next month... .  wtf changed shipping date? no email notice?
this is unacceptable, the item was promised for june delivery and is now extended an additional 3 month! i would like an immediate refund.
@jan: per our update posted on june 8th, we are experiencing a 1.5 month delay. our current timeline shows first batch shipping will be in august and second batch shipping will be in early september. sorry for the delay. in case you missed it, here is the link for the update:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312
when do we receive this product?
"comments on here or on any update cannot be deleted at all; neither by us or by kickstarter." ks can, and do when comments are innapropriate.
@nao: the $3 special to add hdmi was only while the campaign was live. our campaign ended on june 15th. no changes can be made to your pledge after the campaign ended. you, unfortunately, cannot add the hdmi adapter at this point. also, comments on here or on any update cannot be deleted at all; neither by us or by kickstarter. sorry about that. if you have any other questions, you can always inbox message us.
how can i add hdmi adapter? you wrote "early birds special: can add $3 to get an hdmi adapter" and, please delete the comment  i contributed a short while ago.
hdmi adapter
@splintermgs: the reason why no changes can be made to your pledge now is because kickstarter does not allow projects to change the "end date" of the campaign, even if there is a delay. once the campaign ends, no changes can be made at all including adding items or changing reward tiers.
especially given the delay, it's pretty disappointing that those who wanted to upgrade and get the hdmi adapter included aren't allowed. pretty much "forced" to buy another unit if you missed out earlier (but wanted one).
@arlo: per our update posted on june 8th, we are experiencing a 1.5 month delay.  our current timeline shows first batch shipping will be in august and second batch shipping will be in early september. sorry for the delay. here is the link for the update: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312 @andrei: sure. i will inbox message you.
hello. i just saw that delivery times have been changed. can i cancel my pledge?
when you will shipping to china?
@jerry tam: unfortunately, there is no way to make changes to your pledge once the campaign ended on june 15th. also, we are not selling the hdmi adapter on its own. however, we are taking pre-orders on nonda.co. at this point, the only way to get the hdmi adapter would be to pre-order the package that has hdmi adapter included. (please note: pre-orders on nonda.co are not being shipped until october). @yi hoo: unfortunately, we do not have a recommended mst that can be used with our hub+. also, the usb-c port on our hub+ is actually only for charging. it cannot be used to connect the apple dongle to create more ports. sorry about that.
hi guys, quick question on multi display, you recommended that we "our hub+ currently only supports one monitor. however, you can use a display hub such as a mst (multi stream transport) hub to connect two monitors to hub+." can you recommend any mst hubs which you guys have tested with your hub with reasonable lag/response times? i am on a dual screen setup and would like to know what works best. or whether using an apple display hub dongle plugged into your extra usb-c + your mini-display port could be an alternative too?
this is not an urgent matter as far as i am concerned, but it seems that over the past year, no one delivers what they collect money for anytime close to what they promise. just take a look at karma: for their go wi-fi hotspot. order last september for november, then december, then ... and on and on, and still no product. can't anyone plan ahead any longer? after all, this is not a 787.
how to buy an extra hdmi adapter?
@hoang: per our update posted on june 8th, we are experiencing a 1.5 month delay.  our current timeline shows first batch shipping will be in august and second batch shipping will be in early september. sorry for the delay. in case you missed it, here is the link for the update: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312
just wonder if june shipment can be achieved. can you guys clarify on this point?
@chris: yes, you can change your selection before be begin to ship. we will send a final confirmation before shipping begins to allow for updated preferences (different colors, battery vs non battery).
can we change our decision after we see real samples or should i hold on the survey until we do?  if i fill it out now, can i change my pledge selection later?
@chris: as stated on a previous comment (a little down the line on the thread): per our update #14, we have just found a chipset solution and we are currently working on laying out the pcb board. once that is complete, we will then move onto creating samples of the hub+ with and without battery. sorry for the delay.
i would really love to see a real picture of the two versions stacked on top of each other before i fill out my survey.  is this possible?
@tyler: thanks for sharing your concerns with us! as we move forward in finalizing all technical aspects of the hub+, we will definitely keep everyone up to date on any changes or progress. this is also our first kickstarter and along the way, we have learned many things in regards to how we communicate with our backers. comments like yours give us legitimate feedback on how we can improve our interaction with everyone. thank you!
@tyler martin. i fully agree!
nonda, i am just slightly concerned about this product. you have my money now, so i'm expecting to receive a working product in august. i don't know anything about software engineering, but others' complaints do make sense to me. after reading comments on the demo board video of people calling it "fake" and seeing that none of the pictures of the current look of hub+ actually contain working mechanisms, i was very doubtful this was going to be a real product. further research led me to your website, which shows some other products, (new ones that have very little information on them). at this point i was doubtful your company was even real. my faith is somewhat restored now after finding your currently available product "ihere3".   ( http://amzn.com/b00e9oxj2y ) this seems to be a legit product that people are buying, and while the reviews are a little scattered, it does seem to be a working product. i would understand a first product having its issues, so that doesn't bother me. putting all go this together, i can see that you are indeed a real company selling real smart tech products, which is good. still there are some worries i have about the hub+. i, and i'm sure many others, would like to see a video or picture of something to help gain our trust again that this is going to be a real functional product in the near future. i make these comments in the most sincere way possible. i still believe in this product, and if it is successfully created, it will sell like crazy. i just wish that your marketing gave us a little more concrete evidence of what our money will bring us in the end. thank you for reading my concerns, and i wish nonda the best. remember, all of us here today believed in you enough to trust you with our financial support. please don't let us down. -tyler martin
good afternoon wonderful backers! just a quick reminder that if anyone has any issues or questions about your survey or pledge, please send us an inbox message so we can better help you! thanks! @carmen: our current timeline shows that 2nd batch shipments will begin in early september. sorry for the delay. @sam hon: please check our update posted on may 22nd about the battery. here is the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1239387 @alexander and wister ng: per our update #14, we have just found a chipset solution and we are currently working on laying out the pcb board. once that is complete, we will then move onto creating samples of the hub+ with and without battery. sorry for the delay. @ralph: i will reply to your inbox message with this same question. @ross: please check our update #12 that was posted on june 8th about our delay in shipment. because of this, changes to the shipping address can be made up until august 1st. here is a link to the update: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312 @makita: per our faq located at the bottom of the main campaign page: yes, the usb-c to usb-c cable will be included with the hub+. please make sure to check out our faq which has answers to many frequently asked questions. also, in regards to the chicken dance, per our update #15 posted yesterday, we have filmed the chicken dance and we are currently editing it. it will be posted by the end of the week. just in case you missed it, here is a link to that update: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1265253
@nonda, will there be any comparison pictures for us before we make the decision on the version of the hub+?
nonda i think you should give us all a free leather pouch for sticking with you. especially with all the doubt that has been spread in the comments sections..... i mean we are loyal supporters after all....
a quick question : does hub+ package include a short usb-c cable to connect hub+ and macbook (as we see in the hub+ promo photos), or do i need to get one apart from the package? it's pity to see the fact the shipment is august at earliest. i was expecting to bring hub+ with my macbook in my travel in july. now i know it is impossible. however, i understand this is the way a crowsourcing product is developed. show me chicken dance, guys!
hi, delivery date target was july 2015, this was part of my reason for supporting...a swift solution for the one port macbook challenge. now i read that it's possible to change survey details even during august? how does that fit with a july delivery target ?
i ordered 2 hub+ and one hdmi (early bird)... didn't find in the survey how to add the info about hdmi...  will it just be send to me, together with the 2hub+ or did i miss something in the survey?
can you pls. also send me a comparision picture of the version with and the one without the batterie at best with an macbook 12 in the back?
what is the target weight of the final production unit (with and without built-in batteries)?
hi there, if june moved onto august, the second batch (july) will arrive in september? that would mean the whole summer will go with no macbook hub!
@andy: at this point, we are not offering the leather pouch for individual sale. sorry about that.
hi there i would like to get the leather pouch still, how do we get that as part of the order delivery?
@daniel: yes, the version with battery doubled in battery capacity to 800 mah in comparison to the original version that was 400 mah. we now have two version: one with the 800 mah battery and one without a battery. @gus: the adapter that comes with the $79 early bird reward tier is the mini usb-a adapter.
@daniel nguyen https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1239387: "when we sent out a survey last monday (may 11th) to all of our backers at the time, 55% of backers preferred a hub+ with the built-in battery while 31% preferred it without the battery. since there is a considerable amount of backers who didn't want the battery, the team decided to make two versions: one with the battery and one without the battery."
@nonda regarding the survey, i pledged $79 early bird and it states: you’ll get one hub+ and one bonus adapter. how will you know which adapter we would like?  should our selection be added to notes/comments or will it automatically be the mini usb adapter?
i don't think i am incorrect @creator. i've been following the campaign and the original has 2.5 hours of battery built in. the update was the option to double the capacity with a 4mm increase in size wasn't it? am i wrong about this backers?
@duc: yes it is exactly like the the apple space gray.
will you be honoring the case as a show  of good faith for your backers?
would like to ask bout the space gray color. is it exactly like the apple space gray? coz it looks lighter in your stretch goal photo. tks
just a reminder to all to please inbox message us if you have any issues with your surveys. it is much easier for us to help you if you send us a private message as opposed to try to help you on the public comment page! @mickey: your survey selection does show silver. but, don't worry. before we begin to ship in august, we will send another survey for those who had any issues with color or battery selections. @jefferey bower and @francesco: i have send you both a private message. please check your inbox messages/email.
i am having a similar issue as mickey kim - i went to edit my address, thinking my color choice would stay but it reverted to space grey, the first color option - however - i want gold. it took a few times to get everything right - address and color - i just want to insure i get the correct color - which is gold...
i'm having trouble with submitting the options on the survey. no matter what color i choose, the survey always lists "silver" as my choice, but i chose space grey on the survey.
is there a possibility of sharing a photo of the two designs (battery versus no-battery) compared to a macbook so we can make a better informed choice?
is there a possibility of sharing a photo of the two designs (battery versus no-battery) compared to a macbook so we can make a better informed choice?
hi nonda! will you ship the first units in june/july for backers or agoust is the indication for those who will make a preorder from your website? thank you
@daniel: actually no, that is incorrect. the choices are with or without battery. please check out our update that has all the details of the battery. here is the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1239387
so in terms of battery, it's either 9mm for 2.5 hours or 13mm for 4 hours right? (although they stated "double" capacity of the original)
@maletone: we are sending it out soon. thanks for your patience!
i have not received my surveys yet
has anyone received the final survey yet?
space grey for me please! thank you.
great to hear you've made your financial goal.  it proves to be a wonderful product.  if this is the time and place to request colour, i'd like it in space grey, if possible.  otherwise, i'm open to any.
@sergio: per our comment posted 3 hours ago: you will receive a final survey today asking you to note your preference on color and battery as well as to note your shipping address.
congratulations for happy final project,  i'm very excited because hub+ is the only and perfect extra  for new macbook. when your send form for choose color???�
silver for me please.
again, just a reminder: you will receive a final survey today asking you to note your preference on color and battery as well as to note your shipping address. (it is not necessary to post your color preference here but we love the excitement!)
space grey for me please.
good morning to all our wonderful backers! we are super excited to be moving onto the next part of our campaign. i see many of you have some questions. i will do my best to answer them all. if you have any further questions, please inbox messages us so we can help you. first, we want to thank everyone for all the support and patience through out this campaign. you guys rock! *we will be sending out a survey today asking everyone to make their selections on the hub+ (color and with or without battery). also, this survey will ask you to note your shipping address. *for those of you who saw you were charged an additional $5 or $15: you were charged that extra amount because you did not add the shipping charge to your original pledge. shipping fees were $5 for within the us and $15 for international. because you did not add that amount to your original pledge, kickstarter automatically added that amount. sorry for the inconvenience or if shipping charges were not clear. *once the campaign ended at midnight pst on 6/15, changes to pledges can no longer be made. that includes changing tiers or adding more hub+ sets. we are taking pre order on nonda.co for those of you who are interested. *our current timeline for shipping shows that we will begin shipments in august. again, if you have any specific questions about your pledge, please inbox message us so we can better help you. thanks again to everyone for your continued support!

well, congratulations first! then, give me the gold one please oaq, becoz my macbook is gold. congratulations again~ send it to me soon~ thx~
i've pledged for $97 for the hub and both adopters ships to hong kong, but it seems like kickstart had charged me an extra $15....so it totally charged me $112... nonda please fix it.
good!!!! please give me gold color~!!
$16,540 short for a case :( congratulations to nonda. you guys did a great job, can't wait to have my hub+.
hey nonda team, i wanted to directly ask you all if you'd consider honoring the $900k stretch goal and award us with the leather case. it was hard to see all the doubt and speculation in the comments up until the last minute. i think those of us who stuck with your should be rewarded.
great job hub+ team!.  i'm looking forward to receiving the hub (after you've gone through great quality control) and using it with my macbook. when do we receive the e-mail to provide our color selection, etc.?
hi, i have received an email updating me about the project; it was not mentioned the hdmi adapter (i have added 3 $ to the initial amount). domenico
congrats on the successful funding! now.... the faster you can finish and ship the product, the better :-). my macbook needs some docking action in order for it to be useful at work!
space gray please
congrats! how am i going to enter the survey so the colour can be picked and shipping address will be provided to you guys? will you send out email for the survey?
i was wondering also when we get to choose the color!  can not wait for the hub+, you did an outstanding job getting this to market so quickly
congratulation(๑•̀ㅂ•́)و✧
so will shipment in july be met?  also even though fell just short of case stretch goal will you still be providing case?
please give me space grey! i can't open facebook to fill in the survey.
good!!!! please give me gold color~!!
really hope this isn't fake! i'm looking forward to having my hub + but i do think for all the backers that entrusted you with your pledges and didn't back out last minute that you should give them a free case. seeing as there is a delay we didnt expect until the last few days. seeing as you have you video demo showing that the hub works regardless of it being usb 2  or usb 3 does that no mean we are on target? i thought thr chips working together was what the delay was before manufacturing started?
i love this! can't wait to have my own hubby hub �
can i up my pledge by the 3usd for an hdmi adapter? and please give us a chance at the nice pu case.
congratulations! when will you send a survey for the preferences? i also expect hdmi adapter because i've pledged 97 usd: 79usd earlybird pledge + 15usd shipping + 3usd as asked in the email (receved on 20th of may) for hdmi adapter.
i bought 11, but separately in the two id, can you help me with the delivery, and return one copy of the freight? i have sent you separate message
june's order when can shipment?
i am a chinese, a manager of a company, want to agent your products in china, we can work together?
i prefer, if is possible, space gray thanks alessio
hi ! is it still possible to switch from the 86 to the 93 $ pledge ? (plus shipping) regards marcel berman
おめでとーございまーす！
congratulation! how do i choose from three color? and do i need provide the delivery address?
hey guys how do i change my pledges to get a second hub ?
hey guys how do i change my pledges to get a second hub ?
where to choose the there colors?i can't find.
hi i had pledged $93 but i got charged in my credit card for $108 which mean you have charged $15 extra. may i know why is this? also request you to give us the pu leather case free for kickstarter backers as you are very close to yor last stretch goal.
where do i choose from three colors ?
really looking forward to this :-)
you does not reached only 17k to free case goal, please lower this stretch goal and make us happy with free case :) this pu leather cover cost just 1-2$ to produce for you (just 18000$ from 883000$ that we all pledged here).
agree with weetom. wish you reduce the stretch goal for us who believe in your project and your team. thank you so mush nonda team.
congratulation! where do i need to write my delivery address?
sorry to see the last stretch goal not reached, but the case is really beautiful could you please break the rule for lovely us?
good job !!!
a "yo" from switzerland! great project, now lightning speed delivery and you will get unlimited love from the community!
where is my hub+
@ keifer, for your question #2, we have to use an external power, because the power supply port of this engineering pcb board is not usb-c interface. this external power cable will be replaced by your macbook charging cable in hub+. -steve.
@grant, thanks for clarifying this. hi all, if you check the video @54s carefully, you can clearly see "usb 3.0 hi-speed bus" on  the top of the profile window. -steve.
look closely - it's the usb device plugged into the bus ("ultra" at 0:54) that's usb2. not the bus.
have to agree with keifer, they're charging with 20v, in which case they'd need to add step up converter or mod their design... either way, gonna take forever. also, the specs are actually reading as usb 2.0, and not enough info on why this is... i'll save my money now and pay for the $99 version when it ships
ok guys, i'm tired of all this and i'm tired of losing all this time. when you do the serious projects we may talk about it, maybe .... i'm out
who are steve and ann (the ones sending the privater messages) any fake persons or is s prove here that they're real and by nonda?
oh, got this by private message: since i do not get s reply thhere again about other prove of prev. projects or an english page of this 'so super' ceo page do i postit here: --- the information about jia li's previous company is on that link that was shared with you. the company is called baixing.com hog is the creator and inventor of the ihere 3.0 that can be found on amazon. --- why no other hardware preve then on noda page? why no english page of this super startup? anyone speaking chinese here? my friends from asia didn't reply to my mail asking for translation and info so fair...
ahahahaha!! oh you poor people, hub+ has really done it this time. please ignore the fake yes fake video evidence. i am a computer hardware engineer and saw through this crap right away: #1 they are claiming in the video that they have "usb3.0!" but if you look at what they are doing they are highlighting "capacity" as in the size of the thumb drive not "speed". the speed shows 480 mb/sec which if you knew the usb spec, which they clearly do not, is usb 2.0 speed..  #2 they are claiming that they are the first outside of apple to figure out the charging through a hub but, oh wait, thats not the apple charge cable! they are using a power supply to supply 20v. the macbook charge cable only provides 14.5v and it does so only after contracting with the mac through the cc pin (or vbus) which their power supply cannot emulate...  so basically they are just tricking you and thinking you as the investors are too stupid to see through their scam.. beware people, the creator does not seem to know the usb type c spec at all and therefore will not be able to provide you with a real solution!!
asking again, since time is running out and i would like to know if it's worth to give a tray and trust you or not: please give us some example / prove to be checked about the  previous internet startup, which raised over 150 million usd as you say, founded by  your ceo, jia li as well, give us please some prove examples about hardware you co-founder,hog has done in the past 20 years. and still this question to be replayed: you guys spent a lot of money for adverts everywhere... how comes you had such money or other asked why kickstsarter if you have so much money vor adverts and from prev. startups etc.?
and which have this startup been? any prove that they're real? by the way, you guys spent a lot of money for adverts everywhere... how comes you had such money or other asked why kickstsarter if you have so much money vor adverts and from prev. startups?
ok, i fule you.  our ceo, jia li, is a serial entrepreneur. his previous internet startup raised over 150 million usd from benchmark capital.,etc top vcs. our co-founder,hog, is a hardware guru who made over 100 harware products in the past 20 years.  you can learn more from here:https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nonda -steve
"if we reach $900k, we'll include a free protective hub+ case made out of high-quality pu leather and designed in italy with your hub+ pledge." why not replace this with a leather alternative (cruelty free, reduce the high carbon and pollution impacts)?
hmm... ok... can you tell ussomething about you and your team (background, names) etc. which we can not read on the pages...? who are you guys where did you work before and where did you study? how sre you in contact with the china factory guys... have you been there by your self or how is your contact working there?
@ralph, i just asked all my colleagues, we really don't know who is nelson chiu... -steve
i somehow still have a bad feeling, but i might give you a chance when you can explain what whit this 5 star recommendation on facebook from nelson chiu – the guy who is ceo by this arist company which is still not delivering there products from the kickstarter campaign... i know it's not easy as a startup company, i started my some years ago as well and know that's sometime hard to get everything right and make people believe if not everything goes as it should. so i would really love to believe in you even if my feeling tells me different... hope you will prove my feeling wrong and this is in the end a working project. will see to the last minute how it goes and then decide... so please explain the recom. from nelson chiu and tell us everything about the product and your company to make us believe in you and the product again... regards from europe
@jomthana: our current timeline shows shipment will begin in august.
can you tell us about estimate time you can deliver your completed product to us?
i am canceling my pledge (early bird)...from the video, this product will be not completed and shipped in at least another 3 months so...by then i will be able to buy a "real" product from a "real" vendor....good luck guys....i am out!
i think i might have to back out and just keep my apple multi adapter... living out of a backpack for the next few months and i don't think this will be ready until end of summer.
not taking any chances with a last minute switch or to back these lot. so...enjoy a new early bird slot
i have backed enough projects to know when something doesn't feel right and this definitely does not feel right.  $1 pledge here i come.
out of the $79 + adaptor eb pledge, and in the $1 in 10, 9, 8, ...
i would rather wait for a final product release and make the purchase, even though at a higher price, but at least i know what i'm really paying for! with or without me, this project is getting funded, and i'm not in a rush. no doubt it's a great concept if all goes as well as planned!
discovered something else. according to their website, nonda want to release 3 products in 2 months : hub+ (july), zus (also july), and cliq (august). all in excess to ihere 3.0 that is supposed to be out. a huge lot for a small startup isn't?
when in doubt, guard your wallet!
another point is the anonymity of the founders. many kickstarter features the founders talking about their product. this one is clouded behind nonda. always a hidden face. i wonder why. just my suspicions being raised. ok. radio out.
watched the new videos - looks very 'raw' compared to the initial promotional video. after all this time and no proper working demo? pcb also looks way too big. the video on the iphone is also too short to show anything. wish the rest of you good luck. hope you really do get the actual product. i'm not putting my bets on this one.
that is an interesting question kevin. i chose to believe the answer to my question regarding the gold pledges, but that is indeed a possibility. unfortunately, it will be night time in most of the american continent, and if they back out, a lot of us will not see it!
just watched the vid, and based on that you'll be lucky to see a hub+ arriving this year. the gold adaptors are bizarre, this whole friends thing has sounded weird since it was mentioned at the beginning. i just feel like they are trying to catch a whale by dangling one available. i wanna see if those nine gold ones suddenly get cancelled at the last minute.
well after reviewing the videos, it seems legit to me, even "a bit" at last minute. at this point in development, july, august or even september delivery look doubtful. there is still a lot of work to do before manufacturing, although doable. nonda need to be way more transparent in their communication though. i'm still in, but not a fan of the way it's going to date. i would certainly not be in for more than my $79 + adapter pledge.
well gareth, $79, or $86 is money you don't have for something else, particularly if this happened to not deliver.
@gareth: thank you so very much for your support! @ralph: those pledges did indeed come from our friends. several of our founder’s friends want to have something special. to carter to those requests, we created the 24k gold hub+ for them, which is why those were sold on the first day. further, we reserved a few for the public, just in case someone else wants to have the same thing. we are very lucky to have many people who truly believe in our product and are able to support us in this way.
just seen the videos - great to see some examples working.  anyone that is in doubt - so what, it's not a huge amount of money, i'd rather support nonda - they have altered the product based on feedback, so it the delay is for a better product. the best things come to those who wait!  can order laptop now!
thanks for your replay... i still have an other question which might help me decide if i should start to trust you again or not... what's with this thing about the golden backers ivan talked about  5 hours ago:  "back on 6 may - 9 people backed this project at $3999 each for the gold plated version within 24hrs. someone already suspected something fishy. you can scroll back to view previous comments. just something i recalled." sound's a bit strange to me... any explanation form your side about this?
@ralph: we welcome anyone to come visit us at our office! the "building" is only 3 offices located in a predominantly residential area located near downtown palo alto. the other 2 offices are currently dental offices. in regards to our ceo, you can also check out his linkedin at this link: https://www.linkedin.com/in/baixingjia
ok, i'm still not sure if i should trust you after ignoring every question... how about your headquater, see the comments?  what's in the building you are located and why do we find only medical companies in this building? does the designer and you have any reverence to be shown to give us any trust in you and your project back? the ceo have, according to his fb page been working for microsoft... any prove of it?
@phil c: the pcb board in the video is the engineering pcb board used to confirm that all functionalities can work together. now that we have a solution, our next step is to lay out the pcb board for hub+. @ralph: we did not reply to the previous comments because we wanted to wait until we had a confirmed update on the chipset and firmware solution. we apologize for the last minute post. if you look at our website, www.nonda.co, we clearly state that jan schmitt is our designer. for the ceo and owner, check this link: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nonda @richard: unfortunately, kickstarted does not let us update the reward to show that you will be getting your hdmi adapter.  we will know to send you one based on your total amount pledged.
phil c. i was having exactly the same thoughts, so nonda, how come it looks that big?
there are only 12 hours left to go, and still we are left with nothing. no responses from nonda, or any updates concerning a working model, just an overwhelming multitude of comments from concerned backers. if you look at nonda's instagram "nondainc" there are 37 posts in the account. of those 37 posts, there are various pictures with iphones or the new macbook attached to it. now i want you to think about this question when you are looking at these photos. "why are all the iphone screens black?". shouldn't a person advertising a product that not only charges an iphone but a computer and other devices at least show a screen with the green charging symbol on the top right. then i looked my closely at the pictures with the macbooks. take a look at a picture 1 week back (third row, third picture down). take a look at the top right corner. that's right! this pos doesn't even show the mother-******* charging sign, and its cropped tf out. now rewatch the videos. not once did i ever hear the charging sound that the new macbook makes when you charge it. now go to '0.44' seconds in the video. okay, so it shows an iphone six supposedly "charging", but is it really. it only last for a couple seconds so that the viewer may not notice, but i want you all to plug in your phones. now what does it say? well its not "battery charging" that's damn straight. for example, for my phone it will say "56% charged", because i have 56% of battery left. seeing that this is a new iphone, it should be the same as well, but it isn't. i even turned off the battery percentage on my phone and tested it out, and same thing. whatever percentage of battery you have left, it will show that when you are charging it, not "battery charging". plus, how do you know that the screen is just a fake photoshopped picture onto the iphone to show that it is "charging" but in reality it isn't. again, wait until the girl puts the usb-c into her macbook. once again, no charging sound appears to be present. it is kind of peculiar how relatively all of the video is background music and a narrator talking in the background. now if this isn't enough evidence for you, i have more. i went to nonda's website and clicked the "about" section and this is what it says. "nonda is founded in palo alto by several big fans of smart hardware. our vision is to become the ultimate platform for smart hardware. company culture efficient communication, straight forward, no bs. transparency, 100% mutual trust. strive for excellence, 1% improvement every day. fairness, reward based on contribution. enjoy, have fun. office location: 828 bryant street, palo alto, california, united states" it is very short, and not very professional from my standpoint. the fact that they say no "bs" is ringing a bs alarm right in my ears. also, "founded by several big fans of smart hardware", that is all they have to offer us to trust them. trust is earned, and frankly, they haven't been doing a great job at it. the next thing i did was search up their address: 828 bryant street, palo alto, california, united states. i went to google and pressed enter. now what did i find? psychiatrists, psychiatrists, psychiatrists (dishotsky norman md a professional corporation to be specific). why would their company be in a building that is predominantly a healthcare facility. those were the top three keywords that popped up, and nonda being the fourth. now go back to the previous comments to ivan. he stated that "back on 6 may - 9 people backed this project at $3999 each for the gold plated version within 24hrs." if 9 people backed them during the first day they started kickstarter, & it still shows that 1 limited spot is still available, then that comes to show that this whole entire time from may 6- june 15 no one has actually bought the gold plated hub. if you still uncertain, keep scrolling back to previous comments, they probably have more if not better evidence that show that this project is a scam. i want you all to think carefully these last remaining hours before risking your money. it seems kickstarter hasn't intercepted the project yet, but there is still a chance that this project is nothing more than a scam. personally, this is my first time on kickstarter, and i don't want it to have a horrible first experience having my money stolen. even if this were real, it is a long shot. i mean if they have their money funded, what makes you think they will deliver it to you on time. now look at "zen dock" by cole flournoy another kickstarter project that was fully funded. its has been two years already, that's right, two years, and backers still haven't received their zen dock. nonda has around 8,000 and counting hub+ to manufacture and deliver at our doorsteps around their estimated time frame of late august. they are biting off more than they can chew, and by the looks of it, the lack of responses for their backers is because they are trying to hold back by saying anything until the last remaining hours. & why is that you suppose? that is because they will lose a large portion of their backers in a short time frame. i have done the research, and based on my perspective, i would like to keep $100 and spend it on something that i trust and will be delivered to me on time. i recommend waiting to see if the project actually delivers. who cares if you pay full price for $20 or $30 more than the campaign prices. it ensure a fully functioning product, and it's worth the extra cash to wait. cheers everyone, and wish you all best of luck. -danni update: i just watched the video, and must i say how much of a jump this is from a high definition quality camera to that of an iphone almost. the video is unlisted and only those with the link can view it, also comments are disabled for the video itself. in one of the videos, you see him attaching the usb and usb-c to the printed circuit board (pcb). theres no way that pcb will fit inside the aluminum body of the hub+, the dimensions are much larger. the videos are there for you to decide, and although it was very last minute, at least it was posted for last minute deciding. as for me, i want to have faith that this project will go through as efficiently as possible, but i am drawn between the line of keeping my pledge to see how everything goes, or dropping it altogether. this is one of the best designed multi-port hubs out in the market today on the basis of looks. functionality on the other hand . . . let's hope nonda delivers this as well. i will be keeping my pledge until the final remain hours. i want to see and read everyone's opinion before taking a risk on my behalf.
hello.  i signed up for the $79 early bird and upped my pledge by 3 dollars for the hdmi adapter ($79 early bird + $15 shipping + $3 added for hdmi dongle = $97 total)  because there is no confirmation of the dongle addition, does this mean you guys will know a pledge of $97 entitles me to both the usb and hdmi mini dongles?  just checking.  thx
@nonda give us some trust in you back, tell us why you haven't been replaying to any of our psts and messages? and let us please also know who's the real owner of noda and who is the designer... give us some details and maybe, just maybe we start to beleave in you and your project again...
how come the pcb looks bigger than the actual hub+? i mean, how does the pcb fit in hub+?
do you guys beleave the very latest update and videos: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1264285 such things can be easy faked... what do you others think about it?
hey all! good afternoon from palo alto! we are excited to announce a new update with video demos! check it out! also, in regards to the indigogo.com posting of the hub, that was definitely not us. we are not sure who did it, but the posting has been removed.
unfortunately, i've decided to back out as well for 2 reasons: 1) i frankly don't think i'll be using a usb-c hub that much to begin with as i barely even use my apple hdmi usb c dongle. i use my 15" mbp retina for most of the heavy lifting and connectivity and my new macbook for portability; 2) i find it astounding that nonda has not responded to legitimate inquiries and concerns from its backers. that is just poor business sense to say the very least.
uh by the way, who's the chef designer from germany, this jan schmitt from heidelberg? is it this guy? https://www.elance.com/s/junikdesign/ https://www.xing.com/profile/jan_schmitt21 his website is as well not working... http://junik-design.de
looks like i'm out too... by the way, according to facebook is the founder and ceo of nonda a guy named jia li: https://www.facebook.com/kimbleli
do tbey have a sign titled "tooth and $ extractors"? ;-)
@ivan i don't live in palo alto, but google street view shows nonda's address to be a single story building that hosts some dental practices (based on the signage). i wonder how old this street view picture is?
haven't been tracking this too closely, but yes, i would say it all sounds fishy. main reason i jumped on was the promise of getting a unit shortly after my macbook (which i just got this weekend). after seeing all the comments and lack of response, i have lost any confidence of their ability to deliver quickly. i don't know if it's a scam or not, but even if it isn't, i am now sure that i'll be able to buy something like this from another manufacturer before nonda ships anything. worst case i figure is that i'll buy this at full retail when it ships. i'd rather pay $40 more later than lose $80 completely.
hi guys, does anyone know if nonda has responded to any of the raised concerns? i'm about to jump ship but wanted to give them one last chance before they run off with my $$$.
just dropped my pledge to $1 and switched to voltus https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltus/voltus-mobile-power-expansion-for-your-macbook
right it is!!
lol. oui, je comprends (did i get that right) haha
you know, my name is"fish" in french, so i can smell fishy things ;-)
i think i was this someone ;-)
back on 6 may - 9 people backed this project at $3999 each for the gold plated version within 24hrs. someone already suspected something fishy. you can scroll back to view previous comments. just something i recalled.
wonder who removed it
https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hub-for-usb-c-get-your-macbook-ports-back << this has been removed
what's incredible is to see this one going up and up. do people read comments? updates? do their homeworks?
i'm out too!
this one is a clear canadian scam (palo alto, manitoba, canada ?). i'll let hub+ respond to it. sure they will react a lot faster to this, than to our interrogations.;-)
it's here under hub (not hub+) https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hub-for-usb-c-get-your-macbook-ports-back#/
@ivan not seing any hub+ on indiegogo. either it disappear fast, or it is listed under something else.
hi marie. it's true. i just saw in indiegogo. you can search there. very suspicious of nonda.
the indiegogo one looks like someone has just copy-pasted everything from here over there. i doubt it's actually them. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hub-for-usb-c-get-your-macbook-ports-back#/story i think i'll jump ship too if there's no news from nonda in the next few hours. apparently they're active enough to update their facebook page 1hr and 17hrs ago, but don't care enough to come back here.
*since
sivpce they are in california, i considerer 13:00 my time limit for a new update showing their functional prototype. after that, i'm gone ...
ivan. real thing or not? if it is, it is another very doubtful practice from hub+.
hi everyone - hub+ just got listed on indiegogo. seems they have the time to list it there but no time to reply to backers here. i'm out.
it's scam campaigns like these that kickstarter is shooting themselves at their feet...they were pretty strict at the beginning then $$$ starts clouding their brain. i have backed over 120 projects but slowly but surely lots of people like me are losing their trust with this platform...shame on you kickstarter !
kickstarter will see their $856193 x 10% = $85,619 commission...so they will just let it slide. caveat emptor
anyone informed kickstarter about it, i mean it is a "kickstarter staff pick", so... to bad, would have loved this project, but it really seems a "dead fish"... tried to contact nonda over facebook, over twitter, over kickstarter message no replay, not even a note on  the comments... was thinking first, they might be on weekend, but now it's monday and getting close to the finish of this foundation which means they here for sure, but probably not giving any comment 'cause they realize that people here are not to dump and starting to realize that's a dead fish... i'm still in, but if there's noting coming back i guess i will be out before the project ends as well...
bye bye, i'm out. i'm not willing to risk something again on ks. why don't you guys just answer and be honest to the backers...
their website nonda.co lists their address as 828 bryant street, palo alto, california, united states. anyone staying nearby may be able to verify if the company exists.
interesting how there is no comment from nonda. i'm also backing out in another few hours if still nothing heard. this will be the kind of response (delayed) even if this is not a scam.
i unbacked myself earlier today, but came back to chip in a dollar just for commenting's sake was trolling out nonda's facebook page when i realised that there was this "nelson chiu" guy who gave them a 5 star review. for those wondering who this fella is, he's one of the founders for arist, which was another project i was backing previously. turns out arist was nothing but fluff - there's tonnes of angry backers out there who are demanding refunds, and not getting them. classic case of great marketing and fluff, and when it comes to post-funding, nothing. check it out here:- https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/236195807/arist-brews-coffee-like-the-best-baristas-anytime take a read for your reading on this as well :- http://aristscam.com/ i've long given up trying to get my money back, but at the moment i sure hell am a lot more cautious with kickstarter. i'm not insinuating that there's dots connecting their team and ops, but when a dead fish starts showing it's head, i'd be more cautious on backing something that does not even bother to respond regarding technicalities. cheers and good luck all.
enjoy the early bird space that has just opened up!
so i was all in on hydradock, then horror stories about one of the creators forced me to back out. next was hub+ and boy have they been advertising everywhere, and i mean everywhere. their bloody advert has been following me everywhere. alas, it seems i must back out of this one too as my constant requests for proof of concept have been ignored. the money is rolling in for sure, but i ain't sticking with them. so now i'm left with voltus which i think is gonna be fantastic. a power bank for all my devices and a usb hub. also gone with kadi for portability (i would have selected branch too but i have the apple hdmi dongle already). finally, pluggable for the docking station/connectivity goodness from a company with a strong reputation. it isn't a pretty dock, but it's going to be a fixture at home. whether you back out like i am doing right now is up to you, but the creators haven't even attempted to answer the prototype issue, instead choosing to offer a pu leather case (btw that's not real leather, pu stands for polyurethane and costs next to nothing to make) to push more sales. i smell something fishy and i'm not gonna wait to find out if i was right to be fearful or not. laters people
@spencer depends on what you are doing... i get anywhere from 5 to 9 hours
@spencer i do get 8-9 hours from mine.
off topic a bit...  is the new macbook battery not delivering the 9 hours they advertise in your experience? i've not got mine yet (ordered just under 2 weeks back). assumed that would be enough for me so voltus doesn't really seem worth it to me.
just jumped - gone to $1 to just be able to comment - will pull that tomorrow. good luck everyone, plugable gets my cash and i'll wait for a commercial portable version to come soon.
another +1 for voltus, looking forward to charging my macbook anywhere i want... https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltus/voltus-mobile-power-expansion-for-your-macbook
@marie-andree lol... made my day... �
@andreas for sure, but "we told them so"! ;-)
... sadly even 500 of us canceling their pledge will leave them with a huge sack full of money...
just set a reminder to cancel my pledge in 12 hours as well, should there be no satisfactory reply from @creator. something's off.
@nonda: please be honest, why have you been more or less ignoring the comments concerning a video of a working version? i am a bit sceptical now and am considering dropping my pledge. i don't want to risk losing my cash, even if you do turn out to deliver...
just changed to a $1 pledge and spend the other $78 buying pop corn reading comments. good luck to the rest...you need lots of them here
i've reflected on matters further during the day. with 40 hours ago and 7,488 backers, i've decided to make it 7,487. i'm out. i wish the developers good luck but they've scared this backer away. if it emerges out of the shadows i may consider it at retail, if by then i've not jumped on another offer.
by the way, anker have a ton of mini hubs on or coming to the market. not as sexy as this one, but at least real, or near commercialization.
the market for macbook products are moving at light speed so delivering a new product timely is the key to success. if this product is not getting out in time then the opportunity will quickly diminished and goes to the one who can. however, if that is the case we, the backers, will be cash strapped. my experience with ks had taught me that i should sit this one out and purchase it after the product has been delivered on time, successfully. the risk of putting the money upfront far exceeded the benefits of using such a peripheral device.
"pebble is the best example of good communication, transparency, and delivery of an extraordinary project. " the actual project certainly is, but the first one was a mess, and nearly 1 year late. they had to hire a manufacturing consultant to get it right. that being said, i could tolerate some delays from a first time creator, but what i don't telerate is the way they say it's our fault if the product has changed so much, and the lack of transparency and realist plan.
@nonda - you claim the battery change was based upon feedback but i am not seeing it. yes usb 2.0 was a loud cry for change but the battery was not. in fact, the battery is the least needed feature. nevertheless, if the delay was usb 3 related just say that clearly. and as others have requested prototype video please.
"there must be a feature freeze. there must be a credible timetable and there must be complete transparency from the project developers." so true! there must be a feature freeze : tought it was a strong point of this project at the beginning, as it was supposed to be near production. not the case at all! there must be a credible timetable : well, clearly not anymore! there must be complete transparency from the project developers : those guys are marketers first, and creators far behind!
chiming in. i have seen a lot of good ks projects, pebble is the best example of good communication, transparency, and delivery of an extraordinary project.  nonda does have all the warning signs that failed projects have: constant feature changes (more features for the same price?!), changing relevant features (the battery story) and, most of all, failure to deliver some kind of proof that it works.  they promised a video weeks ago, there have been tons of requests to at least show a working prototype, regardless of the design. hey, nonda, you are talking about everything else, and i believe that you have been doing a proof of concept that worked on a macbook. so it should be no problem to show something.  to make it clear: i am not saying that you are cheating on us. i only say - as many others do - that you make all efforts to make us feel like you do. so please: show us that there is a prototype that works!
please don't drop the ball chaps. (reposted from an update thread): i too am a "little concerned" - perhaps judging by the rush for money and the linguistic tone employed. it might just be over enthusiasm and business naivety or i am being more cautious as it seems far too many kickstarter projects turn out to be damp squibs. the "triggertrap ada" and their "creative idea of accounting" debacle was the last straw and i stopped backing ks for a time. luckily my credit card issuer has been helpful to date and has granted chargeback requests when (sadly a fair few ks projects) have not delivered the goods. ks only care about their commissions it feels... i want and hope this project to succeed. yet once the first milestone is not met after completion without a damn good, credible reason i will be pressing the panic button and let the might of mastercard international and their team of lawyers and finance wallahs get involved if necessary. i do share some of the concerns raised. there must be a feature freeze. there must be a credible timetable and there must be complete transparency from the project developers. if they've not already done so, they should look at many failed ks projects and see how many have turned out due to mismanagement (hello triggertrap), creative spinning (triggertrap again) and lack of project management and projection completion skills (triggertrap, why do you keep on springing to my mind).
+1 @knut i'm also backing the voltus project (hub + battery) which is great as the macbook's battery is quickly empty, check it my friends ! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/voltus/voltus-mobile-power-expansion-for-your-macbook… i' an eb on hub+ but there too strange and disappointed things to 100% trust this is not a fake project. i think to cancel my pledge. i don't want to loose my money.
it seems that you invest a lot of time and effort to get more money. instead you should show us all a working prototype video. no one needs a leathercase for thin air.
kickstarter is very much a trust and support platform, so when the creator are dodging questions or not being upfront with things it calls into question their integrity and raised a red flag. you have 24 hours to come clean, or i'm out of here...and i encouraged others to do the same. real pity... :-(
hi guys, are you fix the date of delivery for early bird?
guys, updates on getting more pledges but no answer to showing us something in the works? not very nice. 52 more hours to mass exodus... i've backed 3 scam projects over the past 2 years and am not willing to commit to vaporware again.
@kean maizels thanks!
i've freed up an eb spot as i decided to replace my macbook air with a surface pro 3 instead of the new macbook.  good luck all!
nonda why won’t you address any of the questions about showing the old prototype? @marie i agree, this working usb-2.0 hub they speak of doesn't exist. they have been dodgy about answering my questions for several weeks that require them to prove any actually works. there are two new options for usb-c hubs on kickstarter right now and both have either a track record or have demonstrated some sort of functionality. one is a great office solution, the other is a great mobile solution. i encourage everyone to check these out: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/plugable/plugable-ultimate-usb-c-universal-docking-station https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/branchusb/branch-form-fitted-usb-c-hub-for-new-macbook i wish all hub+ backers the best of luck…
or "a sexy brick with phoney ports"!
"also, the pictures on our kickstarter are those of the original prototype with usb 2.0." considering your resistance in showing this prototype in an action video, it's pretty clear that this prototype is only "a brick with phoney ports", not a functional one! i'm strongly considering getting out of the campaign.
personally i'm intending on using the hub+ as a portable dock and not use it as my main at home/office hub (i'll use pluggable's if it gets funded - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/plugable/plugable-ultimate-usb-c-universal-docking-station). so port speed isn't as much of an issue for me... now actually getting this product is, i'm quite concerned these guys won't be able to deliver this year and when they do send out units, others, which have better features at a lower price will be available. let's see a prototype before this project ends on ks, otherwise don't be surprised to see a mass exodus of backers in the last 24 hours.
hi guys , can you please comment on throwing in the case as a sign of good faith due to the delay, and in spite of not having reached the $1m pledge number?  please do respond.
funny how every question is being answered by them...........except for the one about the completed prototype. usb2/usb3 isn't as much of an issue when compared to the possibility of this being another vapourware kickstarter. of course i'd much rather have usb3 but that doesn't prevent you from showing us a working usb2 unit, does it? you've got three days left so show me that i should keep my pledge.
@eric weiner: thanks for sharing your concerns. in regards to your first point, we made those decisions based on the feedback we received from our backers early in the campaign. many people expressed they wanted usb 3.0 instead of 2.0. the same thing with the battery as per our survey results in update #10. for your last point, we released the information of the delay as soon as we confirmed all details including how long we expect the delay will be. it took a while to get the details confirmed and we apologize if you feel as if we waited until the last minute. that was not our intention.
i find it very deceptive that nonda has acted like all is on schedule, then waiting until the very last minute to finally admit to a 6 week delay. part of the sell of this device was its almost immediate delivery. now we are looking at mid to late august. some rather questionable decisions don't give me confidence: 1) usb 2.0  2) stretch goal of a bigger battery but the then removal of the smaller battery 3) a 1million stretch goal? what happened to $750k 4) a case that should have been the stretch goal over the bigger battery 5) a delay in admitting there will be a delay by the time this is delivered, i am sure there will be plenty of these docks available. heck, owc has announced one. so has pluggable (and they have a track record).
can we change the 1 million goal for the protective cases to $750,000 since shipping has been delayed??
so no video of the old usb 2.0 prototype in action?
happy to wait to get the best product :) while i want to have it in my hands as soon as possible i know i'm going to be using this for a long time so adding usb 3.0 will be a big boost for me.
thank you for the info. since i know that you will add usb3 am i happy to wait a bit longer as the project had planed... love your hub+ and can't wait to get them !!! great job guys!
@daniel n. me neither. i'm european. shipping is cheaper here but doesn't change the fact, that an apple adapter is just $19. i wouldn't mind spending it for 4 or 5 fruit/milk shakes or large coffees instead but the upgrade to usb 3.0 is worth waiting for ... btw it was really very nice from nonda that they have listened & are willing to upgrade their product for us!
@realdigital not everyone lives in america. our adapters cost $130.
ps. if you can afford a 12" macbook you can also afford an usb-c to usb adapter for $ 19 to use in the meantime & maybe for other future products anyway ...
i prefer waiting for a hub+ with usb 3.0 to having it with usb 2.0 & delivered on time! thank you for that great change!
good morning all! we want to take a moment to address some of the recent questions. the mini adapter will, unfortunately, not be shipped any earlier than the hub+. we made this decision based on the fact that it would be much more efficient to ship everything together. our current timeline shows that the mini adapter and the hub+ have parallel shipment dates. therefore, it would be much more effective to wait. our initial idea conception and original prototype was with usb 2.0. after our backers voiced their preferences and we confirmed that 3.0 was something we can do, we changed the hub+ to support usb 3.0. the delay is based on the fact that we’re redesigning the product after the kickstarter campaign began and figuring out additional technical issues. also, the pictures on our kickstarter are those of the original prototype with usb 2.0.
is it possible to change the delivery location, based on on the extra time needed for testing i might need to have it delivered to a different location.
@ami good points!  still vaporware?
i feel the same as the others about the adapter, it would be nice if those would be able to be sent on time, if possible. it is a bit confusing with your last manufacturing update #12. you mention that "once we finalize the chipsets, we can hit the road running with testing and then production." yet, reading your campaign page i noticed it said, "we have tested our initial batch and are working with a manufacturing partner that we trust and have worked with in the past." would you mind clarifying, as currently it seems to contradict? also, along with others, i am concerned about the lack of actual pictures or videos. according to the campaign chart, the prototype and reliability testing was completed in late april. what prevents any update of pictures or videos of even just the prototype that was made? i hope you are able to bring some clarity to these topics to help those with concerns to understand the actual progress. thanks for your understanding.
+1 for @daniel nguyen , can we get the adapters first?
i was having the same thoughts as matthew, because i think 1 million won't be reached before the end of the campaign and i'd really like to have the protective case sooo please listen to matthew's idea! :)
+1 for matthew!
even though it is ks, it's a real shame that it's now being delayed, especially for early backers. any chance we can at least get the adapters first (early backers)? for me personally, i would like to have at least one usb c to a product to work with my 12 inch macbook now rather than having to result into buying an additional doggle between now and when i actually receive my hub+.
hope you are faster than taobao, when the chinese figured out how to make a usb-c hub the price will only be rmb69 ~us12.......
will the adapters be delayed as well? also to confirm, there is no working demo or prototype unit yet?
@matthew: that's not a half bad idea! @ralph: pledge looks good now! :-)
think it should have workend with the additional 3$. thanks for your help..
due to the now later shipping schedule, which still is yet to announced (but sure not going to be late june), as a show of good faith for early adopters - throw in the proposed "1 million mark" protective case :)
@charles chong chien yuen: yes, it will be possible to purchase after the kickstarter is completely done. the retail price of the hub+ by itself is $99. please take a look at the rewards on our pledge page. it shows what each reward will cost at regular retail price.
so looks like august at the earliest now when they start shipping. bummer.
hi nonda thanks for updating the progress and the honesty ned to use it by july guess the hub wont be arrive on time due to technician problem possible to purchase after that and whats your retail price after all this campaign end?
is it possible to add 1 more usb-c port? now that i think about it, if i'm charging the device and connecting to the macbook, there is no extra usb-c to connect (for the future).
@gavin: i just sent you an inbox message about your inquiry.
i think it would be nice of you guys to ship out the mini usb adapters on time for those of us who ordered them. at least give us something during the delay period.
i have pledged for 10 units. is there any way to add the hdmi adapters too?
@ralph: here is the link for the update we posted on may 19th with the instructions on how to update your pledge: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1233585
and how must i do this (to add +3$)? sorry for the question, but i'm a kickstsarter newbe...
@ralph: because you are an early bird backer, you can just add an additional $3 to your existing pledge and we will make sure to include an hdmi adapter with your hub+ and mini adapter.
how does it work with the hub+ essrly bird and the hdmi adapter for +3$? somehow did i nod get it... do i have to klick something now to get the hdmi as well or will i have to select it when the campage is finish? thanks or a replay how i can get the hdmi with my esrly bird...
@kevin wun:  once we finalize the remaining chip sets, we will update with a video then. thanks for your patience.
@jeffrey: thanks for your comment. well said! in regards to the shipping question that was asked 6 days ago, i unfortunately did not know of the delay until just yesterday when we began to get all the manufacturing information details and the updated timeline. i, too, agree that we could have handled all this better and i truly apologize for that. this is our first kickstarter and we are figuring out many things as we go along. in regards to updating the estimated shipping dates below each pledge, kickstarter actually does not let us edit any rewards or dates associated with the rewards. that is something we wish we could do but cannot. this has truly been a learning experience for us and i appreciate your continued support. we are planning on having more regular updates from now on, as well.
@nonda. thank you for responding to the concerns and for providing the helpful update. i definitely don't want you to cut corners to make dates, but i also feel like we should be kept in the loop to a level that is reasonable. it's hard to believe that a 1.5 month delay, which is longer than the entire length of this campaign so far (1 month), could not have been foreseen 6 days ago when a message to dennis li here indicated that shipping would be on time. i don't really mind the delay that much but it probably could have been handled a little better. i think most people here would be fine with this 1.5 month delay if we had been notified of cumulative delays over the past 1 month openly rather than being told everything was fine. it makes it difficult to know how to interpret new estimates now. i also think that you should update your timeline dates (prototype creation, etc) as well as the estimated shipping dates below each pledge amount, as pledges are still being made now based on substantially inaccurate numbers which is not really fair to them. however, i do appreciate your honesty with this update. i guess, worst case scenario, you could have said nothing about the issues until after the campaign. the fact that you didn't has started to build your credibility in my eyes and is why i may still stick with this.
so it sounds like a "small" delay. considering the chipsets haven't been finalised i doubt they'll get anywhere near their predicted date. the one thing i really want to be confident is seeing a functioning prototype. based on their original schedule the prototyping was supposed to have been completed in april. so can we see a demo of hub+ to restore confidence in your ks?
@alan: unfortunately, kickstarter does not allow the end campaign date to be changed once it is  initially created.
with the delay, is there any chance you can hold the campaign open a bit longer? 6 weeks could turn into 6 months really quickly.
hey everyone! i want to apologize for the delay in the update and thank you all for your patience! please check out the latest update on the progress of the hub+! here is the link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1257312
uhmm, phishy!
will the hub be ready to ship on june 15th?
till now nonda havent give a responce or reply. nonda, kindly update us the progress, we are all concern
+1 marcg. for me plugable's solution is more of a docking station to be kept in one place (eg: your desk already connected to monitor(s) and other peripherals) and hub+ is a portable solution. i do echo others comments about the realistic chance of the hub+ actually coming to life and being on time. these guys have no track history or given sufficient evidence they are ready to ship this month. plugable, on the other hand, has credibility in this field and has more realistic dates.
plugable looks good, but it's not a portable solution. there is a place for both for me. the plugable does multile displays via displaylink technology. their dock is pretty much the same as the current kensington 3500v i use very successfully with my air except the connection is usb c and can deliver power too. at the $99 price point it's cheap comapred with existing usb 3 displaylink docks.
you don't need another account to order extra hubs.  manage your pledge, click on the amount you already pledged, then overwrite it by doubling the amount (only for the hub, not for transportation) and then you'll get your extra hub+. at least, that's how it's described earlier.  (please correct me if i'm wrong @nonda)
@lambros karavis - create another kickstarter account and pledge again.
umm, how does one order a second hub+ ? pledge only seems to allow a single order!
hi nonda would you show us the progress and update anytime soon?
john, from their documentation it shows they actually have a chipset to drive the display, and based on their previous products i believe they'll be able to do what they promise. i'm really hoping hub+ can do what they have promised, but they need to get on here and address everyone's concerns.
hello, does it work with the apple cd external drive?
i'm not sure the macbook is going to be able to drive more than one external monitor based on the documentation. this should not be a hard product to bring to market - usb-c and all the components are standards with no one group owning the tech like you have in thunderbolt tech
hi kevin this is my first time be a backer here worry about the trust issue as well. between barca 1-1 at the moment. lol
charles you won't get charged until after the campaign ends. until that time you can cancel without being charged. i'm going to wait and see what the owners of this project show us so i'm willing to wait until the last moment before pulling out. i want them to succeed but like the hydradock before them i've got serious trust issues, especially in terms of delivery time.
hi all looking at the comment here raised my anxiety regarding the hub + any cancellation fee be charge? should i just go for the apple store usb-c to vga adapter hoping for prompt responce from the creator asap, hope to see the prototype and the update as well
steve, i get what you're saying. for me, the portability of the apple hdmi adaptor should be enough for when travelling. i want the dock when i'm at my desk so form factor isn't so much of an issue. i also like that they have included a power adaptor so i can keep my apple one in my bag and just use the included one at my desk. have any of you looked at voltus? it seems pretty cool providing a good amount of battery life to extend my mb/ipad/iphone. and i like that it can double up as a usb hub too.
i'd like to see the prototype, as well.
kevin you raise a very good point. i believe adding features and raising the stretch goal to make a million dollars without proving any proof of, well, pretty much anything for that matter is completely inappropriate. especially for a product shipping in a couple weeks. regardless, nonda has a lot to work on and for that reason i'm passing on hub+. this is not an appropriate way to conduct business and it's showing here. nearly every recent comment is negative. good luck everybody!!!
meh.  i don't need three simultaneous displays, and the plugable hub looks ugly by comparison to hub+.  i'll probably withdraw from hub+ also if they don't address the concerns that have been raised here, but assuming they do, it's the better unit for me (and i suspect for most folks).
time to back a different horse. i'm switching to the plugable ultimate usb-c hub. don't mind waiting til november as i already have the apple hdmi adaptor. i'm moving because they are a proven manufacturer, allows up to three displays simultaneously and the sheer number of ports. i'll probably withdraw from hub+ at the last moment as i want to see if they can show demo units. right now i just feel like they are saying things like adding features to milk more money from us. i hope hub+ is all it's cracked up to be, there seems to have been a huge marketing push and lots of people have backed them. but something just isn't sitting well with me.
you mentioned in an earlier comment that hub+ will only work with the macbook usb-c port.  is this just a question of what you are testing/certifying with (totally understandable), or is there something about the hardware design of the hub+ that makes you believe it wouldn't work with anything other than a macbook?
agree with last comments! even though i have a tolerance for delays (it's ks after all), the production and delivery impacts of the sudden quite major changes in design should be better explained.
ditto all the backers on seeing progress at the moment as well!
hi nonda agree with all the backers right there. will you be able to make it shipped on time? some might needed to use the hub + soon/urgent/daily use.we dont want to see the delay situation till next year only able to receive it. no bad meaning, just to voice out what backer is concerning right now.
thanks for everyone finally commenting on this...i posted weeks ago and my comment was very rudely brushed aside by the nonda team. i was concerned with both a demo of the product and with manufacturing. what did i get? a snapshot of a plane to china. a totally joke. in the meantime they update stretch goals and rewards and significant redesigns of the product all together. i was more than excited when this product emerged. my new macbook needs ports, there's no question and i had a huge smile on my face when i found hub+, but after weeks of waiting for legitimate updates, i'm finding the chicken costume gimmick to be a technique to delay delivery of a product that's not ready. this whole project is becoming more and more shady. thanks you nonda,  for not addressing the half dozen or so vocal complaints that people have given in the past. they are all compiling now
+1 for jeffrey
more like a working demo unit before releasing to manufacturing rather than prototype...
as a project backer, i'd also like to see a working prototype of hub+...thanks!
i agree with jeffrey zuccato.
i agree with jeffrey zuccato. it's very important to give us that feedback before the end of kickstater period.  i already be victim of a undeliverable product and idea, and i don't have plans to be mistaken again. thanks
you has mentioned a few weeks ago that you would show proof of a working product before the end of the kickstarter period. with 11 days left now, i was wondering if there were still plans to do this and, if so, when. i think it is especially important given how many units you have now sold with an estimated delivery date of july. adding them up, it comes close to 10,000 units within 2 months which is concerning since we have no knowledge any any units being produced yet. as backers, i think we should be given much more information about the production status including how many units you have produced so far, how many can be produced per day, and any issues that might be holding you back from production. thanks for your help.
nonda one million target reach all get free leather case right? lets pray for that. lol
@leanne: no plans for releasing and additional adapters. yes, any third party usb to ethernet adapter should work fine the the hub+.
hi, really looking forward to receiving this. are there any plans in place for an ethernet adaptor, or would any third-party usb to ethernet adaptor work with your usb ports?
@simon: sorry for the misunderstanding. yes, if it is connected to your computer, it will work as any other hub will.  all the ports can communicate with each other.
thanks for the response. i think you misunderstood though? i meant if the hub+ is plugged into the macbook first...can i then use the hub+ to plug in an sd card into the reader and also hook up a usb external drive and transfer photos from sd to the drive? can the hub+ facilitate this? basically can two storage devices be plugged in whilst the hub is hooked up to the macbook and transfer data to each other? thanks.
@simon: unfortunately, no. the hub+ needs to be connected to a computer to do any file transfers.
hi, will the hub+ allow me to insert an sd card in the reader, then hook up an external usb 2.0/3.0 hard drive and copy photos from the sd card directly onto the hard drive for back up?
@michael: you will receive a final survey once the campaign is done and you can make your selections then.
when do we choose our colour? and the battery/no battery-options?
i don't suppose you guys are considering dropping the stretch goal to $750k..?  getting to a million seems like a really far reach for just 12 days :/
i think this is a major cool hub. i’m really going to enjoy my macbook and this will make it near perfect as with the hub+ and it’s 7 strategic ports, an additional usb and hdmi adapter, i believe i will be set for any thing i need to get in or out of my mac. this was a really good product development process you accomplished...and, i can get it in space gray to match my mac!   cool…
i've just ordered my 12" macbook. now the race has started, which will i get first?! 4-6 week lead time from apple if i'm lucky...
hi, pls do consider making adapters in the future for vga and ethernet.  then the pdt will be perfect :d
hi guys, do you have a visual/render for the two different hub+ versions now available for backers to support? i'd like to see exactly where that 4mm is, as descriptions have varied as to width or thickness. any chance of a picture? thanks in advance!
i still not understand why original version with small battery have to disappear. i doubt there was problem of battery heat which needs additional space between pcb board and the battery even in original version . if so, nonda's decision was right. but i believe backers prefer more honest explanation. anyway, to make decision from 2 version, i need more information. at least comparison detail photos.
@dennis never, ever count on a ks reward to give as a specific gift, to realize a project, to plan a trip, etc. having something that vaguely respect the estimated delivery date on ks is nearly a miracle, except in this case where ks is mainly used as a promotion platform for hub+.
@dennis: 1st batch shipments are estimated to start late june. 2nd batch shipments are estimated to start shipping in early july. we cannot guarantee that you will receive it before end of june. sorry about that.
hi, as i will be going on a long trip with my new macbook early july, it would be most ideal if i have the nonda hub before i set off. so i am wondering when will the hubs be shipped out, and would they be expected to arrive hk before end of june?
it's nice to hear the free case campain for goal at $1m. though only 13 days left, let's keep fingers crossed! cheer up for nonda!
@weetom: yes, it will be the same price. we will send you a final survey when the campaign is over and you can choose your preference there. @kristopher k: please inbox message us so we can help you out! @simon: sorry to hear about your bad experience with a previous kickstarter. thanks for your support on our campaign. we truly appreciate it. @nina k: thanks for voicing your opinion. we made the decision based on the feedback received from our backers since the beginning of the campaign. i apologize if this is an inconvenience for you.
i agree with all of the comments about the original offer with a smaller battery.  i don't understand why the choice now is between "no" battery and original size or "bigger" battery and larger size.  why isn't the choice between smaller battery/original size and bigger battery/larger size?  what's the benefit to backers who wanted the smaller size to having no batter included?
i'nm really hoping this works out okay. i was seriously stung on my first kickstarter backing - agent watch by chris walker of secret labs llc. he has been a nightmare to deal with and refuses to communicate in any open or honest way. two years later and a million bucks down the project has even disappeared from ks search. this project looks fantastic and i cannot wait to receive the "reward".
how to choose colour?
i need to talk with someone from customer service.
i would like to choose the hub+ without battery. is it the same price? and i just wait till you send email right?
@charles chong chien yuen: sorry for the inconvenience! @mark: thanks!
very nice product. can't wait to see it with the battery option.
hi nonda i am interested in your product but i mainly need to connect my macbook to vga projector for presentation.i have one thunderbolt to vga adapter, thought can use ln the mini display port but you said no.
@david kaun: sorry, hub+ is designed specifically for the usb-c port of new macbook 12". @charles chong chien yuen: no plans for any other adapters. also, the mini dp and the thunderbolt are not the same for the external adapter. our hub+ does not support thunderbolt displays. please make sure to read the faq at the bottom of the main campaign tab. it has many answers to frequently asked questions. thanks for the support! @daniel nguyen: unfortunately, no. sorry. @splintermgs: terribly sorry. we do not have plans to sell the hdmi separately. however, it is possible that someone cancels their pledge and you can take their spot. you would have to keep checking back, though to see if there is a spot open. you might get lucky! you never know!
since the $93 pledge is all gone, will it be possible to get the hdmi adapter separately when available?
adding built in storage is a great idea!!!
is the mini display port and thunderbolt the same for the external adapter?
is there any sort of indicators on the device or even shown on the computer that displays what percentage the battery is charged or how much battery you have left?  thank you! :)
hi nondo it will be great if you do provide adapter for mini display port to vga as well. any plan for that ?
hey nondo, just wondering if this product will work with other computers outside of apple? thanks
if feasible. what about a stretch goal to add built in storage?
@steve: we are still anticipating 1st batch shipments starting in late june. the hdmi adapter will just be added to your package. if there should be any delay, we will definitely let everyone know.
as an early bird backer adding $3 for the hdmi adapter will not delay my hub+ being mailed to me in june correct?
@charles: no it is not. we also have many faq (frequently asked questions) at the very bottom of the main campaign tab. again, thanks for your support.
sorry nonda final question is the display port is apple macbook product thunderbolt?
@charles chong chien yuen: yes, same price for both battery and non battery version. 1st batch shipment is estimated for late june and second batch shipment is estimated for early july. thanks for the support!
@alex martin: sorry we missed your question. here are the specs for the sd card reader:  * secure digital v1.0/ v1.1/ v2.0/ sdhc/ sdxc (capacity up to 2tb) * 5 gbps superspeed, 480 mbps high-speed, and 12 mbps full-speed transfer rates
oh ya and i need to use it by august and location at malaysia will it be delivered that time?
hi thanks for the reply option for battery pack or without will be the same price?
@nonda : not sure you saw my question so i ask again, what are the maximum read and write speed of the sdxc card reader?
are there any tiny sd cards that you can recommend for the hub? i'd be interested to get something like the nifty drive, this might sit flush with the body of the hub plus. ports, power, and memory! :)
@taha: primary advantage of the battery-less version is that it is a bit lighter and smaller. it is based on personal preference and necessity.
thanks for the clarification on the size differences nonda. what would you say is the primary advantage of getting the battery-less version, if not the smaller size?
@daniel nguyen: the battery is charged through the usb-c power cable that needs to be connected to an outlet. yes, you will be getting both adapters and the hub+ with your pledge of $97. @charles chong chien yuen: yes, once the campaign is over, you will be charged the amount pledged, in your case $96. once the campaign is over, you will receive a final survey asking you to note all your preferences, such as color and with or without battery. @joseph: sorry, hub+ can't be used as a usb-a hub. it is designed specifically for the usb-c port of new macbook 12". @kidd: we anticipate that it should not be a problem.
also, forgot to add, i'm an early bird backer and i've pledged $97. am i now getting one usb-a adapter and one hdmi adapter as well? just to be certain because the email i received only mentions that i will receive only one  adapter (the original offer). i hope that made sense!
am i right to assume that you charge the battery via usb? if not, how? also, is there any sort of indicators on the device or even shown on the computer that displays what percentage is charged or how much battery you have left?  thank you! :)
hi can the cables be black instead of white? at least it matches the keyboard
hi i have just place the pledge on hub only cost 96 usd included shipping on the 16 jun the credit will only deducted from my credit card right? and what about the colour option? will prefer for the gold colour hub aince my macbook is gold in colour. does the hub contain battery for charging as well?
hello, i'm wondering what's the maximum read and write speed of the sdxc card reader? did you perform some test? thanks.
@joseph i think the creator had explained your question before in the earlier comment. the only way to use the hub+ as a hub is to connect to the usb-c port. hope this help you to understand.
if you have a usb-c to usb-a cable, could you theoretically use this as a hub for a macbook air/pro (by plugging it into one of its usb 3.0 ports)?
i want to know if the mac os upgrade in future, will the new os support hub+? coz i got a lightning cable (unofficial but famous brand) which cant recognize anymore after i was upgraded my iphone5s os. please advise, thanks.
dear backers, a lot of you have had questions about the $500k stretch goal and we wanted to take a moment to clarify. we understand your request for sleekness and we believe that the additional width will still keep the hub+ very sleek. so, just to put things in perspective, a 4 mm (0.16 inch) difference in width is less than that of 4 credit cards pinched together. the difference is mostly imperceivable. the difference in weight between the two versions (with and without battery) is similarly very small - about 43 g (1.5 oz). we believe that having two versions to choose from will give our backers more flexibility. also, in regards to the battery, a little bit of additional space can help provide protective padding between the pcb board and the battery. please note we’re focused on delivering a beautiful and well-made product to our backers and so you can be assured that those qualities are not things we’ll compromise on.
@cun-kai liao: yes, you are correct. for one hub+ and shipping it is $108. for 2 hub+ and shipping it is $201. you will have the option to choose two different colors as well.
i want to pledge 2 usb+ with hdmi adaptor, can i chose the different color (1 silver and 1 grey)? and i just add $93 myself to pledge amount  if i buy only 1, include shipping, need $108, and i just need to set pledge amount to $201 for 2 hub+ ,right?
hooray! make it dubble!!  way to go, nonda team!
@will: yes, it does.
does the hub+ come with a short usb-c cord to connect it to the macbook?
@benson: sorry we misinterpreted your question. unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to test every display or computer on the market with the hub+. if you are interested in what displays and resolutions we have tested, here is a link to that update. https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1229691
hi. i posted a comment earlier, but it was misinterpreted. my question is have you tested the hub+ on a chromebook pixel 2015, which is a laptop computer with usb type-c ports made by google.
i completely disagree with everyone on "hdmi" replacing displayport... if you have a modern screen hdmi 1.4 isn't going to cut it. maybe when 2.0 4k @ 60hz becomes a little more common, but we're not there yet. displayport is more versatile and a better choice for an advanced user.
@stefano: the mini display port supports both audio and video. the hdmi adapter can only be connected through the hub+ since the macbook only has one usb-c port. make sure to check the faq at the bottom of the campaign tab and the update tab for all relevant information. thanks for the support.
@nonda hi, does hub+ mini displayport 1.2 support also audio out or it just supports video out? for example, can i plug the hdmi adapter to hub+ mdp and have a full resolution audio and video out or for this feature i have to plug the hdmi adapter directly to the macbook? thank you!
please keep to the original version with battery,
i really think hdmi is more popular than mdp and should be made default instead of an add-on option.
i would also prefer the original version (9mm with battery).
@mitul, the hub+ cannot charge your macbook on the go. however, it will charge your macbook if you plug your macbook's power cord into the hub+ while the hub+ is connected to your laptop.   @taha, yes you can charge your phones via the usb-a to usb-c adapter. you can also charge your phones with the non-battery hub+ version when the hub+ is only connected to the macbook.
can the hub + charge the macbook without additional wires? i know it can charge iphone for 2 hours of talk time, which is not that much.
wouldn't it be possible to keep the original version (9mm with battery). thanks
also, this may be a long shot, but what if the usb a ports won't charge phones/tablets, what if we use the usb c -to- usb a adapter with the usb c port on the hub; will that charge? presumably that's connected directly to the macbook's power...?
hi, will the hub+ without the battery be able to charge iphones/ipads when connected only to the macbook (and not external power)?
awesome. really looking forward to this. the highest if fives from norway!
hi, over the ten items, i just add 10$ for international  shipping ? i was paid 15$ for ten.
i also agree with lin chang hua. 4mm is too bad impact for design in exchange for larger battery.... i believe original version would be the best. anyway, thank you for the nice product :)
ditto, orignal version as offered with 400mah was the one i was interested in. i feel the extra 4mm are not worth for my needs. thanks for all your efforts in making this successful! :)
+1 with lin chang hua. i think what people wanted is lighter or smaller battery-less version than the original. it is not a large version of the capacity up.
i totally agree with lin chang hua…. would love the smaller form factor as a backup battery. but larger size, with more power, is not interesting for my needs and smaller but no battery also is not practical. wish you could make your original vision!
the fact so many people see a need for this should be a red flag to apple and how they dropped the ball on ports. i hate how they force this "less is more" when it's not for a laptop. sad:(...
this comment has been removed by kickstarter.
would the battery power an ipad. 12w @ 2.1amps at all ? if so for how long?
i love the ability to charge the phone, but i don't want to increase the width of the unit. if the 500k stretch goal is met, can we still have the option to have the thin version (9mm) with limited battery capacity. since it is not going to be a regular power bank, we will need it as an temporary backup solution. 400 mah is good enough to run any phone up to 2 hours.
@yuan-ming, if you would like to get two orders of the $93 backer deal, you would pledge a total of $201, which is ($93 x 2) + $15 (international shipping). @philip to order more, you just multiply the reward amount by the number of orders you want to get and add on the flat rate shipping fee.
how can i order more than one?
excuse me, i want to back 93*2  and shipping together. but no option for back 2 items with together shipping. what should i do? thanks.
@jay we think of it as giving people options based on what people said they preferred via the survey. the battery version of the hub+ at the $500k mark will be even better with double the battery capacity and double the battery life for your phone. for those who don't care about the battery, they can choose to get one without the battery as per their preference. thanks.
so, just to be clear- if the 500k stretch goal is met, the original product you advertised will not be produced?
thanks
@ofir, from the specification of nifty drive. i think it will work with hub+, but it will leave some portion outside the sd card reader. -steve
@teoh tiong hong.  for a hub, it needs an input port and several output ports. for hub+, the input port is the usb-c, output ports are "display port, sd card, usb-a". after the role of each port finalized, a chipset will be programed to control how to convert signal from input port to those output ports. once the program done, the hub will only work as programmed. -steve.
i will also love to know if the nifty drive will work with the hub+ thanks
i'm really excited about this hub for travel when i must connect to multiple devices away from home. this is precisely why i am very excited about the hub+ without a battery: 1) it will be lighter (if you add the weight of a hub+ with a battery, you might as well ditch the macbook and get an 11 inch macbook air with native ports for the about the same weight and much less cost) and 2) batteries die. i have macs that are still in use at my house that are over 8 years old and going strong. when that battery gets old it will go from asset to dead weight.
hi, i don't understand why the hub won't work with older usb 3.0 a ports found on current gen macbook pro/air ? since it should be compatible with the usb 3.0 standard, if plugged into a usb 3.0 a port only the usb-c charging function should not work.
perfect :-) looking forward to the videos
@sms, we don't consider they are two completely different products, since there is no technical difficulty for the battery function at all. -steve
@realdigital, i don't it its our hub perfectly. to save space, hub+ features a short version card reader.
@tom, it is impossible to make usb-c transfer data and at the same time support so many ports. that's why apple's multi-port only support charging too. -steve
so you still believe you'll deliver on time? considering now producing two completely new products it seems impossible to do
would a nifty minidrive fit perfectly* in your sdxc card reader? www.theniftyminidrive.com *they offer different ones for retina, air etc.
hi, any plans to make the usb-c transfer data? i think this would be good to future proof the device a little more. tom
if i get it right, the new stretch goal leaves a choice between a 9mm-non-battery hub or a 13mm-800mah hub? so no more slim hub with small battery? kind of disappointing!
@treton, please note those versions will be created if we reach our stretch goal.
@ray it would be the current version with 400 mah battery.
i'd like to know the weight difference between the battery and non battery versions.
if you can't reach the 500k goal, which version of hub+ will you provide?
@alex martin, yes we're planning for it.
hello again! i think everyone would love to see a video of a working prototype before the end of the campaign, have you planned that?
@stevenlau: thanks for the feedback!
@nonda since that a lot of the backers are requesting for different types of adapters. any plan to make it happen? adapters in manufacturing now: (1) mini adapter   - usb-a 3.0 to usb-c adapter (2) hdmi adapter - mini displayport to hdmi adapter. adapter in request: (a) ethernet adapter - usb-a 3.0 to ethernet port (rj45) adapter. (b) thunderbolt adapter - usb-a 3.0 / mini displayport to thunderbolt adapter.
cant wait :)
@alvin since you're an early bird backer, you don't need to select a different reward. there's no selection to choose from. just add $3 to your pledge total. on our end, we can see from your pledge total that you want one hdmi adapter. thanks.
hi nonda, thanks for bring hdmi adapter at $3 for early bird backer. i faced a bit of issue trying to select the hub + backer deal reward tier.  after log in, i could not found this selection. please advise thanks
hi everyone, we just released update #9. please see that for an update on manufacturing. thanks.
thanks for all the updates - very excited to get mine as i was an early purchaser of the hub+ .  do you have an estimated ship date for your product?  and will it be shipping from the us or somewhere else in the world?  thanks for the hard work you are doing.
thanks for the response.  however, i wanted to know if i plugged in 3 devices in the usb-a ports to charge and also connected to the macbook, whats the maximum output power the hub can handle (not using the internal battery of the hub+)?
another suggestion: could you post a video of the hub+ in action, so that we could all see it's really working? there are legitimate concerns regarding another dock project for the macbook on kickstarter, where the creator where unable to demonstrate a working unit to the backers. thanks and keep up the good work!
@stevenx2: thanks for your feedback.
@powerex: when charging off the internal battery the power output is .5a. when the unit is plugged into a power source, it can output the full bc 1.2 standard spec power.
@keifer urbin: i understand your concerns and i can hear the frustration in your words.  i apologize that we have not done a update which meets your needs and time frame. i can assure you that we have been working extremely hard and fast in order to make this project a success and keep up with the timeline we promised. we will try to have an update that meets your needs soon. i want to thank you for really bringing this issue to our attention again. it shows that you are extremely concerned and invested in the entire campaign. we need more backers like you who voice their true concerns. thank you.
it's probably too late i know, but it would've been nice to kick the integrated battery and have built in hdmi und lan ports. no point in the battery for a minimal charge, you can charge your phone in all vehicles and a lot of stores/coffee houses and have got charging stations already.  why would you want to take the whole hub with for a minimal charge... i'll only be using the hub for my macbook and when i connect my iphone to it, i'll be able to charge it as well. the small charge in the hub won't really make much of a difference. besides that, i am looking forward to the adapter.
yes nick - i wrote it as a new 350k stretch goal but got no response - my concerns with all this adapters that they will get lost.
how about design a cool container to hold the item and accessories?
+1 for keifer . exactly my concern + the 9 3000$ pledges that were 'reserved' by nonda
that was a thumbs up
just a ��� to what urbin said
3 usb-a charging ports + usb-c macbook power, what is the total max power the hub can handle?  whats the limitation on the output of the individual usb-a ports and also on the usb-c port?  thanks!
it's really upsetting that 3 backers excited about this product recently voiced concern about the timeline of the product development and delivery only to receive a copy and paste "pass it along to the team" response. all the doctored photos and photoshopped images are not enough for a product that's a few weeks out. you also switched out your chipset to handle usb 3.0 and that had no effect on manufacturing or delivery? where are you guys in terms of manufacturing? the lack of concern here is shocking. but ofcourse this email will be lost in the midst of "i want a gold one!" comments. i would like this addressed here, no via private mail. i know the people that aren't back this are thinking the same thing.
here is the link with the update and the instructions on how to pledge for your hdmi adapter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1233585
just a reminder to all early bird backers: do not change tiers from early bird to hub+ backer deal for the hdmi adapter. simply increase your total amount by adding $3 to your current pledge. this will ensure that you will still be an early bird backer, your hdmi is only for an additional $3 and you will still be part of first batch shipping. if you change tiers, you will be part of 2nd batch shipping and will lose your early bird status! if you have any issues with your pledge, please inbox message us before changing anything!
@dustin: great! let us know if you have any questions.
nevermind! figured it out.
i've seen a million comments on it but still haven't found what i'm looking for. how do i add an addition $3 to my existing pledge? i don't see the option.
@henk van der stelt: i am going to send you an inbox message to address your concern.
i was early backer but unfortunately made a mistake in adding 3$ for the hdmi in response to the mail of nonda regarding the hdmi possibility. really a pity that this cannot be repaired. i would have thought that early backers who help start up a great idea into a viable business will  not be rewarded by bureaucracy answers that this cannot be solved in an elegant way. kind regards henk
@alwin: no plans for a 1g lan adapter at the moment, but as usual we will keep everyone up to date about any changes. thanks for all your support! @celia: that is correct! you will be getting two hdmi adapters at the $100 pledge. no need to change anything. thanks for your support @alex martin: great suggestion. i'll pass your message along to the team. thanks for backing us!
hello, i just backed your project since you found a way to add usb 3.0 support. however i'm wondering if you could provide a speedtest with a faster device than a usb 3.0 flashdrive ? those are quite slow and can't expose the limitation of the chipset, a test with a ssd in an usb 3.0 enclosure would be a better test. thanks for considering this!
i'm sorry to make you answer this frequently asked question again but at least my case is a bit different :) so actually, i'm an early bird backer, for 79$, shipping was 15$ so i was at 94$ and i rounded it up immediately back then to 100$. does that mean that i'll get 2 hdmi adapters without me needing to change anything in my pledge now?
added $3 for the hdmi although i really don't know why i needed it tho.  =d anyways, how about add a 1g lan adapter? any plan for this?
@hansi, i'm sending you a private message to help you sort it out :)
@jacqueline bannink congrats on your new macbook's arrival. we love using our gold ones at the office :)! so glad that you like the product and our efforts to make our backers happy. cheers!
just pledged $3,-.  already got my lovely little 12" golden macbook. knowing from early bird that this project definitely would be a knockout, i bought my macbook without any of apple's own additional solutions, so i really can't wait ;). keep us updated, and keep reacting in you're backers, you're doing great work so far, like it!
i want to add $3,00 for hdmi-adapter, but now my pledge is complete changed.
@qiyun: love it! you're the best!
just add 6$ for two, foreve early bird. thank your!
@ofir: you need to make sure to calculate your shipping fee.  you should pledge: $79 hub+ and mini adapter + $3.00 for hdmi adapter + $15 international shipping or $5 in us.
by the way - new stretch goal for 350k - you will make a nice case to keep the hub+ and all the extra adapters ....what do you say?
@chris: it seems that is what happened. as an early bird backer, all you had to do was add the additional $3 to your original pledge. you might be able to catch the slot open if you are quick. otherwise, 2nd batch shipment is planned for early july.
i don't understand how to add 3$ . if i'm going to my pledge (79$) and want to make it 82$ the system saying that i need a min of 94$.
seems i may have gotten confused ... i was early bird and selected the $98 option ... i can care less for the difference of $3 vs this one, however saw something about 2nd batch.  don't want to fall in line if that is what i did?!?!
@henry leung, we have upgraded all our usb-a ports to usb 3.0, so it's been already done :). about the thunderbolt adapter, as of yet we don't have plans to make that adapter since usb-c currently doesn't support thunderbolt. here's an article about it too: http://www.macworld.com/article/2894423/thunderbolted-usb-c-is-our-new-connection-overlord-get-used-to-it.html
@kevin wu, we love your enthusiasm! cheers!
@gareth, we love your line "am i crazy to be backing this, when i don't own a single usb-c device?". that is true faith there. thank you.
@stevenlau, thanks so much for the warm feedback and for your sense of humor. although we can't satisfy everyone's different requests, we're happy that we could make the hdmi adapter happen :).
will be best if there is a thunderbolt to usb-c adaptor/cable or usb 2.0/3.0 hub+ version, for those old mac air owners.
i have added $3.00 to the total amount of pledge. good work on the hdmi adapter!! as the demand of various adapters is so high, maybe nonda should consider to sell accessories to all backers in the future. i'm looking forward to a version 2.0 hub+, although i don't even own a new macbook now.  :)
@adrian: as long as you added another $3.00 to your pledge, you are fine.
@takaya: just add $3.00 to your pledge amount. @ sherif: as early bird, you are already getting the hub+ and the mini adapter (usb-a to usb-c). if you want the hdmi adapter, add $3.00 to your pledge.
@takaya ito read update 8 for instructions
can we add additional money to the early bird pledge to get both the usb-a and hdmi adapters? i would love to get both!
@creator i am an early bird. would you let me know how to add $3 for the hdmi adapter.
hi, i've added $3 on top of the early bird pledge+shipping. please help check whether that is correct?
am i crazy to be backing this, when i don't own a single usb-c device? i just figure i'd need this if i ever were to.
now that you offer a hdmi adapter, how about an usb to gigabit ethernet adapter since there is a month left in the campaign?
i've +$3'd my order, this just gets better and better!
seeing more early bird backer slots open up. i do hope people are not confused with this hdmi adapter add on. i read at the bottom of the post. 'if you are an early bird adopter just add $3' for the new hdmi adaptor. so i did. i didn't choose a new pledge level, as early bird backers don't need to. yet more spaces appearing... *shrugs*
so cool project.but...i need rj45 connector.
@creator awesome! done, pledge amended! thank you!
@edwin: yes, that is correct!
hi @creator, i'm an early bird backer and i have doubled pledge amount to receive 2 hubs. do i now add $6 to receive 2 hdmi adapters?
@sms: yes, the cables are interchangeable. as far as the daisy chain of the hub+ is concerned, unfortunately, that is not possible with our product.  we even tested the apple dongle with the usb-c connection, and that also did not work. i apologize for the inconvenience.
if it's standard usb-c i shout be able to interchange the long apple cable and your short cable right? and because of the usb-c standard why can't i daisy chain them?
@ryan: we will release the survey results within the next week. thanks for your interest!
hey, what were the results of the survey for the battery?  400ma is tiny, as even my smallest portable battery is 3200ma and i can't see any benefit from a battery so small.
@steven: unfortunately, no. they cannot be chained together for more ports or battery power. sorry for the inconvenience.
can these be chained together for more ports or battery power?
thank you all for the support and i also hear your concerns.  we thank you for your patience while we finalize the product. we very much appreciate all the feedback! @ofir, no known issues at the moment, which is good! we are very happy about that.  @julia, thanks for the suggestion!
just looked at a lot of great kickstarter projects that had great potential but didn't deliver on time and i'm talking about 6 month to a year late. i was wondering if it will be the case with the hub+? is there any known issues already ? i see that you planing to ship next month to us and you even had a real product show up just renders photos. i really hope you will make it on time.
any thoughts on making a mini-adapter that has two usb-c ports to allow the computer to charge while connected to a usb device? i have pledged for the hub+ w/bonus mini-adapter, but really only need one usb port + charging capability at any given time.
an ethernet port would be nice.
if the hub can be made smaller, lighter and thinner without the battery, i suggest having an option without the battery for those of us who already have an external battery charger for our phones.
@w l eric ng: clever idea!
next stretch goal: perhaps a silicone bumper to protect this lovely hub and can also act as a dust cover for all the ports ?
another stretch goal is needed.
@jeffrey then: the weight of the hub+ with the battery is approximately 3.5 ounces. thank for all your support!
@lee-anne stewart: thank for the support! after the campaign is finished, kickstarter will send a final survey link to you. then, you can choose the color you want. yes, you have your choice between the three colors for your mini adapter as well.
@max tsai: thanks for your feedback and suggestions. i will pass your message along to the team.
@peter wonson: unfortunately, the hub+ will not be able to support thunderbolt display. sorry for the inconvenience.
@offir arbel: no other stretch goals at the moment, but as always, if something should change, we will keep everyone up to date.
@gerhard habinger: thanks! well said!
space grey！
i want gold one!!
space grey for me! ship to karachi, pakistan.
hi nonda, i'm the one that created the hub+ thread at macrumors :)  with the battery inside the hub, how heavy is the overall weight?
just backed this project after the nice folks on the macrumors forum led me here! send me a nice gold hub+ to scotland please! ps will the mini adapter come in 3 colours to match the hub+ and rmb?
just wanna be realistic to support this project. in the following weeks, you guys will have to finish the prototype testing and march into mass production and ship to all the backers. it would be most appreciated to share all of us the progress on a weekly basis, otherwise, i am afraid of this would become another bubble.;5

any chance you will be able to support the apple thunderbolt display before you launch?
is there any new stretch goal ?
thank you so much for creating a design that fits perfectly to the new macbook, especially by using the same high-quality material aluminium instead of imitating apple's consequent design with a plastics lookalike. you did a consistently good job. most accessory designers (would) have tried to save money with low-cost material in that important issue. for me it was the final reason to go with your beautyful hub instead of moving to one of the other alternatives. you clearly got it.
great invention. looking forward to get one soon. space grey is the right hub+. :-)
gold (for my wife) :-) thanks!!!
@keifer: great suggestion! i'll pass the message along to the team. we really appreciate your feedback. :-)
i'm totally psyched on getting this product but i'm really concerned with your lack of real use photos or video. i see a lot of fancy shots rendered carefully on a computer but no shots of this thing actually working on a monitor or actually showing the laptop recognizing a usb device plugged into this thing. i realize on kickstarter you're not supposed to have all of the details worked out completely at launch but with your delivery date only weeks away, you would think that it would be very easy to make some product demonstration videos. could you post a monitor test videos at least?
space grey for me, thanks.
@kyle, awesome :)
space gray!
@alessio bettini and @ravindrasinh chavda,  thank you for sharing your excitement for your preferred color. space gray is great! you can note down your preference on that final survey we'll send when the campaign ends :).
@czars, we're glad to hear that you like the hub+. unfortunately this hub is only designed for the new retina macbook.
hi, is this able to connect mac book pro 13"? is cable type-c to type-a a problem to to use it on mac book pro? its great to know you create this wonderful device! hope it can support not only new macbook. thx
space grey for me
spiace gray for me
space grey for me…….!!!
@stephen: thanks for the support! and great suggestion! :)
go team nonda! love your work & can't wait till my hub+ is delivered in june ��. just want to say thanks for adjusting design to include usb 3. per an earlier comment it would be great to take a priority ticket for version2 (hub+ will be such a success) with some more features. hdmi, more usb-c ports etc. cheers stephen������
@jaron: yes!
is the mini adaptor will have the 3 colors selection as well?
@heo seon young and @jacqueline, gold is a lovely choice :)
@edwin you're welcome. we are happy that we could make it happen for you and everyone. space gray noted. you can note down your preference on that final survey we'll send when the campaign ends :).
@nova we love you too. thank you for backing us!
i love you guys :ddd the usb3.0 finally come wwwwww and my gold hub+ :yay
thanks for listening to your backers @creator! usb 3.0 is really good news! and not forgetting color selection! space grey for me! thanks!
want gold colcor ^^
oooow yeah!! gold it will be!! happy and exited.
thanks to everyone for the suggestions and for the support!
space grey is on! :d
great news and this effort will reach its stretch goal!  space gray hub come to papa!!!!!
very exciting news - makes this a long time keeper. i do have one suggestion though: why not put a type c on the bottom so this device can sit between the charger and macbook? that way the cords are a straight shot instead of being at a 90 degree angle when charging and using this device.
great news on usb 3.0!  another few dollars and its colors for all!  thanks
thanks for the update guys, usb 3.0 ! woooooo !
@benson: unfortunately, we do not have the capability to test every monitor. we will keep everyone up to date as information comes in.
just wanted to mention that i would probably use the internal battery, as i often am not near power and could use the little pick me up charge on the go. i do agree with the other comments about usb 3 though.
just a little over $5k to go... space grey, come to me! :d
quick question to nonda : you've done testing on the new macbook, but i'm curious if you've checked the results of your display testing on the new chromebook pixel 2015?
instead of battery. i would like to have all in one. 3 usb-c ports  1 sdx  1 mini displayport (mdp 1.2 video output, 4k displays at 60hz refresh rate) 3 usb-a \ charging ports  1 ethernet port placed on top the surface. instead of at the side. 1 hdmi
thanks to everyone for all the feedback and support on the hub+. we have an update about which monitors are supported by the hub+ and the new macbook! test result with apple monitor: apple led cinema display 27" with mini display port - passed test results with 4k monitor: 2540x1440 @ 60 hz - passed  3840x2160 @ 27 hz - passed  3840x2160 @ 30 hz - passed  3840x2160 @ 34 hz - passed for the full report, please follow this link: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nonda/get-your-macbook-ports-back/posts/1229691
since everyone is volunteering suggestions, i'll toss in mine. is there a significant cost associated with the change from passing a usb 2 versus a usb 3 signal? usb 3 data speed is an expected feature in any hub in 2015. once past kickstarter and competition appears, you are not going to appear competitive. adding a third usb-c port would be very useful as these devices become more common. where you can usefully and economically add extra ports without increasing the perimeter...not sure. it appears that you might have several products on your plate. one with ethernet, one with hdmi, etc. i have no need for the battery.
@timothy: the mini display port on the hub+ does not support a thunderbolt connection.  to get an ethernet port, you can use a usb-a to ethernet adapter.
on the display port can i use thunderbolt to ethernet port?
@nova: thanks for your comment! i think it is a great suggestion. i'll pass the information over to the team and we will definitely keep everyone updated on any changes!
for your reference, something like this: http://aka.re/3vx and have 4k support and using metal design. i think it will be just amazing
dear nonda, i know it will be really hard to add a hdmi port in the current design, but is it possible to release a super tiny mdp to hdmi adopter just like your usb-c to usb-a mini adopter?, it will be still great if you can do that <3 (same as the ethernet port, is it possible to build a mini usb to ethernet port?) the only think i really want is usb3.0, which is the only port that cannot get upgrade instead of buying a new one.
@thierry: great questions! here are the answers: 1) it is a mini display port. 2) the hub+ does not support thunderbolt displays.  for ethernet, you can use a usb-a to ethernet adapter. 3) we appreciate your suggestion and look forward to considering including an hdmi port in any future updates of the hub+.  we will definitely keep everyone up to date on any changes to the hub+.
to add to the other comments i am unlikely to use the battery. my primary use for this would be as "docking station" where it will sit on my desk permanently connected to power and whatever peripherals i need. over the long term i would be concerned about the battery failing and causing other problems. from my perspective ethernet is the only other port that i would be interested in. hdmi doesn't really gain me anything.
hi, i've just backed the project, going with the hub + adapter, hoping to get the space grey one once you guys hit the $250k mark - no doubt you will! just a couple of questions: 1. can you please confirm what the display port is? mini display or thunderbolt? 2. would i be able to plug a thunderbolt to ethernet adapter on it? 3. any chance you could include a hdmi port to the hub, instead of a usb 2.0 port? i am hoping it would be a thunderbolt port, as it is the most recent norm and would allow to plug several types of adapters to it (so the hub doesn't have to include them all itself). cheers!
loving all the feedback! keep it coming everyone!
+1000 !!!
one concern i have is that this design isn't really future proofing our uses. take the two usb-c ports. one obviously is lost because it needs to be connected to the macbook. the second one can only be used to provide power. but we have 3 usb-2.0 ports while the world is definitely moving to usb-c. so i feel you should add a 3rd usb-c port that acts as a through port so we can add usb-c hard-disks, pen drives or whatever comes down the road, while still being able to connect an external monitor. that would be far more useful for a hub of this nature than 3 usb 2.0 ports or even an internal battery, or even hdmi... those are all valid tradeoffs, not having a usb-c through port seems like a real compromise. don't know if i am making sense? :-)
hdmi/mini dp over battery please
i think battery is not necessary for this product. more importantly, please exchange 3 type-a usb 2.0 port for 3 type-a usb 3.0 port!! for transferring huge amounts of data, usb 2.0 is useless currently, so it is the biggest weakness for this product.
opps sorry, correction. considering the battery is only 400mah, would prefer hdmi/dvi over battery.
considering the battery is only 400mah, would prefer hdmi/mini dp over battery.
i prefer battery than hdmi :)
i also prefer an hdmi port over the battery :)
love this design. can't wait to get one!
would also lean towards an hdmi port if it was an alternative to the battery
thanks you all for your insight and allowing us to understand our backer's preferences! we really appreciate all the feedback you have all given us! thanks again!
+ 1 for the hdmi port ;-) !
i must say something for the battery, in fact i love the battery design. it will be a great feature is it can charge my ipad @12w 2v. and i do agree that it will be great if have a hdmi directly from the hub, and one more usb-c please. :d
well, i would say there is no one super perfect device. i'm sure the creators have thought of a "swiss army knife" hub but given the size, i guess we have to compromise on some features. i too would like to see more features but that will add more bulk. i'm happy with how it is currently. hopefully we are not forgotten (and offer attractive price points for ks backers) should the creators release future variants of the hub+.
hey...  i agree with some of the comments below. i would rather exchange the battery for other ports like more type c ports, and display ports!
i think 3 usb type c port instead of 3 usb type a (moreover 2.0) will give to the product a longer life. electronic market will now release all next devices with this type c port. it's also possible next apple's display will come with type c port.  regarding ethernet, in france we have good wifi everywhere, no needs of ethernet port.
@alwin: today we tested the apple cinema display 27" with mini display port, it was a success! the dell 4k monitor will arrive on wednesday. i will update you the test result.
@alwin: correction! it has not been tested with the dell. we are in the process of it. sorry for the confusion.  please contact us if you need further clarification.
@alwin: the dell monitor was tested today and it was a success!
i would give up the battery if it can add something else like etherport etc.  but there is no other options to pick in the survey.  if there are no alternative then of course i would want to have battery.  to conclude the battery is not a must and i'm willing to give up if there are any alternatives. by the way, how's the 4k display port test with the dell monitor?  i am very curious for the result.
@spencer: thanks for your very insightful response! we really appreciate your feedback!
thanks for the confirmation. so the survey is just asking if we want the battery, not giving us an alternative. whilst the battery isn't a major thing for me, i'd rather have it than not. would be totally different response if the question was "would you like something else instead of the battery?". ethernet isn't a big deal for me, but another display port option would be appealing (hdmi, dvi or vga). keep this comment in mind when you see my "yes i want the battery" response as this would probably change had you given me an alternative.
@spencer: we are currently conducting a survey to understand our backer's preferences. at this point, the hub+ is still being produced with a battery in mind, however, if that should change we will definitely keep everyone up to date!
survey: i don't understand what i'd be gaining by not having the battery. is it a smaller size, choice of colour without stretch, ethernet port or nothing? without knowing the consequence of my choice i'm reluctant to answer.
@lawrence: thanks for the feedback!
instead of battery. i would prefer to have the ethernet port. it will be more useful in case of wifi not available.
@norton: thanks for your feedback! we look forward to considering adding an ethernet port to any future updates to the hub+.
it would be great if an ethernet port (no matter gigabit or not) could be added to the product. such that the new macbook would be an ideal laptop for working in data center
@sms, yes. -steve
displayport is video and audio?
@romerror, the reason is the adapter does not require a hublink chipset. -steve
how come the adapter is usb3.0 but the dock is usb2.0? i read the problems with the chipset, but you use it in the adapter thanks for clarification.
@qiyun: thanks for backing us. after the campaign finished, kickstarter will send final survey link to you. then you can choose the color you want. please note, the space grey/gold color option is part of our stretch goal. please help spread the word introducing hub+ to your friends. the earlier we can reach the stretch goal, the quicker you can receive your space grey/gold color hub.
@ qiyun, once we reach $250k, you can choose one color from gold, grey and silver. kickstarter will send you a survey link for color option when this campaign finished. -steve.
hi guys, for the perk "hub+ early  bird" , which colors we can choose?
@imad: update: the hub+ does not support the thunderbolt display. sorry for the confusion. please message us again if you need further clarification.
@imad: thank you for the great question. our hub+ mini displayport supports apple cinema display. but for the thunderbolt display, you'll need to use a thunderbolt to mdp adapter.
@troy: when charging off the internal battery the power output is .5a.  when the unit is plugged into a power source, it can output the full bc 1.2 standard spec power. i hope this answers your questions.
@troy: in regards to the iphone cable, here is the answer: belkin 6 in./15.2 cm metallic 2.4-amp lightning to usb charge/sync cable
@imad: i will be happy to find out for you.  i will keep you updated!
@francesco: no update as of yet, but we will keep you updated!
@troy: i am working to get an answer for your questions.  i will keep you updated. thanks for your patience!
@benoit: the usb-c port is only for charging, not for data. apple's multiport is also the same design.
have you tested it with the apple cinema display and the apple thunderbolt display?
hello nonda, is there any change to have usb-a 3.0 with this model, or we should just wait for a future update? thank you!
https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/kickshark/hydradock-11-port-usb-c-dock-for-apple-macbook… something similar on kickstarter :)
also, would love to know who makes that snazzy-short-braided iphone cable in your promo shot!
hey guys - curious what power levels are supported on the usb-a ports... a) .5a - standard usb b) 1a - normal recharging levels for an iphone c) something else higher - such as what is specified in the bc1.1 or bc1.2 standards, or eve the ipad charging spec also, i suspect you're close to manufacturing if you're going to delivery in the next couple of months, but i personally would lose one of the usb-a ports, and replace it with another usb-c.  my logic is that under normal use, i'd use both usb-c ports for power, meaning i can't plug in any 'future' usb-c devices (aka... the future!). anyway, no matter what, 2 have already been ordered.  they look like a great device!
i understand the hub is usb 2.0, as you explained for reliability, but the usb-c port is it 2.0 or 3.0? can it be used concurrently with the usb-a ports if i don't need to charge the computer? specifically i have one usb 3.0 (video acquisition) and one usb 2.0 (audio interface) device that i connect simultaneously on my mac pro (obviously that machine is usb 3.0 through and through). can i connect them simultaneously to the macbook through hub+, if i don't charge at the same time? thanks
@rochelle: yes, you can get any ethernet adapter and plug it in the usb-a port and no it does not come with the hub+.  thanks for your question!
apple usb* ethernet adapter, sorry, typo.
hi, the hub+ doesn't come with an ethernet adapter right? if i want to connect my new macbook with ethernet, do i need to get an apple usd ethernet adapter and plug it in the usb-a port of the hub+?
@grant goodale: thanks for sharing these technical details. we just ordered a dell 4k monitor to verify all these specs. we will update you guys the results of the test.
@alwin yu: the stats you quote for external display support are over hdmi, the only thing the a/v adapter supports. a displayport 1.2 adapter (for example, the one google sells for the chromebook pixel) will enable the macbook to output 4k@60hz to a supported external display.
@rohit: thanks for contacting us! sorry, hub+ is designed specifically for the usb-c port of new macbook 12".
hey, can i use this with my macbook pro 15"? can i connect it to the displayport and use this like a hub off of that?
@qiyun and @edwin:  you are correct!  for every additional $79 pledge, you will receive another hub+ and adapter! thanks both for your support.
hi, edwin jia zhong, it's ok ! thanks
yes, in general, order system function like this, but i can't in this project. i don't know why. i was tried  many times.
@qiyun i think you just need to add 79usd for every additional hub you require. see this description under the reward details. hub+ early bird: congratulations! you’ll get one hub+ and one bonus adapter.  want more units? for every additional $79, we'll send you another hub+ and bonus adapter.  choose from three colors when the stretch goal is met.  regular retail price will be $114.
just doubled my pledge for the early bird special! can't wait to receive the two hubs in june!!
hi, i backed up this project as well. and i want to know, how can i buy more ( i just want to buy the perk de 79$) ? thanks
@sherry @m chow, thanks for backing us. after the campaign finished, kickstarter will send final survey link to you. then you can choose the color you want. please note, the grey/gold color option is part of our stretch goal. please help spread the word introducing hub+ to your friends. the earlier we can reach stretch goal, the quicker you can receive your gold/grey color hub. -steve.
i backed up this project as well. but how i am supposed to choose the color? i want the space gray!
can i have a gold one?
@liuhongji: great! thanks for the support!
i wanna get a gold one
in regards to the shipping question, the hub will get clearance. we are set to ship internationally, and we are working with trusted partners with expertise in global logistics.
thanks for your comment ryan, hub+ is the only hub that let’s you charge your phone on-the-go. the first edition will not have the option of a removable battery, but we look forward to considering releasing more versions with various options, including without a battery.
patrick thank you for your comments. we value the feedback of our backers and want to deliver the best product possible. please see our updates in the faq section regarding the display port.
thanks for your input bryan, the first edition will not have an added memory chip, but we look forward to releasing more versions with various options, including considering one with a memory chip.
where from will you ship to the eu? will the hub+ get clearence by the eu customs?
love the concept, but not sure i like the idea of a battery in it, since 400ma isn't going to do much and i'm going to use this primarily as a dock for quite some time.  will there be the option of removing/replacing the battery?
for the record, the 2015 12" macbook does in fact support a 4k monitor at 60hz over a usb-c to displayport adapter, however at the moment i'm unable to get anything better than 2560x1440 at 1x. a software update may enable it to output at 2x, but it's also possible that the graphics card can't handle that resolution. we'll have to wait and see.
also, will you considering implementing like 128gb memory into the hub and add a usb on it to as as alternative pendrive like memory thing?
so, i am wondering, why can't the hub+ be used as normal usb port ? i mean like using a usb-a to usb-a cable and plug into one of the usb-a port or included adapter, and used the feature of sd card reader and extra usb-a ports. ????
@nova upinel shing hei chow altesse, the sdxc is usb2.0, since it depends on the usb-c to usb-a hub-link chipset. for the other question, i believe you are able to connect a mini-dp to hdmi converter, because hub+ outputs standard display v1.2 signal.
@pandeeswaran bhoopathy, yes, we can confirm that.
@alwin, the mini adapter is usb 3.0.
@ alwin, thanks for providing this helpful info from apple. since hub+ uses display 1.2 standard chipset, it does support 4k@60hz, however, if macbook doesn't output correspond signal. the maximum rate will be limited by the maximum output of macbook.
on more thing, the bonus mini adapter is it usb3.0?
though it's mentioned and i already backed, i would like to confirm this: can the new macbook itself be charged by connecting power cord into second usb c port right?
the below is copied from apple support https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht202856 the macbook (retina, 12-inch, early 2015) will support these displays and rates using the usb-c digital av multiport adapter. 3840x2160 at 30 hz refresh rate 4096x2160 at 24 hz refresh rate (mirroring is not supported at this resolution) even apple stated that your hub only can support 4k@30hz.  do you mean your display port can output 4k @ 60z with the new macbook 2015?
i see, although the usb still a lack of this product, but i still want to have one! is the sdxc runs on usb2.0 speed or 3.0? and can i connect a mdp to hdmi adopter cable to output hdmi signal?
patrick, thanks for your support!
thanks for being honest about the gold-plated pledges. again, i want to see this project succeed, so i kept an open mind about 9 out of 10 of those rewards being taken. i'm hoping you hit your stretch goal so the gold and space gray options are available (i have a space gray macbook).
@ philippe: we are using a 1.2 display port which supports 4k at 60hz.  thanks for your question!
hello blair davis.  thanks for your question! at this point, our usb-a port is 2.0 because there is no stable chip set to support usb-c to usb-a 3.0.  we will update the product once we get a stable chip set. also, unfortunately, our interface does not support hdmi.
@nova at this point, our usb-a port is 2.0 because there is no stable chip set to support usb-c to usb-a 3.0.  we will update the product once we get a stable chip set. sorry for the inconvenience.
hello patrick.  thanks for your question and great observation.  i can see how the large pledges within 24 hours could look suspicious to you.  those pledges did indeed come from our friends. several of our founder’s friends want to have something special. to carter to those requests, we created the 24k gold hub+ for them, which is why those were sold on first day. further, we reserved a few for the public, just in case someone else wants to have the same thing. we are very lucky to have many people who truly believe in our product and are able to support us in this way. i hope this addresses your concerns.  thanks!
@ mixpower, unfortunately, our interface does not support hdmi.
what kind of displayport are you using? does it support 4k at 60hz?
hi marie-andree, thanks for your question.  that's a great observation! yes, those pledges did indeed come from our friends.  several of our founder’s friends want to have something special. to carter to those requests, we created the 24k gold hub+ for them, which is why those were sold on first day. further, we reserved a few for the public, just in case someone else wants to have the same thing. we are very lucky to have many people who truly believe in our product and are able to support us in this way.
i think usb3.0 and hdmi1.4b(support 4k@30hz) will let it amazing.
can we have a stretch goal to include usb 3.0? also, hdmi ever an option?
i love this project until i see this: q. are the usb type a ports usb 3.0 or usb 2.0? a. they are usb 2.0. seriously?
9 people backed this product at $3,999 for the gold version in the first 24 hours? i find that hard to believe. don't get me wrong, i backed the early bird reward and i want this product to happen, but it seems to me like there's something fishy going on...
just backed this project, it looks great! it would be awesome if there would be another version available with hdmi instead of dp :)
what is up with those $3999 and over pledges (and many eb still unpledged)? are they coming from friends of yours?
hi emily, thanks for asking that question. yes, it does charge your computer while you are using all other devices. hub+ is designed to have 2 usb-c ports, one that connects to your power adapter and one that connects to your new macbook.
hi creator could you please tell me if the product is compatible for charging the the new macbook?
@joan, awesome! thanks for backing us :)
i will be happy to beta test your products
