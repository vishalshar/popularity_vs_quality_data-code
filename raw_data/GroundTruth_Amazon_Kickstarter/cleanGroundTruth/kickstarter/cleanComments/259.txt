jamie, the print i got last week is awesome! keep up the great work.
this is exciting!  i love the aviary and am looking forward to new work! (and an awesome poster of the quiet bird-man and a squid with glasses high fiving...everything i've always wanted in a poster)
indeed! your artwork looks just great. i can't wait to have the aviary in my hands! my only regret is that i can't pledge more... good luck, jamie.
thanks, andreas!
