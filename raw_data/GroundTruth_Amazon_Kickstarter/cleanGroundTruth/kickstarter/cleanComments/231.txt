@khaled, on the usps site it does say customs cleared, but then right below it says "does not meet customs requirements - return to sender"... we didn't get anything back, so i'm going to call usps tomorrow and see if they can give me a straight answer on where the game is at. if this doesn't work we'll use a different shipper when we resend the game. either way we'll figure this out and you will get your game, sorry it's taking so long, we'll make sure it's handled this week.
@khaled, i'll look into that for you and see if we can't figure it out.
not sure why my order is stuck in canada since june 8, and cleared customs there, while i live in dubai, uae. info please. thanks.
@hon sing sim your copy is on its way, i'll pm you to make sure you have your tracking number. @steven, let us know how it goes!
why i haven't got mine yet?
got mine here in canada today. can't wait to play this weekend!
mine arrived yesterday in the uk, seriously can't wait to play it! :d

anime sucks-- thank you for being a gentle soul. i just ripped open mine.  -jason
tuck box open! i grabbed a screwdriver, shoved it in the butt, pushed up to the mouth.. and pushed it open.... gently
got my cards today, really excited to play! thanks for the great work guys!
heh, yeah tuck boxes are the worst. i think pinching the sides helped, either that or grabbing it with your teeth and tearing it open.
can't... open... 8-bit.... tuckbox....
how excting! received my deck today . can't wait to play
@hon sing sim i send out an update shortly, but in short, the games are sitting on the docks in la waiting to be reviewed by customs, our shipping broker says it'll be reviewed by the 26th then shipped to our warehouse.
cards are not here yet. any news on shipping?
@timothy, we've been working with our shipping broker. they manage receiving, and sending the game to our fulfillment partner in la. we signed all their papers, verified that we're a legitimate business(which is also new for us!) and now we're waiting for the game to clear customs in china!, from the date it clears customs in china it should be on the ocean for a couple weeks before we get it. we'll post as soon as we learn that the shipment is on the boat, and again once it reaches us shores.
any word
@hon sing sim we're waiting to clear customs in china, should be any day now. we'll update as soon as it happens.
are you shipping already???
@tim, you better believe it! we'll have an update shortly with the current state of things.
shipping?

@chris, we have lots of news to share. we'll update everyone this week!

my pleasure, and looking forward to the update! i can't wait to embarrass myself with this game.
@tim: we're working on a new update right now that we'll be sending out soon. sorry for the delay. thanks for answering your backerkit early!
any word on production?
i haven't received anything for the backerkit thing. has anyone else?
yay!
wow, what a buzzer beater! great end to a great campaign, congrats to grant and to all of us for being the first wave of people to play and get the word out on a game that will take over cah's dusty, dildo laden mantle!
booyah!
and someone joins the fray! w00t! 13,000 stretch goal completed!
so close to that 13,000 stretch goal...so close
asonifrank@gmail.com looking forward to leaving stuff.
the top pledger on humble bundle led me here! this game looks so fun! glad i made it in before the cut.
just saw this on bwl, holy crap this game is going to be fun!  glad i didn't miss this one.
we may release them at a later date as a separate purchase, if things were going really well for us, but they wouldn't be part of the kickstarter delivery. we're still hopeful that we can make it in the final few days!
if the stretch goals aren't met, will the spite cards be available as an add-on?
congrats!
funded!!!!!
