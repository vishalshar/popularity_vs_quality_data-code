has anyone had issues with the slider being too tight that it will not slide  out easily
thanks dwayne and todd for the positive comments!
received my wallet this week and stuck it on the back of my iphone 6 plus. it is amazing! unintentional side-effect: it now makes my phone sit better in my car mount and doesn't wiggle anymore. i use it to hold my credit card, license, and work my work badge. i've back several kickstarters and this is probably my favorite and most satisfying reward. thank you, joshua!
i received my wallet two days ago and i love it so far. i carry 2 credit cards and a transit card. i placed my id on the "sticky" side. perfect!!
congrats joshua! looking forward to my new wallet! :)
oh hey, the pledge goal was reached!
yasou joshua, ti kanis? my father's greek but that's pretty much the extent of my language knowledge :) great idea on this wallet, can't wait to get mine. curious if there will be any stretch goals or possibly color options available?
hi joshua! love this idea and can't wait to receive it, wishing all the best! how can i reach you to feature you and your product in an upcoming issue?
this is an amazing product that i hope i can have is there any chance to get it in case it doesn't get funded?
