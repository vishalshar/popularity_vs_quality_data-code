glen i just posted. i am happy to answer any questions if you have specific things you were wondering about. cheers, laurie
what's the status of this project?
thanks so much holly! yesterday someone described build & imagine storywalls as "the dollhouse, re-invented". i like that.
laurie, this is amazing! i love what you did here. we were in the market for a dollhouse and this is so much better! i shared on social media. fingers crossed this gets funded! let me know if i can help.
going to need some boy stickers too :)
awesome idea! my boys love to build things and they will love this, plus supporting friends is a double bonus!! say hi to the fam!
phenomenal, laurie. can't wait to have a set in my apartment (and i'm 26!). ;)
great idea! love seeing more and more s.t.e.m. inspired products geared towards girls. my project (campaigning now 'til 11/13/13) is aimed at getting girls learning and thinking about space science. hope to see your playsets in toy stores soon!
these storywalls are so cool! my neice whose in 5th grade is going to love the marine mammal center. what a great idea :)
