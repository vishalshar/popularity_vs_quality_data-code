i never received my bars.  i did receive a very nice card with some bonus bars (which i enjoyed very much) but never got the actual kickstarter backer reward.
these are amazing! i love them because i can grab these instead of a candy bar or junk food! my favorite is the hickory smoked bbq and cheddar! i hope that i can find more of these latter when i run out!
i really enjoy the bars. i can't decide which flavor i like best! after taking advantage of your backer coupon, my only feedback is that i hope you'll work on uniform portions. i was disappointed to find the italian bars in my box of 12 varied in size and some were very narrow or short compared to the bbq line which seems much more consistent in sizing. this made me less confident in the portion sizing and nutritional data (very important as i watch what i eat!). good luck--i'm a fan!
thank you just arrived here in thailand, not had chance to taste them yet, they need a little chill time after the hot trip :-) but they look great!
just got mine.  very tasty!  the italian and bbq each have their merits.  srirachia soon.  i'm also surprised at how filling they are.
i have not received mine yet,either.  im sooooo hungry!
just received mine including the siracha and lime! can't wait to taste them!
received  today, i'm typing this as i'm devouring  the hickory smoked bbq and cheddar  bar. i'm a fairly picky eater (i have both taste and texture issues)and have been looking for a snack bar that i can toss in my lunch box and eat between calls on those days that we're  out nonstop. i'm officially  done looking, this bar is phenomenonal! i will have to order more!
has anyone received the sriracha delivery yet?
received. devoured. enjoyed. thank you--these were delicious and filling. good luck with your business!!
haven't received mine yet :(
eating my first savory harvest bar, i'm eating the parmesan, tomato, & herb. omg! so good. you know the italian tradition of dipping bread in herbed oils? well this tastes like that but without the oil, the herbs are strong and flavorful. wish i hadn't walked out the door with just one...
guys i left you a message about something came up with my order
received my shipment. am very happy! here's to your continued success.
thank you so much for the comments and messages as you receive your packages, it keeps us motivated through this packing and shipping stage. also, thanks for all the postal advice, we are getting smarter. signed up for stamp.com and aside from burning through the ink jet, that is a big improvement. savor your day!
i got my savory harvest bars! i tried the bbq one yesterday, and it was absolutely delicious. :) i hope i'll be able to find you in stores soon - and more than just whole foods and health stores. have you thought about dealing with wholesale/bulk stores like costco? i don't know what the contract terms are like (i've heard they're pretty good, but i have no experience with that side of costco), but i would happily put in a request at my local store to start carrying your bars. if i could get them in bulk, these would easily replace my nature valley bars. well, maybe not replace entirely, but i'd definitely eat them alongside (i tend to crave savory foods more than sweet). :d
update out (lisa w. thank you for the nudge).
any update is better than no update.
any idea when the surveys are going out
lisa and tom,  good luck at the trade show!!!  sell, sell, sell.  we are all sending you good mojo....
so when it says "expected delivery: may" is there any time frame in may that i should be expecting to receive the bars?
is there a way to add on for the sriracha and lime bars to an existing pledge?
dearest sriracha, get in my belly. signed,  hungry and seeing #blackandblue
sriracha and cheddar & lime all gone??? i can't change my pledge to add them ï¿½
how can we get some sriracha bars?  add to pledge?
i was telling a coworker recently that people like me, who have a "sugar aversion" have few choices for snacks besides wasabi peas and nuts.  that same day i saw you on kickstarter and could not believe it! of course i pledged!!!   i also love the thinking..."unsweet"!   i can't wait to try!  thanks!!
great minds are behind this operation. i was lucky enough to receive samples and... holy deliciousness!!!  the yum factor is off the charts!  i'll be buying these in mass quantities!
i was able to try samples of these bars and they are truly delicious!!  what an awesome idea and i look forward to following your success and am very happy to support your kickstarter adventure!
