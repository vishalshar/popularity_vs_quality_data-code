@paul wright i just sent a message with information.
@aun sent a private with instructions.
i had forgotten about how i backed this project, but i never received confirmation of shipping to the email i provided. i had to update my address as i've since moved out of state. any idea what happened or what the status of my pledge is?
no product at all they are not shipping to everyone.  refund the money now.
just received. the quality is nicer than i expected. thank you very much!
@ryan cheng - sorry to hear that you are having some trouble with it. please take a look at the instruction page here, and make sure that the elastic band is properly seated on the marker board, and lined up on the lens. http://focusshifter.com/follow-focus-dslr/dslr-follow-focus-puller-rack-video-camera-instructions/ thanks, daniel
any canadians have a tracking number? (i only ask because most shipments to canada are not tracked right.)
got mine on last week. the marker board is so easy to fall off from the rubber band. which is become very useless for me now.
no tracking number yet
we are still in the process of shipping these out to all backers. you will get a message with a tracking # when it has shipped. if you have not received a message, it means that it has not yet shipped. thank you for your patience.
got mine!  thanks!!
any idea when it will be shipped
i'm backer #19  so happy!!!

thanks for everyone's comments about the lens/camera combinations that you'll be using with focusshifter!
gh4 (+gx80/g7/bmpcc/e-m1). have a great selection of lenses, but narrowing it down it would probably be most for pairing up with the veydra mini prime cinema lens set (12mm, 16mm, 25mm, 35mm, 50mm and 85mm t2.2's). contax zeiss primes (distagon 25, 28 & 35mm f/2.8, tessar 45mm f/2.8, planar 50mm f/1.4, sonnar 85 & 135mm f/2.8). the nikon 'bourne' duo (af(-s) nikkor ed 28-70mm f/2.8 d, 80-200mm f/2.8 d); the 28mm f/2.8 ai-s mf as well. tokina 11-16mm f/2.8 ii, at-x pro ii 28-70mm f/2.6-2.8 & at-x 535 pro dx 50-135mm f/2.8 zooms. sigma art 18-35mm f/1.8. olympus m.zuiko 7-14mm f/2.8 pro, 12-40mm f/2.8 pro & 75mm f/1.8. something like that. (^^, )
sony a6300 - a lot of different lenses, but mostly rokinons.
canon 5d mkii - 50mm prime and 24 - 105mm zoom
sony a6300 - selp 18-105 g / ef 24-70 ii
canon 70d - 18-135stm, 50mm, 24mm, 10-22mm
olympus om-d e-m1 or e-m5mkii with most lenses (12mm, 25mm, 7-14mm, 12-40mm, 40-150mm)
canon 5d mkii and 80d 50mm 1.8 arm, 85mm 1.8, 24mm 2.8
@brent - thanks!
@ege celik - it won't work for that "point and shoot" style camera with a focus by wire ring. focusshifter is designed for use on cameras with interchangeable lenses, and mechanically linked focus rings. thanks!
this looks great! i'm happy i stumbled across this kickstarter.
i love this project ! i just have a question, can i use it for my rx100 iv ? this camera have a ring that can adapt the focus, so i was wondering if i can do it with this, or it'll be too small ?
@leon smits - thanks for backing us again! yes you can upgrade your older set.
i already have one ;) , but i wouldn't mind a second set. can i upgrade my pledge with an additional 10 bucks to get a new set + an upgrade for the old one i already have?
@amer - yes, focusshifter will work on sony lenses, such as e-mount. it will work best with mechanical focus rings. it will not work well with focus by wire (focus ring is electronic) lenses.
will this one work with sony lens such as the e-mount?!
@gordon chu - it looks like the lumix fz1000 has a digital focus/zoom ring. it is not mechanically coupled to the focus lens. the focusshifter will fit on the lens, and you can use the lever to adjust your focus or zoom. the repeat-ability of being able to pull focus between 2 points using marks or hard stops will be dependent on how responsive the digital focus ring is.
how about lumix fz1000?
@gordon chu - can you provide an example of the camera you would like to use it on? the camera or lens must have a mechanically linked focus ring. if it's an electronic focus ring, that is not mechanically coupled to the focusing lens, then it will not work well.
will the shifter also work with (prosumer) dcs which come with a manual focus ring on the lens?
