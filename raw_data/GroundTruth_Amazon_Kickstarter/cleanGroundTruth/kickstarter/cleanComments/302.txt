i'm so glad this has been funded. it drives me nuts that the only science kits currently marketed to girls are things like cosmetics - the proper science sets are all too often billed as boys' toys. as a female scientist (and an utter science geek to boot), it is disheartening to see girls put off entering the stem subjects because its overwhelmingly presented as a guy thing. i agree with both sets of comments here - having a cheaper chemistry set, and having a physics one. there is certainly a need for a physics one, to inspire girls to go into this area (women are massively under-represented in physics, partially because it is still perceived as a "boy's subject"). would also be nice to have one related to cosmology (but not sure how you'd do one), but having a science kit that people at lower incomes can still get would be fantastic - unfortunately education seems too much tied to income far too often. as a co-organiser of a skeptics in the pub group here in the uk, could i also suggest an introduction to the scientific method (e.g. building theories from evidence, testing hypotheses, but also the importance of reason and critical thinking). a lot of the science kits i've come across often do something like "hey, do this cool science experiment" without introducing kids to what science actually is. yet encouraging critical thinking is something they will find useful in many other areas of life. and lastly a hope that one day i'll be able to get one of these sets here in the uk (i have a young goddaugher - too young at the mo to be playing with chemicals, but will be doing my best to instil my love of science in her). if you do ever expand, don't forget us science geeks across the pond!
my five year old loves science. (of course, having a momma that was a former teacher might help. � ) we would love to see kits in other areas of science to help make more connections and, as she gets older, help direct her into a field of interest.
thanks, jenny! so glad that your daughter is excited about science. let's keep her interested and engaged :)
i was lucky to have a science teacher for a father and i think his lessons and interest sparked a life-long love of science. i can see the same excitement in my daughter and i think yellow scope will be an excellent tool to encourage that. thank you for bringing this product to the market.
danielle - we definitely are aware of the need for access to lower income families and truly want to figure out how to make our kits and science in general more accessible. thank you for your thoughtful comment.
rebecca and jennifer - duly noted.
amanda - excellent comment about physics/astrophysics, but it looks like you got cut off :(
we are loving all of the ideas, and comments that people are putting out there. keep 'em coming!
i'm torn like others. love the idea of a lower price point, but as a physics and chemistry teacher, i feel we need more physics science kits too. considering that girls are less likely to be talked out of a life science field (at least in my experience) than a physical science field, i'd say stick to the physical sciences till they are better represented to our future (lady) scientists. still, any science covered is a plus in my book (even earth science, heh.)
i would love to see kits from other areas of science like biology or biochemistry as well as a lower cost version of the chemistry kit.  i've done research to look for kits for my child and haven't been thrilled with what is out there.
moving forward, i would love to see a different area of science represented.  i would like to explore another area that is traditionally *not* populated with females (to introduce young girls to this aspect of science).  perhaps robotics, electrical (check out snapcircuits), or programming/coding.  love this start-up.  keep us posted!
i agree with danielle: i think the best move forward would be to create a chemistry kit at a lower price point. i think her points about it being more accessible to families with fewer resources, and that it would be more likely to be donated/gifted/supplied are all spot-on. however, if the final decision is to bring in a new field, i vote for physics, being a physicist myself. ;)
i would like to see kits for different areas of science. and maybe even move into other stem areas like engineering, mechanics, robotics, etc. i'd also like to mention that my son will also be using this chemistry set, along with my daughter. :)
i am possibly going to go against the grain here by saying i would like to see you develop a chemistry kit at a lower price point before expanding to different sciences. i personally would like to see the physics kit, however a lower price point would be excellent for families without a lot of resources. it would be more likely to be gifted, donated or supplied to kids that don't usually get science kits at all much less one marketed to boys vs girls. i hope yellow scope markets this to boys as well as girls and i hope your supporters consider buying it for young science interested boys they know too. most of all i am excited to do some experiments with my 5 year old when this kit comes in!
love the idea of a new, different biology or physics kit next!
i would love to see a biology or a physics kit next.
for future kits, i'd love to see a physics/astrophysics one that specifically talked about light (thus you can tie in some astrophysics things about how fast light travels and what that tells us about stars and space, the different wavelengths of light, etc.) as well as talk about things like how rainbows form, how mirrors work, and how colors form on soap bubbles. these are all phenomena that kids are used to seeing in their own life, and even mostly in their own bathroom. :) the kit could include a prism, a small mirror, and a small container of blowing bubbles, for example
thank you so much for continuing to spread the word!
we reached our 25k goal! stay tuned for our stretch goal...
so excited that you've reached your goal with days to go!  still spreading the word and can't wait for my daughter to have a chance to explore her interest in chemistry!  thank you!
we are so excited to be a part of this project!  we have two (almost :) ) boys ourselves, and see the myriad of scientific toys for boys; but it is a shame that these are almost universally marketed toward those of us who happen to have y chromosomes. let's raise a generation of barbie-scoffing, easy-bake-oven-denying intellectually-minded girls! well, maybe not the easy bake oven denying, as everyone needs a cookie now and again.  go yellow scope! any plans for a marie curie action doll?
we are up to 357 backers! we can't believe it. kickstarter sent a fun congratulations when we reached 352 backers. we're wondering if that number has special meaning for them... anybody have any ideas about that?
way to go! good luck with this campaign. can't wait to see it all come to fruition. excited that you'll be shipping to canada.
having a new daughter has opened my eyes to so many things.  she is my 5th child after 4 boys and i have taken for granted all of the opportunities my sons have in the science world.  it is so easy to keep them excited with all of the products geared towards boys.   thank you yellow scope for filling a real need in our society.  this product will go a long way in supporting my daughters science needs, keeping her curious and asking questions.
i can think of so many schools down here in the pasadena area who will eat this up.  westridge, chandler, sequoyah, waverly, poly, highpoint.  parents at these will buy this product like hotcakes.
do you know who maria klawe is? she tweeted about us :)
i taught chemistry in college and in high school, this is an important project!  good luck!!!
what an amazing product!  kudos to you both from canada! as a mom and middle school teacher this is a much needed tool to engage young girls and help them to discover more about "real" science!  way to go!
anvil tax loves to support local business.  congratulation, it looks like you’re on your way.   my science loving niece will love the lab coat.
let's all work together and push this project over the top.
love from portland! home schooling mom with science loving daughter! you really hit home with us, wish we could donate more. shared with everyone we know! thank you
as a high school teacher, i can definitely attest to the need for getting girls more comfortable with science, especially being hands on with things.  keep it up!
i love the whole concept of this project. good luck reaching your goal and beyond! and of course, i can't wait for the kit to arrive!
so excited about this project! my girls are going to love experimenting with these kits. science for everyone!
you had me at hello, my name is...!!!!  great program!!  yay for science!!!!!!!  congrats!   happy to help and i'm spreading the word as best i can!  love, your fellow science geek, shana in la
this is a great family bonding activity. who doesn't like science? i want the science kit for myself.
my daughters will love this!
i think i'm going to have to adjust my prediction of when you will reach your funding goal! at this rate, you will be funded by wednesday! congratulations!
i earned $40.00 by emptying the dishwasher ($1.00 every time i did it) so i could buy a science kit and help yellow scope. i think it's a really good idea to make science kits for girls and the kits sound really cool!!!!!                                                          -mckenzie, age 9 3/4, i'm a girl.
what a great product!  i can't wait to do these experiments again! (i was lucky enough to be part of the focus group team).  these are fun experiments!
go yellow scope! good luck and thank you for thinking outside the conventional box. my daughter will love this kit!
i'm so proud of you young women.  the concept is great and i wish there was something like this when i was young.  best wishes for a successful campaign. how proud i am of my daughter and kelly. love mom
what a great concept.  young girls will now have an important tool to help them reach their potential in science.
can't wait to see the first kit!  girls everywhere are going to love this.  go yellow scope!
so excited!  this will be a welcome item for omas and grandmas to get for their granddaughters.
great idea! look forward to having fun using it with my girls!
this is such a great project! my daughter is only two, but i'm ordering a kit anyway and hoping all the components will be shelf-stable for the next six years. good luck with the fundraising. i'm so excited to see the finished product!
now that i'm a parent of a young girl i am glad you are making this available.  this is a great idea.  can't wait to get the kit.  you have my full support!
if i were a girl, and interested in science, i'd want one.
i'm so excited to be i'm the era where things like this actually exist! thank you so much for bringing this to market! i guarantee you hit your goal by the end of the week, and if you don't make it to $100000, i'd be surprised! can't wait to see what else you have i'm store for us.
i have seen the kits first hand.  they not only cover foundation science concepts, but they are very creatively designed & will easily make any girl want to dive right in!
my daughter will love this. what a great idea! do you ship internationally?
go girls in science! go yellow scope! good luck!!
