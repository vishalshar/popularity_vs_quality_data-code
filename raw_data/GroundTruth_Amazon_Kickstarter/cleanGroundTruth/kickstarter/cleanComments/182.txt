although it's has been a long time since i received it, i'd like to say the bandana is great. the only problem that i've been facing is that, if i'm not a little careful, it can't stay around my neck when i'm running. thanks
for the record i messaged both my german friends below their tracking info (both packages departed march 8th) and we are working on solutions to eventually get them an actual weatherneck.  just so ya know, i take care of my bidness.
i am also waiting n germany for my weatherneck parcel.
uk user here and loving it works perfectly on the cycle commute and is great how it blocks the wind over my ears and neck so i barely notice the cold!
yes, michael. i have received mine a few weeks ago. it is absolutely perfect and does everything as expected. the only thing i don't like is that it is white on the inside. i would prefer a version with the same color as outside...
anybody in germany already received the weatherneck? mine has not arrived until now. what is standard delivery time from us to ger?
overall it's a good product. however for me it's not quick stable on my face... possibly because i do not have wear a helmet and i use it for fishing tour
one would think jhack...i replied to your message.
@brian davis. i've received it today. the tissue is elastic. every time i extend it a bit the stitches come away from the tissue!!! i hope this is related to "some defective weathernecks" you talked about. if it's normal, it's unusable.
thanks dejers, love the selfie! thanks anson, good feedback, we are working on some of those issues now. thanks beh...working on the gap issue for next fall
woo, loving my weathernecks so far! @creator, a note; it feels a bit wonky smashing the top of my nose. other than that though, definitely happy with my investment! :) selfie with weatherneck; https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/rt4rrfkr/20160321_071833.jpg
@creator... got mine- perfect timing as the weather is getting a bit better so it will be bike-to-work next week! couple observations on mine... the top seam/stitch isnt the best in workmanship and irritates my face a bit. i will try your flip-top technique and try again :) secondly, the fashion police doesn't approve of the white interior since it's a huge contrast to my black weatherneck (when worn just on the neck and you can see the inside white)
got mine too. very nice fabric. and warm too. the only concern is the open gap between the top and bottom magnets.
just received it! i'll post my feedback after trying them outside :)
got them, thanks brian!
thank you brain!
hope there fast ;) thanks brian!
hi oliver (and others), all orders i had info for were shipped last week. i have only 19 people that have not shipped. that means for intl orders, give it at least 2 weeks, if not more, to expect delivery. sometimes the postal folks move very fast, other times it is painfully slow. as for tracking, i would only be able to show you it was picked up in the us, the postal tracking doesn't allow for door to door tracking using first class mail which is what i used to keep costs reasonable.  thanks!
@creator hi brian, i was wondering if my weathernecks were sent, and if by any chance you'd have an approximate eta? it is getting warmer in paris and i really would like to try them before it is too warm ;) cheers!
hello creator, i live in hong kong and i still receive nothing today. maybe you miss my pledge?
thanks tim...will file for potential future changes matthew z...sweet!
brian, got my replacement yesterday.  thanks so much.  now i just have to wait for some cold weather to wear it again.
a snafu with my postman sent my package back. the creator was on theball and shipped it right back to an alternate address i gave.  posing in front of the mirror and playing with the flip flpping magnets. if i may suggest curving the top so that it is higher over the nose and a little lower under ther eyes, i think it will help it stay in place better.  great job overall!
hi ascar, the magnets are sewn with space on purpose. so the magnets can flip around (or you can flip them around) for proper polarization. so try flipping them over in their spots for better alignment. that also helps with the gap. but again this product is designed for people being active outside so complete and total warmth was never the goal. 2 hands to put it on...yes that's true. but 1 hand to remove. stitching-i'll keep that in my mind as the product evolves.  that's for being an early adaptor and enjoying the process of making it better together.
completely unhappy with my item.  2 tiny magnets that move out of place and do not line up.  a 2 handed operation to put it on.   and it has a bunched up opening because the neck is curved and the design is not.  lets all the cold air in on my neck and down my back. the stitching on the edges is rough on my face.
good morning richard!  thanks for the feedback. i addressed the thread remnants with the sewer. it's not as easy as it would appear to conquer that though. the scissors grab the magnets so it's challenging to get close enough to snip without snagging the fabric. i'm looking into non-magnetic scissors for the next batch.
i just received my two and i have to say that the stitching quality is awful at the top near the magnets.  it's like they completely missed where they were intending to hit.  i'm hoping it doesn't made too much different to the longevity of the items. in addition, the finishing is generally poor.  would only take a few mins to snip the longer loose threads (this was obviously done for the promo shots). fairly disappointed to be honest.
p.s. 4 kickstarters successfully funded and 4th delivered ontime.  please spread the word and direct people to www.theweatherneck.com
shipping update 3-9-16 i only have about 25 intl backers left that i have survey info from and need to ship, otherwise a ton of product went out earlier this week, so it will be on the way.   finally, there are still about 30 people who have not responded to the survey or emailed me through messaging. i cannot ship your order till i know your address and color choice. feel free to get in touch with me through info@theweatherneck.com if you need more help.  (the survey would have been an email through the kickstarter email system delivered to your inbox associated with your ks account.)
replacement weathernecks that i was notified of shipped out yesterday...@matthewz that includes you.
@marc or anyone else...i would love photos of the weatherneck in skiing or snowboarding settings...report back how it worked too please!
so ill guess ill try your email address instead of messaging you here.
received today in hong kong,  just in time for a 10Âºc drop overnight.
@brian: no bad feelings because of vat! as i said, it was a known risk, so no expectation from me for you to do something. all good! :-)
got it.  weather moved in.  i went out skiing.  product worked great.  thanks!
sorry for the lack of response, was gone for the weekend racing... re: vat, sorry not much i can do about that re: ricky, i emailed you back on your photos re: loose fit...refer to the re-sizing video on the campaign page for how to make it tighter
thanks!
got my weatherneck and couldn't be happier. definitely will need to get more for some family members
mine arrived yesterday in switzerland! looking forward to use them :) big thanx!
my friend received his but i haven't yet
now in france ! thanks. merci et bravo.
bit bummed how loose it fits, not tight enough
wow i just got mine in today 3-4-16 the only thing i got a problem is at the top where the stitch is losing  and hanging out,  i wish i can post pic of what im talking about but other than that it very nice and i like it
weathernecks arrived savely in germany. sadly i had to pay vat, but thats a risk a had to take. the weathernecks are awesome!
they arrived in japan today. awesome. crazy fast!  thanks
awesome, thanks matthew. this sounds weird, but i also have found sort of inhaling the fabric a bit into your mouth and then exhaling a bit more forcefully through your mouth also mitigates the fogging issue a bit.
so i was able to sorta fix my fogging glasses by doing 2 things. 1) i tightened it up a little. 2) i made sure that i was looking forward(apparently looking down a little because of the wind appears to be causing my glasses to fog up)
amazing! can't wait to use it!
hi brent, no tracking numbers and not everything is shipped yet either, i'm still working my way through. all the 9-packs and 4-packs are out the door and some other groups here and there. i'll have an update soon explaining.
is there a tracking number that comes with the shipment? i think i missed that comment if it was said
4 weathernecks arrived in germany ! amazing speed, man ! thanks so much. great product!
just got mine, now if it could just get cold enough again to use... it looks great!
hi bryan. check the campaign at the bottom there is video called re-size detail. also the graphic on the campaign (and the slip that should have been in your envelope). try that and it should help.
i got mine, fits too loosely.  what can i do about that?
thanks matthew, it's not the end all solution to fogging, but it helps having the mesh. i might experiment as time goes with more holy mesh...ha.  anyway, thanks for the note and thanks for continuing to play around with it. it took me some time to dial it in too.
looks great, the fastest kickstarter ive ever participated in.  however am i wearing it wrong, for some reason i thought it would stop the fogging up of my glasses when im breathing.  ill keep trying though because my face isnt frozen when i wear it.
received!! thank you!!
got mine today. much thanks.
just got mine today. looks great and ahead of schedule
got mine today! a month early and they look and feel great. nice job!
hi mate, just wondering where the survey is? it wasn't in the email you sent out and i can't find it here on kickstarter, any guidance would be appreciated and congrats on getting the project funded!!! cheers
i was more curious about the approximate time from when they ship to the destination, not necessarily when they leave the source facility. it doesn't change my shipping address, as experiences have been generally pleasant with usps.  it was just one extreme outlier situation, with a package that took much longer to arrive than anyone expected, hence the question.
hi lyle, i will be shipping via usps. i plan on getting a lot out next week. i have used usps for a few years and they do have some issues, but i can't beat the cost especially for intl shipping. if that changes your ship to address on your survey let me know.
hi brian, just wondering what expected shipping times to the toronto (ontario, canada) area would be from when you send the parcels out.  i've had some interesting experiences with items shipped through usps  and was wondering how the international shipping was being handled.  this product looks great and useful for my use case.
cool.  i'm excited to test the products skiing, tubing and spring biking :)
hi brian, thanks for the details! looking forward having it :)
@toni  not the first time i heard that about the hex pattern being too masculine...i'll work on some new designs over the summer and we will be ready to rock next fall with some more selection.
@oliver... 1. i am looking into it, but it will not be available for some time. your color choice will be made in the survey which will likely be emailed to you later this week. 2. you just put it on like a bandana, so it's open in the back, but that's about it. not much too it other than putting on your head vs. around your neck.
@brian/creator  congratz being funded! quick questions: 1) will there be a way to have the all black you talked about in some comments? if not, here are my choice for your estimate: 2 black/grey hex 2) i like the way you put the weatherneck under your helmet. you show how to quickly remove it, even from there, but how do you put it? would you be able to make a video? thanks
safety worker pattern
congrats at getting funded
can't wait -i know the guys- farm boys will love them.  but, i personally as a woman would love an all black one to wear ( didn't look so masculine) . toni
just backed! black hex pattern please! thank you!
1 black, 1 orange.
ncaa school designs - starting with louisiana state university. geaux tigers!
the name would be visible if it is gloss black on flat black. nice stealthy look.
black sticking on black? itd be there atleast and maybe a more visible one on the inside.
yes, absolutely! i will likely have something put together for that next fall. i'm told from a few conscientious backers who are military that those folks need all black. so i'll do that for them. not sure how i'll get the name on there but i'll figure something out. i'm a bit resourceful.
thought about solid colors?  i think all black would be sick.
1 blue camo
1 red hex and 1 blue camo - winter fat biking and skiing will be primary use. can't wait!
i plan on using them for camping. i camp and hike a lot in the winter, so something that keeps my face warm while letting me breath is great.
check out this little sneak peek review. love the reviews these guys do. very fresh style. http://youtu.be/ggt_uoevus0
saw the motorcycle video. i'm sold now.  thanks for taking the time man.
regarding motorcycle helmets. yes, i discovered it does work very well. video added to the main page at the bottom. thanks to appleton harley-davidson's heather for educating me on the ins and outs of mc helmets.
thanks @frank i needed that today. lots of haters in the ether today. i appreciate the positive vibes!
how will i use this?  how won't i use it is probably a better question... commuting (you'd be surprised how frosty a beard can get in a mile), mountain biking, hiking, walking my dog, nordic/downhill skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, standing outside in the sub zero temps for an hour or more to get one or two good pictures.... the possibilities are endless.
could i see a picture/video of its use with a full-face motorcycle helmet?
i'm primarily planning to use it while cycling.
i'm thinking 1 pink and 1 black grey hex
winter fat bike riding, snowshoeing, hiking.
i plan to use for biking, xc skiing, downhill skiing, and cold packer games.  maybe hunting too.
colors - 1 black/gray hex, 1 green camo activities - cycling and hunting
1 black and 1 orange thanks
i'd like one in the black hex please.  i'm going to use for alpine skiing in cold and snowy weather and for biking in the spring, fall and winter.  spring and fall on the road and winter on the fat bike on snow trails down to about zero fahrenheit.
oh good call on the velcro vs. long hair battle. i keep forgetting to bring that up!
really excited about this! i'd love one in the black hex if possible. will be using it for cold weather biking and cross country skiing
i'm planning to use this skiing. i hate pulling wet neck warmers up over my head at lunchtime, and velcro gets all in my hair
i got the green hex, but would really love if you had one that was more lime yellow without the hex pattern for highest visibility. i'd even suggest you consider adding a reflective coating option, especially along the sides, for improved low light/nighttime visibility while cycling! i'd certainly pay extra for that!
1 black hex
and one blue camo
one black hex
1 blue camo 1 gray camo
1 blue camo 1 gray camo
i love the idea, brian! the only improvement would be to have one now for the impending 3' snows.  i work in catering and at the end of every month i have to do inventory inside our three giant -25 degree freezers. i currently use a face covering, but as you mentioned it gets moist inside around my mouth and that is no bueno.  after seeing your high speed test video i decided on the 4-pack, with the intention of giving some as gifts to family members with motorcycles. i'm leaning towards: 2 classic camo, 1 orange hex, 1 black hex keep up the great work!
thank you brian for your quick reply concerning motorcycle use of the weatherneck. since i couldn't decide on 2 colors i decided to go for 4. my color choices: blue camo urban camo brown camo green hex
1x black hex and 1x black/grey camo
approved the prototypes today. sewing has begun my friends. sewing has begun! thank you and please share the campaign, i want to make more friends!

got a couple questions on this... ***how to upgrade your pledge*** 1. pull up the project on ks here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fixitsticks/the-weatherneck-an-updated-bandana-for-outdoor-adv 2. click "manage" 3. click " change your pledge" 4. pick your new level and click continue and it will confirm your wish and that's it. as a reminder, when the campaign is over, i will send the survey to get final color choices and ship to info. thanks again for the color comments, i put in an order for a lot more black hex already.

thanks everyone, this helps me a lot.  i was thinking the black/grey hex would be the major interest, but i didn't order that way. my initial order was even on all colors. that was a mistake. no big deal, i just need to make a new order for black/grey...so i will be ordering more black/grey hex today. i'll keep ordering and you keep sharing the project!
congrats & great news!!!   i am thinking for my four:    * red hex,    * orange hex,    * green hex &    * black/grey camo

hi, a green/black hex for me please :d
i will get one black/grey hex.
@ kenny young: thx kenny i appreciate the support. good eyes spotting the weatherneck in the wild yesterday.
2 black for me, was cool to meet you on the trail yesterday and see the product! really cool idea. it is easy to get on/off, a vented strip for breathing.
i will take one pink.
@ willa getschow: can't believe you'd want a pink. ha! thx for the backing. you were top of mind when i ordered pink.
1 black/grey hex, 1 pink hex :)
probably 1x "black/grey hex"
1 red hex or 1 orange hex, i'm not quite sure yet...
1 grey camo and 1 blue camo
1 black/grey hex
planning on a grey camo and a black/grey hex here.
hi, 2 x black/grey hex. thanks!
i'm in for two.  black/grey and orange/grey hex.  excited to get these.  could have used it today up on the mountain.
4 in black/grey hex.
to be 100% clear, i will be offering 9 choices as shown in the campaign. i refer to the hex patterns as "black/grey hex" and the dark camo as "grey camo".  if possible, please use that verbiage so i don't order more of a wrong style. thanks!
ordering 1 in all black
sounds good. i selected the pledge for 4 of them, and i'm after 4 blacks.
hey jon, good question. here's the facts. i ordered 10,000 magnets yesterday from texas and they shipped. i ordered the fabric (from pennsylvania) for all the styles weeks ago and that arrived in my sewers facility in green bay, wi last week.  i inspected it personally and approved.  i told them to wait to cut it in case i flop.  of course, i gave them the go ahead to cut yesterday. i will inspect on monday to ensure the cutting pattern is 100% and we will let 'er rip. they tell me that production in 4 weeks is no problem. we should have product by march if not earlier. this project is very simple but thankfully will have lots of backers, so i'm sticking with shipping sometime in march as my standard line. if the campaign blows through what that order consists of, i will place another batch and separate those backers if that has to occur. everyone.... if possible, please comment on what colors you **think** you would order....this will help me ensure color availability.
hello brian. you have march as a possible delivery date, do you believe that's an achievable shipping date? i'll be in the us between march and april so ideally i'd like it to be shipped to me there instead of here in australia to save money of course. thanks.
hi ricky, i do not recommend machine wash or dry (the magnets grab the machine).  a quick rinse in the sink with hand soap is what i do and let them hang dry, they dry very quickly due to the material. a number of my testers mentioned that and i agree.
are these weatherneck washable and fast dry instead of putting them in the dryer?
i use my fix it sticks every week, fantastic tools. but i'll be honest, even though the weatherneck looks spot on for my mountain motorbike riding, it was brians amusing email reply and even funnier video, regarding its suitability on a motorbike, that has me backing this project. funniest thing i've seen today. plus a great reward coming my way too. bonus.
i love my fix it sticks also and backed this without hesitation.  thanks for the high speed test video; i plan to use one of these while on my motorcycle.  hope you have funds left over to buy a new hat!
thank rkt88...yes if it appears there is demand for matching the middle i could move that way, but yes you rightly identified it would be more expensive to do, but those problems are solvable...i'll keep it in my mind as more feedback comes along. also, i won't say the weatherneck solves the fog issue. it doesn't eliminate it (not sure anything does or could)...but it does at least reduce that problem. thanks!
hi brian - for the tan and green camo colors, i think they would really benefit if the breathable area could also be tan.  the black strip creates a pretty contrasting shape that is less than ideal.  since those patterns have a common or near common color it could be shared by both of them.  i realize it is an additional cost/complication, but maybe if the numbers and interest justify it...?  having a facemask that doesnt fog the eye protection/sunglasses would be fantastic.  right now i use the old neoprene face mask with extra cut outs for the mouth, this looks like a far more useful and comfortable replacement.
thanks ian! thank you too michael, that comment means a lot to me. very much appreciated. well, that was a first day that i was not fully expecting. how cool. guess i'm not the only one that wants those things off my neck!  as many of you who backed me in the past know, i don't do many updates unless there is something of value to tell you. i will post one later today or tomorrow with a little test video we have planned for today.
congrats on meeting your goal so quickly.
my previous experiences with fix it sticks and the backbottle made it a very easy decision to back this project.
bit late for the uk winter :(    but then i guess that's kinda smart - after my ride this morning i couldn't turn this thing down.     also those 'chi-friendly' magnets sound pleasant :p
