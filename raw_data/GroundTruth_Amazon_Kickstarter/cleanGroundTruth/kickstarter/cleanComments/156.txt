i still have not received this. please refund me.
vivian, i have your address.  i'll ship out new pads for you.  please note, the phone must be between 45 and 55 degrees for it to adhere.  also, when you insert your phone, put a little pressure on the bottom face so the upper pad presses firmly against the glass screen.
thanks barry. how can i contact you for shipping for a thicker pad?
ok got it! it's on it's way. sorry for the misunderstanding, enjoy the product.
dear mr barry. i have send you email with my adress several times. but you don't answer there. i actually don't know we're i can give you my number so here it is. 004741658039. it was never my intention to be rude.
all international backers.  i cannot ship without a contact phone number. so please if you haven't received your rewards, make sure you check if you messaged me your phone number before leaving comments.  i don't understand why people insist on comments not messages.  it forces me not to be as personable as i would normally be.  sherko keeps asking me where his reward is but disregards my request for his phone number.  makes me look as if i'm ignoring him, which i would never do to my backers for helping me. thank you
hi i sent you my address and number on 16/11/2016. can you give me a update please. thanks
when will i recive mine?
vivian, the phone must be between 45 and 55 degrees.  if your using a thin case or if dash is 90 degrees the angle may not be correct.  i can send you a thicker pad to accommodate. lmk
not great. been using it for a month now. every bump and rattle throws my phone off and onto the floor.
i emailed you with my adress. were do you want me to send you my number?
i need your phone number.  all international backers, please make sure you message me your phone number for customs.  also anyone who submitted their survey later then august, please lmk, because your address info didn't make it when i imported all backers into shipping software. thanks
when will you send it to norway?
still not received.
kevin          this is your tracking info.  i'm not sure why you keep posting in the comments section.  i feel as your trying to discredit me among other backers.  i went above and beyond designing and making a special adapter for my backers with right hand drive vehicles.  this was not part of my obligation,  but should be an indication of my integrity.   my goal is to not only produce a great product,  but to make sure my customers experience is exceptional.    i thank you once again for your support and your reward should be delivered soon.  i have no control over this.  thanks for your understanding. barry tracking: lz617295835us location date local time description  united kingdom november 10, 2016 12:41:00 processed through facility  london, united kingdom november 6, 2016 09:51:00 departed  miami, united states november 5, 2016 20:16:00 departed  miami, united states november 5, 2016 10:02:00 arrived  isc miami fl (usps) november 5, 2016 07:49:00 processed through facility  miami, fl, 33112 november 4, 2016 16:41:00 departed usps facility  miami, fl, 33112 november 4, 2016 06:51:00 arrived at usps facility  miami, fl, 33152 november 4, 2016 05:40:00 departed usps facility  isc miami fl (usps) november 4, 2016 04:41:00 arrived at facility  jacksonville, fl, 32099 november 3, 2016 18:26:00 departed usps facility  jacksonville, fl, 32099 november 3, 2016 05:22:00 arrived at usps facility  west palm beach, fl, 33401 october 31, 2016 18:38:00 departed post office  west palm beach, fl, 33401 october 31, 2016 15:31:00 picked up

hi ..i have email you my detail to the email you given...any feedback?
i wanted to give my right hand drive backers a optional base.  i will ship yours on monday. thanks for your patience.
not received.
sherko, i sent you an email today requesting your address to ship.  if backers don't supply me with their shipping address, i can't ship! kickstarter does not supply this information to us automatically even though you may have entered it during your pledge process. please email me directly at gravityxinc@gmail.com with any issues.  these comments doesn't solve anything but make us look as if we don't respect our backers.  we appreciate all and would never not ship all rewards out.  international shipments are delayed due to our error in forecasting the costs, we will however ship every reward even at a loss to us. thanks for your understanding.
to all us backers.  all units were shipped in august to backers who submitted the surveys prior to august 16th.  any us backers who did not receive their rewards, please email me.  i do not always check this comment area.  as to sherko, i did not receive any emails from you.  i will reach out to you directly.  thanks again for all your support.
still waiting for mine? i have emailed you but you dont answer?
i haven't gotten mine yet. i'm in the u.s.
do us domestic backers need to send you our address in the proper layout as well?
also to all my international backers, can you plz provide your phone number,  customs require it.  thanks
sorry for the delays on the international shipping.  unfortunately the costs far exceed what we collected.  we will still honor all of our rewards.  the bulk of our inventory is due to arrive in 2 weeks.  i promise i will try my best to expedite.   i want to reiterate my appreciation to all my backers. thanks
i think its time to ask to cancel the order and payback. quit des pointed of your sorry to lat you wait policy.
good evening.  when will you be submitting the 20% backerclub.co discount/refund via paypal?
could you please tell me when you will be shipping my pledge?
can you please let me know the shipping status of my gravity x? many thanks  david
i am come from taiwan, my package not arrived.  can you please help check the package status and give me the tracking number.  thank you very much.
i haven't asked for anyone's address yet. i was waiting for inventory.  supply new address when i request it at the end of this month. thanks
hi barry, i'm moving to a new place right around mid august. should i still keep my current address or change it to the new one?
hey chad, final sample has been approved. just waiting for the production run due to be july 20th.  i'm arranging for air shipment from factory for my kickstater backers.  that should be under a week compared to sea shipment which will be 30days.  i would say probably you will receive product first week in august. thanks for your support.
any updates on expected delivery time? looking forward to seeing the final product.
yes, see attached.  looking good and on schedule.
any updates
yes, we made it. not a moment too soon. congrats!
@ greg: we'll make it
excited that we are headed to final cad drawings. does this mean the green light is lit. asking because it appears that we are still about 50% from our goal of $10,000.
early bird for 3 - $40 = $13.33 each early bird for 4 - $60 = $15.00 each even after factoring shipping, 3 is still the magic number.  you may need to look into adjusting the price for the early bird (4)
