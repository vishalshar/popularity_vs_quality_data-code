it's a year... not receive anything
no chatlight received here too...
we love our chatlight! do you mind sharing if you used one of the kickstarter promotion websites? we have just launched our very first project and are very skeptical about them. thanks!
my only negative feedback on these is how bulky the clip is. doesn't work well on my phone as it sits over the camera. other than that works great!
i still have not receive as well...
am i the only person who hasn't received their chatlight?
thanks for the light guys, it's awesome! having fun playing around with it. cheers and congrats!
@ r g: thank you! very glad that you are enjoying your chatlight!!
@ enrico c: great to hear!
got mine and it works great! thanks! will be a repeat backers for future projects.
you guys are truely amazing. its an honor being a backer. received the 2 units.. but most of all was really moved by your charming personal letter inside. i'm recommending chatlight to all my family, friends and co-workers. thank you!
@ sigmund & adam fidyke: wonderful!
got one of my two chatlights and it works great! thank you.
@ wendi forbes: shouldbe arriving any day now. thank you for your patience :)
wondering when deliveries will start in australia?
@ steve mebs: hi steve! so glad they arrived. please take a look at our youtube video for tips on how to make your chatlight fit on a large monitor: www.youtube.com/watchâ€¦
@ omair: hi! you should receive them any day now. email us at info@chatlight.com when they arrive or if you have not received them by the end of the week.
mine just arrived in canada, they're great! i didn't know that you could rotate the light at first, that's great. too bad it doesn't fit on an apple cinema display, it's just a tad too small. on an iphone 5s if you put it on all the way you can see the light in the video, but it's tight enough to slide up a little. it works well on the side of the phone as well. it works great on my computer in my office because i have a large window behind me that, without a chatlight, makes me look like i'm in a cave. with chatlight the video looks much nicer. great job guys. note for other international backers - i didn't receive any shipping or tracking info, they just showed up unannounced.
guys, australia here, any shipping estimate? not 2 weeks surely !
@ min je woo: hi min, please email us at info@chatlight with any concerns regarding shipping.
hi, anyone here in new york that did not receive the product?
@ lorenzo marion: hi lorenzo. thank you again for being an early $10 backer. please keep in mind that the light needs to be bright enough to make a difference and does have 2 settings. we are working on making some tips and hacks into a video that will be shared on our website. in the meanwhile, we will email you with some solutions that we have shared with others.
hi, just received mine a few days ago and been testing it. i agree with a lot of the comments here that chatlight leaves a lot to be desired. the biggest issue is the functionality - to get a good light when on video chat the light has to be shined directly on you, blinding you in the process. any other angles creates a shadow effect. disappointed and can't recommend this to my friends and family.
@ antonio fanna: shouldn't be much longer for international backers
@ aiki: we do not have tracking information as our local post office was overwhelmed with the number of packages, customs forms, you should expect delivery anytime in the next 2 weeks.
any tracking number? not yet received here in hong kong.
still haven't got it :(
@ geir eivind mork: hi geir. glad you received your light and are putting it to the test. we are going to email you with some solutions and some questions, particularly in regards to the flashing you mentioned which is most likely a recharging issue but we are happy to trouble shoot all you mentioned and offer some tips/hacks. as for colors, original silver is our number one seller (we sold out this weekend) but we do offer both black and white. cheers and keep an eye out for an email within the next 24 hours from the owners/creators.
beside the fact it is in tacky silver plastic (wrong decade for that), the build quality and finish was good and to my expectations. the clamp is sturdy, the movement of the light is sturdy. there aren't imperfections in the plastic and the joins is flush. so great job there. should have been in black or white instead of silver though.
got it today and well. the computer i intended it for had a monitor that was too deep to clamp on,  and on the brightest setting i looked like a ghost. the worst was yet to come - on the medium setting it flickered like i was watching myself on a tv that wasn't tuned in. i made a video to show the flickering: https://youtu.be/i0q3smdvfhq worked well on my tablet however and the image quality was great without any flickering, but i had a hard time looking at the screen because i was blinded by the light. will be going on a business trip next week, i'll apparently replace the grainy videochat i used to have with me wearing sunglasses.
@ jacob george: hi jacob. it looks like you are in dubai which means your order has recently been shipped. expect delivery in the next 2 weeks.
i have not received chat light. plz let me know the shipping status.
@ simon gray: hi simon, we will message you to confirm your shipping details. in the meanwhile, if you do not receive anything by week's end, please email us at info@chatlight.com
i haven't received anything yet - should i be worried
@ rob justice: hi rob, we will email you with some solutions and tips that should address your concerns. very sorry that your expectations were not met and hope that our tips will help.
not to poop on the celebration... buuut mine arrived over the weekend and i'm really disappointed in it. i was expecting a more professional lighting setup then a straight light shining at my face. maybe i set the wrong expectations for what this was going to be but i could have accomplished the same effect with a book light. sure, i can rotate the light so i can look like i'm telling a ghost story with a flashlight under my chin and i have two brightness settings so i can choose between washed out and slightly more washed out. but it doesn't seem like either of these features help me accomplish a lighting style that doesn't look like i strapped a bulb to the top of my camera. as an added bonus the edges of the chatlight are clearly visible around my camera so i give up real estate too.
@ jeffrey p.: thank you, jeff! enjoy!!
the lights are really well done.  you guys did a nice job with this campaign, and the product has turned out to be a wonderful product. thanks.
@ lisa wheeler-street: glad to hear it, lisa! enjoy!!
received mine today, love them!
@ mike dedmon: we tried sending an email again and wrote to you in the kickstarter messaging as well
@ henry geddes & ian sheill - thanks for the response. i'm hoping for some good options, but i haven't received an email from you guys.
@ matt stubblefield: hi matt, your chatlight should arrive soon. the usps was not able to generate individual tracking numbers due to the 1,000+ packages they processed for us. if you do not have it by monday, please reach out to us again.
hello, i guess i might have missed something.  was tracking info sent?  i haven't received my light yet and i am anxious.  thank you in advance for your prompt reply.
awesome, thanks for the quick reply. looking forward to receiving my chatlights!
@ mike dedmon: we have emailed you some viable ideas to address your concerns
just received my chatlights today! they look great and the lights are crazy bright (even on the low setting, as mike pointed out). haven't put them through their paces yet, but i did try using it with my phone and it works perfectly.
@ steve mebs: hi steve. the chatlights have all been dropped at the usps for processing. many usa backers have received theirs. i see that you are in canada and the international customs forms are being filled out now. the usps, who we are in touch with every day at this point, has given us a time line of mailing all internationals by monday and that those backers can expect arrival between 10 days to 3 weeks (some of our backers are in remote locations). i hope this information helps.
should everyone have received shipping info by now? i have not received anything yet.
well, i was so excited to receive my chatlight today. but, i'm so disappointed. it doesn't fit my imac 27" (late 2012) model. the curve of the back of the system causes the light to pitch forward and you can see the base of it in the video. plus, even on the lowest setting the light is blinding. i can't even look at my screen when it's on. the higher setting was crazy bright. i'm really so disappointed.
just got mine!
@ bitemyapple.co: thank you and enjoy!!!
got mine today... what a difference it makes... great job guys....
tracking number?
shipping is underway!! thank you all for your contributions to making chatlight a reality. without you all, we would not have made it this far.
the chatlights are in the air and on their way to us. as soon as they clear customs and arrive at our doorstep, we will send out an update and begin shipping.
my selfies need this now! lol  thanks for everything! i can't wait
adrian and all backers, we are expecting the chatlight to arrive this week and will begin shipping straight away. rest assured, we will be sending out an update the minute they arrive!
any dates on shipping? it has been a long time coming
i am excited.. winter is coming and a bright light is needed. waiting for the chatlight and with warm greetings from germany.  krimo ps: tell santa i wasn't naughty!
i needed to update the shipping address and so i edited it in the survey page. is that correct?
taking far too long
yes, we are very close to shipping. as soon as the chatlights arrive from the manufacturer, we will send an update. our shipping materials are all ready to go so as soon as they arrive, we will quickly send them out. thank you for your continued patience.
close to shipping yet?
still not shipped...disappointed
i am really looking forward to this.  because i live abroad, i am constantly skyping with friends and family back at home.  this will make things a lot better for me! i'm so excited
please update us on the status
almost a month since the last update..
would love to hear of any news, good or bad.  hope all is well.
how can i change my shipping address?
@antonio fanna, @yermom182, @florence yuen - the latest update was posted yesterday.  we are at the finish line and really appreciate your support and patience!  please email ian@chatlight.com or henry@chatlight.com with any questions or concerns.  thanks!
i think we would all appreciate some updates
please advise have these been sent out?
any new updates?
@isreal nahsohn - very welcome!  we are trying our very best to stay in touch, but we also have so much going on with the manufacturing to get this completed.  thank you for your loyalty and patience! @melissa "taser creeper" nicole - thank you for explaining this!  ;) @charley ravine - please email me at ian@chatlight.com if you still have questions about the survey. @douglas kirk - we will send an update shortly, but we are very close!!  should be receiving all the units in 2-3 weeks (hopefully closer to 2).  please keep in mind that we relay what we are told and unfortunately it isn't always as accurate as we would like it to be. thanks everyone!  any other questions, please email me at ian@chatlight.com.
any new news or updates?
hey charley, click on the campaign tab above, scroll to find the reward tier you picked (should be highlighted in green).  mine says at the bottom of the green box when the survey was sent, and what my response was.
just happened to look at comments and see some people referencing getting the survey.  i did not recieve a survey.  at least i don't remember seeing one and i can't find anything in my deleted emails.
just wanted to publicly thank you for responding to comments and keeping up the same communication going post campaign!  thank you!
hi adrian, we still haven't completely locked down the shipping date.  we are of course pushing the factory to move as quickly as possible, but at the same time, we want to make sure that there are no shortcuts taken.  we are hoping to have everything finalized towards the middle to end of july (which at this point is our expected shipping "time period").   as soon as we can give you a "date", we will!  thank you for your support and being patient with us!
hi timothy, we did receive your completed survey right away so thank you for being so prompt! we are currently waiting on an update from the factory. good news is that the molds are in production. however, this still does not afford us an actual shipping date. we will keep you all in the loop as information comes in and we get closer to completion.
shipping date?
hi.  i don't remember getting a survey.  i was wondering when we can expect shipment? thanks, tim
javier palenzuela, we will pm you. you can send updated information to us via kickstarter messaging. in terms of getting additional chatlights, please visit www.chatlight.com to order more as our kickstarter campaign has ended so it is not possible to add on here, but you can from our website. we hope that answers your question!
is it possible to have redo the survey? to add addons?
dennis ho, we did receive your survey back on april 4th. thank you for backing chatlight!
antonio fanna, everyone was sent a formal survey on april 2nd. in fact, yours was one of the first sent back to us completed! anyone who we have not heard from was contacted last week as a follow up. thank you!
krimo kae, we received your completed survey on april 4th. thank you!
@henry and @ian could you please check.. i dont remind me to fill in the survey. could please send me the survey again.
@min je woo   we had a couple week delay which will unfortunately delay our shipping date some.  we are still hoping that we will ship in june, but will only know for sure once we get a little further along in production.  we will keep you up to date!
is the shipping date still tentatively set for june?
hi all, we will be sending an update tomorrow.  more importantly, we would like to apologize to you as we have dropped the ball with our communication.  this is our first kickstarter project and we have worked so hard on working with the manufacturer to keep things moving that we neglected to post some updates.  that will not be the case going forward!  we really appreciate all of you being patient with us as we work to make chatlight the very best that it can be!  in the meantime, if you would like to reach out to either of us at any time to get any questions answered, we would love to hear from you! henry - henry@chatlight.com ian - ian@chatlight.com
i got the survey as well. as there are no real choices here, like colors sizes etc. the survey merely confirmed addresses etc. it was not the in depth type survey that many of us are used to. as far as the project being dead, it is a bit early to start putting nails in the coffin at this point. don't get me wrong, i don't like the lack of communication either but i am willing to give them a chance.
i got a survey 2 of april...
nobody seems to have received a formal survey. i guess michael kaandorp is right about the project being dead
i do not get any survey too, could u pls have a look too? many thanks!
so far - no survey received. could you please have a look.
considering i purchased 8 of these things, if i don't see any progress in the next week i'll just do a chargeback on my card
hi guys - i know we haven't received any updates, but we did receive the survey.  i realized it when i clicked on "campaign" and my looked at my highlighted backer tier.  it says "your response" and i saw that i had already put in my info.  address, phone, and name for the "thank you".
the last response is over a month ago. the project seems to be dead or has big communication issues. too bad...
no updates, no survey received.
has anyone received the survey?
any updates?
while we wait is there anyway you can show us actual pictures before/after of using the chatlight? thanks.
congratulations to dr. matt ferenc!! he is the winner of the chatlight raffle. we hope that he enjoys his brand new set of smart wireless muzik headhpones donated by jason hardi's muzikofficial!! we will be contacting you, dr. matt, for your shipping details.  thank you all for playing!
didn't manage to get a chatlight during our kickstarter campaign? please visit us at https://www.megafounder.com/chatlight to pre-order yours now. cheers!
the manage button takes me to an infinite loop not to my backer page, superextraearly2
@ isreal nahsohn: thank you isreal! it's celebration time here!
great job guys!  congrats on a super campaign
hi explaitten!  we miss you!  stop by! :)
earlybird1

superextraearly3 thanks for the extra bonus.
earlybird2
thanks. superextraearly7
got in late, but glad i did.  great communication and backer interactions.  17 hours left with an additional 34 pledgers since last update!
earlybird2
hi creeper. :d
earlybird2
as marv has asked- i too would love to see some photos taken using this light.  would like to use this to enhance some photography of food, indoors.  i don't always have the best natural light, and am hoping this will work out.
superextraearly1 thank you!
earlybird2

earlybird1
how long will the rechargeable battery last? and can it be replaced?
superextraearly
@ sharad mulchand: i will message you.
i am having trouble  changing the uperextraearly3 from the one i ordered. help!
great product and presentation. i wish i had this when i was promoting my kickstarter live now! :)
although i'll use the chatlight on my laptop and phone, my primary use case will probably be on top of my apple thunderbolt display. the top of the display is probably a bit too thick for the clamp on the chatlight; have you come across this issue in testing? do you have a recommended solution for using chatlight with thicker devices?
will you provide some actual comparison shots/photos? in the video the light seems sometimes rather harsh. what is the color temperature? in how many settings is the brightness variable? what is the lumen range?
@ douglas kirk: ï¿½ï¿½
funded! congrats! you guys rock!
really nice product! one question though, i'm currently using a thick protective case on my iphone and ipad, will that hinders me from using chatlight? what's the largest room allowed in the adjustable clip? thank you.
this is absolutely genius! i need it now!
@ mondeep: thank you! we agree!! looking forward to sharing chatlight with the world!
@ jonali das: thanks a ton! we appreciate you and all of our backers!
@ michael: it is our absolute pleasure! we are passionate about lighting and look forward to sharing chatlight with you and all of our backers!!
@ sondeep hazarika: thanks a million! we are in the home stretch.
my brother showed me this project and i immediately agreed to support you :) i love the whole idea of using this to be able to do facetimes at night. this will be a very useful product. good job and best wishes guys! i really hope your project gets funded.
this is perfect and exactly what i was looking for all these days. i do online classes and most of my classes are in the evening. this will certainly make things easier for me. very nice concept and i'm happy to contribute. thank you very much.
perfect accessory for my laptop to use at night. i would love to have one. i really hope this gets funded, good luck!
wow, this product looks to be very useful. lighting has always been an issue in selfies and video chat and this is what we need. very nice project.
thanks for the info: i've ordered my pair and recommended it to others. if you are shipping from inside the eu then customs isn't an issue and i won't require that bill i asked about. great!
super device! i like it! it will ake easy the life at nighttime and the night owls won't smash their heads against the wall.
i think this project is a really great idea. smartphones are able to create professional-grade photos now, so it makes sense to have portable photo-lighting tools to go with them. i've been doing my own professional photos for my business for ages now and could really benefit form something like this.
@ jorg mayer 1) the lighting is led 2) when using cl with an iphone, you can put the light on the top of your iphone or on the side of your phone.  using it on the side ensures that nothing gets covered up.  using it on the top may cover up the earpiece (where sound comes out of), but most likely you will be using it on speaker phone or with headphones since you will be holding it.  additionally, we are working on a feature that would allow you to flip cl over and set your phone in it.  this should be in place by the time our first batch is ready to ship. 3) chatlight can mount high enough on the top of your iphone so the light does not reflect into the camera. 4) we are planning to ship from eu to eu.  i am not 100% sure about how the bill will be placed on the package.  if this is a concern for you, i can dig deeper.  please email me at ian@chatlight.com with any additional questions. thanks!
very inventive, really like this idea!!! will spread the word
i love this idea and cannot wait to see it come "to light". great idea for us marketers who are always using video!
great accessory for my samsung galaxy s5 and ipad. let's keep the momentum going!
just a bunch of questions before i get my pair :-) sorry if i missed the information in the details section. - what type of light is this? led? - in the original video cl is shown with an iphone, where it covers the mic. there is a picture below that tries to "fix" this problem by what seems to be balancing cl on the phone. how useable is this solution ( i sometimes like to walk during calls)? - especially with the light colors: is any light reflected from the mount into the camera? i had that kind of problem with one of the protective casings on my previous phone when using flash. - do you know how to put a proper bill on the package when shipping to the eu? that might help me to not pay customs for the shipping as well as the product. thanks for a cool and useful tool.
@mark zumkeller yes, the light is aimable and you can point it to light up your laptop keyboard.
i never get the right light, looking forward to this.
so the light is aimable, right?  can it point down to light up my laptop keyboard?
i really hope this gets funded, good luck!
this looks like it would be really useful
awesome concept!  good lighting for video chats and recordings on a tablet or smartphones can be extremely challenging.
what a bright idea well done
@ luke bowes: thanks luke! you will not be disappointed. the chatlight will make a huge difference.
great idea! most of my video chats and skype calls take place in the night so would be nice to show my face other than a blurry black blob, same with selfies. this and a selfie stick...sorted! i have supported, shared and hope others do so also!
great idea! :)
hi my friends!!!!!!    hey.... usefull, very smart and creative idea. i wish your success!!!
this is such an amazing tool for online course creators and entrepreneurs. looks very light for travel too. happy to support this!
@ douglas kirk: yes, i will note your account now.  thank you for your continued support!
@ adam scull: thank you! glad you like it!!
hell yeah! im in! great great idea!
hey guys, i doubled my pledge to get two but left the shipping the same. does that work?
@ stephen mckenna: we agree! thank you for believing in us!
great idea, nice design too. i think this will be a hit!
@ ann: thank you! we saw the need too!
great idea, it is amazing that the tablet makers have not done this, very innovative.
@ tobias wilhelm: you will love it for video chatting with family! thanks for your support!!
@ backhills designs: thank you! you will love it!! spread the word, please:)
@ bruce: we agree! thank you for your support!!
@ james exmoor: thank you for your comments and support! fingers crossed for a successful campaign!!
@ darius: we think so too :)
@ dread knight: we feel the same way! thanks for your support!!
@ dianahh: thanks a million for your comments! spread the word, please :)
i like this concept. it is simple, sleek and solves a problem. it looks like it has great functionality and with the prevalence of video chat and photography it is certainly needed. i think this product will change the way we present in both our social interactions and our business ones. like all great ideas: simple and when you see it you wonder why it hasn't been thought of before.
great idea. everyone should support. good luck!
i am impressed! very smart and creative idea. can't wait to get one. i wish you the best of luck with your great campaign!
i always have dark circles around my eyes and have needed a chatlight for years!
simply brilliant idea! can not wait to use one of lights. most of my facetime is in the evenings and i so not like the amount of bright light required in the room to look like your not in a cave. this little solution with be great!
great idea! can not wait to get my hands on one of these for myself and my college daughter! good luck with your project!
i definitely need one of those for my relatives in germany. when we use facetime or other chats, and they sit outside with the 6 hours time difference, it is always dark, since they dont want to illuminate their porch like a football stadium:) with one of those, it would be great. i wish you the best of luck with the project, and hope that i can buy this soon.
this is such a great idea. i support your endeavor and wish to see this great project as completed. i always support people that do useful things. good luck!
just saw the chat light show up on backer club. everyone needs to share this project through social media sites and drive more interest. it's a cool project, totally useful and the prices are great!
will this fit properly on surface pro 3?
awesome idea! i have needed a chatlight for years!
