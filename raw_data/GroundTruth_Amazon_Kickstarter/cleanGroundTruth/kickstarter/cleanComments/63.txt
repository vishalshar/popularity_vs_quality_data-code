howard or whomever, i reached out via email regarding the misspelling of my name on the level i backed.  will someone please email or respond to me; i haven't heard a word?  thanks!
hi howard, same as mark a lowe in dec 19 comment and as already mentioned by email, i lost my digital copy of the album on my pc... any chance for me to re-download the album? thanks!
hi. after i download the album on to my hd i now find that due to a hd crash my album is gone. any chance of another link to enable me to re download the album.
here in canada, still no sign of package for a 350$ pledge. any way you can get in touch and assist? was hoping to get this for xmass.
i'm not sure if anyone else in canada had the same problem as me, but after about a month of inquiring it seems my package is somewhere in the ether. it was at the ny facility oct 21 and thats the last anyone knows. the tracking number i had wasn't an actual tracking number but rather a customs number or something so nobody at usps can help. the t-shirt would have been dope but at least i didn't go for the bigger money items. lesson learned.
i just received my sneaker head package in montreal. thanks everyone.
so any chance we'll get our stuff before 2017 or will all our other rewards continue to be held up waiting for 7"s and t-shirts?
@jordan & everone: if you're trying to figure out how to access your messages, please go to the kickstarter page (any page works), and click on the icon in the top-right (your image icon) to access your account info. click on "messages" on the left side of the window that pops up, under "my stuff". if you're trying to send us a message, click on "de la soul" in the header of the campaign page (under the green pre-order album button), then click "contact me".
@jordan: i'm sending you a message now.
howard, i received your message about the 7" records being delayed. i still feel like i received the wrong package, as the package that came, came with different contents for a package that is less than what i paid for. is there anyway to confirm you have me down for the ultimate vinyl head as opposed to the ultimate fan t-shirt package. i have no problem sending the items back, i am just a serious collector that needs that 7", and i don't want to get forgotten about when they come in and get shipped out. thanks. not sure how else to reach out to you guys, kickstarter provides no direct e-mail to correspond, which is frustrating.
hi guys, i've just messaged you. 10 weeks since album release still no sign of my $350 reward having left the us for uk shores. please get back to me asap...
package has arrived at last - thank you
got my reward last friday safe and sound. very pleased with it. thanks for all the hard work. i'll be backing the next one.
you guys sent me the wrong rewards package, i pledge for ultimate vynil head, and you sent me an ultimate fan t-shirt package. how do i proceed at this point? i can take photos etc. i just want that 7", i'll send the cd and shirt back, it's not even my size.
hey howard and the team, i pledged for the dls is dead 24x24 print. i still have not received it or an update of any sort. when can i expect it? should i expect it? any updates would be much appreciated.
thank you howard and de la. everything's fine. package arrived 3 days ago. great work.
thanks guys arrived today never been so proud to be part of something so fecking awesome! thank you xx
got my vinyl today thanks guys
@kevlar: the bonus track is "unfold"; track 16.
hey howard and all at team de la i just received my vinyl, and it pleases me for a number of reasons. firstly, kickstarter has fucked me over royally in general. i've done 6 including this one,none are ever completed on time,  i'm still waiting for 2 from 6 months plus before de la, and none have ever been as described. until now. the vinyl isn't the general cream one i had seen around, and it's not just a barley describable pen mark but signed with a proper message from de la. the t shirt is bright and awesome. all around greatness. finally, i didn't listen to the album until the vinyl arrived, so you can imagine the hype i was feeling. i wasn't disappointed, and lived up to the tracks i had heard on them radio. i look forward to hearing them on tour soon in the u.k., hint hint ;) i'm sorry for people who haven't received their packages or having issues, but i'm mo sorry to howard and the team for the bad vibes throughout the comments. as kickstarters go, this is one of the best informed i have been part of, and i never got the impression that the project wouldn't be fulfilled (looking at you james lavelle!!!) one quick, unimportant question. what happened to the kickstart only track? anyway, as i say, much love to all kev, london
i also never got a tracking number. thanks.
geraint: i sent you a message; your tracking number shows that it's currently in the uk.
hello, nearly a month on from last post and response still nothing received?! no tracking number, no pledge! wondering if it will ever arrive?! �
howard, any updates on the 'the da.i.s.y. head' package? i got my tracking number over a month ago, still no movement. really starting to be disappointed with this.
i was 17 or 18 the first time i heard de la and i remember thinking i am going to buy every single thing this band ever produces.  a few months later they were the first live band i ever went to see, twenty years later the same group of friends got together to go see them again. now 13 months late, after leaving tokyo 4 times and sitting in an airport 30 mins away for 4 days ( thanks usps) i finally have my package - the first cd i have bought for almost 10 years and a t-shirt that i will be proud to wear. for all those still waiting or with wrong packages, i feel for you  thanks de la thanks h
finally got my package today, vinyl, cd and shirt. thanks for all the hard work but maybe next time add a little more packaging protection, the vinyl cover got some dents in the corner....
received the ultimate fan package today but it's missing the cd. what can be done to claim one? or are these being sent out separately?
this is likely a long shot but hey, what the heck - the t-shirt i ordered was the wrong size. ordered a medium but actually need a small. is there any way i can get it switched? i realize this is a crazy question seeing as there are mad issues with people receiving their packages but i gotta ask. i will gladly pay what i have to pay to make this happen (within reason of course). i also put this out to any one of the backers out there! anyone want to swap a small size t-shirt for a medium?
so nobody should hear an album this great just because a few packages were shipped out late and the whole planet should wait? seems a touch selfish alice. the fact the album is out so that we can bask in it should be the only reward that matters.
also as a side note, i agree with one of the backers below - the release date should have been pushed back so the backers either got their rewards just before or on the day of release
have received notification from usps that it's at their ny facility - hope there's no further delay now
my package actually arrived today, yay! :)
packages are being sent out daily, with another large batch scheduled for pickup today. as i previously stated, we had run into labeling issues, which explains why a couple backers have received incorrect rewards; we thought we caught all of the issues, but clearly missed two. i've been answering each of the inquiries directly, which is why you haven't seen anything from me here. - h.
still waiting here too (uk), have the usps message from 15th september, but nothing more.  howard keeps making me promises, but still nothing, come on please sort it out!
hello. by seeing the top two comments, this doesn't look good... obviously, i've been waiting like everybody else. but to be waiting 2 months after release is absolutely ridiculous! when you guys give excuses like: "it's only a couple guys on shipping" "we didn't know how much work this was" all of this should of been figured out during the 1.5 year we waited for the release date. if you couldn't live up to shipping on time, why not push the release date a couple months, since we paid for this project. we (the backers) should have been the first ones with the album. to my reward: i see one guy below my comment has received his and it isn't right... i truly hope after waiting this long for this package, it isn't wrong. please let me know when i can receive this. as i am also seeing the same message: pre-shipment info sent to usps, usps awaiting item thank you.
hi there! just wanted to check in as i received a tracking number for 9/17 but haven't seen any activity on it. this is frustrating as i come home each day hoping that my packages get delivered. i have refrained from downloading the album in hopes to hear it on vinyl ($250 level), but given the delays i'm might give up on that thought. any updates would be awesome.
got the package finally but all is wrong - the vinyl is clear and not the green colour it should be. it's not autographed.  no cd either. i waited all this time for the totally wrong goods. i know there's probably nothing i can do but like i said before 150 is a lot of money to some of us.   the least i expected was what i ordered.
hi guys, any news on my package - no ups as yet.  awesome album!
still no word about my package either - usps # given was from september 17 and no movement since.
still no tracking number and it says "collected" what the actual fuck
hi guys- got my pledge today- so many thanks. record sounds great.
is there anyway to put this album in my itunes?
another week passes... any more updates?
sorry for the delayed response; please read the latest update if you haven't, already: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1701448
hi guys, same as jenny - im in australia and i have the same issue, tracking info is shown for the trip all the way to sydney (aus) but then no movement since the 27th. i can't lodge an enquiry with usps either :(
hey guys! my tracking has not moved since september 27, can you please help me contact ups?!
hey guys, thanks for the cool mase usb stick and of course the album! just want to say that it is great to see the project come to fruition. this is the only kickstarter i have been involved in and it is not to get a trinket, but to support you on your musical journey. the number of times i have received pleasure in listening to your albums and songs in the past more than makes up for any delays in allowing you to achieve your vision. for any of the other supporters who are still waiting for your goodie bag, please take a minute and throw on buhloone mindstate for a little bit and chill. progress doesn't work like a light switch.
arrived safe & sound !!! vibes :d alex - italy
hey german backers… anyone received a ultimate fan package? still waiting here patiently… but to be honest... i´m about to get p…ssed off! tracking number says pre-shipment info sent to usps on september 17… hui... so dls, what´s up? die entdeckung der langsamkeit, or what? any kind of update would be nice...
also looking for an update. i know you said pledges over $150 were next, but any idea when? i haven't received any tracking, messages, nothing about this. just looking for an update.
still waiting patiently but no sign or tracking details. anyone else in uk with same problems.
same as mike, i am in the uk, but no tracking info on the usps site yet :(
got tracking info sept 15th no news of when package will arrive yet
hi, i've checked my ups tracking number and it appears that they have not received a package yet.  is their a way to contact someone to check on this?  thank-you!
hi, i have received one of two rewards. the second of which says it still hasn't arrived at the distribution centre when it was due on the 17th september. the details are below - can you check for me what's going on? https://www.usps.com/ lz609823748us
hi - my lp arrived today (canada). just wanted to say thanks for all the effort that went into this. it's really appreciated and i'm happy i could help make this album happen. it must be so difficult to get all these negative comments, but just let that slide. people are so concerned about the me factor, they loose sight that backing an album is different then just going to the store to buy one. it's a great album and you did a great job getting it to the people. thank you!
i'm in the uk and got mine this morning, so it should be any time now for others.
am in the uk and got my cd this morning :)
question for uk backers (if you've received your physical item).  my item has been in transit from london since last saturday. if you followed the tracking how long did yours take for delivery?
received the package. cologne (germany) is happy!
i've been looking everywhere, but can't find the answer. i just saw that de la soul added a concert date friday in scottsdale. it's been a life one dream to see them. i can't find what time they take the stage. anyone out there know?
the package with the bonus rewards arrived in very good shape today. thank you so much. =d
got my cd today here in the netherlands , thank you howard
arrived today.  signed color lp set, shirt, and cd.  all in great shape.  lovin' my de la groove.  thank you, pos, dave, mase, and the kickstarter crew.
rob - i ordered the same and did get the cd in the package.
i got my package today, awesome! i ordered the ultimate fan package, but did not get the cd, are you guys shipping them out separately?
(uk). dispatched email received and it's the uk and on route to me should receive it tomorrow. #excited.
poster sucks. it's like 11x17 and small and lame. $70 for a flyer, it ain't a poster. album is good but like you guys say you ain't know what to expect, but you been making albums for like 20 years. gtfoh. i'm unhappy with the rewards. shouldn't have backed when you said you gonna put an album out in like a month. plus you sampled james brown and other people but supposedly you weren't sampling anyone. which is it? de la? it's an industry album. congratulations, you just played yourself!
my vinyl just arrived!!!!
guys we need a good de la autobiography, loved the documentary, but it's too short to tell the full story. would be a great kickstarter project! be happy to write it too � how can we get the band onto later with jools holland when you next come to the uk? would love to see lord intended or snoopies live on bbc2! have a good saturday, saturday, saturday, its a saturday... �
have to say am loving the album, such a cool overall sound and feel. the important thing is that it is fresh. breaking new ground there, nice one guys. can't wait for the cd to arrive. be patient people, crowd funding is often not smooth sailing. you got the music which is what counts. peace.
it's all good. even if there are no "physical" rewards, the real reward is in knowing we played part in helping de la put out another album. i, for one, feel pretty good about that.
very disappointed - still waiting for me package to arrive - went into local record store yesterday and this cd was sitting on the shelf. shouldn't the fans who backed this kickstarter effort recieve this before everyone else?
did you send it already to europe
still waiting where is my reward
we be kickstartin,  here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes  the pile of revenue i create  but i guess i don't get my reward cuz my lp's a year late.
all of us who paid for you to make this album are still waiting for our copy. meanwhile everyone who did not financially back you get their copy off the shelf with no problems. you have f***ed your true fans over with this campaign. kickstarter backers should have been rewarded before everyone else. what you have done is tantamount to obtaining money by deception. so many promises, turned out to be lipservice to the people who believed in you enough to help you out. turns out the daisy age is truly dead.
still no sign of the album that i have been waiting for for way over a year, funded on the assumption that backers get it first, yet copies have been available in the shops for a more than a month now,  and at a fraction of the price. i understand there are logistics and inevitable delays,  but come on! this is quite frankly taking the piss.
i agree, backers should have received the product on or before the release date.   please share some updates.
i do know that this comment wont help anyone of the complainers, but : ... ... the delays that are happening with the delivery of the physical rewards right at the moment are just usual with international projects like this and could have been expected by everyone who participated with this project in the first place, before backing... i m just wondering where all the patience has gone nowadays. :) i havent seen my rewards yet either, and i still expect it to take quite a lot of time to travel around the world and through our customs =p. now the important message of all this : i dont care about it how long its going to take ... the physical copies always end up in the record shelf of mine after some time ... ... the essential thing is, that we made it possible for them to release such a great album at all. ... and what tha hell, the digital copies travel along with myself all day long on my digital devices for a couple of weeks already. thanks for reading this ...
hi, any update on the international shipments of the cd's? i've seen some vinyl updates but anything about cd copies? thanks!
i and many, many others are still waiting on a delivery status update on our physical rewards, and we want our physical rewards now - not over three weeks after the worldwide release date of the lp. i've read several messages and responses explaining that there are limited resources and a only small team working on this rather than a larger team of professional distributors. i've read that you don't have the resources anywhere near large corporations that have full-time, fully staffed fulfilment teams, and there aren't unlimited funds available to resolve the issue and throw at the problem.  but - the kickstarter campaign reached double its financial target, and the album is selling exceptionally well, particularly for an independent release, therefore there must be more than enough funds available to now invest back into getting the distribution of the remaining rewards distributed by a professional logistics company with enough staff to fulfil the demand. the fulfilment process is a big and challenging one, however it is one that should have been fully realised and acknowledged the moment you know that 11,000-plus products would have to be distributed worldwide. financial investment should now be extracted from the sales of this album and put into funding a professional company and staff to have the physical products sent out by the end of the working week at the most. there must be more than enough funds available to organise payment to a logistics and shipping company that can provide a service that gets the remaining products out at the earliest opportunity. no more excuses please! over $600,000 was pledged and it appears from this update that the album has sold remarkably well. some money and financial investment has to be taken from the sales profit of the album and put back into appeasing the thousands of dissatisfied fans who backed the project and made it happen.
any update on when the signed vinyl/cd/shirt packs are getting shipped out? it's going on three weeks now if i'm not mistaken since the release date. a bit frustrating when other folks have received vinyl orders, yet folks that paid for the signed merchandise haven't yet.
is there any tracking info?  i haven't received anything yet.
ian: i commented this below - your copy of the vinyl is custom pressed, and is notably different from what you can find in stores. additionally, the generic, retail units were handled by our distributor who has teams of full-time employees, worldwide. our team, on the other hand, is very small. we're doing our best to get it out, but it's a pretty significant undertaking. daniel: we're getting close to getting the remaining items shipped out. you should see something, soon.
seriously, where is my vinyl? every man & his dog has their vinyl now, i see stacks of them in record stores and friends who didn't back it are happily spinning theirs right now! nothing for backers who made this whole venture possible. album came out 3 weeks ago...... come on guys.
i am a backer and have seen nothing about the shipping of the artwork.  de la print:  you get an amazing de la soul print, designed by artist dan lish (available only via this kickstarter). when will these be shipped please. thank you.
vanessa: please check #4 here - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542
hi, i am a backer and should have received the download link for the digital album. i have the email from august 24th with an instrumental version and saying that the link will be sent the next day, but i don't have anything from the 25th. can the link be resent to me?
alessandro: please check #4 in the following link - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542. rachel: i will be posting updates as we ship each reward.
hey- i'm in no rush, but i was wondering if there would be tracking info sent when our rewards go out. i'd just like to know when to expect it to be left on my front porch. could you possibly send updates about which rewards have and have not gone out so people can be on the lookout?  thanks! and congrats! the album is just incredible. well worth the wait.
i haven't received a mail with the download link and code. what should i do? i checked in my spam mail as well alex
eddie: your copy of the vinyl is custom pressed, and is notably different from what you can find in stores. additionally, the generic, retail units were handled by our distributor who has teams of full-time employees, worldwide. our team, on the other hand, is very small. we're doing our best to get it out, but it's a pretty significant undertaking. gigi: you should've received the digital download. please refer to #4 here - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542…
so.... i am really happy for you guys but i still can't figure how in fuck name every slag and their cunt has this album except me. i've put 3 x times the money it cost to buy this shit in a store and like some fuckin idiot i'm still waiting. how the fuck is that possible, please explain. some cunt fuck store has the 20 copies of the album, and i the core investor gets fuck all. actually i was sent a download code. thanks. not what i paid for. where the fuck is my album and how is it everyone else got the album before me. that's the bit the burns me the most.
i fucking love this album and so glad you did this on kickstarter. i remember buying "3 ft high and rising" in high school on cassette and i feel as good about this album as i did that one. kudos and thank you!!
hello there, first off...congrats on all the accolades you all have been getting. you rock!  i did bet my vinyl, which my son has stolen from me. did not get a digital code though. is that coming?
hello, will there be tracking information sent? waiting for the signed lp. currently listening to a payed copy of the vinyl from amazon. please let me know. thank you for your time. best, nigel
*edit. i have no problem waiting....
i have problem waiting for the album to be done! i would rather wait longer and have what the artist intended.now that the album is out however, if i didn't back this i would be already spinning the vinyl weeks ago. still waiting. ps i love the album.
hi matthew & everyone: sorry about the delays; we hit a few bumps in the road. we're working hard to get back on track, and we're getting really close to getting the remaining rewards out. please continue to hang tight; we're also anxious to get this stuff sent. i'm awaiting information so i can post an update, soon.
hi howard, just wondering if you have any update for international backers? even if it's a suggested timescale to commence dispatching would be most appreciated. thanking you in advance
album is simply awesome, thank you guys.  i have loved hip hop forever but also love well produced music from artists who love what they do and you can hear this on every track.  cannot stop listening to it - wish you got a bit of mf doom in there but that is my only wish! much love and thanks
pablo: i see i already messaged you. did you see it, yet? click on your icon in the top-right, and go to "messages".
pablo: i'm sending you a message, now.
hi howard, there's no code yet. i've just reset my email from kickstarter, could you try again please?
to let those wondering- i did the safest thing and clicked the download link on a wired pc (safer than wi-fi as more stable connection). used firefox. worked first time and got all three versions no problem. (this ain't a gloat attempt, honest!) thanks to the team and thanks for all your hard work on this howard. don't take the moaning to heart :)
hello. i'm curious to know if the signed vinyls have shipped yet, or an eta. pledged for this a year and a half ago and am just dying to finally get my hands on it! it's in stores and in the hands of backers that paid a lot less than i did. that does sting a little!
pablo: i'm sending you a message now. - howard
hi de la web master, i sent howard an e-mail yesterday via posdavemase@gmail.com and he told me the following: "please login to kickstarter and leave a message in the comments of the link below. from there, i will send you a download code using the kickstarter system, so you'll be able to see the message on the site if it fails to go to your email address."  so that's what i am doing. thanks in advance! pablo.
sam: i'm sending you a message now.
my download failed halfway through the process. how do i get a new link to download the album?
daniel: i'm sending you a message. jumpsaround & walter: please confirm that you've tried step #4 in the following link - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542
oh and need my dl link. peace.
all sorted - thanks for the really prompt reply.  now looking forward to listening to it
haven't received my digital code yet for my pledge so i'm just listening to the album on youtube. sounds so good though!
fuckin' good job guys, it sounds incredible!
my vinyl came severely damaged. cracked on edge. both disks. how do i deal with getting a replacement?
ewan: did you check #4 here? https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542
i need a download link or something? been listening on youtube... my ears want high quality
tom: no worries; i definitely needed to know. i'm sending you a message. thanks! lenon: i'm sending you a message.
another "did not receive a download link" as well - i know you'll be busy but just need to let you know so it can be sorted. cheers!
hey all. i'm sorry to post this but after i was finally able to get the download to work, the files seems to have problems. the songs reboot my iphone whenever i try to play them. all other music i try is fine.
kdj: please confirm you've tried step #4 here - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542. fred: i sent you a message.
did not recive my download link
hey guys, big fomo right now since i never received a download link either! hit me up please - you're the only project i've ever back on kickstarter!!
is it possible to provide a european delivery update please (i pledged a vinyl reward and live in the uk). there's an update on us delivery - where's the european and / or rest of the world update please? it would be much appreciated. yours, a dedicated and patiently waiting de la fan!
"i am"  pleased ;)  that is i am i be pleased, dig!
nice work fellas, i very pleased overall!
any eta on when we might get wavs? thanks. ps- album is great!! only thing i've listened to all week. great work by all involved!!
i seem to be having problems downloading the explicit and instrumental versions of the album. howard kindly resent me the codes as we had a power cut mid download. but for some reason those two downloads don't seem to happen? now i can't use the codes as i've attempted to use them to download the tracks :( i'm using firefox. anyone else had this problem?
when i put my cd in my computer to load into itunes, it doesn't recognize it to load track names. has it been added the the cddb track name database?
yo, i want to give a shoutout to bob power and anyone else who worked the boards on this project. sonicly, this album is butter to my ears. i have not encountered a hip-hop album that carried a sound like the anonymous nobody. ever. and i wish i could've witnessed some of those jam sessions. ...this album is great on so many levels. peace.
justin: it's track #16 - unfold. thomas: did you check #4 above?
hey guys, i never received my download link. please advise.
congratulations on this fabulous milestone. this album was well worth the wait!  de la to the fullest!  i been rockin' with the plugs since my junior year in high school in 1988.  what a journey...not many things make me fill special the way i did when i first heard '3 feet high and rising' back then.  this project did!  'and the anonymous nobody' proves that when you fuck with de la you're fucking with the best.  peace.
what happened to the bonus track?
dj: i sent you a message.
s yazdanfar: i've sent you a message. nicholas: it's too late for any kickstarter rewards. thanks for the messages, but please comment on any technical issues (including failed downloads) in the troubleshooting update - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542.
hey dls. i never received a link from info@cashmusic...  super huge congrats to you guys for completing this project.
love the album! any chance i can purchase one of the extra vinyls and get an autograph? @dalasoul?
congrats on an awesome album, yes album, i got the physical vinyl yesterday and it sounds great!! secondly i hope it breaks into the top 10 tomorrow!!! this has been a cool process to be a part of and i am happy to support such talented and hard working creative musicians. as a documentary editor i also want to say that the short film you put out is really really well done and and great insight to the work you've put in!! peace.
first of all, congratulations on wrapping up this project. it's been great to back one of my all-time favorite bands, and i look forward to listening to the cd 300 times.  i am having trouble downloading, regardless of the browser, and appreciate any suggestions. i get an error that says "this site can’t be reached...mandrillapp.com’s server dns address could not be found"
i got my mase flash drive a few days ago and it was physically just as shown and described in the campaign.  i haven't plugged it in or listened to it yet ......lbut i am commenting to say that i am very satisfied in advance.  i had no problem with the wait, i just felt i backed the right reward and knew it would get here.  now i'm just waiting for the right occasion to sit down and really listen to the album, i hope the vibe takes me back to the mid 90's when i was in college and my brother had some of de la's cd's.  thanks guys!!
just love the album gentlemen.  so happy i played a small role in lending support.  greyhound and drawn particularly are masterpieces.  thank you!
howard, thanks for all you have done!
please use the following link for technical issues, first: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542

nikki: please check the older updates; they were mailed last week. m marjanovic: i'll message you directly.
hi! i wanted to check on the mailing? i was supposed to get the  plug one (posdnuos) 1gb usb thumb drive pre-loaded with a digital copy of the album + additional bonus track. have they been mailed yet?
great album. truly blowing my mind. got my vinyl (with the extra track) and the shirt. thank you for all of your hard work.
howard and crew: i got my dan lish de la print - yeah! - but it's got all kinds of nasty creases through it.  maybe it got caught in the printer?  (the rolling machine?)  it's really in bad shape.  (the mailing tube is solid, so it must have happened before it got mailed.)  can you guys send me a non-creased replacement, please?
wuttup howard!  have the tracks on the ks-only 45 been released?  just curious!  thanks, can't wait.
patrick: check #3 here - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542
so i got my usb drive with the album and when i load it into itunes it seems to work fine with no problems at all.  when i add it to my iphone however it only plays 5-10 seconds and then crashes the music app.  anyone else having this problem have a solution?  this has never happened to me before.
the album is great so happy and excited for you guys and fans too.  i know you guys are in the midst of delivering items to us kickstarter backers, but is it possible to order another de la drive? i'd like a whole set and everyone that sees mine wants one!  thanks again and continued success.
want my signd vinyl and cd and shirt cant wait  gent belgium europe
still waiting
got mah cd
thanks for all the hard work howard and team. thrilled to have a new de la soul album and to have helped make it happen. they've meant so much to me for so long and we're all better off hearing more of what they have to say. peace!
all good!
rocco: please refer to #4 in this update - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542
the email i got just has links to streaming services.
hernan: i sent you a message.
hi howard, i need to download the instrumental! i missed it :(  how do i do???
this album is amazing, i cant stop listening to it ... ^^ do you guys remember me saying "just take your time to make it another masterpiece" at the beginning ? honestly i think you guys did it ! thanks to everyone involved into this, the other backers, the whole team behind the scenes, all the co-artists on the album and of course de la soul =) hope to hear from you soon...
i was able to download it, a truly superlative album. thanks howard and de la for bringing it to us!
hi howard, thanks for all the hard work on this project.  can you resend my email with the download link? i can't find it. (i checked my spam folder already.) thanks again!
howard:  thanks for all of your hard work.   plugs 1, 2 & 3:  thanks for the great album!
howard: new download link you sent worked like a charm! no problems, fast and easy download.  thanks for the speedy reply!
such a great album and can't stop listening to it! you guys need to tour please! houston tx !!
omg just got my pos usb and it is awesome. super worth the wait. great usb and great album guys. kudos and applause.
i'm not sure who was complaining. i backed this album not with a specific date in mind, but to support the art and culture.  de la soul has given me life ever since stakes is high, so it was a no-brainer on backing this, and i'm not concerned if things got delayed.  you guys did a great job; i'd back this again with no question.
the entire process has gone extremely smooth with constant updates.  very satisfied thus far and can't wait for my physical product to arrive.  thank you howard, de la and the entire team.   great job
eric & nikki: i've sent you a message.
who do i need to talk to for the download code?  i got an email saying they were being sent out... and then i see comments about how awesome the album is. wtf?
it was well worth the wait, howard. all of you all did spectacular job with this project and i'm highly satisfied with the whole thing. i'm glad i could be a part of it.
have all the download links gone out? i have been checking and have not received one yet.  i know things are crazy, so i apologize if i am jumping the gun.   thank you.
speaking as a veteran backer, this project went over pretty well and is one of the quickest projects i have backed, so far.  for those who were beefing over the "long" wait, you have no idea about waiting...  try 2.5 years and getting an item that didn't work (and no support from the fly-by-night company that started and failed out the gate), or try four years and still nothing (including very little communication) from the project.  nope, you didn't have to suffer those irritations with this project.  just a slight wait for a great album and there was communication when it was needed.  thanks to all (fellow backers, de la, howard and the project team) for making this a reality!
howard et al, loving the album, loving the way the campaign was handled! can't wait till i'm finally holding the vinyl copy in my hand. that said, the download of the album has failed on my end and i'm receiving an error code right now, could you please re-send the download link pour moi? error code received; error> code>accessdeniedcode> message>request has expiredmessage> expires>2016-08-28t06:52:41zexpires> grtz, ralph
thank you howard. the album is the bombay!  please let me know if i can help with  my time and organization skills. i am a project manager by trade and would love to volunteer for something i love.
thank you de la and the team.  great album, what a project!  thanks for keeping us updated along the way, ignore the haters.  it's so funny how some people think kickstarter is a shopping site (i pay, you deliver).  we came here to support your project and anyone who's worked on big projects will know that they never go exactly to plan.  but you guys have delivered, great effort...  thanks again, much love!
love the record and seriously, f*** the haters if they're going to hate on this campaign.  it was awesome and i'm proud to have been a part of it.  thanks howard!
howard, i've donated to a bunch of kickstarter campaigns and this one was run very smoothly and professionally. you guys were very transparent and communicative. you should feel very proud about what you guys accomplished!
dear current hip hop artists please purchase this album and take note what the art of hip hop is all about!!!  hip hop had been missing this type of music for years.  i'm glad to be a backer of such a great project. thanks de la great album i needed this in my life.    :)
howard, i'd like to send a 'thank you' for your co-management of this campaign. i had my impatient moments, but flaws and all, i think things were handled well. and as for the project, i'm more-than-pleased. perhaps some backers expected a typical boom bap/beats and rhymes album, but dah well. from what i've seen, the love is outweighing the nagging. peace to everyone who had a hand in making magic happen. <3
i am really proud of this album. great work de la and crew. i can't stop listening. thanks for keeping up to date howard. people that are bitching are not true fans. people dising the album are not true fans of hip hop. this is album is a gem.
aà a fellow kickstarter and a backer i think this whole process went well. i even took the time to do a video to personally thank the crew: https://m.youtube.com/watch… i thanked you there and i'm thanking you here. there isn't a need for an apology. the album is dope and most don't understand how hard is it to account for shipping costs.  great job!
hope howard is ok �
the goal was always to put together a great product. you have done that. stop apologizing. it's giving the haters a reason to hate. kickstarting a project comes with risks and challenges. one of those risks is there's a chance the product won't even make it. the album is done and the rewards are going out. if de la soul ends up making some money out of the deal too, then bonus. kickstarting a project also means you have to go with the ups and downs of starting something from scratch and then completing it. in the words of de la soul. "yeah. aheegaheegaheegi. i can't see another." great job guys. thanks for following through.
the album is supreme! great music and great work everyone! thank you! :) one quick question, i was hoping to get the album in a lossless format like flac. is that possible? again howard, de la, and the rest of the team. thank you!!! :)
michael: i don't believe your grapevine is more connected to the situation than my team, and i assure you that your information isn't accurate. i know there's nothing i can say to change your mind, but i think you should try to remember what the campaign is/was about: it's not a "service", it's a support & backing of a project to make it a reality. in return for your backing, you'll be receiving special items.  i'm sorry you're unhappy, but i know we tried our best to deliver a quality product.
not sure why i hate this album - i think because of the mayn false promises that were made.  these folks made way more money than they needed and took a vacation as i have heard through the grapevine.  money donated is money paid for a service, and you all took advantage of that not after the fact as most folks would have, but rather prior. i see who you all are.  no longer my heroes but definitely worthy of your trump vote, because that is how you acted fools.
hi. i have not received a link.
de laaaa. . . ooh, la  - la la la laaa! smashed it! but those of us who know you from first time round always knew you had much more music in you. welcome home. well done everyone..  i'm proud to have instantly hit the pledge button and become an anonymous nobody. p.s. howard <3 blow it off bruv x
howard - haters are always gonna bitch. not sure what people were expecting given that a product would come out - whether it was on time or late. the most important thing is an artist delivering something they believe in and if it took more time, the people backing it should understand. otherwise, they shouldn't pony up the coin. it's just that simple. i have to believe that most of the other backers feel the same way as you. we backed it for the love of dela, the love of hip hop, and the love for someone/people making art.  i don't really get the hate. nothing or no one is perfect. thanks, howard. love the album and appreciate the work.  in response to people bitching, in the words of marley marl - "so put a quarter in your ass, 'cause you played yourself.". :-) peace and love!
mailman just rang the bell-- ran top speed down the steps and there is was, man it's a beautiful day--good looking out howard!
brilliant album, you've all done a top job....... especially you howard...peace x
downloaded all 3 album versions today and found the cd and tee in the mailbox too! thank you for all the hard work, it shows and is appreciated!
top work and thanks to howard and the team. love the project, love the album & love de la
thanks to all involved. the ep and singles along their way were the perfect way to keep us involved through the production and the three versions of the album are an awesome bonus. and then there's the amazing final result that was worth every minute of the wait. the boys delivered. thanks to all involved
this album is an instant classic.  best hip hop that i've heard in years.  and the instrumentals are awesome!  thank you
unfortunately i haven't received a download link.  i know you're being slammed but can you add me to the list of new code recipients.  appreciate it.  thanks for working so hard for us!
dls thanks for blessing the masses with this album and thanks for allowing the faceless to help with the funding ! with that being said...hopefully with all that music you guys able to acquire "legally" over the years you could drop another album sooner than later! yeah i know the album just dropped yesterday but i am a de la soul addict...and i don't want no rehab!!!! peace.
have been listening to the album all day long now since my last post on here. ^^ (it always takes a bit of time for me to get into the flow and lyrics of every song.) to sum it up somehow : just a freaking awesome album you ve created there. rock on de la soul ! so proud beeing a small part of it. =p and thanks to the whole team who made this album possible. bye bye =)
hi guys.. i downloaded okay on linux with firefox yesterday. i have abp and ns.. but had both globally disabled, just in case there's a js that would need download from 3rd place and mess up my download.. all good.. *listening*.. :d way to go de la soul!
loving this album. like nothing else out there. never would have made it through a major label process, right?
i'm so excited that i received the usb drives in the mail today!  i can't wait to start using them and listening to the music.  thank you for letting all of us be a part of your process!!!!
howard! you are a hero, man! appreciate the hard work you've put in hooking us all up!
this was so worth the wait. phenomenal album. can't stop listening. won't stop listening. can't wait for the vinyl to come.  i have something coming from nj. hoping that's it.
note: please refer to the following update for any technical issues with the download - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542
the album is phenomenal. working through it for the third time now. a lossless option would be great...
hey guys, my link started to download buy i guess the connection went down because i got a timed out error. now the link says it's expired. tried in chrome, safari & firefox.  streaming in apple music in the meantime. love it!
i'm enjoying the album a lot, would be super duper if there was a flac download option though :)
kickstarter bonus track = unfold (correct me if i'm wrong) ("full house - jacks & fives - motown")
do a search for info@cashmusic.org. it should show up.
heeeelp! i don't see an email to download the album! who should i be receiving the email from again?
hey, i just got your email and tried new link & code, it worked!!!!  thank you:)
i was downloading the versions of the album (can't wait to blast it through my stereo) sadly, like other comments i've read, my internet connection died so the explict album didn't download and now my link has expired.  cheers.
you guys... you always come through... lay down the thickest shit.  going to take me weeks to wrap my head around this cd, so many levels, feelings... so sick.  thank you so much for making music an art again.  peace from the daisy age
got my cd and shirt in the mail today! excited to listen to the album. only one thing is that my jewel case came cracked . :( might want to pack it better then just wrapping a tshirt around it .
amazing album. so happy to have another de la soul joint. hopefully you include australia in your tour next year.
here's a review i did if you're interested.  love it!  https://esoligh.wordpress.com/2016/08/26/my-journey-through-de-la-soul-and-the-anonymous-nobody-by-esoligh/  :)
hi howard, thank you for coming back to me but you re sent the link to the trouble shooting ( https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542) which i who'll like to try but unfortunately, the link sent from initial email sent with cash music, the one time link to get to the download page, it is not working anymore, says it is expired, i need that one to be re sent. thank you
de la soul! awesome job guys.  the album is great. thanks.
hi there, i received the email to download the album. i tried on a windows system, it downloaded the zip files. zip files unpacked to mp3 but then they would not play. i wanted to re try download now on a mac, but the link is not valid anymore even if in your last mail it says codes would have been valid for a while. can you re mail ?
my drive showed up today (yay!), but it was empty (boo!). i was able to download the albums (yay!) but that means no extra/bonus kickstarter track (boo!).
i found that downloading by clicking control+spacebar then "save as" worked better than just clicking the link. the files actually unzipped using this method.
i backed this funding and i still haven't my memory stick wth the album. i've emailed the help address 5 times with no response!  deplorable!
dls thanks so much for letting us be a part of your new record! it's been extraordinary watching you make this album through the campaign. i've enjoyed the experience, and hope it shows other musicians how to fund a successful record in 2016. new album is dope. i dig the variety and appreciate the old school de la vibe within a fresh new sound. good work fellas, was a pleasure to support. p.s. it's de la day in seattle so tune in! http://kexp.org/player/liveplayer.aspx
@richard johnson that worked! thanks for the tip. haven't attempted to add artwork back to the tracks yet. but  image-less tracks all are playing fine now. hope this helps others.
richard: thanks for the help.
note: please refer to the following update for any technical issues with the download - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1665542
@lee lewis i had it with every download along the way and only managed to figure it today :-)
@richard johnson thanks for the tip about resolving the crashes when adding the tracks to apple music. i will try it and see if this works.
wow! i had no idea what to expect. i did not listen to any of the preview stuff you sent out..too busy and just wanted to wait for the album. like all music, there is some stuff i like and some i love. really great! i am only up to "snoopies" so far. the beat...the rhythm...the mix...it's alive. i truly appreciate the "clean version" because i have kids and can feel comfortable playing this around them (i am not a fan or cursing in music anyway). i would rate this as "exceeds expectations." congratulations!
love love love the instrumental version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
excellent album! i've been listening to a local seattle radio station, kexp since 6:00am this morning, breaking down 3 feet and rising all day!! http://blog.kexp.org/delasoul/
thank you! links worked, sounds great. thank you for all the hard work.
not complaining, but super disappointed... this poster is so small. i can't... i wish i'd added an extra $5. i think i would have gotten something i would have appreciated more. congratulations on completing the campaign, though.
downloaded and very looking forward to listen to it,  but where are the uncompressed .wav/.aiff - files ??? please offer lossless files asap- thanks in advance.
did everybody receive their pledge item, or are they still being mailed out? i have not seen anything in the mail.
great album! i really enjoy it! thank you! good work!
i was able to download the album and transfer the cuts to my iphone, but itunes keeps crashing anytime i try and play a track... what's the solution?
oops, i see wav files are coming later
i received the downloads, but they are only in lossy mp3 format...  do we also get links to download lossless (flac) files? i hope so.
can't wait to hear the album.  i got the links yesterday but none of them would work.  i left my computer on to see if it would work this morning, but the page now says link expired.  can you send me a new link when you get a chance?  thanks!
loving the album.  only problem is that the download to the clean version failed.  can i get a new link for the clean version only (the other two downloaded fine)?
i've received my cd! i was unable to complete the download, though and now my links have cancelled.
received the link last night. used my computer and tried to download. nothing just timed out for three hours. fell asleep woke up this morning and now the link doesn't work... not sure who to even contact. hope to receive the cd so i can actually listen to this. plaese advise.
this. is. incredible.
recieved my link! nice work guys! thanks from luxemburg!!
actually... it is there but not in the same order as the soundcloud list.
i just downloaded and cannot wait... however, the kickstarter bonus track seems to be missing
glad i ordered the cd, but the links keep cancelling out with network error, i hope i'll still be able to download later...
received the link, and once clicked, was not able to download the lp, and said the link has expired.  i clicked on a computer as instructed.  how can this be remedied? pretty disappointing being i've been waiting for this for quite some time now ... thanks.
anyone else noticed whoodeeni is spelt differently on the instrumental version (whodini)?
wow, its finally here on my computer and in my ears. =d a bit different from what i have expected, but i m really loving / enjoying it (!) the track "memory of" is totally blowing me away right at the moment ... thanks for the album delasoul :) greetings from germany !
i think my vinyl shipped! my usps shows a package on the way!! you guys in jersey??
lee lewis and anyone else having problems with it crashing the apple music app, i fixed mine by removing the album artwork (and then replacing it with one i saved off amazon). works fine now!
link arrived in the mailbox, download worked, album is on my computer and in my headphones. thank you for the music, de la soul <3
people are going to make a big deal about minor changes or slip up here and there, but it a new process for everyone. i'm proud of this album. feels dope to be a part of something and to help support a group that i respect and believe in. much props to howard and the staff for making it happen on this side of the house. y'all did it! be easy!
my link takes me to the kickstarter page with no actual download link.
really enjoying the album
maannnn.  i'm stressing over a link and the cd came today.  the fam had it underneath the other mail today.  overall, you all delivered the product and provided (at least to me) information along the way about the process.  plus.....this is the first ks (of three) i've backed where i have the music before worldwide release.  again, great job.  if yall go this route again...i'm there.
i got the downloads, please disregard my last post!  thanks!
got the links but the downloads stopped working, will i still be able to try later as it's suppose to be one click per?
added the files to itunes and everyone i play them through apple music it crashes the app.
received the link and get page cannot be displayed.  what gives?
album super fresh fuego fire - can't wait for the swag coming our way
just got the links everyone!!!
any answer on why the instrumental tracks link doesn't work ? i'm logged in to kickstarter, i'm logged into soundcloud....just curious if there's resolution on this.
just curious why the links for this weren't sorted out over a month ago... the masters have obviously been done for quite a while as everything got manufactured in time...
just opened my mailbox and got my t-shirt and cd filled with certified gems for him and her!!!
have folks been getting their download links via email? haven't seen mine yet. and yes, checking spam folders...
has there been an announcement for when the vinyl is shipping? i backed the signed colored lp, and haven't heard anything about that.
are the instrumentals digital download, wax or both? many thanks
does anybody know what songs are on the kickstarter only 7"? there has literally been no update here! *fingers crossed for "pain."*
link from update #53 doesn't work, but i got a cd in my hand!
i hope we ll be able to download the instrumental too ?
can't lie and say i'm not salty that my vinyl copy will not be in my hands prior to the release date.  o well.  de la my dudes so they get a pass.
link is dead
the soundcloud link isn't working either... �
a friend on facebook got an advance download link already. odd that we can't get the same download link for the full album. looking forward to getting my rewards, but this whole release situation could have been handled better.
i agree with michael hart, us true de la soul supporters have been left with empty wallets, and zero product. which makes us weary about the future of this process. it was supposed to be in my crates several months ago. now. i can't even exclusively play new de la soul tracks cause everybody will have it. and have heard it. btw you should have put "god it" on the lp. even though the song is too hard for the vibe of this lp. de la soul "come again" - in my krs voice
the link wasn't for the instrumentals, it's to listen to the music, and isn't working anymore. it says it in the comments. go to the latest update and listen there!
yeah like errbody else says the link to the instrumentals does not work
wait are we getting vinyl copies of the instrumental lp?
link doesn't work.
link to the instrumental version isn't working. grrr!
link does not work......
would like some communication regarding the digital album. it releases tomorrow on itunes.
great... awaiting survey for digital rewards :)!
great work thus far guys! you've nearly done it! am a backer for the la listening party which was to include advance digital download of album plus bonus track.  with release date in 2 days i'm wondering when and how we are to be provided this advanced digital download of album?  thanks.  cannot wait to hear this track whoodeeni again.  it's been in my blood for a year now from just hearing it once.
this is going to be great! thank you, de la team, for all of your hard work.
supporting this campaign has been weak sauce from the jump. i should have known the management team didn't have heir shit together when i asked if they could make a new reward level with a thumb drive and the vinyl and their response was that i'd have to make another kickstarter account. plenty of other campaigns add new reward levels after the campaign rolls out. that you didn't think of that from jump is pretty poor performance. then you released music to other people and outlets before us. charged us twice as much for the vinyl as other outlets. aren't giving us any of the colored vinyl variants. and it looks like we won't be getting our vinyl copies on release day, or before people that ordered through regular retailers because "no one could have expected the magnitude of this fulfillment process"? you had the numbers for a year and a half. you've had the product sitting in a warehouse for months. why the fuck did we support this campaign again? what is the advantage? one extra song that you've already released to certain outlets? you should be appalled with the way that you've handled this campaign. full of fail. i see why your director didn't want to talk to me after you said you wanted me to be interviewed for your pity party documentary on "the difficulties of doing a kickstarter campaign". "oh, anders is back in europe, you never heard from him?". nah man, i never heard from him.
@jamesthorn fyi that it ooks like there is a 'smoky clear' variant of the vinyl, limited to 1000 copies and sold by various retailers. fye will have an exclusive "opaqe yellow" variant. ours, i'm guessing is black vinyl, and is pressed with the kickstarter only bonus track. plus we got the epi. not sure what you feel is better. color variant or bonus track limited to this? personal decision, i guess. also, i'm not with kickstarter or the band. just reporting what i saw online. looks like the rest of the music dropped via updates on tuesdays/wednesdays. i'm hoping for an update by the morning.
ok, im kinda mad about this. i just got an email from turn table lab and their showing clear vinyl lp's and saying they are shipping now. so are people that didn't back the project getting better products then us? a dude even had it in his hand and everything...not jumping to conclusions just wondering.
would you please provide us with the date that the physical rewards will be shipped?  also, when will the advance digital download be provided to backers?
i'm really hoping this doesn't end up like other projects i've backed where i don't get the reward when stated. physical rewards shipping soon? how far in advance will we get the digital download? info/update please?
hi guys, hope you see this. the rewards talked of an "advanced release" for the kickstarter crew. whatup with that?!
"how far in advance of the public release should we expect to receive the album we made possible through this kickstarter project?"  i was trying to find an update on that one too.
album out this friday #excited  pity we won't receive our goodies prior to the release (any news on this guys?).  also i've noticed in the uk there is a coloured vinyl version of the album. pity that wasn't an option at the time of backing.
been out of e-mail contact for a while and trying to catch up with this project. kickstarter showed that i backed it and my pledge is detailed but i can't get any further with getting my reward! no survey link visible..... and time is running out! what the hell is going on peeps!
i'm excited to hear the final product when it's released next week.  i'm hoping that backers have the music before bootleggers and others ordering from online music sites, such as ughh.  btw ughh is shipping the cd on 8/23 (tuesday).  it's possible that someone could have the album by wednesday (overnight shipping) or thursday (1 or 2 day shipping).  i know you all want to keep wraps on the album until the final release date, but please think about sending backers the album digitally before the release date.  the most disheartening thing about ks or other crowdfunding sites/projects is the backers are usually the last ones to get the product even though backers were a (small) part of the process.  anyway.....can't wait (word to bart scott).
fucking magic. period. i won't tell you how old i am but let's just say i've seen them live in ny a few times on li where i went to school.
are we going to get the "greyhounds" song that was released to the net?
hi howard, pledged for an ultimate fan reward and not seen any survey (t-shirt included). i'm in london and really want to make sure i can get the reward survey to get the t-shirt sorted and confirm address etc. thanks rich
i backed for twitter following and tweeting in addition to the great album... love the downloadable tunes so far but have been lacking the twitter love - what's up with that part of the reward?
"quota has been exceeded for this file"  cant download....  pls fix :) <3
will all of the music you sent us be on the flash drives with the album?
will the digital singles you've been giving out be on the album?
i am patrick,  i be wanting to spin this record soon
there is no survey tab between rewards and messages after pressing my pledge button.  other options?  b/c i also tried the updated link below...
hi everyone. if you have questions about surveys or changing your address, please refer to the following update: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1645924 h.
the survey tab is under your pledge. please take your time to look for it. 1. click campaign. 2. click on view your pledge 3. you will see the survey button once you view your pledge.
still no survey tab, and it says i recd my reward
hey people, it is under view pledge then there is a survey section ;-)
saw you guys at penn fest! great gig, can't wait for the vinyl...
awesome...i am supposed to receive the signed vinyl and other trinkets...where's the survey??
y'all got do-overs? i selected the wrong reward
hey everyone, sorry about the confusion. the surveys are only for people who backed the campaign, and are receiving physical rewards. if there's nothing to be mailed, there's no need to complete the survey. howard.
i do not see any survey tab either.
i don't see a survey tab or an area for t shirt size.
i don't see a tab for the survey either
i don't see the tab for surveys per your last update...
yay, it's august which means album release this month (based on updates) �
i thought we were getting usb thumb drives with the album? what's up?
i keep hearing tracks from this album from alternate places. what was the point of being a backer if the public are being given first taste?
same as dan stated below. i'll need to cross check my delivery options as i think it's going to an old address.
hey, just wanted to change my delivery address details as have moved. any ideas how to do this?
just wondering when these are gonna be sent out? it's been a bit.
has any backer received anything by way of "reward"?   almost a year beyond the due date and i haven't received jack.
hi. we should be receiving our album very soon? i know 2 weeks before. how about earlier?
anyone know where i can download the new de la soul action track in mp3 format?
hey de la, can i change my cd on order to a vinyl copy?  happy to pledge more if needed.
oh and funny thing. just check my pledge. the original funding goal post. "delivery estimated september 2015" almost one year late. one year. come on now...
hey de la. uhm. how bout another update after not hearing anything for over a month? got people around me telling me about this album. getting the music. listening to the songs and all. i got nothing yet from you guys. nada.  well i got something... regret.
please please please support my kickstarter too.  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1521485757/the-original-hip-hop-cafe
when will the gifts be sent out to the backers?
music sounds awesome + i'm so happy to be a supporter + i wish people would calm down. you'll have the album, and you'll love it. thank you, de la, for taking care of your fans.
hi guys. when can backers expect to receive the album?
hi guys. what's the latest? a friend just shared the album now it's listed on apple music. but the bankers haven't got it yet. how far in advance of the public release should we expect to receive the album we made possible through this kickstarter project?
looking forward to this album!
hey guys - ordered the de la drive with the album loaded on it. any idea when that should arrive?
liking the tracks so far.  wondering if you are willing to share details like signal chain for vocals. it has a consistent vibe for the most part.  the snoop verse on "pain" sounds different though.  sounds like it was tracked in a different space, a different mic at least. keep 'em coming.  can't wait for my vinyl!
hi, i'm somewhat confused getting emails about pre-ordering the album. i have supported and received no notifications about the gift that should have the album already downloaded. can someone get back with me regarding when the gifts will be shipped. that would be decent of you.
i'm in with urban mediamakers (and a whooooole lot of others it seems actually) on this one. good music is one thing, time management ánd trying to run a business another one (with you guys at least it seems). a shame. i know the art-thingy takes time etc etc, but then don't promises continuous new deadlines and updates if you cannot make them (while you have our money)... also, i'm confused by all the emails and notifications on pre-ordering, buying it here, getting it there etc. i am getting this thing, right? i'm confused...
on the real, being patient for an album that was promised in september 2015 by a group that has made music for years would be a month at most -- not nearly a year. now you are asking to pre-order a cd that i have already bought. wtf? you all are touring, living big, but where is the da*n cd that i paid for. to be honest, at this point, can you just refund me my money? i have backed all kinds of projects, but this is ridiculous!!!!
i'm disappointed with all the whining from the "supporters" about the release time. it takes how ever long it takes. like any art form, there is a process and along the way there are always unforseen obstacles.  in many cases these obstacles result in an even better outcome for us as the audience. as "supporters", our contribution was a gesture demonstrating alleged respect and appreciation for de la's craft, not to simply get some merch, but it's possible i'm wrong. anxiously awaiting as well, but to see what's next from some of hip hop's greatest, i'll gladly be patient.
i still can't believe how far off you are with the original timeline, one could think this was the first album you ever produced. i am utterly disappointed ...
hey guys, i did select the pledge which included a physical cd. when and do we still get a physical cd?
hi guys... i have a question for you: as an ever-since-fan, student and vinyl backer is there any chance to get on the guest list for the 06/18 concert in duesseldorf, germany? i must admit i'm a little short at the moment and a tickets sells for around 51$ ... would love to see you guys again after the 1989 show right around the corner... please help me out...peace & love, matt
heya y'all--i keep getting emails telling me to pre-order the album. didn't i already pre-order it when i became a backer? i chose the backer option that included a copy of the cd. also, even if i did try to pre-order, there's no option at the pre-order link for a cd, just various streaming/download options. thanks for any clarity on this! signed,  tlc, who has the love and the faith, but some confusion toooooo...
"pain" is a dope smooth joint! keep 'em coming & keep up the hard work fellas!
i am getting an error message when i try to open the zip file!
i must admit, i was very disappointed to hear the song released to the public before to the backers of the project. but at least it wasn't wack. patiently awaiting!
hi, do you know when we are going to receive the album. i do not want to have to download song after song, and it seems it is a very very long time we are waiting now. thank you!!!
i can't wait, my only complaint is the length it has taken to get the album complete. but i trust de la!
hope the song in this promo is on the album. pain & suffering is good, but what i just heard in the promo sounds great.
wouldn't it be great if you guys could drop into the massive attack home coming in bristol, uk in september...would be a great platform to launch a tour for the new album and thank your fan base over here in the uk...it's going to be an epic day.
just realised what a plonker ! all on the free download. come on boys need the rest of the album. phife dawg rip my diabetic compatriot �
how come we don't get the first release trainwreck for free? found it on itunes via twitter. am i missing something ?
sounds awesome so far. can't wait until august!
pre release is amazing! so excited <3
just had a chance, finally, to enjoy the pre-release tracks. definitely whetting my appetite here, guys - can't wait for the album, and thx for keeping in touch.
hooo fuck the prerelease shit is dope
actually, it made more sense to just make this https://youtu.be/jraxlcnl-ty
whooooops, i meant to link this https://youtu.be/luwswxpunag
y'all probably won't be too interested in any part after the first 30 seconds of the video, but if you dig dance feel free to watch it through! https://www.youtube.com/watch…
beautiful night is everything!!!
i've been a fan for a long time and i'm just excited to hear the thump at the end of the tunnel.  long days and pleasant nights.
i was just checking my reward� "ultimate vinyl head" and wondering if that 7' single is same in all the rewards? i am asking because in more expensive rewards it says "only 1000 made" but in my set there is no such a mention. �✌�
loving what i'm hearing big fan can't wait to hear the complete album, to bad the ep is all over the net already i felt like i had a exclusive that's the game these days...anyway peace 2fingers ..backer #3293
many of backers seems to be, well almost angry? i have no rush for real, just take your time and deliver true dls package for us! ps. why i didn't get any announcement about phone question happening? greetings from finland!
you guys are hilarious, brilliant artists.  i'll happily and patiently wait for something that is much more complex than most of your backers can even imagine.  keep up the great work and i can't wait to hear the magic!  cheers!
patience is really hard to come by these days huh. you want a good album done the right way, you wait until it's ready. then when it comes out you can continue complaining because thats what you do. i, on the other hand, will be letting my eardrums enjoy it and will appreciate something that we were all a part of to make happen. boom. pz yall.
hey dela, does this mean there will be an album plus a couple eps?  that would be hawt!!
happy for you guys man! also sorry for your loss. rib phife! looking forward to yet another masterpiece.-rusty grillz aka backer # 2801
yeah, yeah, just do it already. so we are funding a record company deal now? whatevs.
copied from the update thread:  this works!!! solution to the download qouta are to add the file to your own google drive. right click: make a copy of the file and then download that copy. this isn't a trainwreck, with a workaround it can be a beautiful night.
i just closed 6 tabs of recent attempts at download. being stuck waiting on your favourite groups exclusive, that's the brakes.  it's early eve here in sydney and i wanna bomp the new de la
fought with the link for half an hour.  giving up and going to work... empty handed.
link will not work?
@collective elements to many people downloading the lp at once
that link didn't work for me , anyone know why ?
woohoo so the album comes out tomorrow right...
the single didn't come out in feb/mar so i'm going to assume the album won't drop on 4/29/16 per update #32?
thanks for the recent update... cant wait to hear the album.
it's a process and it takes time. patience...
https://www.youtube.com/watch…
is it too late to change the receiving address?
looking forward to the album. hope it will out sooner then later!!
patience - dropping an album takes time. i'm sure dls will release soon and its going to be 'yuge'!
what's happening?
this is really bad.  i can't believe that de la soul really doesn't care about its fans (even backers who invested their money believing in de la soul's pledge).  the band has not fulfilled there pledge by september 2015 (as initial promised), this should mean that they stay in close contact and explain why they are late and when we can expect the result. but they keep quiet and in hiding. are they just hustlers getting away with their fans money?
i would love to get an update or single or  even a "hey how ya doin".
when dls did the november update they said it would be out april 29th.  looking forward to it!!!
wow, i sure love that poster i didn't get in september 2015...maybe i'll see it by 2016...who knows.  they aren't telling us anything. any place to ask for a refund?
i love dls... but no updates in almost 2 months, that's not how you run a project and support the backers that are supporting your project.  i don't doubt that the music will come, but damn... at least an update telling us what the hold up is?  any news would probably calm the masses, silence will just further the disconnect.
crickets on my side since feb 3rd. almost a year later and sure enough the updates are slowing down to just basically nonexistent at this point.   not to fault dls on this since they are artists seeking to deliver the most pure hip hop experience they can deliver but oh well,  this is likely the last music based project i will support myself.
i have changed my address as well, where do i update the information i gave to you?
status update please? havent heard from you since feb 3rd. when is your album expected to be released?
im not worried about this, dela will drop when ready
hello? when will backers be receiving their rewards? when will the album be dropping? no updates in a looooooong while.
getting a bit impatient. really wish we would get some sort of update. :(
hopefully you guys can address some of the issues other ks campaigns i've invested in have had. 1.  please get download links to backers before they go live on apple music (usually 1115pm-1130pm est) and other digital stores.  took a few days before i received one project and several hours for the other.  both were on apple music before i received my link.  imo that shouldn't happen. 1b.  how will you all be getting the d/l to us?  what service will host the album?  bandcamp?  will there be a redemption code to get the album? 2.  if sending physical products please (if possible) send individual notifications via email (tracking #'s if possible) about product shipping.  one ks artist put on ig a picture of items ready to ship, but i'm not sure if mine is in that (still don't have product). 3.  you guys will be busy on release night however please have someone on ks able to answer questions about links and products.  if there is a delay in things just let us folk know.  people will be (probably most) ok with delays in shipping items (as long as they have at least the digital album), let folk know that's all. 4.  lastly, good luck with the release.
hey guys? what's up? any news about album drop? no comms since february.
i have just changed address. where is the best place to send my new one? thanks! -mike steele
in anticipation of the new stuff, i've recently been going back to the catalogue, and getting deep within. just finished with buhloone. my goodness that thing is amazing. guess i was sleeping a bit when it dropped (blame bcc) cause it is a full-on unreal classic. it must have given me twenty sure-fire and positive shivers up the spine. also did grind date (lost my calendar! damn) and that impossible mission tape. could use anothet instalment there. and maseo, if you ever check this out, consider me one fan that would still geek on an aoi iii, (even though i see that it might not make much sense with where you fellas are at right now). when is the last time de la let me down? never. can't wait to start digesting something new from the crew. all love. love all.
want my money back! no survey!
when is the next update
hey guys. i went with the cd and tee, and haven't received a survey, who's best to talk to? hope it's going well. peace, james / vice
very close to april, any news when the album will drop? haven't received any updates lately either.
hope its dropping soon?
curious when i can expect the benefit of having you guys retweet some of my tweets. reached out to you on twitter and haven't gotten any responses. is it not until the album drops? i know you're already following me.
i'm just another backer like all of you, but here's some info from recent articles (looks like april 2016 release, idk if backers would get it before):   http://www.digitaltrends.com/music/de-la-souls-and-the-anonymous-nobody-will-be-out-in-april/   and  http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2016/02/81611-de-la-soul-talks-kickstarter-album-not-going-to-a-label-we-love-the-freedom/
i am getting really excited! is it time for another single to drop?
when's the launch party in the uk?
looking forward to seeing you guys at pennfest, uk (22nd july). bringing the new sounds?
btw, the three heads graphic is dope.  it would make a great laptop/bumper sticker.
i finally had free time to give some feedback, i hope it's not too late. if there's anything about de la soul that is a "signature" is that they have no signature, other than being themselves.  the beat and hook is fire, the actual singing is not pavarotti.  but i am sure it's not supposed to be.  carry on gents, i can't fucking wait.
@tink they asked for feedback einstein
hard to say if it fits in the album, not knowing the rest of the album of course.  i like the the flow of the verse, but the chorus doesn't grab me right away. this is really amazing you guys, and i think it is so cool to be contributing to your creative process and interacting.  never thought that while sitting on the back of the school bus blasting a 3 feet high tape back in the day.  wow! peace
when is the album going to be finished and shipped?
all these bedroom producers telling you guys how to put a song together, wow.  do as de la does, this shit sounds lovely.
sorry guys i dont anderstand, did they they backed for the digitl album recieved the digital album or not? i didnt get it. didnt got a survey didnt get a download link nothing. how i get the digital album please help. sorry i know my english is shit
i would assume that mastering the album takes some time. and you want it mastered. releasing a half baked album just to backers so it can be judged unfinished and possibly leaked is not a good idea. just wait. i'm sure it worth it. this album is not life or death for the fans but it may be for the group of not done correctly.
not understanding some of the fuss.  the group has updated us along the way.  been open and up front about the process and and has a release date.  didn't get the track in december but ah well. what i do hope happens is backers get everything first.  some of the other ks i've backed the non-backers have received art work, tracks, etc before backers.
@nique s. thanks for the input, but i'm wondering where they heard that the album is finished. i was thinking it was the listening party video, but i watched again and didn't hear that. i was at the nyc listening party and they mentioned that the songs weren't finished, so i'm just curious where this is coming from.
can't wait to hear it guys!
@bkny i think they're referring to the most recent update. not sure where jonathan got the idea that the video was recorded on a phone; looks like it was filmed with an actual camera to me. and i completely understand why some backers are getting impatient, but from my understanding, this is de la's first independent album. i have little knowledge of what goes into distributing one, but i'm sure it's far from an easy undertaking. i'd rather the guys take their time and do it right than release an half arsed, low fi anything---even if it's just a song. i expect quality from them, and i'm sure that's what they're working hard to give us.
@ben @john @jeramie: which update are you guys talking about?
"why did we get an update late last year that basically said "the album is finished but of course we can't just release it to the backers because it is complete, that is not how the music business works"? if that is the case, then why did you structure the ks campaign in such a way as to imply that you would record an album, and release it to the backers when in fact it was complete?" jonathan is pretty much on point with this. everyone respects you and the music, but the nature of kickstarter is to get things to backers before the general public. you reward the people who funded the project. who cares if the music is not mastered, remastered, mixed up, mixed down, lo-fi, hi-fi etc. you have all the tracks right now. post a link for backers.
well said john
thanks for the update, guys. i was really looking forward to hearing a track last month, but i understand; setbacks happen. much love!
de la the dopest! just chillin' with mrs. witter,  and she said "be patient".  so i will.   still my favorite group of all time.
i found your last update (video) puzzling. it was just a clip from a phone video, poorly shot, totally unscripted and rambling, and not one that gives confidence to the backers. de la soul is an experienced group, and made several albums over the years. why does this project have the feel like a group that is making everything up as they go along? why did we get an update late last year that basically said "the album is finished but of course we can't just release it to the backers because it is complete, that is not how the music business works"? if that is the case, then why did you structure the ks campaign in such a way as to imply that you would record an album, and release it to the backers when in fact it was complete? i'm sure we will eventually get to enjoy this music, but it the process does not have communicate confidence and experience from a group that has such a great history.
the lack of communication is getting sketchy...this project is falling off
i am yet to be sent a survey. what's happening guys???
i backed this project and was supposed to get a t-shirt and a copy of the album. i never received a survey. what's going on?
@creator i haven’t received any e-mail.please send me a survey.  thx.
i have not received the survey yet. could you please send it to me? thank you very much!
i've been wondering about the "train wreck" track as well. since the song wasn't released last month, will the actual single with snoop drop sooner?
in one update you posted:  "in late december we'll hit you with a treat and release a song entitled "train wreck"  are you still going to release the song?
what's the word on that track with snoop that was suppose to be released in december?
hi, still haven't gotten my survey. please hit me back. bezenge@gmail.com
hello, i didnt receive the survey for my pledge.  is there another way besides my email? thank you
got the pledge email but the link in it is broken. takes me to a 404 error page...
feelin' bart scott and whatnot...
early christmas gift? would be the dopest christmas gift!
idk... there's been nothing but excuses & delays for this album. i understand all the politics in the business, but now we have to wait for our rewards?! first & last time.  thanks!
keep up the hard work guys! can't wait for your new tunes - you can't rush these things! would have been fun if we could have paid for a mention in one of your songs haha!! any ideas what month/year you might consider a uk visit?  peace! :) andy.
april date...i can live with that as it now becomes my 40th birthday present to myself.
thank you for the reply howard. sorry i didn't catch it in the update... i'll wait for the next survey, then. cheers!
apologies for the late reply daniel. i posted this in the latest update: fyi, if you've received surveys, you can always update your address there. if you haven't, you will receive one as we're getting closer to shipping your stuff, which will ask you for your shipping address. i hope this helps. - howard.
i have recently moved and would like to change the address i gave you when i initially backed the project. where could i send it? also, thanks for all the updates, i'm really looking forward to hearing your new record!
2livestu it's definitely coming together stu! it was a pleasure seeing everyone come out and enjoy the music! pos plug won
i saw someone asked how to change your shipping address, but didn't find the answer...
shaping up nicely. keep it going fellas !
good news about the la party
had the la listening party yesterday. really hyped for the final product!  thank you de la for being really awesome to all of us in the crowd. even got to see dj royalty rhettmatic, numark and j rocc at the show.
what about a london launch party?
hey,  any update on when posters will ship? we're in japan, so want to be sure all is in order! peace.
hello howard, this is arjay smith (jeigh b. records). contacting you about changing ticket from la to nyc.
hi there, i donated $100 for the la listening party,  with the intent of receiving two tickets ($50 apiece). may i bring a guest? also, i've since moved from la. am i able to transfer these tickets to someone else if i can't attend?  thanks!
my reward is the print and ship date is sep 2015 however it does mention shipping to canada is $20.  do i need to make this additional payment? if so then how?
hi! will you please let me know what the timeline is on the poster? i have not received  anything  yet and i will be going on vacation soon. how is this shipping? usps? also, how will we know when it ships? will we get a tracking number? any updates you can provide will be appreciated.  thanks!
there was an update clarifying that ny listening party tickets are for people who backed the reward: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1396761
hi, i didn't get ticket for ny showcase...how do i get it?
my address has updated since signing up and becoming a backer. how do i update it for when you guys get ready to send the physical albums out?
great updates but no idea of timescales for the album? come on guys you've only going into production for usb? so looks like everything is behind not just the album. just give us a date you're aiming for!!
hi. i didn't get tickets to the ny show. how do i get them?
i didn't get my tickets to the ny listening party. it says to let you know, but i can't see anywhere to do that. was it supposed to be by email, mail, carrier pigeon? who do i ask?
is it too late to upgrade to the usb drive option?
hey de la soul, what's the deal with the album. you all are not new to the music game and recording, so when will the album be delivered? we are at november 2015 now. you haven't sent out any new updates. are you offering refunds?
you know i was getting kind of impatient and all then thought about how good de la treats their fans by comparison to most artist. common 25th anniversary they release their entire catalog, the drop rarities from dilla all for free. sorry but i can't get mad at you guys take your time and get it to us when you can. on a side note see if you can talk your boy's tribe into doing something for the first time in like eternity.
i´am waiting, sept. has gone, october is almost over. when will we get the album?
so what's up??
any update on this, it was supposed to be released in september. granted these things can naturally slip, it comes with the territory. but no update announcements are a tad annoying.
any update?
i'm sure everyone here is hoping to hear an update soon, like me!  i'm itching for some new sheit! should we have received anything yet?  there was a survey for our shipping address like 2 weeks ago, and nothing since.  not sure if something was supposed to show up or what.
since backing this project i have started collecting vinyl again, is it possible to increase or change payment for the vinyl reward?
waiting patiently :  hoping to hear the product in my truck or living room soon. peace from the bronx.
waiting patiently :  we understand dates and events change. i guess we just wanted the product at the date stated. but it's worth the wait.
i hope this is the first of several future de la album projects that we can support this way! wish the tribe would take the lead from you guys and bless this earth with a similar type project!
with the date of the listening party pushed back by two months, what's the chance those of us who can no longer make it might be able to trade to the lp perk instead? thanks for your consideration.
la listening party question: kids?? hi there, this may be a crazy question but would kids be welcome to the la listening party? i've got an 8 year old son that i was thinking about bringing. he's a cool kid but wanted to check if this event would be even remotely kid friendly. can you let me know about this? thanks!
what is the release date?
is it too late to change my choice of t shirt colour?
is it still possible to purchase another ticket for the la meet?
the latest video gives me a small preview - sounds good - can't wait :-)
really hoping the listening party in nyc doesn't coincide with my trip to la/sf. i purposely booked it in november because the show was supposed to happen in september. i understand shit happens and delays are inevitable. i just want to put some good karma out there that i don't miss out on my reward.
de la fan here since 89, just saw you guys at annenberg in l.a. if you guys ever need album artwork of a different piece, check it out:  http://mrrourke.tumblr.com oodles more where that came from.
t-shirt  - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album/posts/1193170
can we preview the different t-shirts before answering the survey?  it would be nice to see what white/yellow/black looks like.
count me as another person curious about the survey.  need to make my selection for the lyric sheet! :-)
so...will the survey be coming out this month or what??thank you
any news on the listening party?
hoping to get an update on dates for the listening party. any news is good news
can't wait, looking forward to it :d
thanks for the update. can't wait to hear the final product.
when is the la meet+greet?
+1 on la listening party dates? guessing not the first or second week in september, since you'll be in marseilles and chicago.
is that dave chappell crowd surfing?
have the backer kits gone out to people? i haven't received anything.
did the backer kits go out yet? i don't remember ever seeing it.
hey @de la soul, @brandonhixon, or @sabrinadax, any more updates on the specific dates of the listening parties? i've already backed it but need to clear my calendar asap so i can make the weekend in la, thanks so much!
wow. people on here be greedy. any update on when the listening party will be in nyc? want to make sure i'm in town! hope the creative process is going well!
hey i made a typo in my twitter account name for tweet tweet reward - can i update please?

congratulations, guys!!
@mark beddow, i see the confusion now; the colored vinyl is being limited to only 2500. on the other hand, the black vinyl is also limited (it will have the bonus track), as it's only available via this kickstarter.
@paulino deguzman, you will get a survey asking for address info. you would just need to put your friend's address.
de la,  i am so happy to back this project.  i love the concept (the live sampling thing), it's brilliant and groundbreaking.  i just wanted to say thank you for all the years of music you have given all of us.  the laughs, the skits, the realness, the stakes is high and everything in between (and here, i thought this was all about donuts). i'm so happy (and not surprised) for the overwhelming support you've gotten from this project.  you have been a force for good in hip hop for so long...a true (goy) light in the universe.  thank you for being such companions on my own journey in life.  here's to nothing but the best for all of you in the future.  you've earned the good vibes coming right back to you!  peace to you all, my brothers of the human family!  you can say that you will leave the earth a better place than when you found it!
ok, i thought i read there was only going to be 2000 made, thats fine, just wondering what has changed and if i should see if i can scrape up some more money to back
dear de la soul, please be advised that i backed this as a special gift for a friend. i do not intend to receive the rewards but rather give them to this friend. that's cool right? i can make sure the right info goes in the survey, right?
i put in for the ultimate vinyl head, but i wish there was a way to get at least one of the thumb drive with this perk as well :(. regardless, i couldn't be happier that de la's pumping out new jams!
@mark beddow, the vinyl hasn't changed. all the vinyl offered in this campaign is limited to only this kickstarter (as far as i know). only the colored ones were restricted by quantity, but that hasn't changed. either way, these copies aren't available after the campaign ends, so they're all (technically) limited.
wait, to my backer reward is now less special? at one point there was only going to be a limited edition number of vinyl copies,  now i have to do twice as much for a limited edition record?
less than 24 hrs to go. congrats to de la for knocking that goal out the park.
whew! just got my pledge in! you know.....life! but i made it. haha  not only am i excited to hear the album and play it a lot on my radio show, it's a beautiful thing to see so many people support innovative hiphop! continued success, y'all! peace piece conshus de our show
ok after listening to stakes is high i will say that de la is the truth and there are to many good songs to call any one of them my fav.
i'm loving this! i remember when i first heard you guys. i was in nigeria. i bought your tapes and cds just through friends who were in the u.k. so i'm looking forward to hearing the new music. i am happy that you guys have raised close to 5 times of your goal. but i'm disappointed in we so called hip hop fans. not the ones who have supported this kickstarter campaign but those who haven't. i'm not saying everyone must support every crowdfunding campaign but come on this is de la soul we are talking about !!!!. hip hop royalty man!!!!! more people should step and support with money instead of complaining about the death of good hip hop and then not doing anything. apologies for the rant guys. i need to calm down :-) i just respect the value you have brought to many people's lives through your music and passion for the art. thanks for doing what you do.
i'm ecstatic to be a part of this project! i remember hearing you all for the first time in elementary school. you already had 3 albums under your belts by then, but once i heard "buddy" with tip & jungle from my neighbor's mix tape; it was game over. congratulations on the continued success, sop, yogurt & mase!
super stoked to hear the new album!!!!
can we add an nyc show ticket?  you only sold 199! lol!
@de la soul: will everyone over the $50 pledge get into the listening party?  thanks!
@de la soul, you may wanna clarify if you plan on using a pledge manager for this campaign so people know whether they can pledge for multiple pledge tiers or just one.
@samuel tecpaocelotl castillo thank you samuel, we may not be able to give you everything but we won't let you down on the music. - dave
@wc: thankful that you made it here... thanks for listening and appreciating our music for all these years. - dave
so glad i found this!  been listening to you guys for years!!!
i wish you guys had a vinyl, cd combo. i am a backer though.
will you guys be adding a lil' hey love to this joint? �
@patrik lindberg : thank you patrick for having faith in us and supporting the vinyl!!  pos (plug1)
jumped on board for the vinyl release! along with posting costs it felt a little expensive, but i can understand that posting vinyls around the world is not cheap. then when i hesitated, i remembered that you guys shared out your old releases last year, a nice gesture and a good way of collecting email addresses to potential new fans. since i've only heard a handful of hits back in the 90s it was great to listen to everything. happy to be on board and good luck with finishing the album!
great! i'm happy to support you guys. can't wait.
@dirkz: yes, you'll receive both, mp3 and flac format. thanks for you supporting the project!! - dave
is the digital download going to be in flac format is well as mp3? i'd like the highest quality digital files.
@shaun pryszlak ha!! yeah that would be a helluva party with all the backers ready to dance!! pos (plug 1)
you should get amanda palmer on one of your tracks.  make it a kickstarter party!
@jorel levenson : all good my friend! pos (plug 1)
thanks. was scrolling too fast...gotta slow down
@jorel levenson : peace jorel. the print illustrated by dan can be found in our pledge for $70 named "de la print". let us know if you have any other questions.  pos (plug 1)
i'm not seeing any pledge level with the dan lish print....what am i missing???
glad to see that this kickstart has been so successful, and i hope the process of making the album is similarly successful.  will the instrumentals album eventually be available outside of the current dj pack?
i really wish you guys would do a vinyl + poster tier, or allow add-ons like some other ks projects.  i've got the vinyl, but would upgrade to get both.
@desmoq: we won't strive for anything less than a masterpiece!! you deserve the very best!!  - dave
@lara gamble: thank yoooouuu!!! we did this together actually:-)   - dave
@jimmy jouthe: thanks jimmy... we're gonna make this album a good one!!
de la got it going on, 10g strong!! that's what's up, congratulations y'all!! i can't wait to hear le album de soul
@buddy : that's what we are hoping to be apart of doing sir!  pos
congrats on breaking that 10,000 backer mark!
congrats! over 10,000 backers!  this might help break the traditional record company funding model, which is awesome.
10,000 backers with four days left!
17 people from 10,000 backers!
just saw the new reward from mase...it's ace but i'm uk based.  dj drop instead...happy face
@jim peacock: thanks jim, we're so ready to have you guys and gals hear this album! thanks for the kind words... we do hip hop the de la way, it's nice to know that people appreciate it. - dave
@robyn: awww happy "soon come" birthday!!!! i wish mase could do birthday parties for everyone. thanks so much for your support.  - dave
@jerrilyn dee clark-raine: thank for believing in us! this project means a lot... we know you'll enjoy it!!  - dave
@mjölken: we got a few things in the works!!!
my 60th birthday is august 29th and would love to have maseo dj. but i'm not a baller and need to save for retirement lol
had to check if you guys got to 10k yet - 66 to go and 4 days - you'll walk it! so stoked for you, love de la soul, the first crew to show hip hop didn't have to be ignorant and macho, props now and for ever!!
ca 5 times the pledged amount. you should throw a couple of concerts for the people!!
less than a week to go! getting geeked to see that grand total.
i absolutely cannot wait til the album drops! i started my hiphop journey with you guys my absolute all time favorites for life! long live the plugs �� thank y'all..
i'm almost depressed i only pledged for the digital version - but shipping to europe is simply too expensive to get anything real over here ;-(
@lara gamble truly a blessing!!!
@leroy boyce it's a bit weird letting de la orgee make it all the way through a play on my speakers when my kids are in ear sight as well! thank you so much for your kind words leroy. it will never stop blowing my mind that we wake up every morning to do what we love to do and people like your self  found it relatable to your own thoughts pos
@ephtee duzit you've put together a helluva wish list!! lol! i'm afraid 99.7% of your list isn't on ours but i am 100% certain that our list is being carefully thought out with the intentions on blowing your mind! stay tuned! pos
@marlon brice  just as you said marlon it is quality going into this project at every twist and turn. i can't wait for everyone to hear it completed. pos
@desmoq we are carefully crafting this album for sure so god willing it will be worthy of being considered a masterpiece. i have a great feeling about this album! pos
@juan pepe luque  we love australia so that is without question! pos
@matt parker we are working hard on it matt. it is thankfully coming together quickly which is a blessing for us!
@jurgen cardon since my first name is kelvin i'd like to say your son has a great name!! thank you for the love. we truly are grateful to have people like you in our corner!! kelvin aka pos
in a room surrounded by vinyl and sampling these records for years.
love how you guys are working this and can't wait for it to land! wish you could hold a meet n greet in the uk, but c'est la vie.
i've enjoyed your music for years, and i'm so happy you're making more!  i listened to trying people, and pledged immediately afterward.  i bought the d.a.i.s.y. mixtape.  i can't stop playing it!
$500,000!!!!!!
less than $2k to $500,000!
you guys came to do a show at my college (jmu) in 2001 or so.  my friends and i had the opportunity to buy you a case of beer (heineken, if i remember correctly).  later, during the show, i guess you remembered me because you brought me on stage.  the show was incredible and that was really the start for me.  i have since purchased your catalog and have seen you guys perform four more times, including the single best show i have ever been to (and i've to a ton), which was at the 9:30 club in dc.  during the show, you surprised everyone by bringing out phife and jarobi.  the place went absolutely nuts and you all destroyed it.  excited to support de la and the incredible music you make.  now, get back to work on the album!
i'm hoping this won't just push off this album, but another productive period for de la soul.
yo! it would be dope if you could add "god it" to the album...jus sayn
i can not wait!! perfect concept from the greatest hip hop group of all time!!!!
man,  now that i see the tshirt i want one. can it be added on to a package?   anyway,  so glad that people are supporting. i am very excited for this. been with yall since i saw potholes in my lawn on video music box.
iconic hip-hop+creative control+2015=magic moment. (can't wait!)
de la soul proving, once again, they are the most creative pioneers in hip hop. they bridge cultures, countries and eras effortlessly and unite them all. this from a 40 year old, white englishman. congratulations for being positive, while so many around you are misogynistic, violent narcisists. i fondly remember collecting your 12" records, back in the 90s - buddy being my all-time favourite. i still have them all. it's a credit to you that i'll be happy for my kids to listen to 3 feet, although with the exception of delaorgy for a few more years yet! you deserve every success. good luck and keep up the great work.
one more item to add on that "wish list" for this album - it will feature little brother (big pooh + phonte)....i know, wishful thinking but i can only imagine the possibilities infinite lol
de la soul has always been a constant to me as a hiphop-head - i am thrilled about this project which am already counting on to be a classic b4 release just based on the virtue of de la's material over the years.  if i had a wish list, all i am hoping with this album is that: 1 - this will be a double-cd 2 - this will be the magnum opus of all de la soul's magnum opus 3 - this will feature prince paul, truth enola, butta verses, native tongue members especially  q-tip, dres, psycho les, mos def, mike g etc...and sean price or nas (heard the freestyle you did with him back in the day on a radio show - vintage dopeness) 4 - this will feature critically-acclaimed & versatile artists on the come-up...like another joint with stalley would b nice 5 - this will show some of this younger generation how hiphop is really done #longlivedela
there's alot of hey love here...and well warranted. love you guys!
this right here proves that people are still willing to support quality music. love this and love to be a part of something dope. this is hip-hop. much love and good vibes to you all.
congrats, crew. with a support like this this no doubt will be an epic album. my personal opinion - given the legendary status of the music you create it`s only right if you bring back prince paul for at least one track. he and dilla were there at the very beginning of it all and although we cant bring dilla back we still can pay homage to the roots.
i really enjoyed listening to your music for over 17 years now. ^^ and i still love it. take your time with this one, to make it another masterpiece =d keep up the great work ! greetings from germany
really happy to participate in the project! come to belgium, i can propose you a beer tasting afternoon with me for free!!!
now that us australians have backed you guys you gotta come out to aus and promote your new album.
you can make the album four times as long now.  ;)
incredible effort guys, well done. glad i pledged when i did 10 days back! can't wait to hear this album.
@ eddie muckunlall: thanks for the love
@ molly schofield and louis pryor: comic looks dope!
i'm happy to support creativity :) take a look at my comic mutant chasers with art by some of the top marvel and dc artist   www.mutantchasers.com
we started buying records in 1986 and my brother who was more into hip-hop brought home the 12" of plug tunin.  i can't tell you how many times we played that record just snapping our heads back-and-forth to that sick beat.  we have other 12"s from de la as well.  i'm extremely happy to see de la still in the game and i can't wait to hear the new album.  all of my vinyl will eventually be passed down to my daughter but this particular record will be very special.  thank-you!
kelvin, dave & vincent... for about 25 years i've always thought that buying your ceedees or partying at your concerts or having my own 'native tongue' tattoo was something quite normal as a fan. until the day i got this email i didn't know about pledging at all. i'm thrilled to be a part of this. i love you guys, and my 8 yo son kai kelvin who doesn't even speak english is on his way as well to 'pledge' in a few years, you'll see lol  good luck guys. lots of love from belgium
calling all de la fans. i've got a second son on the way and i want you to check out our campaign to get his home birth funded. the site is : http://www.gofundme.com/maseowhatgoeson.  his name is in honor of both musicians named maseo who appear on i be blowin. home birth is super important to my family and unfortunately an expense that insurance won't cover. thank you for helping to plug some potholes in my lawn.
looking forward to this. could you please call just one track aoi part3 and validate the intro to bionix?
@jorel levenson we've been blessed to have folks like yourself in our corner. thank you for the years of support! - dave
@james krusling: glad you enjoyed the catalog gift. we won't disappoint you on the new music!! thank you for the support throughout the years.
@nijel lindsay:  thank you nijel - dave
please tell mr. plug 2 he did a great job with the shirt design. the spirit of it is oh-so-right!
i agree that free music catalog was a huge blessing on us all...
after you guys were awesome enough to just give away your music for free last year, how could i not support this? looking forward to it!
yeah it would be pretty awesome if i could add a usb, vinyl and/or a print to my tshirt/cd/digital album pack. so many cool rewards! thanks guys!
i'm pretty sure you can stack pledges so you don't need to make multiple accounts. de la mentioned trying to work with backer kit to get people to be able to make multiple pledges on one account. the only thing i could see wanting to try make another account for would be for those pledges with limited numbers. you should be able to total up all the things you want and pledge that amount. if they do use backer kit they will send out a survey after the campaign to select your options that you pledged for. be cool of de la soul to clarify this so people don't keep making multiple accounts when they don't need to. also it will save de la on shipping if they can bundle packages i would imagine...just my 2 cents...
@dls/chonuff, will there be just a pleddge level for the t-shirt on its own? ive pledged for signed cd and t-shirt but i also want a t-shirt i can wear as the signed is getting framed.  also +1 for meet and greet in uk, il jump stiaght on it
i'm glad i can be part of this history in the making! i know you're busy with recording and all that but check out my kickstarter campaign when you get a chance: earth outlaws- a full color 24 page on going sci- fi comic packed with spacemarines, alien cyborgs, pirates and galactic bounty hunters. its fully funded :) https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1914838151/earth-outlaws/description
@chonuff thanks for the help. i decided against adding more money and trying to hack another level. going to think about creating a 4th account for a bit :)
@de la soul, you should really clarify for people about using backer kit and pledging for multiple levels so people don't have to create multiple accounts. it will likely be easier for you guys to figure out shipping that way as well if they are bundled...
@jared miller: thanks for understanding; we're really trying to keep up with all the questions and requests, and it's a little overwhelming.
@chonuff i totally understand. i've seen it fall apart on other campaigns as well. that's fine. no big deal to create multiple accounts.
@jared miller, the best way (unfortunately) is to create a second account, as other methods have already caused a bit of a logistical nightmare.
i grabbed the listening party in la, but had to change my pledge so i'm missing out on the t-shirt. any way to get both or add the usb drives (besides creating a 2nd account)?
hey guys, i'm so pumped to see you back on the studio. get away was such as tease. finally you're following up! grind date is one of your best. you are getting better like fine aged wine! can't wait to see what you come up with. your tracks such as i am, i be and it's like that are still some of the best in hip hop. period. put your hearts into this album and it will reign.
throwing this out there... what about a meet and greet in the uk? us uk backers would love it, eu backers could do it in less than 2 hours and it's transatlantic epicness?
@jeff johns, please be very careful not to change your selected reward if you are modifying your pledge amount. that can cause you to lose your original pledge.
@phillip, you are correct. we suggest that you create a separate account for each additional reward you'd like to back. it's unfortunate, but the modifying of rewards has already caused a few issues, so creating a new account really is the safest way to ensure that you're getting everything you want. for the record, i am one of the people helping out with this campaign.
can we have a listening party in nyc? would love to see de la in person.
based on the admin notes, you are not permitted to add multiple rewards under the same account by increasing your pledge amount. kickstarter does not seem to permit that, which i think is something they should look into doing.
@chonuff - thanks, i will look at that.
@jeff johns, if you increase your amount to cover the additional tier you want, then send a message to the campaign admins, they can make sure you get the 7". if you click on campaign and scroll to the faq section (at the bottom), you'll see instructions. i hope this helps!
@delasoul - i created 3 different accounts on here to buy a few things. is there anyway to also just purchase the 7"? i am already getting the lp/daisy package, listening party (2). would i have to create another account or can i just grab the 7" as well?
thanks. great campaign so far.
@nicholas echeverria @jorel levenson we should have some tshirt graphics to show you by friday.
a happy life is a creative life! i'm happy to support creativity :) take a look at my studio project  http://www.mutantchasers.com https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1914838151/earth-outlaws
@del la soul, ive been a fan of yours since the original release of 3 feet high and rising, hopefully coming to see you at wireless10 if i can get tickets, good luck with the album
anyone have suggestions on where to order the back catalog online, other than through amazon?
hey de la soul! big fan, even though i discovered you're music waaay later than i'd like to admit. i'm sure you low-balled the asking price of this project at 110k. but what do you plan on doing with the extra funds, that are most definitely going pile up? any stretch-goals about to drop? glad i pledged, have fun in the studio, peace
it would be great if you offered a reward tier with the vinyl and poster.  not sure i could even afford it.  already pledged for vinyl, but that poster looks amazing.
i've been a great fan since the days of 3fhar, so was very happy to hear of this kickstarter project! i'm sure it'll turn out great, best of luck plugs 1, 2 & 3.
gotta agree there...an update with pics of the shirts would be killer...
yo guys! any pics of what the finished shirt will look like and colors? so glad i can be a part of this effort! looking forward to the new album.
word! man i haven't been this excited about an album in a long time! thanks for all the great music and classics over the years and i'm glad i can be part of this history in the making! homies i know you're busy with recording and all that but check out my kickstarter campaign when you get a chance: spyframe- turn your iphone into a wireless hidden camera peace https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/spyframe/spyframe-turn-your-iphone-into-a-wireless-hidden-c
thank you so much. i can't believe i didn't know about this sooner. i can feel the tears welling up just thinking about the amazing positive influence you guys have been in my life. so excited to hear what's coming, is there any chance more tickets to the listening party will be released at some point? i'm crushed that i missed the opportunity. much love from brooklyn
you already know i had to back this project dave! so happy to see y'all get the love n support you guys deserve! thanks again for all the years of quality hip hop music and for blessing my life with soundtracks for it! i will always support you guys! roscoes chicken n waffles on me next time in la dave! still can't believe i met you there b! peace
in case it hadn't been mentioned before, i wanted to say that your "are you in?" nike album is amazing!  looking forward to you guys being pioneers in hip hop once again!
glad to support real hip hop and pretty hyped to know you guys are still making music!
the love is unreal. now i gotta add my hearts. honestly, i have not always paid for your music, but since aoi i, i've supported every project with cash, including some of the more low-key ones, and have been gone to every live show i could get to up in northwestern canada. but you've still blessed us with freebies like that jammin dilla set last year. you've been generous to your fans, and we appreciate it and will keep reflecting back that love. karma-loop! thanks for letting me help, thanks for bringing us new tunes, and thanks to your families for giving you the long leashes you need to bring the real.
yo i need that usb!!
what is erybody listenin to?
@jamie scurrah:  thank you jamie... this album is very special to us. we hope you'll appreciate the hard work we put into it. uk, we're on our way!!! (that rhymed) lol   - dave @jin ah yu:  hey jin... we'll see you there! although it sucks, the best way to acquire another reward tier is to create another account. thank you for being a part of making this project a reality!  - dave @rishi:  it's been overwhelming seeing the reaction to "de la's releasing a new album." i love the excitement, as well as the faith you have in us. you haven't even heard any music!! but still, you're here, supporting and cheering us on :-) so humbling. thank you. we won't let you down.  - dave @chris:  wow, i remember that show in san diego! that tour was fun... we want to do more tours like that. independence is the aim here chris! if we raise a million, we could begin to build an infrastructure that excludes the politics and greedy big hands of the business. we could do a tour, full band, with an amazing cast, without the worries of opportunism.  thanks for your support throughout the years  - dave ps  biz is an awesome dj @colin moore:  salute to the wife, she's a keeper man! congrats and happy birthday. thanks for hopping on board and accompanying us on this journey.  - dave
i sincerely hope you will be working with dj prince paul again on one or more tracks!  almost 3 times the amount you've asked for and 28 days more to go..... what a blast!  very much looking forward to this! have fun and make us proud! 25 years fan and counting!
very happy to contribute, can't wait for the new album. see you in the uk soon boyz!!!
had to create two accounts to attend the meet and greet with a guest! can't wait.  only a few more left people.  jump on!
*campaign
from one musician to another, best of luck! support my kickstarter campain of positive music here: www.zacharyfreedom.com
i don't know if i'm happier to be getting a new de la album or to be able to have the opportunity to participate (and get it on vinyl!).
i love de la and i love people who love de la. they have tripled their goal with 28 days left. i hope they pull a mill for this project. my favorite concert of theirs was at 4th & b in san diego. mos def and common sense...now known as common. de la soul was the highlight of course but my favorite present that night was finally seeing biz markie djing. people associate him with that one song don't realize the off the charts creativity and skill biz has as a dj.
happy fried eh?
amazing accomplishment, wife bought kickstarter option for me as a 40th birthday present, been a big fan since having 3  feet high and rising on cassette and last year she took me to see you guys 3 days before we got married in brighton.  first time i'd had a chance to catch you guys live.
big ups to de la!! always staying true to the culture and fans! can't wait to hear the album!! much respect!!!!
de la soul has been the soundtrack of my life for the last 20 years. thank you for the music, the love, the memories, and for making a size 5 in the new de la dunks!! (i called 20 sneaker shops till i found them!) excited for the new music and the continued innovation.
peace de la, props for doing this as ever.. as a 45 year old uk dj and hip hop fan from the mid 80's on, my relationship with music and music buying has changed so much.. little decent vinyl to buy for one thing. i really wanted to get the wax here, but the shipping is a sting - i've backed on digital and will get the wax when i can find it over here. love the self sampling idea, looking forward to hearing it :-d
this was really a no-brainer. anyone that is here can surely in a moment recall many parties, weekends, nights, dates, summers and moments that were made better with your music through all these years. all that and not to mention your amazing generosity over the last few years of giving the gift of that music to people everywhere free. of course many of us have these songs many times over on everything from played through mix tapes, to vinyl, to cd. even if there wasn't going to be an amazing new album, i'd happily contribute the price of one just for the enjoyment i've already gotten. i've loved seeing the experimentation, growth and thought over the last 26 years and i look forward to plenty more where that came from. i'm thrilled to see something funded that truly deserves it. thank you!
to my dearest de...la la la la laaaa la la la laaaa....shoobie doo....duoooooooo. i wouldn't be the person that i am today without your music.  our first encounter was in bahrain...you signed my dunks and was fortunate enough to get to yell saturday on the mic...big d from jersey city! then pos came out and chilled with us for a couple...i had no idea what to say besides "i heard tribes getting back together" and pos gave me a look like i just came to chill and you want to talk about tribe?" lol...anyways our second encounter was in thailand...yessir it's me senoir buzz lightyear...i'm never gonna let that nickname go!  anyways i'm so grateful to be a part of this and de la never ceases to amaze me.  i'm just wondering what de la will be doing in 25 years from now??? but enough of that...lets savor the moment! can't wait for the boombox to arrive. peace and mad stoopid love!!!!!!!!!!
i am brendan, i be kickstartin de la soul.
@de la soul...are we to assume that it is the plugs running the show here? i assume pos is posting from the comment earlier but it would be great for the backers to know who is talkin...
the first two cds i bought were de la soul is dead and the beatles' magical mystery tour from the paris virgin megastore. i can't describe how your sound hit me then. i'll back this project and your next one, and next one...
@ mud_booda: you are why this project is successful, we thank you for your support!! trying people and trouble water are very very special song to us... so happy to hear they've helped.
@isaac c. rodriguez: thanks for the kinds words. those were amazing days, hopefully this project will speak to you in similar ways. listen, enjoy, learn, laugh, share and dance, peace!
@ chad edwards: thanks so much for your support, most importantly taking a sec to visit and see what we're up to. we won't let you down!!
i'm from the state of west virginia and glad i could be a part of this.  just wish i could have donated more.  de la soul!!! man, you guys are awesome. can't wait to hear your new tunes.
gentlemen, i grew up in los angeles and as i recall your music was always on the airwaves and was definitely considered to be something that you would always put on you "jams" tape (and later mixed cd) along with all the other hits and eternally loved music that the people of l.a. loved to hear. those days of truly creative artists and the logic of their creativity needs to be re-infused back into today's culture to teach the youth of today how it's done. who better to do this than one of the originators of originality :]. thank you for the music de la soul, i happily await my mp3 album, best of wishes - isaac c. rodriguez - master auto mechanic - los angeles california
please bring vinia mojica back for another guest appearance ;) all the best and congrats!!
so happy to see this be successful! trying and troubled waters got me through some tough times, thank you.
just signed up for the meet and greet. coming all the way from canada..first time i saw you boyz play was at niagara university gymnasium on the low end theroy tour with tribe..its been a minute..so excited..
hi boys, i'm sure you don't remember me, but you spent a day doing laundry in my apartment in columbia, mo back in the day when you were playing a show with goodie mob and fishbone my senior year in college. just saw you guys again this past halloween in austin when you played a free show - my sister and i were right up front and dressed as the grady sisters from the shining if you happened to see us :) anyway, other than saying hello and congrats, i was wondering - any chance you might do a t-shirt/thumb drive combo? would love to add on if that becomes an option. also wanted to ask if t-shirts will be in girls' sizes. thanks again <3   - @galiarific
i'm utterly excited to be excited about hiphop again! thank you brothers for doing what you do...1
i bought 3ft high on tape in 89 and that has shaped my whole music world from that point onwards. thank you. joel uk.
ha, you couldn't have timed this campaign better. got my bonus march 31 and just had to snag the last 1k vip laminate with a good portion of it. prepay for 10 de la shows? done and done. surprised those lasted 2 days.
hi from new zealand!  i love it that you are forging your own way in the music biz... mad respect!  look forward to getting the vinyl release. i got into sampling and digging because of pioneers like you. thanks!   - hugo (goldbaby)
i'm glad to finally get the chance to pay you guys directly for the music i've breathed for years. thankyou for constantly being the most played artists in my music collection. peace from oz
300,000 is the magic number! if this ball keeps rolling, this may end up being the most backed music project ever on kickstarter! y'all totally deserve it.
@patrick rushby: patrick!! man!! coming all the way from australia to hang out with me is humbling. can't wait to get up!
@randi nelson: hey randi! thank you for the support! it's pos/kelvin. so glad to have you on board!
so close to going over $300,000! i saw that print on dan lish's facebook and had to insta-cop. this is so dope! thank you de la soul!!!
whose gonna be backer 5,000? great start so far...
i want a da lish t-shirt. i'd up my pledge for that for sure if it wasn't an option for the ks shirt in the current pledges.
since they have a month to sort out details with backerkit, i suggest anyone wanting multiple pledge levels up your pledge to what you want. i'm not sure about the limited numbered pledges, but anything else should be free game. let's get this project over a million...
@robert dorn: we'll have images of the t-shirt design soon, unfortunately it's not of da lish's amazing artwork... but hey, with more inquiries, it'll be something we consider. thanks.
coming from australia to go sneaker shopping with pos in nyc. i was gonna look at art galleries in belgium. this is a far better option. : p atrick
@jorel levenson we're looking into backerkit.com like you suggested for choosing multiple tiers (good tip), we'll keep y'all posted
we are still waiting on art official intelligence approval on the multi pledge level backing...
shout out to @88hiphop for sending us one of our old interviews http://goo.gl/ufe2u1.
is there a way to do multiple pledges? i did $65 yesterday for twitter. then i wanted to add on an do the $50 to meet them. does anyone know if this is possible for both?
@robert dorn - the dan lish print is a option.  we're working on a few other designs as well.  maybe we'll let y'all vote on it
@adrian pinderhughes - we're working on it, stay tuned
please let me know if a $100 reward is added so we can get a plus 1 to the listening party.
love you de la soul!  props to da inner sound y'all
@eastpointvet - i'm pretty sure you can purchase as many of the options as you want.
i would love that as a shirt option
what's the t-shirt design? is it the same as the dan lish print? because that would be nice on a black t.
there were just talkin bout this on beatminerz radio on ustream an tunein radio... http://www.ustream.tv/beatminerz-radio…
i'm a so happy this happening. been a fan since potholes/plug tunin. once again you guys are changing the game. can't wait to hear this.
i got the tier i wanted but i also want all of the thumb drives there should be an add on feature so we can get those as well
my all time favorite rap group! i've seen you guys live about 3 times so far, and had the pleasure of meeting all of you. really cool down to earth cats. i'm hype for the new album and can't wait.
no way could i choose between pas, mase, and tru for the thumb drives - glad i didn't have to! y'all started rocking my small-town world back in the daisy age and haven't stopped since. love it that you're still making music. can't wait until september when you rock my world again!
wow - just, wow ...
you guys rock!  i got to hear you live a 100 years ago at guildford college.  you were shut down by the police.
so excited to be a small part of this. had pleasure of meeting maseo and a few of their techs and watch him on his mpc, it was insane. ill pay to hear more of that anyday. best of luck gentlemen.
very, very proud of you guys. and so happy to support your new endeavor.  much love from amityville!
congrats! been eagerly anticipating - you're welcome - as i have every albums since 3ft high and rising. like many around the world you stand alone in my category of greatest of all time. honored to be part of this project. most of all congrats and sincere thanks for remaining a group.
@jorel levenson thanks for the info! @derrick rzl soundbites festival was dope, thanks for rockin' with us for all these years
congrats on exceeding your goal, i been rockin' with y'all since the daisy age & potholes & copped every album at some point. was fortunate enough to meet y'all twice & recently when you did a show in mississauga....(err um thats on the outskirts of t.o, for doz who don't know) when this campaign was announced, i totally got it & understood how it fit into the de la brand & vision. i was schooling some cats on how y'all & native tongues have always been ahead of the game & on the cutting edge art + technology and people are just catching up. here's hoping your campaign reaches a gazillion dollars & hope y'all keep rockin' for another 50+ years. thx for inspiring me and creating the background music to my adolescence. p.s -> keeping my fingers crossed for a crowdfunded native tongues album + concert...
@de la soul, if people want multiple pledge levels can they pledge for more than one and select which pledges they want after the campaign? a lot of kickstarters use backer kit to do stuff like that. it allows people to pledge more things if they want... https://www.backerkit.com/
@mikebgh - yeah, you'll have to buy the listening party tier, it's not included in the $350 tier @dave lee - sorry dave, no +1's, we'll look into making a +1 option
@richard spice your really going to dig it
@soul sister what up!
guess i will be creating a second account to get the listening party as well.
i just hooked myself with the listening / meet & greet reward, fellas.  can't wait for the new album! clearing my fall schedule now but please keep in mind the start of the nfl season - we don't want papa maseo to miss out on watching his son play (ahem).  hey, fridays are fun days, right! :)
is there a date set for the listening party?
so if i did the 350$ level do i have to also get the 50$ for the listening party? or do all the previous backers above the 50$ level get tix?
love de la soul and glad to support the new stuff. i take it the new $50 level includes only one ticket to the party? any chance of adding another option so we can bring a +1? can't wait for the album!
love the new listening party reward. i originally pledged $65. is there a way to combine that? thanks!
pleased to be involved , soundtracked my life and it's been far too long since the last one !
salutation to all the de la fans out there. hopefully we'll see some streaming live action and a good dose of the de la souls dougout with vinny merlot...
hiphop's dopest to ever done it, doing it again...thank u, we need "much more" #delaforever
a few of the greatest to ever do it. very much looking forward to the new material. salute, salutery, salutations.
dope work from p fine to now.i definitely support you guys
congrats on reaching your goal and happy to be a part of history, you guys have always repped strong island and you do us all proud!!!! cant wait for this album to come out:)
what up fellas... happy to contribute to this project. pz. -scott buckets
so excited to be a part of this...fan since we were all in high school!
i am beyond excited for this. de la!
congrats on making the goal.  i had no doubt. many people love you guys as much as i do. you have been my soundtrack for so much of my life.  it is cool to be able to assist in you making your future work. many blessings!
loved them from the beginning and happy to make a contribution - met all 3 before a concert at f.i.t. in manhattan (1998) and they were so cool......also i still can't believe they gave away all their music last valentines day - if they opened a restaurant i would eat there, if they made a car i would drive it - i am also hoping they run as a 3 headed president - i will vote for them
did my part! real hip hop!
wow - that was fast!
from "potholes" to "millie" to "rock co flow"..you brother have always embodied our culture with love and respect..everytime i would stop by 91and 1st ave..i looked forward to seeing ya'll..many occasions pos and i would build on current events or lessons...it was always a pleasure..all the best..your brother..lamel watson(hardcore righteousness 90.3fm whcr)...peace
set up a kickstarter purely so i could be a part of de la's history. nuff respect.
you opened up the music form that i love for me. happy to back it, can't wait to cop the wax. come play in southsea, uk! pleeeaaasssee?
i had the pleasure of communicating with de la in the past as i owned the first website dedicated to de la soul starting in 1994. i was contacted by dave to run delasoul.com and i had to turn it down.. maybe a big mistake? in any case, happy to support. much love - hurricane
been with you guys since the beginning!  love that you're still innovators!  and thank you for my nike running music!!! ps.tony mckissick:  it's spelled "tuhs eht lleh pu."  now read it backwards.  but i still don't know how many times the batmobile caught a flat….
done!
it is a privilege to support such an exciting and innovative project. good luck guys and i look forward to hearing the end product.
proud to support this!!! big up vinny merlot!!!
yay! you reached your goal in less than 24 hours, congrats!!! <3
thanks kickstarter & de la soul for this amazing opportunity
proud and happy to support anything de la is working on. been listening to them since i was in junior high.  they're the soundtrack to my life.  can't wait for more music.
any plans for a high resolution download 24/96 or higher?
no hesitation when it comes to supporting an integral contributor of hip hop & music history. have a blast making the record, guys. "i heard the party's round here, right? you know that's right! dinninit. yo! hey, hey, hey."
since 3 feet high, i've been a supporter and really happy to see you guys as strong as ever. look forward to project, love the idea.
so glad to contribute and help to make this possible but... does this mean no premiere/pete rock mixtape?
so excited for this. i am a fan and collector of all things de la soul. blessed to see you guys host lyricist lounge, do the spitkicker tour, i even got to work with kenny c on the spitkicker shirts (even though they were chosen in the end). of course i'm supporting this. cannot wait, i will gladly back artists for all the hard work they do, especially you guys. do your thing! i see someone bought the skit, you know if you need  backup plan i am a hour away from nyc. shit, i just realized i geeked out. oh well, this is one thing i don't mind being online for all of eternity. thanks fellas!
native tongues were such a big part of why i love hip-hop to this day and pos is just a down ass dude.
you introduced me to hip-hop when i was a kid, i didn't even speak english but i knew the lyrics! great to see you back, love.
love you guys and all the positivity that you have shared with the world. i can't wait for the dopeness that this new album will birth into the world of hip-hop!
i've supported you guys since 3 feet, but this pledge is my thank you for your valentine's day gift when you gave us the whole damn catalog for free. i've seen people complaining about you being in the biz and that you should be able to fund this by yourself... the problem is that people don't realize the reason you gave all of that music away is because of the samples used and how that hindered you guys from really earning any money on that old catalog. as a fellow kickstarter who put his own money behind his product for years, the kickstarter finally made my company viable. it's simply another step in the funding process. the most important thing is, this is not free money. you are going to have to get that album recorded, pay the performers, pay the studio time, pack and ship cds and follow up with tweet packages. that is going to take a lot of energy!!!!! today's math is understanding cypher abbt understanding. those who support you understand what you're doing.
sorry about that that comment! just excited!
man! been listening to you guys since 1988. heard you first on black gods of metropolis on 88.1 kdhx in st. louis. next saw the video on mtv raps a little while later. i jump on the kickstarter because is you! and also after seeing the line up of little dragon, david byrne, and david albarn. thanks for showing that up older catz can still throw down and show these kids how a hip-hop artist does work. (thanks for being my sample idols as well! starting sampling on an atari 800 xl and moved to an atari 520 st!)  nuff said! by the way, what does "tish et el la pooh" mean?
really existed about this, i grew up on '3 feet high and rising' and i met the guys back stage at y-not last year, amazing can't wait.
repaying you for the inspiration your music served on me at a young age. make this one the best yet guys! please visit soon? love from england, uk.
i don't know why you can't select and pledge for multiple packages, but this project is so good i had no option but to create a 2nd account and get back in there! great work guys!!
the love that hip-hop is gonna show you is going to be astronomical!!! you're more than 2/3 to your goal and it's only day 1!! if anyone deserves it, it's y'all.
wow. just wow. great idea. how quickly this is being snapped goes to show the love.
great news. love from germany.
it's all love!! we will not be waiting long for the full backing. all we are waiting for is the album!! thank you @wearedelasoul subwoofers at the ready!! :d
is the digital download going to be in flac format is well as mp3? i'd like the highest quality files.
holy shit!! half way there in 3.5 hours!!!
wonderful news. yo i'm happy to add my print to the offerings chaps. http://leighpearce.com/portfolio_page/de-la-soul-bestival-screen-print/
amazing stuff, so easy to pledge big for projects like these…i'll be shocked if the gaol isn't reached by this evening. can't wait to hear the new album. peace!
this is awesome guys!!! i know you'll meet your goal in 3 days!!! it's the magic number!!! ;-) god bless & continued success!!! can't wait to hear your masterpiece!!! :-)
