i am so excited!!!! i hope to buy a whole collection for my son. there's so many possibilities with your toys. you could make gender-neutral dolls, cross-cultural dolls, dolls with disabilities...endless possibilities for awesome dolls and social awareness!
@ sharon aschenbrenner: woo goo!! we are so excited! thank you!
yay! *jumps up and down* congrats katie and kristen! i'm really looking forward to getting a behind the scenes look at the producing of these cool action dolls! way to go!
