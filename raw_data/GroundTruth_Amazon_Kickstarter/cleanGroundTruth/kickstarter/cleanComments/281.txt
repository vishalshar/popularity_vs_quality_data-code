hi glen, thanks for your message and we're very sorry for the additional fedex charge, we didn't know about this until now too. we're happy to provide you with a full refund for this amount, we'll pm you the details. thanks again. shaun
guys, i received and enjoyed my snacks. today in the mail i got a bill in the mail from fedex for $77 and i did not enjoy that. whats seems really out of whack in addition to the fedex extortion of charging $60  to clear the package through customs is the fact that you folks valued the goods @$280 dollars. seriously? 200 dollars for the snacks, $40 for the hat and $40 for a bandana? your snacks were tasty but i am regretting it now.
hi ryan thanks for your message. we actually never received your shipping address, so if you could please email that to shout@kooeesnacks.com we'll send it out tomorrow! thanks very much. shaun
hey there, i never received my kooee! order.  could you please look into what happened?  thanks, ryan
thanks for letting us know guys!
just got mine today woo! its delicious thanks shaun
congratulations you guys on an amazing ks campaign. can't wait to try your product and continue to spread the word. well done! :)
thanks mitch, can't wait to send some out to you!
can't wait to get my hands on this! looks amazing.
sampled kooee at the markets and it was a taste explosion in my mouth. compared to other 'natural' jerky products this wins hands down as it actually is full of goodness with no badness added. let's all help get this product to market (selfish reasons).
tried this in the pre-production run and it is awesome. going to kill the jerky / trail mix market.
wow! this product looks amazing! i can't wait to have some!
