the rock radio station in my area i listen to does not venture out when it comes to new rock music anymore.  on mashable.com, there is an article that was written in 2013 called, "how we discover music."  this is the link: http://mashable.com/2013/07/10/sol-republic-music-infographic/ . based on the statistics of the article, radio is the number one way we discover music.  yes the internet is great with all these internet radio stations, however the local rock station in my area is not catching on.  i want this documentary to inspire the radio stations like the one i listen to. watching just the trailer, i hope marco's story will inspire djs in local radio to explore and venture out with music.  the current rock station sounds more classic as the years pass.  there is debate that rock is dead.  when i listen to the rock station in my area, i would have to agree. i feel local djs are just putting out the mainstream stuff and not evolving listeners by introducing them to artists that are not mainstream.
