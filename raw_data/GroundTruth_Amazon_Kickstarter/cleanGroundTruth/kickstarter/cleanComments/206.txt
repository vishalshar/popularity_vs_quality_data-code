the universal  plug is coming in sep/ oct and it will serve all country's vere exciting....
the wattage for the plug is up to 1250 watts, and the usb total of 10a
also, what is the specs for the entire unit? how much wattage can it handle simultaneously?
+1 for the universal sockets for the three front  sockets. also what are the specs on the 9 charging ports?
@creator - this looks amazing product, very useful on high outlet/usb needs... few suggestions that i was wondering the possibilities: 1. can you offer this to international backers? limited to usa/canada may not be enough to get your funding... 2. what are the possibilities of universal sockets on the 3 front sockets? i can understand a single plug to be at it is, since not every country can support the same plug, but at least bring universal sockets, this way backer can always be use it internationally with electronics everywhere, or is this only limited to 110v?
