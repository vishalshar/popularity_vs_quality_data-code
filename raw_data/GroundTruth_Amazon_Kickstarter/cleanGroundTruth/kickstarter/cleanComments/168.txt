@odon, we only have a pc version of the firmware update now unfortunately.  sorry about this.
how do we update firmware on the beddi  on a mac??? i don't have a pc and the file uploaded is an .exe file.... any suggestions?
i'm a backer of 4 beddi's on kickstarter. i keep having problems with the beddi's. even after the november firmware update, bluetooth is very unstable and most of the time i do not wake up with music (as intended) but with the alarm sound. sometimes this even happes when bluetooth is still up and running, but still no music (spotify). other then that, both me as my family members are experiencing complete freezes of the beddi. when you power cycle the beddi, it works again, but it looses some of the basic settings unfortunately, so it's very inconvenient. all-in-all, i love the conceptâ€‹, i generally like the beddi, but i cannot rely enough on it and therefor the total experience so far has been disappointing unfortunately. is there any news on updates that might overcome these issues?
i have a brand new unopened  beddi message me if you want to buy
anyone looking to buy another beddi? i am no longer in need of the one i got via kickstarter. send me a message if you are interested.
is there is a way to customize and set the alarm when log pres sing the middle bar, the digital clock will automatically turned off?
sometimes (often) the only way to connect to the audio by bluetooth is to power off the beddi and power it back on again. then it works. but it does mean having to listen to that horrible start up jingle. anyone else have this issue? is there a fix for it please??
in the past weeks my beddi alarm multiple times woke me up around 2 am and then sometimes 1 hour later again, while i had set the alarm around 7 am, the only alarmsetting that i have in the app. is there a solution for this? i already unplugged it and started it up again, but that doesn't work.
@witti dimming it completely means i'm not actually using the beddi :) i backed it primarily as a clock, you see. a cool option would be to set a timer on the dimmer, so i could set the clock to be turned off when i go to sleep and go back to the lowest setting during the night so it's useful when i wake up.
update the firmware, we'll see if it is better. it would have been nice to have an easier way to update the firmware.  if the app is meant to be used in portrait, then don't let me put it into landscape. of course i still can't edit the 3rd button because it is behind the 4 buttons at the bottom of the screen and i can't scroll it up. only 4 alarms? this seems like a horrible limitation. but there doesn't appear to be any way to delete an alarm.  an alarm should be much easier to set up. let me set the defaults, so i don't have to reset everything every time i set an alarm. there are too many clicks i need to make to set an alarm, it is more complicated than it needs to be. the radio is difficult to use. i can only increase or decrease the the frequency by .1? i can do a search, but if i don't want to do a search it becomes almost impossible to find a station. give me a dial, a slider, or at least enter the numbers directly. put a range on the frequency. i was down to 50khz! before i accidently turned the phone, resetting everything! why does turned the phone reset anything? the radio widget isn't very helpful, as apparently all i can do is turn it on or off. i can't change the channel. these are just the issues i found when using the app for a couple of minutes.
@ben, sorry, this is the lowest settings at the moment.  perhaps you can dim it completely? @courtney, are you doing a fresh install or app update?  there is a issue with the current app due to some code that was added to accommodate ios10 (fresh install). we have submitted a fix already and we expect it will be available for download early next week. a current workaround is the following: 1) unplug beddi  2) kill the beddi app and restart, and go to step 2 (select your beddi screen)  3) plug beddi back in  4) "beddi" should show up and you can click on "connect" to proceed please contact us at support@wittidesign.com if you are still experiencing issues.  thanks
@chris, sorry to hear about the problem.  can you try to update the firmware (http://www.wittidesign.com/en/firmware).  the app is meant to be used in portrait mode except in widget (please make sure your location service is turned on).  we only allow to set up to 4 alarms at the moment, and there is a button to delete the alarm at the bottom of each alarm settings (please view in portrait mode).
hi there, i don't know if it is because the new ios update, but the app no longer connects to my beddi...it is currently displaying the wrong time and all i am able to do is connect it to bluetooth nothing more...please help whenever you are able
i can't use my beddi as the lowest clock light setting still makes my room look like a football field at night. is there any hope for the dimming settings to go even lower in the future?
for the third time in the last couple of weeks my "alarm" clock failed to wake me up, as the alarm failed. please fix the alarm issues. it would be nice to fix some of the bugs in the app as well... it doesn't like to rotate (if it rotates the screen turns blank) it doesn't like to scroll (or scroll enough) in landscape mode i can't edit all the alarm properties, i can't seem to add more than 4 alarms, and i can't delete any of them. alarms take too much work to set up. what is "dim on rotate"? why would i want to dim on rotate? the cloth over the clock is a horrible idea, either the clock is too dim to see during the day, or too bright at night. the light is cool (the reason i bought it) but it isn't as configurable as it should be, and it doesn't turn off automatically. but the alarm itself needs to be more robust.
hi patrick, sorry to hear that spotify isn't working as expected.  can you please us the log to investigate? instructions to send the log:    1) go to general settings -> about -> log    2) enable logging    3) repeat the setup & error steps    4) send out log.  please make sure to include a description of error in email.      5) you can disable log after email is sent
thanks for your quick response on delivery, just got my beddi and have a quick test with beddi app, unfortunately spotify seems have some issues, it just keep loading only, fail to connect with spotify with beddi apps
@all, sorry for the late reply @olivier, the white light is limited by hardware unfortunately, sorry that it's not bright enough for you.  we are keep modifying the app to improve the beddi experience so it will be "less beta".  thanks @sarah, please contact us at support@wittidesign.com if you have shipping inquiries.  thanks @patrick, please contact us at support@wittidesign.com if you have shipping inquiries.  thanks @rachael, can you try to restart beddi by unplugging/replugging it?   please contact us at support@wittidesign.com if you are still having issues.  thanks
the bluetooth connection on my clock is no longer working, the alarm clock never shows up in the device list for the app so i cannot change alarms or preferences. also, spotify has never worked for me even when the bluetooth connection did work.
unfortunately i am in need of some extra cash and looking to sell my beddi. i have all the packing and can ship to canada or the us. send me a message if you are interested in buy it.
i still have not received my beddi ?? when can i expect it??
i received an email asking me how i am enjoying my beddi but i have not received it. so how can i survey something i do not have to review.
i've been using my beddi for a while now and while it works it still feels a bit "beta". my biggest disappointment is the power of the wake up light. even at maximum brightness it's still not very bright and nowhere near the philips wakeup light that i was looking to replace. i would say it's not enough to actually get the body response that is needed for a more relaxt waking up. the mood light is also kind of dim so sadly no reading in bed with just the mood light. on the software side there is one thing that i'd like to see changed. when snoozing the alarm the wake up light also turns off. in order to actually have a benefit of the light there should be an option to have it stay on during snoozing so you can wake up further.  other than this i like the beddi but i'd like to see it mature a bit.
@scott, we have updated the weather info already and should have been more accurate.  are you using the latest app?  otherwise, can you do a screenshot of weather on beddi, weather from openweatherapi.org, and from a trust site?  can email them to us at support@wittidesign.com  if you want traffic in landscape mode, please go to general settings -> widget view -> select weather & traffic.  for spotify alarm, did you connect bluetooth audio before  you sleep? @oscar, there is no official google music api, so we cannot access google music from beddi app.  you can use "bluetooth music" as alarm and it will play google music if that's the last player used.
how can i use google music with the alarm? i want to play a playlist as alarm sound (like is it possible to do with spotify).
sorry...i wish they notified when responses to questions were received. i am using ios on an iphone 6. weather and traffic never seem to be right. it was showing a temperature in the 60s last night and it was far from it out here in los angeles. and as i mentioned, being in los angeles, traffic is rarely the same everyday. i am looking at the weather in both portrait and landscape but the traffic in only portrait. i will check it in landscape and see if it updates. i love the clock itself, though the alarm with spotify still doesn't work and i do understand that that is a marriage with spotify thing and not you guys, per say. i just wish the app would show accurate info for weather and traffic. i'll check back in. i really do appreciate how fast and transparent you guys have been. - scott
@austin, we have updated the weather info, can you see whether it's more accurate now?  the alarm data is shown on app only.  we are working on smartthings, in the meantime, you can use the ifttt maker channel option @raphael, thanks for the encouragement @ludek, we will add this in future @robin, weather should work.  please make sure you enable location service.  traffic uses google data.  we will do a workaround for china later
received black and withe beddiï¼Œbut it didn't support china weather and trafficï¼Œupsetã€‚
would be possible to add in the app some quick choices for address where traveling in the morning (work1, work2, etc.)? im managing and traveling to 3 locations and its not so comfortable to change it every evening by deleting whole existing and typing new address.. otherwise the function itself is pretty cool... thanks for an answer
**both**
@witti, noth beddi received. works great, love it. thank you for a wonderful device.
@witti just as a heads up, i have the iphone 6 plus with an otterbox, and my phone doesn't fit properly in the dock. the phone with the case is a hair to big to fit (without forcing it in there, even then, it partially fits at an odd angle).  my weather widget never displays the correct temperature.  is there a way for me to know if an alarm is set by looking at the clock, that would be very beneficial.  is your team still working on smartthings integration? any thoughts on pandora integration? thanks!
@ciscomancer, we don't have a forum yet.  you can email us at support@wittidesign.com if you have any suggestions/questions.  thanks @mike, there is an error at our server and we are fixing that.  thanks for your patience and sorry for the inconvenience caused.
@creator my weather box in the app has stopped working. it is a solid blue box that doesn't display anything. i've tried basic troubleshooting. location is on. unplugged the beddi. uninstalled the app and reinstalled. nothing helps.
have had my unit for about a week now and it is a really nice product! i have had a few of the issues listed in the comments here but i have found a quick unplug and reset with phone will fix. is there a better forum to make feature requests? thank you!
@brecht, glad the new beddi is working.  enjoy! @sarah, sorry to hear that.  can you please email us screenshots of your alarm settings to support@wittidesign.com.  thanks
@witti i have now had 3 weekends in a row where i have set alarms for the saturday or sunday morning, and they just do not go off. i have checked and double checked everything, i have even changed all my calendar settings so notifications don't override the app, and still no weekend alarm. i've had to start setting alarms on my second phone as a back up. the alarm works every weekday, but never on the saturday or sunday. the dashboard tells me that the alarm is set for the next morning, i go to sleep, and the next morning - no alarm.
thanks for providing a great product/customer service. after receiving a defect unit, i got an instant replacement. enjoying beddi now :-) awesome customer service!
hi scott, are you using ios?  and do you refer to the traffic info on dashboard (when your phone is in portrait mode)?  we are working on changing the backend service to include traffic info.  have you seen the traffic on widget mode (when your phone is in landscape mode)?  does that work
thanks for the feedback! on more question...traffic to work never changes...it always says 35 minutes and out here in la, traffic never stays that consistent. is this known issue as well?
@christina, can you try to unplug/replug your beddi to see whether the "long press" issue is fixed?  if you tap on the notifications on the phone (which will turn on beddi app), it should turn off the beep sound.  wiil check on the link, thanks for pointing it out @george, does that happen every thing? can you send us the log please?    1) go to general settings -> about -> log    2) enable logging    3) repeat the error steps    4) send out log.  please make sure to include a description of error in email.      5) you can disable log after email is sent
new app release bug report: setting up a white noise to a smart button with zero timer and save leads to crash of the app.
i just unpacked my beddi and it looks and feels great and i am looking forward to try and use it. i have a couple of questions (apologies if these have already been addressed, i have just read comments posted the last week): when i long press (on smart button 3) there are two beeps and then it starts to play the spotify list i have programmed for a single press. i have tried and tried, but cannot get this long press to work. when i instead program the long press to white light, the light is turned on and then the spotify playlist programmed for a single press begins to play. how do i turn off the find iphone beep (currently the only way i've found is closing the app)? if there is a power outage, is there a battery in the clock to ensure the alarm will go off as projected? in the leaflet that accompanied the clock (very well laid out and easy to understand), the qr link for the video seems to lead to the app download (just so you know).
@michael, "traffic for smart button" is on our to-do list.  thanks @scott, we are working on making spotify more stable.  their sdk is giving us some trouble on connection.  thanks for your patience @raphael, thank you very much for your patience and feedback.  we are working hard to improve beddi experience, and your help is much appreciated.
@witti, the log team did reach out today. thank you for the quick response. your team have been great with keeping ppl posted and assisting those with questions / concerns. awaiting for my beddi.  thanks
hi...i have set up a few alarms and they never seem to play the correct sound (spotify playlist) and always play the typical alarm beeps. what am i doing wrong???
is there a way to set one of the buttons so it says current travel time out loud?
@nil, raphael, our logistic team will reach out soon with shipment status @sn, i hope the kids will enjoy it! @mike, you need spotify premium account to work with beddi.  this is because spotify only gives 3rd party app access to premium users. thanks
@creator i am not using spotify premium. i have tried everything from uninstalling both apps (beddi and spotify). i have logged in and out numerous times. i have unplugged the beddi and plugged it back in. uninstalled the apps again and restarted my phone. nothing works.
received my white beddi a few hours after my last post. can't wait to present these as back to school gifts to the kiddos!
witti, i am also curious to know if you are able to find out any information about shipping / tracking? i have not received either. thank you
hey guys! i did not received my beddi yet. i received neither a tracking number or an email. i heard that many backers have already obtained their beddi. whats wrong?
@jonathan, we received your email and our team is studying.  we will email you on our findings later @koen, we got your email and our team is studying.  we will email you on our findings later @steven, we will see whether this is possible.  but pressing the snooze bar will dim/cycle through the light brightness @chris, glad your problem is solved @mike, are you using spotify premium @maxime, can you turn on the white light via app (just to make sure the light is not broken).  when you set the alarm, did you turn on the wake up light option?
hi, the wakeup light doesn't seem to start before my alarm even though i set it up so it starts 15 min before the alarm. is that a known issue? aside of that love my beddi.
spotify is not working for me .... every time i click to set up my account information it tells me log in fails but i haven't put in my info. i've tried lots of different things and can't get it to work.
my question is already answered, saw it to late.
hi, finally tried out my beddi. really a awesome product with many features i like to have and finally get them. you did a great job on that. one question about the white noise: is it possible to time that so that it shut down automatically? i would love to use it to fall asleep. pleas go on with your work like that.
i see a comment about dimming the clock face, and while i understand that it's too late to add light sensors, is it possible to add the ability to change the clock face brightness to a preset value based on a smart button click?
hi, referring to your post from 6 days ago... i've mailed the log files. several times it seems... sorry for that. i hope it helps to figure out why i can't reconnect my beddi and have to reboot every time.
got my beddi today! love it! only one issue so far: i can see two of my wemo switches in the app but not the other two that i have. all are on the same network and controllable by the dedicated wemo app i have on the same phone as the beddi app. any ideas?
my white beddi arrived today.  i received tracking/shipping confirmation at 2 am and the beddi arrive 9 hours later.
still waiting for both of my beddi to arrive... ;(
got my white beddi yesterday. love it. easy to set up (ios).  thanks for such a great product!
@naomi, we are planning to add white noise to smart button (along with sleep timer).  this will be done in future app update. @bcm, we are working on localization; in the meantime, we are also working on an app update to make the sentence in english first.  you can turn off your phone bluetooth after you are done with setting, but bluetooth music and spotify alarm will turn to default beep sound @jeremy, our logistic team will reach out @michael, is your phone and your wemo on the same wifi network?  please email us at support@wittidesign.com @zak, glad you are enjoying your beddi.  the size of adaptor is big because we need the extra power for charging @paul, thanks for the encouragement!  it's a bit too late to add the motion sensor/light sensor for the clock face.  but we are working on the app ui for users to edit names on fm radio.  stay tuned! @charles, sorry about the miscommunication.  our logistic team will reach out.  as mentioned in our update, amazon has been sending out individual orders in multiple shipments which has caused a lot of frustration to our backers and us.  thanks for your patience @jepz, glad to hear you are enjoying your beddi.  we should be able to discover your lifx and wemo switches.  please email us at support@wittidesign.com.  thanks for your other suggestions too @sn, the white one should be coming soon too.  amazon just been splitting up the shipments. @sara, please check your email @ricky, our logistic team will reach out.  thanks @steven, glad to hear your beddi arrived safely and you are enjoying it.  we are working on longer whtie noise tracks as optional downloads.  we didn't want the initial to be too bad.  good eye on the power adaptor :)  actually the output of the power adapter can go to 3.3a, but they label is as 3a to be safe.  going up to 4a will be much bigger and more expensive.  also, when you charge a phone, it doesn't actually drain the full 2.1a or 1a.  maybe the first 20% of charging will drain more current, but then after that, it will only take in 70% of that current needed.
sorry, for anyone keeping track, i got my white beddi in toronto, canada on monday... and i did not get any tracking numbers before the package just showed up.
got my beddi, and the first thing that i've been impressed with is the sound quality. it is far above my expectation for an "alarm clock" that focuses on "smart home" functionality. the white noise generator runs very very short loops that i'm not too fond of, but i can just hook up my google music and run nature sounds off of that. one interesting question i have... the wall plug outputs 5.5v at 3a, and there are 2 usb ports on the beddi with a combined output of 3.1a... unless beddi is generating power on its own using dark magic, i assume you can't actually charge 2 phones at the same time, and get 2.1a and 1a simultaneously?
did anyone get tracking info or an email with shipping confirmation?
just got my white beddi today...but for some reason it won't turn on or sync with bluetooth...is there something i'm missing? or did i just happen to get a dud...
received my black beddi in southern california. any backers get their white beddi yet? waiting until i get both to present to my sons as a gift.
hi. got my beddi. very impressed with the product quality. connecting to my iphone was a breeze. the audio sound was better than expected.  the buttons do integrate with lifx and wemo with a caveat. the caveat is the inability to see all my lifx bulbs and wemo plugs.  your beddi app lacks a volume control to increase sound without the need to alway touch the physical buttons. further, your weather and traffic update voice assistant need a seperate volume control.  when an alarm sounds, the voice assistant uses the volume set for music which can be quite too loud.
i too am impressed except i pledged support at the 2 beddi level and was only sent 1... i sent a note to the creator(s) a couple days ago and still have not received any reply.  great product, slightly worried about back end support and attention to backer levels and shipping fulfillment...  @creator, please help & respond...  thank you.
i have to say, and maybe it's because i have had a run of lack luster or bad kickstarter products.  i am really impressed, first impressions are great.  i loved the idea and why i backed it, but admit my expectations were low.   so sorry to the team - you have done a fantastic job and they should be proud! the setup experience was great, love the app ui.  gives me the minimal but has plenty of options to tweak to get what you want. the only thing i would have said having now seen it, wished i had said during the build was to add a motion sensor so when you wave at it shows the clock.  the other thing would have to supported search for fm names etc - in uk to show radio1, radio2 etc but again small things, and guess that could be added in a software update later.
just got mine love it so far, don't have anything to integrate it with yet. only minor flaw i found us the wall outlet plugin is huge. it interferes with being able to plug in a usb into my usb wall outlet. simple fix with an extension overall very nice product.
can't get beddi to work with wemo switch, do i need to do anything special?
haven't received mine, or a shipment notification yet!
or, let your user select language on your app and produce the weather in such language only.
witti: i would like to have the whole sentence in english.  it makes more sense to everyone since english is the universal language and simply it is weird to have the sentence out in two mixed languages. it heats up because bluetooth is turned on the entire night.  can it be turned off after i set the alarm up?
i got the device yesterday and had a full day and night to use. love it and i'm proud to be a backer!! i have two questions. it states that the white noise can be added to a smart button. however when i tried add it, it wasn't an option listed. also, it's there a way to add a timer to the white noise? that way it's not on all night.
@hyunsuk, glad your beddi arrived safely and you are enjoying it.  we will sync up with you separately regarding the cable arrangement @bethany, can you please send us the log?  instructions at the bottom of this image.  we are pulling the weather data from some open source weather service @george, we have just finished localization in german for ios.  please try and let us know how it goes @f, we are working on an option to allow different timeout for widget.  stay tune! @bcm, we are working on localization, if you don't mind helping to translate to chinese, please le us know.  and when do you experience a heat up on the phone? @jake, we are working on adding an option for timeout on widget.  stay tune @willmar, i believe your problem has been solved by unplugging and replugging in beddi.  thanks @daniel, when an alarm goes off, the only 2 buttons that are functional are "snooze" bar, and the alarm off button (play/pause button).  all other buttons are unresponsive during the alarm on period. instructions to send log:    1) go to general settings -> about -> log    2) enable logging    3) repeat the error steps    4) send out log.  please make sure to include a description of error in email.      5) you can disable log after email is sent
and my phone is ios system, i am not sure if this issue also happens to the androids.
hey the beddi works great but just got a bug issue. so i set one of the smart button(single press) as turning on/off the wake up light, then i set a alarm. when the alarm goes off and the light is on, i can't press the smart button i set before to close it. and i notice i actually can't use any buttons to control beddi such as turn off the radio or dim the digital clock display. the only thing i could do is i need to set another alarm in the next minute of the current time, when it goes off in the next minute i press "close" in the pop-up window, then i could use the smart buttons normally.
i love my beddi! but i'm noticing that when i do a long press on any of the buttons the single press action happens when i release the button. does anyone have a fix for this?
how do i make it so the screen stays on when the dashboard is pulled up? mine dims after a minute or so to black, then the time display on the beddi also turns off. ios.
i just got my beddi unit this week and i like it a lot!  however, the weather reporting is very strange.  the text is in spoken english while the numbers are in spoken mandarin/putonghua.  can it be adjusted so that the whole sentence is in english.  this is so weird!  ;)  phone is always really hot and it is not that good for the phone itself.  other than those, it is pretty good so far.  thanks!
hey! i'm loving my beddi unit, but is there a way to keep the screen on with the weather? more of an always on dashboard (it ignores my timeout settings :< )
got my 2 devices today. you guys did an incredible job in every aspect. only wish other projects would feature your professionalism.  will check every feature now and report. for now the weather is spoken with a german text to speech but the weather is in english. this sounds strange when played back.
my beddi got here yesterday, and i am loving it for the most part except it keeps telling me the wrong weather? like today told me that it was 95 and cloudy, but the weather app on my phone is telling me that it's 81 and sunny. anyway to fix this? where is it pulling the  weather data from?
@wittie iphone cable for sharing on facebook hasn't arrived yet. are you shipping the cable separately from the beddi? i'm a canadian backer and already received awesome beddi yesterday :)
@ryan, please make sure you have connected to bluetooth audio @andrea, glad your beddi finally arrived safely, and glad you are enjoying it @justin, amazon is sending an order with multiple shipments for some reason and is driving us crazy too.  you will receive your beddi soon  sorry for the inconvenience caused. @aj, we are now working on to support the ifttt maker channel (https://ifttt.com/maker).  we expect to have that ready next week.  after that, we will apply our own channel. @daniel, please check your inbox @veeh, we use your current location at the moment.  we will add your suggestion to our to-do list.  thanks
@creator just got my beddi and it looks great!  just a quick question... is there a way to set a default location rather than turning on location services?
hi! i have a big problem.  i paid for delivery to my country, no problem. i haven't got the product yet.  now i've been contacted by dhl, they say that i have to pay extra to get the product, which wasn't written anywhere in your specifications, and haven't happened to me before. i am pretty disappointed... hopefully it doesn't get to feeling angry.  i want my product; and i don't want to pay more than my 95 dollars.  please give me a solution.
@witti, will we be expecting an ifttt update soon? i'd love to create some recipes for my smart buttons.
hello. i received a lightning cable from you and i'm sure you've said what this means and i'm sorry but i am wondering why just a cable?
got the resent one today! small hiccups in setting up, but otherwise been working amazing. such a cool thing you guys made and i love mine already. thanks for rolling with the snafu and getting one out to me so quickly.
i would love to! also, i noticed every now in then i'll push the smart buttons for the weather or what not and the voice will come through my phone speaker, not the beddi? any advice for that? thanks!
@colin, can you please send us the log when you are having the connection issue @laviolette, if you set up the traffic info, you can select to play traffic info during alarm setting.  if you put the phone horizontally, you should see that weather/traffic screen @jason, amazon might break up the packages, the other unit will be sent out soon @ryan, glad you like it!!  thanks
@koen, can you please send us the log to further investigate?  thanks 1) go to general settings -> about -> log    2) enable logging    3) repeat the error steps    4) send out log.  please make sure to include a description of error in email.      5) you can disable log after email is sent
got mine today! love it!
i also order 2 and received one..  sent a note to  cs..  hope they  fix it..
thank you beddi for contacting and solving my issues. i have a question how to get the notification when to leave to arrive on time. how to get the screen, like you see on the video, when you place your phone on the dock? thank you
@koen and @witti, i'm having a similar issue re-connecting. sometimes i have to reboot the beddi, other times it takes a couple minutes to connect- either way it's a pain.
@witti, referring to your question 22 hours ago: "@koen, that's not the expected behaviour, we just wanted to analyze. did that solve that problem? and does it happen again after you walk in and out of range? thanks" no. again, the problem is it does not reconnect after walking in and out of range. i'm not talking about bt audio. here is what i do - turn on beddi - launch the app, the list at startup shows one beddi - connect to beddi - walk out of range - walk in range, launch the app - the list with devices remains empty only when i unplug the unit and plug it back in, it shows up in the list at the apps launch. -
@witti thanks for dnd comment.  i'm happy with way it works but i would try and test that cable power is plugged in so it doesn't drain the battery overnight! another thought is can you check there is a live feed for bt source if used as an alarm? obviously down to user app setup error otherwise. i had tuneup radio set as last thing the beddi was playing on a sleep timer but it just didn't play anything come morning so alarm was silent.  if you could check bt source had volume and if not default to beep would be great fail-safe!
@jo, i think you mean turn "off" the alarm?  you can press the "play/pause" button to do that.  thanks
is it only possible to turn the alarm clock through the phone or can i do it through the beddi?
@jonny, thanks for your feedback and the dnd issue.  we will add that to faq.  for the beddi screen in landscape mode, currently we don't have a way to turn the screen off (we already dim to the lowest brightness).  another option is to just lock the screen, but then we cannot unlock it when alarm goes off.  we are still trying to find a good way and welcome any suggestions.  thanks
thanks beddi. it's a real neat device so well done! i mentioned below about "do not disturb" not kicking in. if the beddi app is running and the screen just dims when placed sideways on the beddi then phone still pushed out alerts.  that said there is a further option in ios settings allowing you to untick "only when phone is locked". you may therefore want to mention this in your faq.  when the beddi screen fades it is still on (just black colour) so shows a faint hue at nighttime. i would still much rather the screen switches off completely. is that not possible?
@koen, that's not the expected behaviour, we just wanted to analyze.  did that solve that problem?  and does it happen again after you walk in and out of range?  thanks @sue, sorry about the scaling sound, and do let us know if it comes back.  maybe it's an issue with a brand new speaker only.  the clock has 5 brightness settings limited by hardware (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, off).  we will see whether there is anything we can do at this moment.  thanks
received our 2 beddis and just love them!!. very easy to setup and we really love the mood lighting. only had 2 minor issues. 1 unit on the first night made a "scaling" sound at about 11.38pm. then again at 12:15am. i was concerned that this was going to be an ongoing thing, but 3 days later it hasn't happened again so guess it was just settling in...! 2nd issue is more of a tweak for update. even on the "dimmest" clock setting we are finding it a bit to bright. we live in the country so there are no outside street lights etc so its very dark in our room. the sliding setting bar seems to have a big "jump" between the dimmest setting and off. apart from that we are very happy with the units you have created. great work...!!
@witti : i refer to my question and your answer respectively 16 and 11 hours ago. that's what i do. unplug unit, reconnect. but i don't think that's the expected behaviour?
@daryl, glad beddi arrived safely, and you got everything setup!  enjoy!
i got mine today, delta, bc, canada super easy setup, already connected to nest, hue and wemo, love the white noise feature! smaller than i expected which is fantastic!
@ken, amazon has broken some order into separate shipment.  your beddi is on its way. @ryan, great, hope you will enjoy it! @daniel, glad beddi has arrived safely and you are enjoying it.  beddi doesn't come with any cable.  the cable was a gift for super early backers who shared our campaign.
does the beddi unit includes a apple lighting cable? cause i didn't received one. btw beddi looks amazing!
got my tracking number for beddi today! usa, backer 211!
i received a usb apple cable today  but no beddi.
@koen, thanks for the compliment.  when you walk out and back in range, beddi app should auto-reconnect to beddi (the control part, not the audio part).  if you have trouble reconnecting, can you try to unplug beddi, wait 5s, then plug in beddi again to see whether problem persists.  thanks!
thanks for a well run campaign. looking forward to use the beddi but there seems to be a connection issue. i use an iphone 5. i turn the unit on, connect through bluetooth. i walk out of bt range. i walk back in bt range: the device can't be found. it doesn't show in the list on starting the app. it does show in my iphone's bt devices list but the iphone asks to turn the beddi on. i assume that's not expected behaviour? i have no issue on my pebble: it connects when my phone is nearby. the beddi, alas, doesn't. any fix possible? what do i do wrong?
@jonny, sorry to hear that.  we should not have the power to override that settings in our app.  can you provide us with a bit more detail on your phone status at night?  you can email us at support@wittidesign.com @janelle, yes, you will get 2 cables & 2 beddi.  we are not sure why amazon is sending the same order separately.  sorry for the inconvenience caused. @ian, we are checking to see whether we can further dim the light on the clock face.  thanks
@adam, so it allows you to re-enter your username and password?  can you please send us the error log 1) go to general settings -> about -> log  2) enable logging  3) repeat the error steps  4) send out log. please make sure to include a description of error in email.  5) you can disable log after email is sent
my beddi has arrived now, however, are you able to modify the app (android) to allow the clock to dim even more than it already does?i like to sleep in a room that is dark as possible but even on the lowest setting it is still way too bright. a few of my friends have also taken a look at mine and when they find out that it doesn't dim low enough, immediately they decide that they no longer like it.if there is a way that you can make it dim even lower then that would be great. otherwise i will have to pull it apart and try and add some diffuse or colour gel over the clock to make it dim more.
hello again, i received a witti usb cable today but no beddi? since i ordered 2 i figured i would receive 2 cables? i guess the beddi will be coming separately? just want to make sure the shipments were broken out with the cables being shipped separately....
mmm. so the ios app keeps the phone on and ignores the "do not disturb" settings so emails ping all night long! needs a fix ;)
@witti. got the latest app. still getting 'failed to log in spotify' error.
@diederik, are you using spotify premium account?  thanks
@adam, please make sure you have the latest app.  once you log out, you should be able to log in with different user account @andrea, in future, please send us email at support@wittidesign.com for shipment related issues. we will look into this and get back to you @ryan, all data has been uploaded to amazon, and i know they are starting to ship out some products!  they will send out an email to you once yours has shipped out!
@diederik, can you please help to send us the log?  using the following steps? 1) go to general settings -> about -> log    2) enable logging    3) repeat the error steps    4) send out log.  please make sure to include a description of error in email.      5) you can disable log after email is sent
have us shipments started? :d
the address it was mailed to is incorrect. i had updated my address 2 times and was told it was input in the system.
i have a small issue. in the setup, i mistyped my spotify login. now i can't correct it. i tried closing the app and did a reinstall. can you help?
i have setup the spotify smart button with a playlist from my spotify account however nothing happens when pressing the button. also when choosing as wake up alarm a spotify playlist is will not play it (just beeps). spotify works fine when i choose a playlist myself. any suggestions ?
@all backers:  if you have any shipping inquiry (tracking number, custom issues, missing product, wrong plugs, etc), please help to email us at support@wittidesign.com .  most of the time shipment information involves personal data so we do not want to disclose those information publicly.  also, consolidating to one email address will help us get back to everyone quicker.  thank you for your understanding and support
@adam, glad beddi arrives safely and hope you enjoy it! @ben, for future shipping inquiry, please email us at support@wittidesign.com for quicker response.  anyway, we are arranging your 2nd unit.  thanks @tay, we got your email and will reply there.  thanks
i received a notification email from dhl that my item was stuck at my country's custom department, and the custom department need a full technical specifications sheet in order to release the item to me. i have searched all over your website (www.wittidesign.com) but i can't find any spec sheet there. can you please provide me one? thank you.
received mine yesterday, looks great! but was expecting two? as i had bought a second as an add-on later?
just got mine. (melbourne, australia) can't wait to get them home and set them up. thanks for a great campaign.
@laviolette, glad beddi has arrived safely.  we have sent you an email regarding your issue, please check @janelle, all orders have been submitted to amazon and they should be sent out within this week @diederik, we are arranging the 2nd unit as we mentioned in email.   sleep mode -- when you go to sleep and listen to music, when sleep mode time is up, beddi will turn off the music/light that is playing  nap mode -- when you want to take a nap, and when the nap mode time is up, then beddi will play the alarm sound. @daniel, elias, we will reach out about sending the appropriate plug.  sorry for the inconvenience caused.
i have the same problem as daniel fÃ¼lling, i also sent a pm about it
hey, i just received my beddi today and the look and feel is great. however, i received the wrong power supply (australian instead of german/schuko). since the voltage is kind of weird (5.5v) i was yet unable to find a suitable replacement. any suggestions?
i received my beddi yesterday and it looks great! i was expecting two beddi's as i backed and payed for another beddi in the survey. when can i expect the second beddi to arrive ? another question what does the sleep and nap button do ?
any word on when all us shipments to go out? i live in texas and havent received any shipment confirmation yet, i can't wait to receive mine! :)
received my beddi today in paris the product is really nice i don't know why i thought it was bigger. i really like this size.  i have a small issue with the app the location of the weather is incorrect and i can't change the traffic when i try to change it the app turns off  i hope it will be fixed

@roelof, glad beddi arrives safely @ian, sorry about this, we will keep an eye on the balance shipments.  please let us know if you have trouble receiving your beddi @tim, please email us at support@wittidesign.com to see what supporting document you will need.  thanks
hi, my beddi ended up at german customs.  they want a value proof  - how should i proceed? best tim
despite my address being listed as perth and having a post code of 6000 in backerkit, my item ended up with the suburb listed as sydney yet the postcode remains the perth one of 6000 (perth is on the other side of australia). as a result my item is being shipped to the wrong address in sydney. i have since contacted dhl and provided them with the correct address (and will probably take an extra few days now), however, you might want to find out where the error in the address occurred and make sure it hasn't happened to anyone else or will not happen again.
received my beddi and it looks great (netherlands).
@creator thanks for that.  looking forward to them arriving in australia.
@adam, the international (non-us) orders are being shipped out.  the goods are being sent from hong kong via courier, so south east asia, australia will probably be 1st to get them, and i know some european countries are starting to receive them too.  the us ones will be sent out this week via amazon. @melvin, thank you for supporting us on both of our products!  the app issue is very embarrassing as we have been testing it for months, and suddenly the weather service changed some of their code which lead to the crash.  anyway, we have already submitted a fix to app store and hopefully it will be approved by apple soon
received my beddi last night. the build quality is really good just as the notti was. just want to feedback that the app is still quite buggy and crashes. hope you guys fix it soon. otherwise great job!
which countries have got theirs already?
@draganov, jordy -- it's an issue with fetching weather (for some reason the weather service changed something on their end), which is why it works periodically.  anyway, our dev team has already submitted a fix to app store, and hopefully it will be released in couple of days so please look out for an app update.  sorry for the inconvenience caused. @michiel, the alarm sound is incremental so the sound will get louder.  alarm volume is also adjustable in general settings -> alarm general settings -> alarm volume @kyp, if you press the play/pause button, it will stop the alarm
how do i turn off the alarm? the snooze button only snoozes it and the alarm goes off again after i think 10-15 mins..
tried it once more just now and suddenly it all works fine! i never thought i would ever say this, but i'm actually looking forward to be woken up tomorrow morning!
just received my beddi and it looks absolutely stunning! only problem is that i also experience a crashing app (iphone) after the initial setup. i tried reinstalling the app and setting up with different settings but it doesn't seem to help. restarting the beddi doesn't work either. hopefully you guys find the problem and provide a fix so i can wake up using this awesome product tomorrow morning!
i've received my beddi couple minutes ago! i have to say, build quality looks very decent! i have also a question,is there a possibility to increase the beep sound?
i got my beddi today, but the app crashes immediately after the setup. the audio link works, but i can't use the app interface. restarting didn't help at all. please advice. thanks!
@wymund, were you able to connect and run the setup wizard?  can you try to restart your beddi?  we are investigating the issue now as it doesn't happen to all iphones.  but some backers experienced this and restarting beddi seems to work.  thanks
i received my beddi but app crash cant link with my iphone. pls help!!!
@phenic, glad you have received your beddi and hope you like it @brian, thanks for the encouragement! @jo, uber is a known issue, was broken when we were making other changes.  we are submitting a fix.  sorry for the inconvenience caused @marie, "dim clock on rotate" is for auto dim your clock display when you put beddi app in landscape mode (the widget).  the uber is a known issue and we are submitting a fix.  thanks
yeah!, got my beddi!! setting it up and not sure what "dim clock on rotate". also i can't login to uber. finally! i can't wait to wake up with it tomorow!,
got it! but the uber login didnt seem to work:(
received mu beddi today... one word. awesome! ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
before anyone asks, no customs fees but i'm in sea (ymmv) and no tracking number. thanks beddi for running a successful campaign and delivering your product.
just sayin, i got 2 of my beddi(s) via dhl today. haven't had a chance to try them out.
@ryan, we will send out tracking info as soon as your package is being sent out @colin, we have started sending out some of the international orders and will continue to ship the balance next week.  for us orders, the goods are still being processed by amazon and we will send an update on status in the next couple of days.  thanks
@ryan, have you heard that from someone, or are you going by the date from the last update? rumor?
can't wait for my tracking number! i know they started shipping today!
@ryan, we have just posted an update @andrea, please private message your updated address to us today (july 10th), as we need to upload the shipment info out on monday in order to have the orders shipped out this week.  thanks
i moved. again. is it too late to get the new address in?
when's the next update?
@ian, we are working hard to packing the international orders for shipment.  we plan to ship them out next week, we will use courier so you should receive them by week of july 18th.  thank you for your patience
what is the progress on international orders like? in particular australia. any eta?
thank you! u guys are doing a great job!^_^
@daniel, we will ship them out around next week so you should get them within july.  thanks
hi, can u provide a rough timing for the shipments to canada? since i am moving in august. thank you
can't wait any longer!
@ryan, the vessel has arrived us, and is in process of clearing custom.  we expect the goods will arrive our warehouse next week, then we will send to amazon for fulfilment!  so it should arrive in your hands in around 2 weeks time from now!
has the beddi vessel arrived? so antsy! :d
@colin, the factory has just finished the 2nd batch of production and will be shipped to our hong kong warehouse next week. then we will start to ship those out to international backers. we will send out a tracking number once sent! thank you for your patience!
@creator, have you started shipping to international backers? and will you be forwarding tracking numbers?
@arjen, we will come up with different variations of beddi later.  and we plan to focus on products that amplify your bedroom experience.  so please let us know if you have any ideas or wishes, we will help make your dreams come true :) @ryan, it should arrive soon, but then it needs to go through custom and all that.  we hope to get this into our fulfillment center by next week!  we will post an update as soon as we get the goods in our hand!
has the beddi vessel arrived? :d
any ideas on future products you would like to share. i'm curious on whats next :-)...
@daniel, yes, we will send out tracking numbers once the orders have shipped out.  we are still on track to ship out early to mid july.  we are working with the logistics team at the moment.  thanks
is there's tracking number provided when beddi is shipped out? thx
is there's a  the tracking numbers when
@raphael, thanks for your kind words.  all of you helped made our dream comes true!  so the least we can do is to keep an open communications on our progress -- good or bad.  anyway, we can't wait til all the beddi arriving your bedrooms, i hope all of you will enjoy beddi as much as our beta testers did.  thanks
your campaign has been great on keeping us posted with every project updates and has met the expectations. i am very proud to have funded this campaign. you kept your promise on shipping and product alike. thank you so much. can not wait to receive the product and brag. thank you beddi
@novak, thank you for your kind words.  i am sure now all backers would have very high expectations :)  but our team did spend a lot of effort on making beddi to be the world's best alarm clock, so that all backers would have the best sleeping and wake up experience.  so i hope all backers will appreciate beddi as much as you do!  thanks again.
just wanted to comment, i'm one of the lucky few that's been beta testing the advance hardware, and i absolutely love with it. it's super easy to use, connects effortlessly to hue and lifx, spotify(others too, those are just my staples). the lights are stylish, and it looks fantastic. the alarm and speakers are loud (i'm a very sound sleeper, love this). adjustable brightness on the clock is amazing. put simply i'm so happy i backed this. i hope every one of you gets as much enjoyment waking up to beddi as much as i do.
@daniel, we are checking with the app development team to see whether ios has a "while using the app" for location service.  we using location service purely to update the weather and traffic information.  please note that we do not store or share your location to anyone.  thanks
hey i just download the beddi app(ios version) to get a preview of it and i found out the app could monitor my location anytime it wants even i am closed it. is it possible to add a location access choice of "while using the app" in the next update? personally i don't want any app have full access to my location. thank you
@arjen, thanks for the suggestions.  we will look into that!
maybe an idea for a new product. a wifi hub that connects to beddi en your other products and enables them to talk with amazon echo, apple homekit, etc.
@deborah, hyunsuk, thanks for your advise and we will check all options.
i concur with hyunsuk chung. usps via canada post has always worked out best for me. and please avoid dhl if at all possible. their brokerage and processing fees are ridiculous, in my experience, and i always seem to end up getting dinged with them.
as a canadian backer, i prefer usps. ups and fedex-type couriers all charge a fairly hefty 'brokerage fee' for processing your package through customs. the postal service such as usps, canada post, china post however does not charge these fees.
will canadian orders ship via the us or direct from china? excited to hear mass production is underway!
@zak, it's coming along.  we will give an update later this week.  sorry for the delay
how is mass production coming along?
@hesham and dina, we will ship all us orders to us first and then distribute from there.  for international orders, we will probably send out directly from china.  thanks
is the fulfillment going to take place from china or the usa?
@stefan, ok, we will make a special note
@witti please do, i'm willing to wait, but i had too many problems with fedex and they tried to charge me more than us$100 for a us$300 kickstarter product. i really don't want to have all those problems again, and besides i had received a lot of kickstarter products that were sent via usps, china post and hk post without problems. do you need that i send an email for this matter, or is it enough with this? i want to take all the precautions, because i can't pay the high import taxes and fees. thanks a lot for the quick answer!
@stefan, we can explore the postal service route, the issue is that it takes a longer time and might not have as good of a tracking info as fedex/ups.
hi guys! i want to check something out with you. i had a lot of problems with another kickstarter, because they sent their package via fedex, so when the package arrived, fedex charged me a lot because of taxes and services. so my question is: are you sending the beddi via postal service or another courier? all the other kickstarters packages that i have received where via postal service and everything went well. thanks! regards,  stefan ulbrich
weekly update? like seeing them!
i see that you're now compatible with nest but was wondering if you're looking in to hive in the uk?
@colin, we received some very helpful feedback from beta testers.  we will post an update over the weekend.  thanks!
any word on how the beta testing is going?
@alan, we will look into eightsleep later as we are focusing on the major smarthome devices first.  we do not support amazon echo because beddi doesn't have a direct wifi access to the internet. thanks
also im curious if amazon echo support is a possiblity ?
not sure if this would be a huge feature request but is there any way you could could look into integration with eightsleep.com (smart mattress topper). i backed one some time ago and given the nature of the product and the nature of yours i think they would benefit one another a lot !
@ryan, we did get your message.  as mentioned, we have over 100 responses within 24 hours of our post.  we are excited and overwhelmed by the support we received.  we are working with factory to see how many additional beddi we can allocate for beta testing.  we should be able to get back to everyone next week.  thanks
i messaged you guys the day of the update to beta test beddi - no reply. did you guys get my message? could i test it?
i would love to test it.
i'd like to better test if still possible.
@jonathan, we have, but still waiting to hear back.  if you have any specific contact.  please private message us. @all, we are super excited that over 100 backers have indicated interest to be beta testers!  thank you for all of your support.  initially we only planned 10 beddi for testing, now we are working with factory to see whether we can double that to 20pcs.  we will try to select people from different countries so we get a wider audience for testing.  thanks
just to confirm have you reached out to august lock and sent a message regarding beta testing.
@zak, we have reached out to qube earlier asking them for an api, but never heard back.  if you are a backer of cube, maybe you can ask them to contact us?  would like to work with as many products as possible @bert, we will keep adding more smarthome product support even after we shipped.  we will do some research on ecobee as i know it's getting popular.  however, there are a lot of work to be done before shipment, so we will only focus on the ones we listed.  thanks for your understanding @daniel, you can change your color preference in your backerkit survey, here is the link: https://beddi-ks.backerkit.com/  . thanks
hey just want to know if i could switch my alarm colour from white to black? the black version looks great from the update!
i see there is support for nest planned. please tell me you will also be supporting the ecobee3 thermostat....
thanks for the update. what i would like to see would be you guys working along side "check out world's most affordable wi-fi smart bulb on #indiegogo! http://igg.me/at/qube-smarthome/x/13274276 "
thanks for answering. i should have recalled earlier.
@shan, unfortunately we cannot add hd radio support at this moment without impacting cost and schedule.  thanks
probably a little late for this, but any chance you will be including support for hd radio?
hi sebastian i have re-invite you to the survey.  or you can login at this link using your email: https://beddi-ks.backerkit.com/ .  thanks
hi, backerkit won't sent me a link to my survey... what to do?
@michael, yes, we got you for a dark grey.  thanks
i saw the update about filling out the survey i know i filled it out but just wanted to make sure, can you check if i actually filled it out. thank you again and looking forward to this fine product.
@lianlong, your request matches our data in the backerkit survey. @ian, can you plug it in a wemo switch (but only on/off control).  does your light work with smartthings/ifttt/homekit?
i have some led rgb constant voltage tape around my room. can you suggest what driver or technology i should look at so that i can control it from the beddi. that's if it is at all possible
hi.i am lianlong li, my e-mail is guxinglei19880910@gmail.com, i pay this item on february 1, 2016, and i want to get two colors, one is grey, and one is white. please check my order, and confirm my order status. thank you !!
@paul, please visit https://beddi-ks.backerkit.com/ (and you should have received an email in the past 24 hours too).  thanks
i dont think i ever got a survey for this - what is the current delivery status ?  thanks
@witti inc: great news! thanks a lot for your quick answer.
@florian, yes.  iphone 6 with apple smart battery case will fit into beddi.  thanks
@creator hi, i would like to know, if my iphone 6 with my new apple smart battery case will fit into beddi. i hope so. can't wait for my beddi.  best regards , florian
@shan, thanks for your kind words.  we cherish our relationship with our backers, and trying everything we can not to disappoint! @zak, thank you.  you can purchase a 3rd one using the backerkit survey we sent out last week
awesome bought two thinking about getting a third!
hey witti team, i just wanted to say thanks for being so responsive in the comments and providing us with so many updates. i have at least 5 other projects i am backing with no updates for almost a month. they really shake my confidence in ks but projects like your sleep me coming back. thanks again.
@zak, we have sent them an email asking for an api.  stay tuned! @chris, i am not sure which pictures you are referring to.  but the finishing on the injected parts are not done yet.  we still need to add texture to the tooling, so at the end, it will have a "matt" finishing.  thanks
when did the beautiful rough "rock salt" finish turn into an over-polished lucite design. i don't like this polished plastic looking finish. it seems in mid-stream a major piece of the product became re-engineered. is it possible to go back to the initial design?
check out check out " world's most affordable wi-fi smart bulb on #indiegogo! http://igg.me/at/qube-smarthome " for only $19 you can get a wifi light bulb. would be awesome for this to work with the beddi!
@robin, will keep that in mind @steven, you should get an email about the survey (you haven't filled one out yet).  but no worries, as mentioned in the update, we are moving to a more flexible survey system and we hope to get that sent out next week or so.  you can provide your info there. @henning, noted and we will do the weee/rohs and ce certifications.  thanks
guys, after a very sad episode in my local customs office yesterday, please make sure that you meet all requirements of the countries you ship to! i wanted to pick up another project i backed, but the official denied the import, because of a couple of missed regulations. if i remember correctly, what he was looking for was: symbol with crossed out trashcan, letter of conformity for emitters, complete manufacturer credits and localized instructions. these where german requirements, but i guess it holds true for many states in the eu. they gave me the option, to destroy it, send it back, or send it to the "bundesnetzagentur"(responsible agency for emitting devices) for evaluation with uncertain outcome. i had it shipped backed to the creator.
i don't recall getting a survey for color and plug. did i fill one out and forget?
don't use the china post for your shipping
@suresh, we are still checking the best way to send this to backers.  what method do you prefer?  do you mind sending us a message on your preference?  thanks
hello witti, just want to know the shipping method for my safety. if it is postal shipping then this great product would cost me 4 times extra in india please let me know. suresh s.
@sarah, noted and changed to white @ed, hyunsuk, noted and changed to dark grey
i also would like to change the color from white to dark grey. it looks awesome will definitely match with my iphone 6 :)
seeing the revised photos of the dark grey, i would prefer that.  i selected white in the survey.  please may i change my preference.   sorry...
when i filled out my survey i selected the dark grey option - but i'm hoping that i can please change that to the white unit? i much prefer the lighter coloring!
@wymund, got your survey and had you down for the grey unit, and the 3-pin plug.  thanks
hi, actually i already done the survey. just double confirm with u. i want dark gray and three pin plug thanks
@shandher, noted your changes.  thanks
hi beddi,  i purchased 3 items and already completed the questionnaire. as we can not specify the color for each unit i want to detail in here: can you please change my survey order? two beddi: dark gray: one beddi: white thanks
thanks so much! :-)
for changes in your pledge, please help to message us as it is easier to manage that way.  thanks @jazz, changed to 1 white and 1 grey, thanks @vegasgirl193, changed to dark grey, thanks @alexandra, changed to dark grey, thanks @biadro, for statistical reference.  the same beddi works for both android and ios @steven, we didn't include dab radio in our original design.  adding it now will incur cost and extra leadtime.  maybe for future generations.  thanks
is there a reason the unit does not have dab radio?
survey asks android or iphone? is this just for statistical reference?  family has both android and iphone is there a different beddi sent out for android and a different beddi for iphone?
oy i filled the survey and put the white one, but now that i see your pictures, i think i prefer the dark grey. any chance to change my order to dark grey? sorry about that! the colors just seem to pop more! :-)
can you please change my survey order to dark grey? i put down white but after seeing your update picture with the new cloth on the dark grey i would really like the dark grey beddi.
hi, please amend my rewards to 1 white and 1 dark grey.  please provide uk plug set for my reward. thank you
@james, yes, additional comments will do.  thanks
hi all, we will send an update with pictures of the dark grey and white version, and the various wall socket plug we will include.  thanks and sorry for the delay @zak, it's dark grey @hesham, please specify in the "additional comments" section @luc, it looks nearly black (especially with the black cloth on top). @aaron, will do so this week.  thanks
i want one white and one dark gray unit but the survey only allows to choose either one. i've put down my requirement on the "additional comments" section of the survey. is that good enough?
could you post a photo of the dark gray model with the new, thin cloth?
the dark grey, is this the nearly black or the grey one? do you have more pictures since the last update?
if i want one black and one white how do i specify that?
surgery only said black and white thought there was a dark grey?
@michael, you mean the 3-leg plug, right?  yes, we will provide uk plug, as well as european plug, us plug, etc.  when you fill out your address in the survey (sending in jan), we will make sure your product has the correct plug.  thanks
just a thought, will you supply different electrical plugs for those of us who don't live in the us? for instance, i live in the uk and so have to put up with our awful gigantic plugs. you know the ones... the ones which only sit with the pins facing upwards if you leave them on the floor, ready for you stand on them when you getup to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. the pain is unbearable.  so my question is, can you send me one of those please?
@rob, thanks for your suggestions and thanks for your support.  we might not be able to add vibration to beddi, but will see whether there is any other device we can integrate with @zak, we will send out a survey in jan for you to choose color and fill out shipping details.  thanks
when can we pick color?
still hoping for some kind of vibration feature to be added, for the heavy sleepers and hearing impaired.  i still backed the project, but i am crossing my fingers there will be a way to integrate vibration.
@zak, lampster is a cool lamp.  we will check with them to see whether they have an api for us to control their lamp.  thanks
if you can get this to work with the lampster (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1284726646/the-lampster-a-lamp-with-attitude) i will forever be great full.
@arjen, we will release our api later as we are still finalizing the app.,  we do plan to allow users to activate philips hue as wake up light.  we need to see whether philips hue expose a "sunrise simulation" api though @daniel, when we send out the survey, you will be able to choose the beddi color (white or dark grey).  we don't have plan for a remote as you can use your phone to control beddi, may i know what features you want to control via the remote?  thanks
hi i want to know when beddi comes to production, can we choose our own beddi alarm colour or u guys are going to ship beddi with random colour? and is it possible to also have a remote control as an optional accessories in the future?
will the api for the beddi be public so that its possible to create add ons and add new functions for beddi? will it be possible to link the wake up lighting to philips hue so that your whole room simulates a sun coming up? keep up the good work !!!
@daniel, thank you for your kind words and trust.  rest assured that our team is working hard to deliver what we have promise.  thanks again for your support to make our dream comes true!
this company looks pretty trust worthy. i believe they can accomplish iffttt, smartthings and even add in tasker. base on their previous project, their backers are satisfied and they are on time. awesome :)
@tony, we do not support z-wave directly at the moment.  but we are trying to get smartthings and ifttt maker channel working so you can control your smarthome appliances through them @ken, the depth is actually around 26mm, the width is around 16.4mm @chris, you mean the white?  we will certainly keep the white color as an option.  no worries.  we love the white version too @bert, gluseppe, as mentioned in our latest update, we are planning on adding ifttt and smartthings when we launch if everything goes smoothly.  thanks for your support
we were soo close to that 3rd stretch goal. can you included anyways ifttt and smartthings integration ? thanks for advance.
dang! we were soo close to that 3rd stretch goal. it'd be awesome if ifttt and smartthings integration would be included anyways given how excited all the backers are and how successful the project turned out!!
i don't like the dark gray. the current color is very appealing.
i saw the section on allowing most phones with most cases, but i did not see a measurement for width (if 17 mm is depth). specifically, would the dock support iphone 6s+ with a mophie battery case (17.4 cm)?
does it support z-wave?
@chris, yes.  all 3 smart buttons are customizable.  so you can change to other features if you are not a fan of uber.  thanks
can the "uber" button be assigned to something else? i have no desire to support uber in way shape or form, and the last thing i want on my clock is a button that calls uber.
@teri, you can plug your coffee pot/lamp to a smart plug such as the belkin wemo switch. @jennifer, we saw that you pledged for the $60 pledge, but then you cancelled it.  so you didn't pledge for anything at the moment.  only 20hrs left, please support us!
hi, i backed the 60 dollar pledge. it was a last minute thing that was available. it showed (on mobile) 1 pledge available for 60 so i went and pledge for it now it shows i pledged for 75. can you please tell me what's going on? i'm confused about what pledge i bought. thanks.
hi, what devices is it compatible with in terms of turning on a coffee pot or lamp or other appliance? (what does the appliance need to be plugged into?).
@hesham - we are currently supporting uber but are looking into lyft as well. it all depends on the lyft app and what kind of integration it allows, we will do more research on this and get back to you! @sebastian - we are looking into other lighting technologies to integrate with and emberlight is definitely one of them. will get back to you :)
are you planning on integrating emberlight?
will the beddi only support uber, or will it support other 'taxi' applications such as lyft?
@gorm - yes! we've designed the beddi to support just about any size of phone.
will samsung note 4 fit?
one early bird coming up!
@shan, thanks for your understanding @ben, thanks for sharing, and glad to hear so many people are looking for a "smart alarm clock".  we do hope to hit our stretch goal as well.  please help to ask your friends & community to support us.
@witti posted on the smarthings community here: https://community.smartthings.com/t/smart-alarm-clock-beddi/29862  hope you make it, it will really make this the perfect alarm clock for my setup.
thanks for listening to my suggestion. i totally understand the cost issue.
thanks @ben!! make sure to share with your friends and hopefully we'll hit the goal!
will the device include the ability to easily swap between which mobile device is connected to it? for me it seams pointless having 2 of these devices in the same room. however, sometimes i will want to be connected to it while other times my partner might want to be connected to it. especially since we wake up at different times. so an easy way to choose which device to connect to would be good.
awesome news on the smartthings integration! now just have to hit the 150k
@zak, seems like you aren't the only one seeing $75 pledges as "all gone".  i am not sure why this happened, but i have made some update to set a high limited quantity, and add another $75 pledge with a slightly later shipdate.  can you please see whether you can see $75 pledges now?  thanks @steve, yes.  if you choose "bluetooth music" as alarm sound, we will use your last media player (in your case soundcloud) as alarm sound.  different from spotify, we will play from where you left off, instead of allowing you to choose a specific playlist.  thanks
will soundcloud be able to be used as part of the alarm sounds?
@zak, the $75 pledges should still be active.  we are still seeing new pledges for this tier.  can you send us a screenshot to support@wittidesign.com; maybe we need to contact ks about this.  thanks
mine says all $75 beddi backers are gone.
to get this project to grow you need to open more options for a single beddi. won't hit 150k without it.
@shan, we will send out photos of our "dark grey" version and get backers feedback on whether we need to make it even darker.  thanks for your stretch goal suggestions on the backlit, but that might increase production cost at the moment @jeremy, we are preparing and will post it out soon @stefan, the clock display is certainly dimmable, if you rotate on your phone while running our app, you can have the display automatically dim (and so will your phone screen).  when your alarm goes off, we can have your clock display brightens up again automatically.  thanks
i don't know if this is already included, but it would be nice to have that the led that display the time would be dimmable and also maybe smart dimmable...for example i have an alarm clock and every night i have to dim the light to its minimum, otherwise i have problem sleeping. and in the day i have to put it back in the maximum brightness so i can see the time with all the light. maybe this can be programmed and automated. thanks!
i'd also like to see some live pictures of the space gray model
hey witti team, excited about this project! both clocks will be going to my sons who are also doing their best to be patient. some thoughts from us:  - +1 for the all black  - a suggestion for stretch goal: make the buttons/icons backlit so they can be seen in the dark. to avoid light pollution, have a hand sensor that detects when the hand is nearby and lights up the backlighting as needed. i know it's a lot to ask but i haven't seen either on a device like this and thought it would help to differentiate, make the beddi that much cooler and give another stretch goal. thanks again and best of luck!
@tysaurus, the system does not support playing alarm music via usb or aux.  however, if you don't use spotify, you can use "bluetooth music" as alarm sound option, and we can play whatever song/service you were using before you sleep as alarm sound @chri, thanks.  we will show you the version of the dark grey we plan to make and see whether everyone still wants a black.  i have seem projects with a "green" version, i am not sure whether beddi will look good in green though, even if we just make the triangle logo to be green :)
@creator the dark grey is nice and is probably the option that i will pick if no other colors are available but i still think a full black option would grab peoples attention. and the green suggestion that i had could be for part of the beddi or could be the whole machine. the idea came from other projects that i backed where they offered a special kickstarter green addition of their product only avaliable to backers. might entice more to back the project instead of waiting for retail
how about the option to play music for alarm on a charging device via usb or aux port as opposed to just being able to alarm with music from spotify?
@michael, as nicholas has pointed out, adding a projector will change the clock design completely so we cannot include that now.  we will keep this in mind for future product line.  you can use apple music as alarm sound, but you cannot choose a specific playlist @zak, we do have unlimited $75 pledges now for 1 beddi @chris, we do have a dark grey option which is very close to black.  are you thinking of a complete green beddi?  or just a portion of it? @ben, we are looking into smartthings integration @michal, we probably can't do alarm that runs every other week.  sorry about that @nicholas, thanks for clarifying for us
@michael desantis i would also like that, but they already said that at their current stage in production, adding a projector would not be possible.
hi i commented at the start of the campaign asking about whether you would be able to support alarm that run every other week. has there been any progress with this? the current alarm app that i use is "alarm calendar plus"
smartthings integration
i think another alternative color like black or green would be a good stretch goal :)
will beddi work with apple music or just spotify?
need to open more single options to buy a beddi so this can grow more.
my suggestion for the 150k stretch goal would be to add a projection screen into beddi that allows for stars to be projected onto the ceiling at night and maybe the time or something weather related in the morning.
@luc, we will explore native integration with homey, but i think we might go down the ifttt/maker route.  we are investigating the possibility now.  thanks
homey integration would be awesome, to trigger a scenario. maybe can be done through ifttt but native would be better :)
@aj - thanks for the recommendation. we are at a phase in the product development where implementing this type of projection wouldn't be possible. but it is a very cool concept and we will be sure to think about it for future developments.
any possibility that beddi could project time on ceiling?  i hate rolling over to check time. especially if i'm taking care of a sick child. thanks.
@deborah, thanks for your suggestions.  we will look into integration possibility.  thanks @daniel, we will look into the cost and whether it's still possible to integrate with the hardware.  thanks for your suggestion @kate, you can use apple music as the alarm sound by choosing the "bluetooth music alarm" option.  we will just pick up from the playlist that you last played.  apple music doesn't have an api for us to choose a specific playlist to use @s. nunn, hope all is well with your husband @simon, we will look into collaborating with our ks projects once we got all the major ones down.  we look forward to shipping beddi too.
it would be awesome to see beddi working with other smart-home-kickstarter-projects like "n-cube" i'm already looking forward to receiving my beddi :)
@s. nunn, i would appreciate it if you don't mind
i have an early bird for whomever wants it:-(  my husband needs surgery so i sadly have to back out.
could you please allow a user to select an apple music playlist? i tend to use that more then spotify
i have a suggestion. if ever possible, hope you can add qualcom fast charger on 1 of usb port. or maybe a stretch goal?
as a backer of mycroft.ai, i'd love if the two projects were able to integrate as well. i'm imagining beddi for the bedroom and mycroft for the living room. https://mycroft.ai
hi antoine, we will look into the maker channel, thanks for sharing.  will also study the killkr project.  thanks for your support
hope it could be possible to fully integrate with ifttt. if not, it could always be possible to use the maker recipe https://ifttt.com/maker for trigger. the user will just have to add the generated key.  a other improvement could also be communication with a other project klikr : https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/klikr/klikr-make-everything-klikable.  to be able to control all not connected devices. can't wait to receive my beddi!
@jo, we also want ifttt.  i will keep pushing them to allow us for integration.  we will certainly leave room for extra feedback in our future survey :)
iffft will be great ;) your survey should have an open ended question if possible. thanks:)
@daniel, we hope to get them working too.  yes, the buttons are interchangeable.  you can customize them to trigger your favorite actions!
that's great. tasker opens up to a lot of possibilities and also google now voice command. another question. let's say i don't use uber. will the buttons be interchangeable? take out uber and replace it with another action like tasker, home automation function.
@nicholas, we will have white noise, fan noise, and natural sound like rain, ocean, thunderstorm like you mentioned.  we will keep updating our app to include more. @antoine, we do want to integrate with ifttt and are in discussion with them explore the possibility to add beddi to their platform @lianlong, don't worry, beddi is definitely coming to life.  we already hit our funding goal and are on schedule in our development.  we sent out the email to better understand what our backers like about beddi, so we can see which feature to enhance, and to work on the next stretch goal.  so your input if very important to us.  thanks again
i don't know what is means that "our kickstarter campaign is exactly half way over and we are already thrilled by the responses from the kickstarter community. so for that, thanks so much for supporting beddi!"  this information from my e-mali. does it means this products are not able to come out?
hi, i don't know if it's possible but the integration of ifttt could be great and permit new interactions with a lot of stuff. the interaction could may be done by bluetooth with the app or with adding wifi capabilities to the clock ? maybe for next goal ?
for the white noise maker, what noises will it make? only white noise, or things like ocean or thunderstorm? sorry if i missed it somewhere
@hai, thanks this is a great question. we will design the app to rotate as needed if you flip your phone to a different orientation. so if your charging port is on the left side, that won't be a problem.
i noticed that the dock is only a slot to place the phone.  it does not serves as a charging dock.  although you can say that it can charge while in the dock with a cable connected to the phone.  there seems to be designed for any phone that has its charging port either at the bottom or right side of the phone.  what about phones like sony's xperia z4?  it's charging port is on the left and if the phone is on landscape mode like what it is shown in the photos and video, users with this phone will not be able to charge while docking.  am i wrong to assume this?
@daniel, the grey will be very dark grey so it will almost be black.  looking into tasker integration.  for google now, we are also checking to see whether our mic can always be on and listening.  thanks
also pardon me if it was mentioned before but is there a mic in this and can it do voice command for google now? that would be awesome since i`m searching for a bed clock with long distance mic for voice commands. if not is it possible? thank you
hi. i can see that the project is going well. i have some questions. i see you have a stretch goal for color grey, can we also have a black version? since black goes with anything and also for automations, i rely on tasker for android. will i be able to set the buttons for tasker integration? thank you
@peter, beddi can certainly turns on your philips hue when your alarm goes off.  we are studying whether we can "fade on" the light gradually as well.  thanks for sharing on twitter @gan, anton, thanks for sharing!  please help to ask more friends to support us!
shared on fb
shared via email and twitter!
can't find my comment from about a week ago so sending it once more. apologies if i missed it: will you make it possible to connect the waking up light to phillips hue to get more light capacity? shared on twitter btw, not sure if i need to mention this.
ordered 2 and shared on twitter :d
@alfredo, andrew, zak, marc, jeroen, logan, haowei, thanks for sharing!  please tell your friends to support us so we can reach our next stretch goal or even unlock more!  we will send out a survey at the end to ask the type of cable you want @zak, still looking how we can achieve this, and the associated cost.  thanks
shared on twitter :)
shared
backed and shared on twitter! :)
do i have to tell you that i shared this campaign?just in case, shared on facebook. thanks
still would like to see. that once the phone hits 100% the beddi stops charging to that device to help save the lifespan of the battery.
shared via email to my friends. appreciate the free cable.
shared via twitter.
awesome product. just ordered 2! i shared my love with twitter (@andrewrtaylor). congrats on hitting your goal!
ordered one and shared on twitter (@parabol3) on 10/28. please note for cable.
@brandon, thanks for your support.  we can't wait to ship the products too! @matt, samuel, noted and thanks for your support!
shared on twitter (@s_gonder) 2 days ago. can i please have the lightning cable?
ordered two and shared on fb! looking forward to receive my beddies. for the cable could i have a micro usb pls?
shared on facebook!  can't wait!
@hai - thanks for the share, your account has been noted. @bethany - we're excited you're excited. thanks for the great feedback :)
i am so excited about this! i don't have any daylight in my bedroom, and so waking up is hard. i tend to snooze/sleep though my alarms in the morning. it's not uncommon for me to hit snooze for an hour before i'm able to get myself up. it was suggested to me that i try a sunrise/light clock to see if that helps, but i've not found one that i really felt like spending the money on before now. i love that this has all the extra features. i do worry that the light won't be bright enough to wake me up, but i guess we shall see. thank you!
shared on my facebook page as well...@long loong
@jordon, thanks for sharing!  we have you down for the cable
just shared on my page. please note for cable.
@jo, as we have mentioned before, we also want to lower the shipping cost.  but this is the current quote we got and we want to make sure we use a reliable service.  the 5 pack shipping cost is lower.  thanks for your support and understanding @rob, florian, thanks for your support and sharing!
shared beddi on facebook. hope some of my friends will join this campaign.
shared (rob echt wel) through facebook! give me my lightning cable :) and my beddi :p
hi witti, is there a reason why shipping cost is doubled when we back for two? isn't it supposed to be lower in cost? is it possible to get shipping cost further reduced when purchasing in bulk to a single address?
@david, thanks for sharing and your support!
just shared this project. very excited.
@johnathan - thanks for the clarification. this is something that we also would like to do. so we are looking into it. great suggestion
@james - thanks for letting us know! your account has been noted :)
i press "share" button under the kickstarter page and i choose facebook and when the facebook page comes up, i just type "@wittidesign" but don't see a page come up? i just then press "share" on that facebook page after typing the "@wittidesign". is it done? can u check please?
yes i would like to set it based on first event in my calendar.
@jonathan, for apple calendar, you want to automatically set your alarm time based on the first appointment in your calendar?  we will take a deeper look at the other smart home devices you mentioned.  for lifx, we have made that into our stretch goal already @james, if you click on you "share" button right under the video, you will get a popup.  please type "@wittidesign" and our page should come up, and you can click on that.  as we mentioned before, we weren't planning to give out multiple cables to the same backer.  but we understand some of you might use the additional units as gifts, so we will give out a cable for beddi pledged.  thanks @steve, it will be both 24hrs and 12hrs format. @david, sorry, we don't quite understand what you were referring to @joel, thanks and we will see whether we can make "human-like" voice as a stretch goal @daniel, the slot on beddi can hold phone with 0.63" in thickness.  do you know the thickness of your phone with case?  from the web, it seems like 0.44" which should fit.
hello, you mentioned that beddi will work with many cases, but will it work with a lifeproof fre power case for the iphone 6?
i agree with bart, a more human-like voice would really enhance this product. the voice in the demo is not a nice voice to wake up to. otherwise looks like a great clock! keep up the good work.
looks like an eb is available for the quick.
is the clock display only available in 24 hour format or is that adjustable?
a dumb question. how to tag when sharing in facebook to get the cable? just type "@wittidesign" when i "like" the page? i pledged the combo of 2 units, so do i get one or two usb cables?
i would really like the alarm clock to sync with my apple calendar . that way i don't have to set up my alarm every day. also can you looking into supporting ihome smartplug , pandora, lifx. it would also be nice for the sound to come out of my sonos speakers for music or alarm, or sleep sounds.
@leigh, we will study the tasker plugin to see whether we can add this on.  thanks for your suggestions @correia, thanks for sharing @james, you are all set.  thanks for sharing @jan, we are working on the wemo integration.  we will send out an update like the philips hue when it's ready.  thanks
any chance for a demo with the wemo lights/switch?
can you please check whether i've shared it correctly on fb?  otherwise i can send you a screencap if necessary.  don't want to miss the free cable thanks!
shared on twitter ï¿½
with so many smart home devices available (and more always on the way), it's naturally infeasible to support them all... but how about providing an event plugin for tasker on android? that would let users configure all kinds of custom actions in response to a particular button event! http://tasker.dinglisch.net/plugins-intro.html  either way, i'm eagerly looking forward to beddi.  :)
@li, the "special kickstarter" just means special pricing, you are buying beddi at 25% off msrp!  beddi does not have nfc at the moment, but what function would you ilke to see with nfc? @ashutosh, we are looking into smartthings integration, maybe we will make it a stretch goal if we can integrate with their api.  stay tune!
hello! are there any plans of integrating this product with smartthings?
in the kickstarter special two pack, what is the mean of the "special kickstarter"? and can i get one of this clock with nfc function (one used iphone, one used android)?
in the kickstarter special two pack, what is the mean of the "special kickstarter"?
@george - very good suggestion on the wake up light. we are working hard to make it as bright as possible to really have a good effect for waking you up. as for the shipping cost, believe me no one wants to lower shipping costs more than we do. we are exploring ways to lower the cost of shipping but still use a reliable shipping service
@david - thanks for the share we have noted your account :)
backed the combo for 2 and tweeted.
hello guys, looks like a fantastic product. however 2 things please to consider!! : please please consider to design the wakeup light with a powerful light. in the video it looks very dim and the small surface might not have enough power to brighten up the wall enough some people need a dim wakeup light and some need a stronger one. look at philips wakeup lights. these are the best wakeup light examples. if you donÂ´t take care of this, many people will get mad at you because its feature will be useless. also please look into the shipping costs for more than 1 device. each device causes to add 20$ shipping fee for each. why ? if shipped together, there is surely some saving possible. thanks.
thanks @renaud, we'll look into it
hello! a link between your awesome device and this awesome other one https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2107726947/hiddenhub-wireless-hd-audio-meets-timeless-design would be absolutely brilliant. i am not sure if this is doable though :) definitely shared this on twitter anyway!
@auhutosh, matt, sebastian, we are looking into adding more smarthome devices compatibility.  we will investigate the ones you mentioned.  please note that adding an extra device requires a lot of coding and debugging, and could destabllize beddi app.  so we will slowly add more devices as we move along.  thanks for your understanding @sebastian, we don't have internet radio built-in our beddi app at the moment.  maybe we will make it a stretch goal is there is enough demand :) thanks
is it possible to listen to internet radio using beddi, e.g. use one of the smart buttons to program a specific internet radio station?  and are you planing to integrate emberlight?
can you please integrate with vera, a very popular home automation platform.  i also use milight (light bulbs) with vera, so it would be great to have them all integrated please
it would be great if you can also include integration with smartthings. its a very popular and powerful smart home platform and will add a lot of value to your product. they don't have an alarm clock on their portfolio...this will definitely get you more backers!
@nick, understand and respect your decisions @michael, for spofity users, we allow you to choose specific playlist as your morning alarm sound, or your favorite sleep melody; because spotify has an open api.  for apple music, you can choose "bluetooth music" as alarm sound and we will play whatever music you were playing before you sleep, so it could be apple music or other music players.  you just lose the flexibility to choose a specific playlist.  for grey, maybe we will call it dark grey to avoid conflict.
this is a great looking product! i've been looking for something with similar features, but there's nothing else out there! i have a question. will the clock work with apple music as well as spotify? also, i'd hate to see this project cancelled, but can 'space grey' really not be copyrighted? is it sensible to name your new clock the same as what is essentially apple speak for black? just a thought.
@all- going to drop my family and friends now. good luck
@creator- i guess you are not understanding my reasoning for dropping my family and friends pledge. i do not agree with the way kickstarter is running their business. i have sent them numerous emails asking why my account was disabled and no response. they don't have a customer service phone number that i'm aware of.  i already have a friends and family special that i could keep, but i am no longer giving any of my money to kickstarter.
@james, you are hired :)  thanks again for pointing all of these out! @nick, sorry to hear about that.  you can still pledge for a beddi with your new account :)
@creator- i have a family and friends pledge on my original account. kickstarter disabled my account for no reason and i can no longer communicate with any of the projects i have backed, hence the $1 pledge. @nicholas and all- i will drop my family and friends around 5pm pdt today
resonance frequency is also missing a letter in your picture.
and the 'easy to set up' picture says "don't not need to worry."... that means we need to worry!!!
found another spelling mistake guys, one of the pictures says 'programmerable'. fancy hiring me as your proofreader ;)
@deborah, yes, google apparently knows everything :)  we do want to incorporate ifttt; however, ifttt has been very slow in responding our request to join their platform.  hopefully if we have a very successful campaign, we can engage with them again @luke, yes.  you can program one of the smart buttons to trigger "fm radio", so you can listen to your favorite station without your phone around.
cool product! will it be possible to use the fm radio feature without the app? in other words: can i select my preferred fm radio station and listen to it by just pressing some buttons on beddi, without taking out the phone and using the app?
just a thought, but would ifttt support be possible? that would open a whole world of automation options.
fantastic to know different modes of transport will work. and i was kidding about the flying. but apparently google maps has flight directions now, so you never know!
@jo, just like most electronics products, beddi will be made in china. @jereon, thanks for your support.  how do you want sonos to be supported?  ie, beddi already contains speakers.  do you want the sound to play via your sonos speakers?  or play your sonos playlist? @bart, currently we are using default tts that is built in to ios and android, so it sounds like siri in the video actually.  we will add different languages support as we go along, we can take in requests and add them to our "localization" queue.  thanks @jit, thanks for sharing!
awesome! can't wait to tie it with home automation products! shared!
hi, i have a few questions: 1) which tts engine are you using? the voice from the demos sounds very familiar with the ivona beta voice (https://www.ivona.com/us/about-us/voice-portfolio/) amy. anyway, could you use the funds that you have collected to invest in a voice that is more human-like? (like emma (who is not beta) from ivona, there is a profound difference in the smoothness and humanity of  between full and beta voices). 2) in which languages will weather and traffic updates be available apart from english? and which tts engines are you planning on using for that?
awesome product! a lot of useful features. any change of sonos being supported as well in the feature?
hi, is this made in us or hk?:) thanks!
@ john, that was not in our original plan.  but we understand that some people are buying extra units as gifts, so we can include two cables for the duo pack for those who shared.  thanks for your support @ nicolas, thanks @ steve, upon initial setup, beddi clock will automatically synced with your phone and then it can be run by itself even if your phone is not around.  we do not plan to have users set the time manually, as we all know that is a painful process. @ deborah, we will include options for different transit method, just like you would do in google map.  i am not sure whether we can support people who fly to work though :)
just backed. this project looks so cool. will it be possible to integrate transit directions with the app, so those of us who take train/bus/subway to work can still know when we need to leave? if you're using google maps for directions (i think?), maybe some way to choose the travel mode? that would also help people who bike or walk to work (or fly!).
hi, is the clock feature of the beddi available without connecting to a smartphone (once synced with the phone will the clock still run by itself without the phone being in range of beddi, or if it is possible to set the time without connecting to your phone)? just wondering if it is a fully functional clock display by itself as in the video you showed the time syncs with the phone. thanks!
hello i have shared via facebook.
if i pledged for two units, will i get two usb cable from sharing?
@corneulius, john, thanks for sharing @nick, sorry to hear about your experience.  we have shipped our previous project in kickstarter on time, and we are confident that we can do the same this time. @nicholas, nick is pledging $1.  there is no more family and friends special anymore.  thanks
@nick did you release it yet?
cool stuff!! shared in fb.
@all- i'm going to let go of my family and friends special ($50). i fully support this campaign and the individuals at witti inc. but i will no longer support kickstarter. kickstarter continues to allow a group of individuals (bomber & co.) to break the rules. i have reported these individuals, but to no avail. instead, kickstarter has disabled my account and i can no longer comment on the campaigns i have backed. i had to login through my facebook account and pledge $1 to leave this comment.

@s tjoe - thanks, we have noted your account :)
@creator just shared on twitter!
@nicholas, jo, hesham, thanks for sharing! @ zak, thanks for the suggestions, we will look into it @alexandre, thanks for the suggestions.  we might not be able to add qi at this moment as it increases cost and development time, plus the design need to change as we need a bigger back plate to hold the qi components.  you idea of a qi charging pad is good.  maybe we make that a stretch goal and an additional pledge option?  will look into it
hi will the smart home part work with lifx smart light bulbs?
suggestion for a strech goal : qi charging, eliminating the cable. or if it is to late into the design to incorporate qi, have an add-on qi charging pad that fits snuggly into the dock with the phone and is connected via usb to one of the back ports.
hi team, great product! i just backed and shared! look forward to my beddi!
hi team, i have shared as well on twitter!!:)
backed and shared. something nice that i just saw that would be nice to see integrated would be once your phone hits 100% that it stops charging to save and increase battery life.
just shared :)
@anthony, @dhara - thanks for the share! we'll note your accounts for the free cable :)
@patrick, @tom&linda - fully agree. this is not by any means an ios centric device. we plan on having robust support for both ios and android
@creator, as @tom and linda tcimpidis mentioned, please remember there are a large number of people who use android devices, so *please* make sure that support is robust and that this isn't "just another idevice" with minimal android support. {fingers crossed}
backed and shared looking forward to this!! thanks
hi i just backed and shared on twitter! excited for the cable!
remember that many of us are not apple people so robust support for android (and its version of siri - ok google) is appreciated!
@adam, jan, ronfoley, yu, thanks for your support.  we got you down for the free charging cable @jo, we do plan to have updates even after the product has shipped, we will continue to make beddi better.  we will support siri, thinking of whether to make it as part of a smart button, or simply press and hold the snooze button.  any suggestions?  we will open the api for the "widget", so someone could write a sports/news/stock widget and have it speak out to you in the morning. @michal, we support up to 4 alarms settings (can be weekdays, weekends, or any day or days of the week).  we need to see whether we can do every other week though.  thanks
backed and just shared via twitter. this project looks great!!
backed and shared, great product!
@creator, will the app have a robust alarm? i work 9 day fortnights, so every second friday i dont work. most alarm apps only have a repeat weekly function. will yours allow people to have multiple alarms that repeat on different cycles? example alarm 1, mon -thurs 5 am wake up - repeats weekly alarm 2, fri 5 am wake up - repeats fortnightly shared on twitter!
it will be great if it could read some news highlight of the day ;)
just wondering if there is support and app updates once it is launched? in addition, for the three click buttons, is there a functionality to speak to siri? thanks!
backed and shared!
sorry. https://m.facebook.com/story.phpâ€¦

@tom&linda, oceancity, sjoe - thanks for the recommendations and bringing these to our attention. we will begin discussing internally and looking at the api's of those companies to see if we can be compatible. appreciate the feedback, we definitely want to broaden our support of various smart home devices over time, so this input is helpful :)
@hyunsuk, @tom&linda, @matthew - thanks for the support and the sharing! your accounts have been noted for free cables :)
i have lifx lightbulbs in my room too and i would love for this to be compatible with them!
backed yesterday and just shared via twitter. this project looks pretty great.
@creator, awesome project! congrats to get funded so quick. would you consider to make beddi compatible with emberlight (another kickstarter funded project)? and a wood version?
regarding the beddi not having wifi to allow it to handle some of the requested functions in the comments...  this is perfectly understandable, but why not use the phone for the wifi connection via either the cable or bluetooth?  this could be the best of both worlds...
any possibility of insteon or an insteon hub support?  our house is largely insteon throughout and that would be nice...  our insteon hub even talks to our nest, amazon echo, and cambridge garage door system...
ok, i shared my pledge for two on twitter and fb.  bring on the usb cable! i'm very much looking forward to getting ours! question:  will the firmware be wifi upgradable to add new features and functions in the future?
shared on facebook. https://www.facebook.com/douglas.michael.9469 iphone lightning cable.
@henning, we do have a bluetooth on/off button on beddi (long press the play/pause button), obviously you can choose to be auto-reconnect if you want.  once you preset the alarm time and other features, you don't really need to turn on the beddi app all the time.  you can play bluetooth music via your own audio app, can you can adjust the sleep mode (auto off) by using one of the smart buttons.  you won't get the weather/traffic app dashboard if you don't use our app though (but can still get audio updates through speaker).  we will certainly post app updates even after product has shipped, and we do plan to have beddi working for more than just a year. @james, thanks for sharing.  that is the vibration diaphragm to increase bass for the sound.  other sound system like bose also has this (maybe they hide it better than us, but very good eye).  we fixed the typo in fm radio, thanks for pointing it out!  we will think about having the wooden version as the 2nd stretch goal! @jo, we will try to film a video that shows the sound quality, and the philips hue setup later. @jeremy, thanks for sharing.  and you don't have a wait for a stretch goal, we will include a uk/eu plug for eu orders!  obviously the power adapter will work in eu too (110v to 240v).
thanks for the speedy clarification witti inc, it's good to see creators respond to all sorts of questions, right from the get-go. i've shared beddi on twitter. as a suggestion, hoping for a uk/eu plug in a future stretch goal.
hi:) any video to show the sound system? in addition, i do have hue. how do i set beddi so that the lights turn on and off (is it a simple click button?) thanks!
just backed and shared, i love the triple function smart buttons, very clever design. i agree with the bluetooth switch comment below, i never turn off the bluetooth on my phone (due to smartwatch), yet wouldn't want to automatically pair to the speaker when near my bedroom. it would be inconvenient to receive a call when at home and the other persons voice coming out in my bedroom rather than the handset and then needing to change the output every time. if not a hardkey, perhaps an android widget which enables the beddi bluetooth connection with a single press? also, what are the faint circular cut outs for in the middle below the clock? they look like they should be for a speaker, but you mention it only has two speakers on either side? i don't know if you can change the images now the campaign has started but it says "built in in fm radio" in one of the pictures. finally, and i know this is a long shot, but it would be beautiful to have a wood version. or even just wood veneer glued onto the main panels. wooden veneers are not hugely expensive and would make it look really premium and unique.
i tried out the jbl horizon and currently i'm using the c1pro and both have their flaws and issues, so here comes your chance to do it all better! features that are really important for me would be: - a hardkey for bluetooth, so i can "dock" and "undock" my phone. i don't switch off bluetooth in my phone and i don't want beddi to connect every time i walk through my bedroom. - make the basic functions work without phone. lazy as i am, most of the time i just want to plug in the charging cable, listen to an audiobook via bluetooth and fall asleep, without having to deal with another app. - most important: make it user updatable and support and maintain the device after release. in my opinion that is what really sets a company apart these days! ...and please don't use those cheap capacitors that let most electronic devices die as soon as the warranty period is over... i prefer sustainability!
@jordan, thank you for backing both of our projects.  for notti app questions, please email us at service@wittidesign.com.  for beddi, please let us know your "wish list" now so we can incorporate as much as possible.  we will certainly make update even after the product has shipped, but sometimes there is technical limitations once we designed and shipped the products. @victor, ann, k, giuseppe -- thank you for sharing! @laviolette -- thanks for sharing.  you can use the smart buttons to control the philips hue bulb.  you will need their wifi hub to control the light, i suppose you don't need extra remotes @kritkit -- thanks for your suggestion.  adding wireless qi charging would significantly increase the product cost though, and iphones don't have wireless charging yet.  we will keep this in mind and perhaps create a different version down the road. @alex -- we do not plan to develop windows app at the moment. @janet -- after we hit the $50k stretch goal for space grey, we can see whether we can create some special pink edition!
may i suggest a pink beddi? i love all things pink and would absolutely love it!
will there be a windows phone app?

just backed and shared on facebook- can i still get the free cables? i don't use twitter.
wireless qi charging for your first stretch goal - please... this would truly differentiate your product, since i have not seen a 'smart' alarm clock which has qi embedded.
just backed and shared on twitter!  @moonkee2
i shared this campaign, it"s really cool.  i have a question: i saw the you can use the device with the hue bulb, does it mean that we can buy the buy without the remote ??
helo !! shared on twitter,  @victikas
i am a backer of the notti. i really like the device but am super disappointed with the development of your app. there have been no meaningful features or service integration updates since i received my unit. will the same most likely be true for the beddi? this looks like a great nightstand companion.
@kylie - you got it :)
thank you! add me on the list for free cables :)
@dustin, the clock face is a nice soft white led that with adjustable brightness. the color of the led itself is not able to change. but with the 16 million color led light pipe on the bottom of the product for mood lighting, you should have all the flexibility you need :)
@cityull, @tim c - thanks for the support and the share! you'll be sure to get that free cable :)
backed & shared on twitter - looks really good :) @viperkowelenz
one other question, the actual led for the time, is that changeable too or only white?
woo-hoo backed & shared, looks like a great project
@smartjim, @eloisa, thanks for the shares! your accounts have been noted for a free cable! :)
@kylie - we'll take your word for it, you're on the honor system :) please just make sure to share word of mouth with your friends in that case (that's the old social network haha).
@jeremy - thanks for the support and the great question! unfortunately we are legally prevented from sharing our supplier information due to nda, but we can tell you that we used high quality speaker components for a great sound. our speaker specs can be found in our page
@robert - thanks for your support.  the usb charging output depends on the adaptor used.  we are now using a 3a power adapter so we can only support one 2.1a. a 4 amp adapter that would have allowed for two 2.1amp ports would have been significantly more expensive (there's a big jump in price between 3 and 4 amp). so rather than spend the resources for two 2.1 chargers, we decided to spend that extra savings on a better speaker so you have a higher quality sound. snd since we assume most people will charge the phone overnight, so we think having just 1 2.1a for tablet should be sufficient.
@anthony - beddi unfortunately will not be  compatible homekit as beddi does not have wifi. we made this decision because adding wifi to the product would significantly increase cost and development time. this means your beddi would have been more expensive and you would have gotten it later. that being said, we definitely plan to have a future version with homekit support
@teo seng kee -- thanks so much for the share! you'll be sure to get a free cable with your beddi :)
@tianni - we need to see whether the sleep cycle app provides an api for us to obtain the alarm time.  stay tuned
@kane - 1) once set, the alarm clock will go off even without your phone around (but then only default sound can be played as it needs your phone to get the music).  wake up light works independent of phone too, but white noise requires phone.   2) yes, you can turn the alarm off by press and hold the "play/pause" button.  you can use the app to stop it too  3) yes, alarm clock has some default sound stored on the hardware  4)  right now, it's use for us to update the firmware.  it can also be used as a power supply input for those who want to carry it out for awhile  5) no.  weather should work "globally" or wherever yahoo operates.  for traffic, it should be "global" too or wherever us operates (ie, not china at the moment)
@anbu - all great suggestions, thanks very much. we will definitely have some time to improve the refinement of the app and product design before we deliver so we will be sure to keep these in mind as we're making final product improvements before we deliver :)
@jeffery! thanks so much, great to have you back :)
@dustin, thanks for the heads up! we are currently compatible with phillips hue and wemo switch, but appreciate you bringing lifx to our attention. we will look into it

i would like to share this but i do not have a twitter or facebook account. is there some other way i can get the charge cord for free?
really excited about this, can't wait to get my hands on it. quick question, what's the audio technology being used in beddi? as in which company are you sourcing the speaker from?
tweeted!
@creator looks neat. why only one 2.1a port?
will the device be apple homekit compatible?
share on facebook https://www.facebook.com/teosengkee/posts/10153372168964398â€¦
is it possible to combine your alarm clock with sleep cycle apps?
few questions: 1) can the alarm operat standalone? also the white noise wakeup light? i know they need to be adjusted via the app. do they need to be connected to phone to be functioned? 2) i see there has a snooze button, but where are the button to stop the alarm completely? must i open the app and stop it? 3) do the alarm have some default sound other than spotify, apple music that i stored? 4) i see there are a "service" slot next to the power-in, what is its use? 5) the traffic and weather condition is only us? thanks.
option not opinion. thanks.
great idea and a beautiful design. this is the first time i have come across one of your designs. couple of things i would like you to consider.  1. looks like this would be a great travel companion. could there be an opinion to add a case (say like the bose sound dock mini, think this could be a replacement)  2. the logo could look similar to your previous products. looks simpler and hence better in my view. 3. the integration could be kept minimal to start with and once the app is stable you could consider adding various other apps. would it be possible to switch some off if not needed. kindly consider usage without internet also like when away from home.
it's nice to be able to back another project of yours.  the notti is still one of my favorite kickstarter projects.  i am very confident the beddi will be amazing.
hi, is there any chance you could look into support for lifx smart bulbs? to use with the hue buttons?
