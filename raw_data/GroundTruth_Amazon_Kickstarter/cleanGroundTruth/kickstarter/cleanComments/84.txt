got mine in the mail today (canada). love the purple colour btw. my puppy is trying to figure it out - should be a fun lewrning experience. the two of them instantly loved the giraffe toy. can't wait to show off this cool ks project. do you have a place we should post pics - like a hash tag or account?
hi michael,  so sorry!  i am surprised, we have abused them intentionally while testing.  i am going to send you a private message to get your address and send you a replacement.  thanks! shannon
my leash came today.  my dog loves it, but during our first walk, she bit the clip portion holding the toy on and it cracked apart already.  it was a great leash for about 10 minutes. :-/

hi there, when i backed the project i thought i'd be sending it to the us, but want to ship this internationally instead - how can i change this? thanks!
thanks amy!  cooper should be our model, he's a cutie!
so excited for your project! cooper will be modeling his leash!
thanks kim and tashi!  we are bouncing with excitement here too.  these suggestions are great, we are going to be adding toys to the line regularly.  leashes are on their way, we are looking forward to getting them to our backers.  thank you so much for your support!
tashi, my english lab black pup, is bouncing with excitement.� would love to see a dragon or unicorn in the toy selection options. �
thanks lauren for the kind words and for the support!  two goldens, how great!  we are on schedule to deliver in october!
i have 2 goldens and i can't wait to use this to keep working on their manners. at 14 mths and 3 mths they r a cute handful.
hi christina,  we have six plush options for the kickstarter, a giraffe, aardvark, chicken and three colors of our binkies.  our binkies can be carried in several ways, knotted, rolled up or flat.  dogs love them!  if you scroll down on our project, you can see a photo of all six.  we will send a survey at the end of the kickstarter asking for your pick(s) for your pledge.  funny enough a fox is on our short list for our next round, we already have him sketched!  thanks for the question!
what kinds of toy animals and colors are available so far, and would you be open to suggestions/requests from backers in the future? i'd love to have my ringo carry a cute little fox with him on walks, for example!
hi sheila!  at the end of the kickstarter campaign you will receive a backer survey, where we will ask which toy (s) you would like, your address etc.  look for that the first week in october.  thank you so much for you support!
i just pledged and it didn't ask me for my address for shipping.  where do i provide my shipping address?
thanks adair!  banks will love his new leash!
woohoo! so excited to see this come to life! beautiful video. can't wait to get one for banks :)
