my son has used it several times, but he's too young to fully hold it. however, he was able to grab onto the leaves and it gave him something to grip. but i had to hold it still. i think it will come in very handy :)
jel, that's great! keep me posted on your little one's progress. if you have a good experience or capture a snippet of your baby using the product, i would be happy to post it on our website. thanks again for your support. jason
got my tipmenot and i'm loving it so far. hopefully my baby will start using his hands soon...
awesome, thanks for trying to keep your word - that just shows how much you care about your backers. good luck and congrats again!
jel, thank you.  kickstarter is in the process of processing payments from backers. once successful, they provide a form (via email) that we can send out to backers to get shipping information, etc. this should be complete in the next week.  our pre-ordered inventory should arrive in approximately 7-8 days. at that point, we will begin sending out rewards. i want to make certain our backers receive their reward within 2 weeks of the auction end as promised in our campaign. thanks, jason
congrats on funding! can you give us an update one when you think the rewards will ship out to your backers?
