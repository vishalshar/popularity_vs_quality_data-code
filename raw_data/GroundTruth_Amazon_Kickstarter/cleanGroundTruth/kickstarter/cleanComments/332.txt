hello
any responses to my question?
got the qc3 model today. really happy with it! perfect sound quality and connected without any hassle. worth the wait cheers and good luck!
got my replacement qc3 unit today, love it. connection to my phone was a breeze, although i am yet to connect to my macbook and see how that works. thanks guys.
i've been using it a while now and i've never had the issue with audio cutting out a lot when it's just in my pocket, like how could i expect it go to possibly to 30ft distance if it cuts out in my pocket from being 2ft??
btw creators, the btunes work perfectly with the monoprice 8323! just another addition u could add to the list :)
@toby close and @tommy thrysøe i'm sorry to reply to you late. we have placed order for the qc3 btunes to the manufacturer at the beginning of jan., the manufacturer is purchasing raw material and other components. generally speaking, everything is slow in china in jan and feb. most factory employees just start to come back to work from the holidays. we expect the assembly start in middle of march. as we have a database of backers with qc3, we will get in touch with everyone to confirm shipping address after we receive the units. we have done so for backers of m4u2 after we received the units before the holidays. best regards, dp
@dp deng any news on the qc3? it is now 4 months ago you discovered the problem...!
am i the only one who feels forgotten here? any news on the qc3 replacements?? it has been so long now it's almost not worth it...
when am i supposed to get mine
it doesn't work, i am using btunes with my bose q25 and i only heard in the left side...any update in the firmware?
my btunes have always had static noise at low volumes connected to my android phone.  is this a common issue? none of my other bt devices connected to my phone have this. when i pause music it takes exactly 2 seconds for the static noise to stop after the sound has gone quiet.
i just wanted to say i've been using my btunes for a couple months now on a very regular basis and i just love this product.  i'm using it with my bose headphones and not having to have a cord is so incredibly handy.  i use my bose a lot while woodworking in my shop, and the freedom of just being able to set my phone down and walk all over my shop without having to keep my phone with me or having cords get in the way has made life so much easier.  you've created a wonderful product that has truly made my life a little easier. thanks again!
so is has been a month and half since the prototype was created to solve the issue with qc3 btunes. any update regarding the outcome of that trial and when the modified unit ship?
are there any updates on the m2u replacements?
hi deng, is there any update on unit for bose qc3? as per updates, you had the fix ready by 21st october.
@ kelvin: thank you. please visit www.thebtunes.com
been using btunes regularly and pretty happy going cordless everywhere. i regretted not including the bt transmitter, is there any way i can purchase one now?
hi guys, can i get my tracking number please?
hi, is there a way to turn off the nfc function and also the range of the adapter is a bit short about 2-3meter? thanks marcus
@dp that will be allright as long as the value of the gift is no more than 50 usd.
so, after only a dozen or so hours of use (only on a second charge) the plug has pulled completely out of the btunes body. so the plug is left hanging by a wire from the body, and the next channel is not playing any audio unless i wiggle it a bit. the only email address i could find on the product website was 'thebtunes@voxoa.com' so i've emailed there, and hopefully between there and here i can hear back for some support. otherwise an excellent product.
@luan dinh found your email, and replied to you. thank you for following up.
@tommy thrysøe when we have the qc3 issue resolved, i will ship the new one to you. the new one is considered as a gift, will that be free of the vat/duty/tax? please let us know.
hey dp, not sure if you've been able to read messages but i responded regarding my issue, would really appreciate some support! thanks.
@dp deng that is your decison about customs... i can understand that it may be okay that i have to pay custom. thats understandable, but you have now send me a product which is not working. (it sound like something you could have spotted in testing as so many of us with qc3 has the problem). i fully appreciate you sending me a new one when you have solved this, but i can figure out that i at that point will pay yet another 40 usd in customs one more time. if i were you i would therefore consider refunding me 40 usd for one of the customs payments, as an error from you otherwise would result for me to pay 80 usd extra. :(
there cracking in the ears... so bad!
hello dp, rma-dd1509131 has been delivered to you 4 days ago. when will you ship the replacement?
@sean thank you for reporting the issue with hd 598, we found this issue and are working on a solution now. we will make exchanges when we have them in stock. i will make an update then.
a note on super bad quality / only sound from one ear. i've got the hd 598, and that is exactly what i experienced at first. it seemed like very poor quality sound (roughly am radio sound), and there was no bass on the right ear (weirdest part). i thought it was really strange, and was ready to write the whole thing off. after a day or so i shoved the btunes in much harder, and it popped into place (also bent the plug..). however it sounds perfect now. basically, if you think it sounds poor, maybe try getting an extension cord and try with that to make sure the plug is all the way in. [don't blame anyone if you break something..]
ok a couple of issues and comments  :) 1. point to multipoint works better than any other i have tried - apart from if you are out of range of one. then you get a "disconnected message" (fine) but then the btunes beeps every 30 seconds until the other device is connected again - that is very annoying.. 2. battery life is so far exceptional! 3. i have occasional "out of sync" audio when playing video's with ios 9.1 beta 2 video player. stopping playback and restarting playback resets audio sync. don't know if it is ios beta or btunes.
ok finally (due to freight forwarding) got mine today. with my qc25's they are perfect. about the same range as the sony mw600/sbh-50/sbh-52 which by far has had the best range for me so far. range is slightly shorter than the sony's  above without sound transmission - so headset disconnects a bit faster. compared to the sony's it also switches off very fast when out of range - where the sony's stay on - and then reconnect when in range. sound is clear - and easy to use. more testing to follow.
@ andrew: i think that your headphones are bose quiet comfort 3 headphones. we are working on a solution and will have it fixed.
@ heiko alhaeuser: we assume that your shipment got lost. we will reprocess your order.
@ tommy thrysøe: i'm really sorry that the customs asked you you to pay so much for the duty. we can't pay for the duty for anyone, we are not responsible for the duties/taxes/vat.
hi dp, got mine and as others has already said on here my qc 2.5 model is only playing on the right headphone. can you please provide update when you have plans to rectify? thanks andrew
@dp deng that is okay, but can you please sort out customs then, so im not forced to pay 40 usd again for getting this through customs??? i am looking forward to the final product...
still waiting...
hi dp both my qc15 units have substantial noise in the background - how do i get them fixed?
hi dp, i used mine for q15 for 2 days now, there is a noise in the background and i have another issue i cant connect with my iphone 5s. thanks
@ tommy thrysøe: i'm sorry for the issues with qc3. we are working on it at the moment. as soon as we resolve it, we will send you another unit.
i have just received my btunes after paying ekstra 40 usd in customs to get it as you did not reply on my last massage about this... i looks and feels like a really nice product, but it ends there as my btunes for qc3 only plays on the right ear and that the sound is really bad... � what can be done about this???
the martinlogan mikros 90s fit the 3.5 without any adapter.  they sound great, too!
@ silverdot: i'm sorry to hear it. please ship it to rma-dd1509131 5500 stewart ave ste 108, fremont, ca 94538
@ silverdot: i'm sorry to hear it. please ship it to rma-dd1509131 5500 stewart ave ste 108, fremont, ca 94538
can i send it back for repair?
my btunes is dead :(  it came out from the socket today, although i was really careful every time i charged it, this time it just disassembled. i inserted back but it isn't working anymore. i miss it very much, i was doing all my works with it, i had linked my phone, my pc, my tablet everything with it.
hey dp, could you (or someone) explain why my headset feels really quiet compared to using a normal cable? additionally, i have 2 qc25 models, and i was wondering if you provide adapters for 3.5mm headsets for universal compatibility. if you do, i'd be very interested in buying one.
hi dp, i'm not sure if anyone has experienced this but when i plug it in my beats studio, one side seems louder than the other. also tried it with my beoplay h6 (tight fit), same issue. another problem i encountered is that when i play a song on my iphone 6, it seems to skip the beginning of the song. please advice what i should do. thanks.
if the next version can be adjust the volume to perfect. accustomed qc25 cables can adjust the volume.
received qc25 version. great work. http://cl.ly/cye3
hi dp,  received mine for qc3, same issue with some other folks here, only right side is working and with some noise. looking forward for the fex and update. thanks.
@ tapan mishra: i'm sorry about it.   did you see one of the previous updates? don't worry about it, let's make an exchange. i will send a replacement to you on tuesday.
r.i.p  btune. mine lasted 1 month. it was a beauty while it lasted. the entire piece came out of its enclosure while taking off the it from the charger. even though i have put it back, its dead
had a minor delay because i had to get the qc15 adapter in the mail after the original delivery but i got the adapter now and everything works great.  the final product has actually exceeded my expectations.  thanks!
@creator,  thank you very much for the info. please let us know if you do in fact get the shipment today.   cheers...
@ n.h.: we dhl'ed the second shipment of qc25 to us, and it is in the sort facility in san francisco early in the morning. i expect to receive it today. we are preparing to fulfill to all backers starting today.
@jeremy naiden,  can you please tell me what backer number you are?  i'm trying to get a sense of where things are with regards to shipping of the qc25 compatible devices.   thanks...
just received mine for the bose qc25.  so well executed - bravo!!  having owned a variety of bluetooth devices, i have to say that this is the best one i've ever used.  the sound quality is excellent, the multi-device support is generally without quirks, and the fit and finish of the product is perfect.  nicely done!
received the qc15 adapter a few days ago and it works great on all of my devices. one concern is that i hear a static noise in the background. this noise does not exist if the headphone is wired. thankfully it is small enough that i can somewhat ignore it but it is definitely there. let us know if there is any software update on it! thank you for the delivery and the awesome product!
hi... i just got a letter from customs here in denmark... i thought maybe that you should have cleared this?? or should i just have to pay??? � tommy
qc25 version has been shipped yet?
hi deng, i too received my qc3 btunes today and only the right speaker works :-/
hi deng. i received my btunes (for qc3) today and the excitement was short lived as only right speakers works with the connection. i tried on mac and the sound was really bad with all sorts of noise and connection with iphone was ok but still had only one speaker working. is there any solution to this issue?
hi deng, any update?
@martynas i've sent you an invoice already, please check your email.
how can i get an invoice for this thing ? my customs office won't give it to me unless i provide an invoice :(
hi deng, i didn't receive the qc15 adapter with my unit..i backed the project so i could use btunes with my qc15, could you please help?
hi deng  i also recieved 2 units today without 2x qc 15 adapters :( can you please fix thanks, br  kim
hi deng, just received mine, i have questions. 1. my headphone is hd 598, why mine the the sound on the right is louder? and i hear echo on the left side? is it btune not tight / faluty or require an adaptor?  2. i purchase additional bluetooth but cannot be recognized, tried on few iphone, and pc/laptop already. can you help to solve these issues? thanks, hanyu
ok, just saw that i'm not the only one with the missing adapter issue...
dear dp, got the btunes today. unfortunately, no adapter for my qc15 was included, without which i cannot use the product. please remedy! also, i plugged in the btunes to charge it up and noticed that the led is not working. should i return the unit? i can't test whether it works or not for the above reason. thanks, andreas
here's how you do multiple-connection 1) i assume that you paired the btunes with device a already. 2) put the btunes in pairing mode. turn off the btunes if it's still on. while the btunes is off, press and hold the button on the btunes for about 6-7 seconds, you'll see red/blue flashes on the led indicator. 3) from device b, go to bluetooth settings area, select btunes to pair. it should be paired and connected in a few seconds. 4) turn off the btunes after it's paired and connected with device b. 5) turn on btunes, and it will connect to device a and device b in a few seconds. (they should be in range).
received my qc15 adapter today after a short disconnect on confirming final order.  dp was quick to send me the much needed adpater. i use all apple product and this thing hooked so quick and easy.   i have not taken off my headphones since pairing it with my mac. love it!!!
i was an early backer of this product. actually it was the first project i've every been interested in enough to back. i think the team and dp did a great job on producing this product, giving us updates, and finally getting the finished product to the backers. it is a great product and works very nicely with my equipment. thank you!
yay!!!  my qc15 adapter arrived in today's mail! put it on the btunes and charged it up.   paired to my ipod with no problems and i got glorious wireless music to my ears! i'm so happy with this product. thank you, dp! i hope the btunes is a great success for you.
can you please ship me 2 of the qc15 adapters for the pair of 3.5mm btunes that i have just received?
@olov87 thank you for your feedback. another backer made the same feedback in private. we will get in touch with psb and see whether we understand the problem and resolve it.
hi, i just tried my btunes with my psb m4u2 headphones. the btunes play music when the headphones are in passive mode, but when i turn on the internal amplification or active noice cancelling there is just silence and a few clicks. the amplification and nc works just fine when i use the cable.
@saleh it's on the way to you. @kelvin unfortunately your order hasn't been shipped out yet. it will be very soon.
just checking if my btunes has been shipped?
today i received my btunes without the adapter for the bose qc15 without the adapter. can you please send it to me ? thanks
got the qc15 adapter today and so far it's working great!
hi dp, i also received my btunes without the adapter for te bose qc15. could you also send me this adapter asap please? could you notify me when you have send me this adapter? thanks, karim
hi. folks, i'm sorry for the inconvenience. we've shipped all the adapters to you either known on the comment section or in private mail. if your address is outside of the us, you should have received a tracking number already. unfortunately there's no tracking number of us addresses. as always, got an issue, get back to us. we'll process it asap.
hello dp so happy that my btunes arrived today but was quickly disappointed because the qc15 adaptor was not included. can you please ship one to me asap? thanks george
hi, just received my btunes. i also didn't receive the adapter although i asked for it. using the btunes, there's a weird white noise on the right side when there's sound. when there's no sound coming from my computer, the white noise stops.
hey dp received my btunes,they're awesome!!  sadly i'm in the same boat as others and the transmitter wasn't included. will they get sent out straight away?
@chwuel71 yes, i did. unfortunately in the mad dash of shipping excitement, it fell through the cracks. only a handful got the adapters in the shipping bags. it's a screw up. we will ship the adapter to anyone who makes a request.
hello dp, i got informed, that mine is on the way (to germany). so i'm pretty excited and a little bit confused about the discussions about sending the adapters. in january, you stated "...yes, the adapter will be included with each 3.5mm btunes.." to karim's comment and in an email to me. please clarify for all and make sure, that it is in the package (to me), or bring it on the way immediately. thanks !
one of the best thing i invested. this is cool. the quality of bluetooth streaming is too good. no loss. i was thinking it will be weird. but not at all. good job
hi dp, just received mine at the office. been trying it out this morning. i'm really impressed and i can't believe i don't have to worry about cables anymore. great job!
i have to agree with @shawn o'brien 100%, i also found that the btunes was a lot smaller then it appears on its kickstarter page. great job dp, well done!
add me to the qc 15 adapter list please!
hi creator,  can we please get a clarification on when the qc25 version will ship?  thanks and best of luck.   cheers...
most of the time i receive over-engineered packaging and an under-engineered product. this product is the real deal. i am super impressed with the performance of the device. nice job and thank you very much dp!
received mine today. works really well, except for the glue on the end. i plugged in the usb cable, when i tried to disconnect it the inside of the unit slide out with the cable. so be careful when you disconnect the power! hope mine continues to work.
great product! worked seamlessly right out of the box! it's so convenient not to have to deal with wires.
hi dp,  thank you for shipping out the product as soon as you could. i received it and it is in great condition. unfortunately the adapter did not arrive for my qc15 like some comments below. please add me on the list for the adapter as well. thank you very much.
i received my btunes today for the bose qc15, but like many others, there was no adapter inside the package.  please add me to the list of those who need the adapter. thanks, looking forward to trying this out soon! -ryan anderson
like many others, i did not receive the adapter for the qc15 headphones.  can you add me to the list to mail out an adapter?  thanks.  i look forward to using this.
i just received the btunes that i'd requested for my bose qc15, but i too did not get an adapter with the device. frustrating...  when i got the shipment notification the other day i got excited about trying the btunes out.  i guess i'll have to wait a little longer. please add me to the list of people who need these adapters sent.  thank you!
i got the bose q15, but there is no adapter to be found. i checked everywhere in the packaging, how am i suppose to get the adapter?
hi, got my 3.5mm this morning and it works a charm straight out of the box with my monster dna headphones, sound is crystal clear, no lag between device and headset. great job all concerned lol forward to future ideas from you
@lew fredane if the package box indicates it's qc15 model, the adapter is in the small white accessory box below the btunes.
hi. backers and friends, along the way, i separated the models as 2.5mm/3.5mm/qc15/qc25. i should have done a better job to remind everyone to update their choices, for example, more notices should be sent out. i'm sorry for the inconvenience. i will get an adapter to you or the correct model.
my btunes was delivered on friday and i love it! now i get to have wireless sound with a favorite pair of headphones. thanks guys. looking forward to seeing what else you guys can do.
lew. i got the same thing the paperwork does not say anywhere that it's made for a qc 15.  but on the site it says that this fits, but needs the adaptor. i am suppose to go on a long flight this week and was waiting to use it then. guess not
so, bottom line, nobody got the adapters for their qc15 that were supposed to be in the package?
although the box claims that what is inside is for a bose quite comfort 15, the packing sheet would appear to indicate a different model. at any rate, out of the box, it does not fit my qc15. help. i've been looking forward to this since i have to long air flights each week and would like to dump my cord. how do i get a exchange? make a return.
me too i never for the qc 15 adaptor too.  how do i get it?
received mine today with no qc15 adapter. who should we contact to get it asap? i'm flying soon to try this out.  ty
i am one of the early backers. received mine today but, same as ernie, it is missing the adapter for bose qc15.
just received my long anticipated package. however i to am missing the q15 adapter as well. i thought i updated my info. please let me know when it will be sent. i am very excited to put them to work.  thanks
along the way, i gave qc15 a separate model. i should have done a better job to remind backers to update their choices. i will send the correct model to you. thank you for letting us know. i'm sorry for the inconvenience.
i am one of the early backers. received mine today but, same as ernie, it is missing the adapter for bose qc15.
just emailed you, but also wanted to post on here. i got mine but its missing the adaptor for my bose qc15.
i'm watching videos or typing on my iphone 6 it's just very irritating that when i type there's a lag and also i watch videos on youtube and facebook it lags.
picked my unit today and it's working great. love the way it looks on my bose and beats headphones. i need to stress test it this weekend. ;). dp, it was a pleasure to meet you. i hope you will have great success with this product.
@ henry rodrigues: please let me know your set up, where you watch the video on. i'd like understand the issue too. i have been using the btunes to watch videos/movies on iphone or ipad all the time. in most cases, you hardly see any delay as long as your internet bandwidth is wide enough. in rare cases, when the bandwidth has issues, the streaming services may sync up the audio stream, but will do a lot of things on the video stream part. in general, the bluetooth latency is about 150 milliseconds (0.15seconds). if you watch videos/movies on tablet, i suggest you download the video into your tablet, and then watch it. and let me know how it goes.
@ kenni sunga: you are correct that we haven't shipped orders that contain 2.5mm model or qc25 model.
is it just me or my btunes lag in sound? when i watch a video or type the sound is like two second lag.
so for us that ordered a 3.5/2.5 combo, our orders haven't shipped yet correct? just making sure because i haven't received a tracking number for a 3.5mm model.
just got my shipping notice...usps to australia so will take a week or so but great to know its on its way.
hi mr. deng! any new on actual delivery for the bose quietcomfort 25? all the best! /glenn
please check http://thebtunes.com/blogs/news :-) we start shipping qc15 and 3.5mm models now. cheers dp
@ari gnepp i've used some 2.5mm female to 3.5mm male adapters (bought on amazon) during development phase. just search for "2.5mm female to 3.5mm male adapters" on amazon. the 3.5mm and 2.5mm will cover most of the popular portable headphones on the market. my focus now is to deliver the present models to backers. i am sure that our backers will have access more to different headphones than i do, when we gather more data we can decide what to do.
are there any plans to create an adapter or any recommendations for 3rd party adapters that would let me use the 2.5 mm version with a 3.5 mm connector in case i change headphones in the future, or will i have to buy a new btunes to fit?
@ zyge: i just check that you have chosen 3.5mm model. if you want to change, please email your choice to thebtunes@voxoa.com
hi, i forgot i choose which one and how can i check my order?
@simon looking at this image http://blog.omy.sg/k3003-sound-of-luxury/files/2011/12/2011-11-17-17.41.061.jpg , i think that our 2.5mm model will fit them.
any possibility for an adapter for the akg q460 adapter?
first review of pre-production unit http://www.gizmag.com/review-btunes-bluetooth-headphones-plug/38479/
update por favor.
thanks! keep up the great work as always
@kelvin it was a small run of production. the mass production is due next month, here's the update https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2116595848/the-btunes-plug-in-pure-wireless-hifi-sound/posts/1266073
does it mean everyone should expect theirs soon? there wasn't any info about it being sent out to all. did i miss an update?
thanks for such a quick response. after tinkering with it for awhile, i did get it to work with my macbook air. for anyone else having a problem recognizing it here is what worked: -turn the device completely off. hold down the on button to turn it on, but continue holding the on button even after the blue led is flashing until it resets the pairing of the device completely so that the led light is flashing both blue and red. then any new device will recognize it. you don't have to do that though for every new device, but this always worked for me. thanks again for such a great product! now it works perfectly with everything i have and the quality is top notch. very happy with the product and congratulations on a great release. glad i backed this project.
ops, the browser had a funny hiccup, sorry for the multiple posts.
@kazman thank you for telling me the issue with macbook air. the btunes should work well with osx, www.thebtunes.com/blogs/news , where i posted a screenshot on my macbook pro.
@kazman thank you for telling me the issue with macbook air. the btunes should work well with osx, http://thebtunes.com/blogs/news , where i posted a screenshot on my macbook pro.
@kazman the btunes works with osx just fine. i don't have a macbook air, but have macbook pro which works fine. here's a screenshot http://thebtunes.com/blogs/news
thank you for your kind words. @blake kuehn @kazman, i am sorry about not sending qc15 adapter. as we separated 3.5mm into 3.5mm, qc15 (model 3.5mm + qc15 adapter) and qc25, in the preproduction, we only made 3.5mm/2.5mm/qc25 models. i randomly selected 3.5mm model backers, mistakenly marked you as recipients for 3.5mm. i can send you the qc15 adapters when i have them. please let me know. @ks_aim please let me know where you'll post your review.
received my btunes yesterday as well. the thing oozes quality. it is very nicely done and even packaged. great job. some things: -as mentioned below, i didn't receive the qc15 adaptor even though it says it's in the box. luckily for me, i am not using it for the qc15, but just thought i'd report this.  -the mic is good quality, it works well. i've tested it with some friends on calls and it is as i've hoped. impressed. -one issue: i cannot get my macbook air to recognize it even though my iphone does no problem. can anyone report if they can get their btunes working with their osx (not ios) apple products? i hope this isn't an issue with the btunes, but just some apple driver update/compatibility thing. thanks for a great device tho! hopefully the osx compatibility issue can get resolved, but otherwise it's great quality!
hi dp - just received my btunes today. i am extremely satisfied. this is the perfect way to start off my weekend. it's very apparent how much time and effort went in to this product, from the progress updates and communication, to the quality of the product itself. 100% satisfied, and ecstatic that this was the first kick starter that i ever decided to fund. it's been a great experience. i'll be putting out a review soon. thank you again. best - aim
hi dp - just received my btunes in the mail. everything looks great - except it didn't include the qc-15 adapter - just the unit and the usb cord. the instructions say the adapter should be included.
hi dp deng, how close are you to shipping? i am an exchange student in the united states but i will be going back to my home country in a little less than a month. since international shipping is more expensive, i just wanted to know when the final product will be ready. thanks, and congratulations on the successful campaign!
looking forward to receiving my btunes!  quick question - is there a "sidetone" feature with this device?  if not, that may be a nice option for future releases/upgrades given that many will likely be using noise canceling or closed headphones.  when implemented well, it can be a great thing to have.  thanks!
mail btuunes!! ty so much dp. ; )
sucks about the mould, but i can wait an additional 2 weeks if i must. thanks for being very open about the delays.
when will you start shipping if i may ask
i am a little sad that it seems like i can't get qc15 adaptor if i order the qc25 model. before i was promised adaptor for both in one package - now qc25 is a separate product. (i have 2 qc25's and 2 qc15's - and still use all the sets)
@ glenn carlsson: i sent you an invite after updating your email to your gmail. cheers.
dear dp peng. i do apologize but it seems that i've also missed to fill out a survey of some sort? is that obligatory for being eligible getting the btune? if so, plz be so kind and send me an invite immediately for me to fill in. my preferred adress is glenncarlsson@gmail.com. if not, my other, which is glenncarlsson1969@hotmail.com. sorry for the inconvenience! sincerely, glenn carlsson.
@ anthony meter: i just got back from china. i will post an update shortly.
update?
hey, is there any way i can change my registered shipping address with you folks? i'm not sure i'll be at the same place in a month or so, so... thanks.
are we still on track for may 2015 deliveries?
will everything be ready to ship next month cause a lot of the projects that i have backed were delayed by a couple months.  some were 6 months late...  just want to make sure.
dear dp deng, i think i mistakenly ordered for bose 25 when i own bose qc 15 noise-canceling (older version 2013) if i ordered correctly on your file, never mind my change request. if i filed it incorrectly, would you be able to make a change to bose qc 15? thank you for your work. i am very excited for your project. best of luck.
@robb thank you for asking. we are still making progress, and i was due to a couple of more samples in a couple of days shipped from the manufacturer. i will make an update even if i don't receive the samples.
how close are we?
i must say, sitting here in a crappy apartment, trying to study from my laptop and use a whiteboard all the while chained to my laptop by a 24" cord, i cannot wait for btunes!
@ alex yu: will send you a invite today.
i have never received the survey, i had completely forgotten that i was required to do it to receive my btune.
completely agree with other who back battery life with traditional solution over the botheration for which agreeably is appreciated that you were concerned. hence i back battery life if that's a compromise.
i like the idea but if it kills battery by that much, then i simply think that it is not worth it.
definitely battery life, be it continuously streaming or standby time. it's already a chore needing to recharge idevices. actually would it be possible to add function to the on/off button? say, press once to check connection status. long press to turn it on or off. double press to disconnect and attempt reconnection. triple press to.. well you get the idea. the led would only light up when it's needed, thus saving precious battery juice for actual listening rather than connection status.
hi. backers and friends, thank you for all your feedback. we will not deploy the pulse indicator as it drains the battery too much. best regards, dp
more battery life
battery life is my priority, please make anything to increase the power
battery life is #1 priority to me. the drain on the standby time is horrible. i would much rather deal with an annoying light than lose that much battery power !
the battery life is most important, how the led flashes when connected shouldn't out weigh the length of streaming and standby time between charges. if it is possible to not have the led go to its fullest of intensity but a reduced power flash sequence all the time would that not still show its connected and not diminish the battery life so drastically?
battery life should have the highest priority! check how far you can reduce the intensity of the led. by the way, it will not be checked in use - on your head (which is when it disturbs during night) anyway. so probably, stop it when connected to the headphones (?)
what about making a plastic or   silicone cap over the tip? don't make the battery life any less at all please.
is the connection indicator an either or situation? ie either the flash or the pulse?  the pulse does sound more sophisticated but i think i'd rather take the flash and some tape than a massive hit to the battery life. would lengthening the pulse interval be possible? eg 1 4 second pulse every 10 seconds or something like that?
@ edward zukowski: we haven't started shipping yet. we didn't send out a tracking number. could the tracking number be for something else?
i received a tracking number, but when it goes to dhl, it cant find it. whats up? is it shipped or not? thanks
@george edward muir you have answered the survey already on backerkit.
@george edward muir the survey has been sent out a few times already. please check your junk/spamming folder. i will send you another one.
hello, when will the survey be sent out? i have not received it
@ kenni sunga: correct.
that would still make the headphones wired correct? there would be no way to set it up so the btunes is on the headset, right?
@kenni sunga: on a second thought, you can use the btunes as the input audio stream for the fiio amp and send the output of fiio to your headphones or other speakers, you pair the btunes with your iphone. in this way, you can stream music.
@kenni sunga: in order to use an amp, you need to send the signal directly from the amp output to the headphones. unfortunately it's not possible to use fiio amp with the btunes.
@william yang: it's done, just sent you the survey invite again (check your junk/spam folder too, just in case). let me know any issues.
is my*
sorry my rocketmail.com in my yahoo email i think i wrote @yahoo.com instead of @rocketmail.com so can you send it to williamyang25@rocketmail.com thank you so much and have a nice day :)
how would you go about setting up the btunes if you wanted to use a portable amplifier like the fiio e12? is this possible?
@ william yang: i just sent you an invite again. your registered email is from yahoo.com. could you check your yahoo email?
my email is williamyang25@rocketmail.com
i didn't receive an invite to the survey page
@ hitesh: hi. we didn't reach the stretch goal, so we only have black ones. sorry about that.
hi. there was no option of selecting the colour.  may i know if backers will be given a choice regarding this.
hi dp deng:i've just finished the survey,thanks!
@wu sheng tung  i just sent you a reinvite, please also check your mail and in the spam/junk folder.
hi dp deng:can you please send mail again to my email:wujake.80@gmail.com,thanks!
@ wu sheng tung: please check your spam/junk folder. i will reinvite you to the survey.
hi dp deng:     i have not received the survey
@ haberjr: you will need an adapter for h6 (with the 3.5mm model). you can see some pictures i took in the updates area. one caveat is that it's not as good looking as it has some angles.
does either plug fit b&o h6?
@karim for now, we will ship a qc15 adapter for each 3.5mm model btunes.
i've just finished the survey. i have a bose qc 15 and therefore chose the 3,5 mm model. i haven't seen specific questions for bose models. does everyone receive an adapter for the bose models?
@ allan li: @ allan li: for the bose qc 25, we make a special adapter (3.5 mm female to 2.5mm male) to fit the 3.5mm model. as the 2.5mm model will fit with ae2i directly (it will not fit with qc 25 as the connector is way too recessed in comparison). hope it explains it.
which one to get? according to the instruction provided, bose qc 25 should choose 3.5mm model, and bose ae2i should choose 2.5mm model. i have both headphones, and i found they actually use the same size cable plug, i can use my qc 25 cable with ae2i, so i'm bit confused. please advise. thanks.
the pre-order site is live. go to http://www.thebtunes.com/ and click "order now". or go to https://thebtunes.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders
@chad bentz it's the second item in the faq section.
@chad bentz we finalized the button operation. we have only one button, so we can't have all the operations with 3 button control. please refer to https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2116595848/the-btunes-plug-in-pure-wireless-hifi-sound/description#project_faq_115790 best regards dp
have you considered standardizing how the buttons work? http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-headphone-controls-2012-8… assuming siri / cortana / hey google support is standardized over bt?
@ zara: thank you for asking. i am planning to have an update on the progress of injection molding, and on the survey part. the injection molding has been casted, i'm waiting on a picture of the molding. i'm going to show some samples of first run of the molding to keep you posted on the progress. the next step is refinement of the molding. on the survey part, i'm signing up backerkit service where our backers can update their info at any time before we ship. people move around and their addresses will change. one more thing is that i'm working to get the best deal on the bluetooth transmitter, and it's very close. best regards  dp
should we have gotten the surveys already?
@ks_aim: thank you so much for your support. i will send out a survey and you will have a chance to get the add-on during that time.
i'm so glad this project was funded! i've been waiting for a quality bluetooth mic solution like this for a long time. it's great to have a disconnecting chord with headphones, but it can still be a hassle. can't wait to get my adaptor!! thank you for putting this out, congrats on getting funded!!
@cj: it's great. thank you guys. now our focus is on delivering the rewards to all our backs.
yay! we got funded!
@jim crone: hi. jim, thank you for backing us. right now it's not the time, we are not officially funded yet by kickstarter. it will be by midnight. we will send out a survey after everything becomes official. if you have any other questions, please let us know. happy new year! best regards,   dp
i'm a backer and i wondered do i need to choose 3.5 mm now or later?
@alex yu thank you for your pledge. i just got back from the fireworks display in san francisco, it was beautiful. the color is a stretch goal and we will make colors available when we reach that goal. after we officially get funded, we will send out a survey so you can tell us what headphones models you have, then we know what models of btunes we should send to you.
hi just backed your project one question though, how do we go about the choosing of the headphones color ect. by the way i have been hoping for a product like this to come into existence and i thank you for being the people to do it.
saw something similar http://www.dx.com/p/mini-bluetooth-handsfree-car-kit-w-mp3-player-speaker-black-200346#.vkswfnvy3sa
@yahya al hashemi that's a great plan. i've known some who bought two btunes to double up the battery time. btw, as you know, the choice of color is a stretch goal. we will have more colors after we reach the stretch goal. i hope we will hit the goal.
@vincent thank you for pointing it out. it's a basic bluetooth transmitter that we oem'ed  from a manufacturer. we put it as an add-on for the convenience of some backers, so they get the whole package. sure, anyone can go to get a bluetooth transmitter. we are negotiating to get the best model with the longest battery time. i will update this part.
@lanezhao thank you for your pledge. the surface is actual two toned. the front and top part is matte, and the out layer is glossy. the design is inspired by the bamboo shoot. we took in two layered design. the battery issue was raised before. the concern was aaa battery is too big for shell and leave too little room for the pcb. in addition to that, it will require to have small parts to hold the battery, the reliability of these small parts is tough to achieve. we really want to have something that is sturdy.
have matte surface version? i don't like the high-gloss surface. looks cheap. i thought if can be change battery is great. like use aaa battery.
i looked but didn't find any specs for the addon transmitter - am i missing something?
@dp deng, cool! thanks... i know, the zik 2.0 is wireless! but the btunes comes handy while traveling and can use it with the zik's flight mode (only in cords mode) which saves me more listening time, plus i'll be still having it cordless ^_^ p.s. i'd like to have my two btunes, one in white color and the other in black! (i know... can't wait!) cheers
@yahya al hashemi: thank you for your pledges and support. we will send the adapter for your qc 25. but parrot zik 2.0 is already wireless. you don't need the btunes to make them wireless. we didn't test the btunes on parrot zik 2.0, can't say how well it will work on them. the transmitter will work with parrot zik 2.0.
hi, congrats for hitting it ahead of the deadline! just pledged for early bird special (2) + $50 for 2 x bluetooth transmitters! additionally i would need 3.5mm adaptors with each of the btunes since i'm using bose qc25 & parrot zik 2.0 cheers...
@shyam patel: when you fill the survey after the project is officially funded, please let us know you have both qc 15 and 25, we will ship both adapters with the btunes.
hi. i received a pair of bose quiet comfort 25 headphones for christmas but i already have the bose 15. i would like to which btunes between each headphone. will you be supplying two adaptors or is there an extra charge?
@tony thank you for your backing and support. our story goes back to the idea to make existing wired headphones wireless, we didn't find any. we designed the btunes specifically for the headphones 1) great music, 2) plug and play and cover as many brands as possible, 3) looks great, 4) long lasting. we packed aptx/aac for both android and ios devices, note, apple doesn't support aptx on its ios devices. many popular headphones maintain recessed connectors so you have to use their cables to connect. we saw that's a problem, we designed adapters for bose quiet comfort 15/25. we designed 2.5mm model and will fit sennheiser's momentum series and for bose soundtrue series. the 3.5mm model will fit all models of beats and monster models (even those models with recessed connectors). back on streaming music quality, you'll need csr chipset and license to support aptx. aac also requires license fee for each unit shipped, the licensee (that's us) will have to pay an initial fee to license its use. i don't see any generic receivers to implement aac, which apple uses in its products. we build in a mic in the btunes and license and employ all the latest technology in audio dsp technologies. the point is that we designed btunes to give you the best experiences for your headphones.
aside from 2.5mm/3.5mm (which can easily be addressed with an adapter), i guess i just don't get what the differrence is between this and just about every other bluetooth 4.0 adapter on the market today. for instance, http://www.amazon.com/streambot-wireless-bluetooth-streaming-receiver/dp/b00mjmv0gu
@josé andrés lópez de-fez: i saw that you added $25 to your pledge for one unit of the transmitter. you are all set. thank you.
done. i hope it works. i couldn't say anywhere that the 25 extra us$ are for the bluetooth transmitter.
@josé andrés lópez de-fez: for the add-on transmitter you just add $25/unit to your pledge.
@josé andrés lópez de-fez: thank you for your support. the adapter for bose qc 15 is included.
hi. congrats for  the idea. just became a backer. i have a bose qc15. will the adapters be included? what should i do to get the bluetooth transmitter? i didn't see any option to check while subscribing
do we have to add the $25 to the pledge or can this be done in the post-funding survey? #transmitter
congrats on reaching the funding goal!  really looking forward to getting them.  best of luck going forward.   cheers...
congratulations dp on reaching you $40k goal!!!! i hope production goes to plan and i'm looking forward to reviewing the product.
@nathan frueh: thank you for your support. yes, the transmitter is for all backers. just add $25/unit to your pledge. you did it and you are all set.
is that bluetooth transmitter available to everybody? i updated my pledge to include 25 extra dollars, i just want to make sure that's still okay. thanks!
@julian freeman the transmitter will transmit anything it receives. yes, if you plug it into a computer, it will transmit music via bluetooth when you play music. if you plug it into the in-flight entertainment, it will transmit music/movies/tv via bluetooth. if your tv has a 3.5mm output, plug it in, you will be able to listen to your tv via bluetooth.
out of curiosity, will the bluetooth transmitter bonus be able to transmit sound wirelessly from, say, a computer or anything you plug it into? i'm just going off of what it looks like.
@juan carlos silva thank you for your inputs. i and my team appreciate your thoughtful comments. the btunes positioned to make wired headphones wireless, and the phone call is a bonus. we've already taken your inputs to make play/pause/next track/previous track available in the btunes. during a phone call, you can mute the call with 2 quick presses.
never mind, you support my headphones :p. thank you.
my headphones look like they have a basic port for the jack, if they don't work though will i be able to get my money back?
i think double tapping the button for mute is a bad idea.  anyone who's had a bluetooth in the past has experienced the multi-tap feature which seems to not register properly after a while of use or timing per person trying to double tap will vary and disappoint. everything about this product is marketed toward and was supposed to be able making headphones wireless unless i'm reading this all wrong and the video doesn't show that.  the calling features are shown as being a bonus but if the button is used for call control then i will need to use my phone to control my music and volume instead of the btunes which takes away the point imo.  too much focus on calling features where most people don't actually talk on the phone, they text which may be why you are short on funding.   strongly consider making the button, or adding buttons for music controls and this would be a hit.   if you remove the cable that has all that functionality already and not replace it in this device seems like a missed opportunity.  i'm sorry to say i'm pulling my support.  thanks for reading.
@chad bentz thank you for sharing. lol. i could have used it in my video.
plugged. http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2q37rp/every_goddamn_day_of_my_life/cn2uy9y
@kenni songa i found this image http://ig.tamindir.com/gal/2f85c7ee7b79/sennheiser-hd8-dj-fotograflari_96942.jpg . the btunes fits well with most headphones' port at the bottom. the dj8 is on the side, we have to make measurement or get a hand on a unit. if you look at our design for the 2.5mm model (see update #2), you will see we added a groove to accommodate "twist and lock" mechanism. the stem below the 2.5mm plug is 16mm long. is it possible for you to make a measurement (with the design in mind)?
@jw cheah and @ivan siew to add the bluetooth adaptor, please follow these steps. 1) log on to your kickstarter account 2) visit https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2116595848/the-btunes-plug-in-pure-wireless-hifi-sound 3) click on "manage" (pledge) under "your are a backer" 4) add $25 to your pledge. that's it.
@h lande, we set up a stretch goal to add in different colors. when we reach the stretch goal, we can certainly consider a silver color.
@h lande i got them from amazon, http://www.amazon.com/vandesail-female-headphone-adapters-converter/dp/b00lwv7pea
where can i buy this male-female-adapter for beoplay h6? yours look really nice. what i found is too big and doesn't fit into the hole. thanks
curious on how to add the option for the blue tooth transmitter
interested in the bt transmitter but there isn't any option at the pledge selection, please add in so the contribution can add further towards the goal line. ;)
i haven't had a chance to check my headphones, but will it work with the sennheiser hd dj 8? the headphone jack is a 2.5mm but you have to twist to lock it into place. will that affect the way the btunes fits? thanks! i'm really excited about this and can't wait to try it out.
or with tan leather? otherwise it's a little pungent out
really nice to hear that it fits h6 with the adapter. but will there be a metal version? so that it fits more to beoplay appearance?
@aviram ben moshe thank you for your backing. the h6's special geometry is such that the btunes won't support it out of the box, see http://www4.pcmag.com/media/images/401267-bang-olufsen-beoplay-h6-inline.jpg… , however, if you get an adaptor, something like http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/41xrbugsdtl.jpg, it will work.
hi what about a support for b&o h6?
@dp deng, that's fantastic news about the mute button.  i'm really looking forward to finally having a fully featured, high quality, music/hands free device (with the qc 25 noise canceling, to boot!).  i understand that some purists have probably heard poorly implemented bluetooth wireless audio before, but i've heard it done well, and it can be great.  it sounds like your team has really done its homework with the feature set and hardware to only make compromises where absolutely necessary but staying true to the high quality audio that people will expect when paired to a reasonably expensive set of headphones.  best of luck and i'll spread the word!
thank you, @jeremy naiden, for your concern. we are working hard to get the word out about the btunes. backers can help by spreading the words among their friends circle too. take it to facebook, twitter, instagram or headphones forums. our project is progressing at a relatively constant pace, i'd like to see a more brisk pace. i'm digging deep into my family and friends circle to get their support. i am also talking with some gift shops owners and some retailers. the good news is they all like the idea, and i'll have to work harder to get their attention in the time of the busiest season of the year. i've set up some demo time slots to show them how good the btunes is. any leads are highly appreciated too. btw, my office is open to anyone who'd like to see a demo. just drop me a message and a time a day, come to my office. or if you organize a meet at your location (san francisco, san jose, oakland, and east bay), i'll stop by to show and tell :-). i'm open to any ideas from backers. thank you.
@jeremy naiden for the mute button feature, yes, it's built in from the start. during phone calls, you double click on the button to mute.
i am getting concerned this may not get funded.  what can we do to help because the price is right? also, i'd like to note a feature request for a mute button for phone calls.  i think this is a differentiating feature when it comes to conference calls and is something i look for when evaluating any wireless telecom solution. thanks!
@tose madzarov: thank you for your backing our project. at this point, the btunes supports b&o h2 out of the box. the h6's special geometry is such that the btunes won't support it out of the box, see http://www4.pcmag.com/media/images/401267-bang-olufsen-beoplay-h6-inline.jpg… , however, if you get an adaptor, something like http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/i/41xrbugsdtl.jpg, it will work.
and now what can i do�my earphones are a b&o h6 �i am a backer
@christopher j chiu: thank you for your backing. qc2 and qc15 share the same design of the connector, the btunes works with qc2.
@h lande: thank you for your support. unfortunately due to the special geometry of the h6, the btunes is not compatible with b&o h6.
if these work with the bose qc15 and qc25... will it work with my older qc2?
hi can you tell me if this will work with beoplay h6?
@donald thank you for backing us. echo cancellation is implemented.
i'm in for one. any chance of supporting echo cancellation?
@james thank you. we noted your preference. will tally all counts from all backers.
@peter thank you for the info. i appreciate your help to spread the word about our project.
@juan in general, more power is needed to drive bigger drivers headphones. we calculated the battery needed and tested working samples to confirm with the design to reach the 10 hour running time. there is only one button on the btunes. we noted your preference, and will tally all votes. thank you.
the powerbeats wireless earbuds are very small and give a full 6 hours of playback minimum over 4.0 have you tested the actual battery life of the btunes?  10-12 hours is a lot for something that small but the more the better right? :) i vote more for track control and volume buttons over everything else.
dp (i used to work for cisco and rented a hotel at the easy 8 during the week in freemont)paul, perhaps you are unaware of this, but apparently part of the kickstarter ranking in our projects has to do with the activity in the comments section.  just a helpful gift from idined to you for the holiday season, share this with your other backers of other projects and make the gift keep on giving.  make sure you tell your backers to come back and add a comment each day, i will continue to try to keep up by doing the same with you. peter gits from the idined project
in the earlier design sketch with a longer mic tip also increase clarity when in a noisy environment. with a larger space inside the compartment, the battery size can be increase while maintaining the same cross sectional area. i vote for first button, short press - play/pause, long press - siri/google now. second button-next track. third button-previous track, both second and third button - eq preset, rock, jazz., classical, dance. since you are implementing the csr 8645 that has aptx, it makes sense to cater for music playback with such functions. those with a smartphone can activate siri or google to perform voice dial or redial.
@james for the issue of the extendable mic, it's not necessary with the choice of the mic we use. the mic is top notch. you can use it in the car by putting it on the dash board.
@james thank you for raising the issue of battery life. bluetooth 4.0 le saves energy when some devices don't need to communicate with the host so much. for example, you have a fitness tracker, you don't need the tracker and your phone to communicate all the time or every milliseconds, you can save battery time that way. when you stream music to the btunes, the btunes works all the time in step with your smartphones. the size of the btunes and the battery size are in linear relationship. to increase the time from 10 to 12 hours, you'd increase the battery size by 20%. we really really want to keep the btunes size small.
@juan i understand your concerns and appreciate your backing us. we went with the single button design for its simplicity, and we have a trade off of these functions play/pause, siri/voice dial, next track, previous track, redial. our engineers just confirmed after consultation with bluetooth chip manufacturer that we can choose only three out of the five. our current design calls for play/pause, siri/voice dial, redial. we are complete open for discussion, and welcome more feedback in this area. for example, you can use siri or google now on iphones or android phones, and the same for redial, that will free those two. we can then have play/pause, next track, previous track. we are all ears to our backers, tell us what you all think of it.
two issues. firstly bluetooth 4.0 should allow for longer battery life, please increase to 12 hrs minimum. this will allow for at least one full day of use, you also could increase the batt capacity. secondly, a extendable mic that slide out of the adapter will be great as some people have larger head, and the mouth will be too far from the mic.
thank you for addressing each point, and as quickly as you did.  those adapters are definitely small and in haste i found those which are rather ugly but you get the reference.  i have beats and they would work fine as is but should i change its nice to know i'd have options.  the skip and go back is a deal breaker for me and would unfortunately have to pull my support. i would like to see others input on redial button over music controls since i'm only 1 opinion.  back before a2dp the only bluetooth option was redial but with the primary focus on making your current headphones wireless it's essential to easily skip, pause, and go back similar to what is offered with the apple inline mic control. i hope it's something that you are able to do prior to the end of the campaign.   thanks for reading and your reply.
@juan on your third point, yes, if those adapters are smaller enough and fit with the headphones you have, it will work.
@juan the second point is about removable jacks. yes, we spent a lot of time investigate on it. there are a few obstacle. the jacks are divided into a few groups, for example, at the bottom at the center, off center on the edge, recessed connectors with different sizes, even some internal lock mechanisms. headphones are very personal items, the manufacturers make thousands of models. we can't possibly cover all of them at the moment. our strategy is to cover as many models as possible with losing how it looks on the headphones. another issue is that if the adapters are small, it's very easy to misplace them. we will make adapters for bose qc15 and qc25, they are large enough that you don't lose them so easily.
@juan thank you for raising these good issues. as i answered a similar question in private message to a backer, we are looking into the skip/rewind issues in the software now. it's a trade off on certain features. you are absolutely right, our foremost and original idea is to transform wired headphones wireless, so music is at the center of the campaign.
few questions: 1. is there a reason instead of skip and go back you went with redial for the multi press function on the headset?  i'm gonna guess every backer here can't name the last person they called with certainty or in the history of bluetooth headsets anyone is really that dependent on the redial button.  i think changing this to skip/go back makes the most sense since you are making headphones meant for music wireless, and being able to make calls a bonus.   anyone else? 2. is there a reason you are unable to make adapters for 2.5/3.5 jacks?  something that was removable and place the opposite jack in its place?  would help more people make the purchase if they know should they switch products their investment wasn't wasted. http://www.ebay.com/itm/new-3-5-mm-f-to-2-5-mm-m-stereo-adapter-/321607043527… 3. for the headphones that the jack isn't at the bottom wouldn't something like this work?  you could have one made to fit the btunes plug instead of losing another backer. http://www.ebay.com/itm/4-polig-stereo-3-5-mm-winkeladapter-winkel-adapter-stecker-kupplung-buchse-/141470447310…
@tom just want to add that looking at the image http://images10.newegg.com/neweggimage/productimage/0th-00wu-00011-06.jpg which shows the connector, the connector is not recessed, so it will work. here's the general rule. if the connector is at the very bottom of the headphones, even the connector is recessed inside (less than 13mm for 3.5mm plug or less than 16mm for 2.5mm plug). the btunes will work.
@tom it looks like that it's compatible. could you tell me what type plug you have on the headphones side? if you can use it to plug into your smartphones (iphone or android phones or tablets of all brands), it's 3.5mm.
awesome! we love your project and we are happy to be one of your backers!
i wanted to check and see if my headphones were compatible. they're ferrari by logic3 and the model number is t350b. here's a newegg link for them: http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx… thanks for the help!!!
thanks for a great project! i'm a backer! happy holidays...
@jesper the dac and amplifier is high quality on board from csr. the plug is not interchangeable between the 2.5mm and 3.5mm, however, you can use it with iem with those female to female adapters http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1…
what kind of dac and amplifier are you planning on using? it would be great if it was of higher quality... or if you made a hifi version of it. the other question is regarding the plug: is it interchangeable between 2.5 and 3.5 male as well as 3.5 female so you can use it with iems? is this the plan? and a final request is to be able to skip tracks. this is used far more than say play/pause...
ok thank you!
@codrin you will make your choice at the end of the campaign, no worries.
thank you for the update. i want to change my headphone selection from 3.5 beats studio to herman kardon cl 2.5
hi. backers, here are the updated new headphones the btunes supports sony: (3.5mm) mdr10r mdr10rnc mdr1rnc alpine headphones b&o beoplay h2 bose: 2.5mm bose quiet comfort 3. cheers
@felipe there's a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch… which shows how to remove the cable. the recess part is pretty deep and it's horizonal, and that will make the btunes to point downward. it won't look so nice on hd380.
@codrin i looked up on the web and found these images http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17ug7yf7h76f1jpg/xlarge.jpg , http://www.gadgetmac.com/storage/product-images/harman_kardon_cl_classic_headphones_cushions.jpg . it's a straightforward 2.5mm plug. our 2.5mm btunes will work with these.
i have a 2.5 harman kardon cl ...is that compatible?
could i suggest that you create a compatibility list of headphones on the start page? for the 2.5mm and 3.5 mm. i have the qc15 so that would be in the 2.5mm list. thanks
is it compatible with sennheiser's hd 380 pro? the connector is just like the 3.5 mm but smaller. not sure if it's 2.5 though
@ishmeet amsaudio has quite a few different models. could you take a look at your model? if it looks like this type http://www.gadgetmac.com/storage/product-images/beats_solo_2_headphones_red.jpg or recessed like this one http://allthingsd.com/files/2012/10/p1030362.jpg it will work. there is a 13mm clearance for the recessed part. we plan to do a new update to show you how to check whether the btunes will work on your headphones. btw, the 3d model on the page helps a lot too.
will it work with sync headphones by 50 cent??
@myron thank you for inquiry. we have two models, one is 2.5mm and one is 3.5mm. looking at the 3d in the main description, you can see there's a stem below the plug (trrs ). the height for 3.5mm is 13mm, and the height for 2.5mm is 16mm. we try to make these two models to cover as many models as possible. there is no technical difficulty to make adapters for other models, the main obstacle is funding and time. we have to make injection moulding for each model, and the turn around time for a new moulding is generally between 30-60 days. we will make adapters for bose qc15 and qc25 in this campaign, as we budgeted it in the funding goal.
i think this is a clever and elegant concept for wireless headphones. question about the compatibility with proprietary headphone jacks, similar to chad's about the bose qc 15s: i have a pair of sennheiser pxc 350s which also have a non-standard 2.5 mm jack. http://www.hifiheadphones.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/220x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/e/sennheiser-517681-cable-for-pxc350-pxc450-300x300_1.jpg however it is similar to the bose jack in that it is angled and recessed into the ear cup. i was wondering if you guys were providing specific models of the btunes for each non-standard headphone model or if there was some sort of adapter for allowing the btunes to fit in non-standard and recessed ear cup jacks? and if so, what are your thoughts on support for the sennheiser pxc line? thanks for your efforts, and i'm looking forward to seeing this project become a success!
@chad the adapter for the qc15 will conform to the overall shape, as it has to be easily removable. we also need to follow bose's internal wiring for the adapter. bose made the internal wiring totally non-standard.
@aziz good news on the battery level. we are working on a solution to give a battery level voice prompt. each time when you turn on the btunes, you will hear a voice prompt from one of 3 levels: high, medium and low.
@akira, thank you for your suggestion. we looked into it. aaa battery dimension is d10.5mmxl44.5mm, which will make the btunes much large. we wanted to minimize the size with the largest possible battery capacity. it will also introduce more small parts that we don't want our users to deal with, that will bring more chance for breakage. our goal is to build it small, just one button and one charging port.
@creator not sure if you have it mocked up already, but if the btunes qc15 adapter would recess the "neck" of the btunes into the headphone a bit it would make a for a nicer look (more durable?) rather then fully protruding out of the bottom like other headphones require. for years i have been wondering if bose was planning on making a bt adapter to fit into that oddly shaped connection... camp pretty close to diy'ing together a bt/mini jack adapter to the side of the headphone.  super excited you have come up with a much more elegant solution!
regarding the battery replaceability point some have been mentioning. i know this will change the design significantly, but what about using a ni-mh aaa battery? that will allow usb charging (with the proper charging chip) as well as on the fly replacement. with ni-mh rechargeable batteries being available from different makers, or if traveling non-rechargeables available in stores. for example, the panasonic eneloop aaa is a 1.2v 750mah battery, so it should provide a reasonable amount of juice.
@chad, you are absolutely right. we will include an adapter for the qc15 (qc25 too). at the end of the successful campaign, we will send out a survey so you tell us what headphones you have, and we will send you the correct model of the btunes.
hi. @chad, double tap is to redial the previous phone number, it's the customary action in the bluetooth headset.
@creator are you making an additional adapter to be able to fit inside the qc15?  the input housing is non standard:  http://img.auctiva.com/imgdata/1/5/6/2/2/6/4/webimg/653477270_tp.jpg
@creator ... if you already have play/pause ... can you easily add double tap to skip / triple tap to skip backward?
@aziz thank you for the suggestion. to show the battery level is still a work in progress. we have made the battery level available on apple's ios devices: iphones and ipads. after you make the connection, you can see the battery level on the screen.
guys a great feature would be if it tells you the hours left on the btunes at turn on!
i just made an entry to the faq section. here you go. how to operate the btunes the btunes has only one button at its end below the micro usb charging port. when plugged into your headphones, you can hear a voice prompt after each operation, for example, "power is on", "device is connected", "power is off" ... all the operations are context sensitive. power on (when power is off): press & hold the button for 4 seconds. it will search and connect with the most recent previously connected devices. if all of the previous devices are out of range, or their bluetooth is turned off, the btunes will go to standby state. power off (when power is on): press & hold the button for 4 seconds. pairing (manual & power is off): press & hold the button for 7 seconds. do not release the button at second 4, keep holding the button until you hear "pairing...". pairing (nfc): refer to your nfc equipped device for instructions. generally, just tap your device on the btunes, and follow the instruction on your device's screen. in this case, you don't have to plug the btunes to your headphones. answer phone call (on and connected): when hearing a call coming, a quick press picks up the call on the btunes. or pick it up on your phone, and then direct to bluetooth or speaker. reject a call: press and hold for 2 seconds. or reject it on your phone. play music (on and connected): a quick press. pause music (music is on): a quick press. siri/google now (on and connected): press and hold for 2 second. or you can initiate it from your device.
@andrew you can use skype with the btunes on windows/mac. as you connect with any bluetooth device, you can use the btunes as the audio input/output. you can use it with siri, google now, facetime (or facetime audio), skype (audio/video)...
love the concept of this project and i hope it does well.  @creator will we be able to use the new bluetooth connectivity with apps on the computer such as skype?
thank you for the overwhelming support and encourage from the community. i have received some questions the btunes, and i will gather and come up with a faq section.  as always, keep sending questions/suggestions to me. i will address all the questions or issues. in the mean time, i'd like to say "thank you!".
@joe, thank you for your suggestion to make the battery replaceable. remember the battery itself is specific to the internal design, and oem'ed directly from the factory, which requires minimum orders of thousands of units. it's not available in stores where you can go to buy them. i'm open to the idea and will investigate more in this area. i appreciate it. the battery will retain 80% capacity after minimum 300 full duty cycles of charging.
@creator, thanks for your feedback, further to the previous question: 1. how many times can the battery recharge? 2. is this the only way to send the btunes back to you to replace the battery and ship it back to backers when the battery comes into the end? suggestion on stretch goal: a spare battery and the special tool for replacing the dead battery would be much meaningful to the backer than the color choice.  :)
hi. hayley, you can connect the btunes with any two bluetooth devices. yes, you can connect it with your mac and your iphones.
hi. darrell, you are right, we thought of making the stem rotatable along the body. it's one of the first thing we considered, the design will be very flexible. we surveyed a lot of headphones and talked with a lot of owners. it's best to make as small number of movable parts as possible. to make it strong, it was determined to use metal for the joint and the body, but then the bluetooth transmission will be block. if you leave an opening for bluetooth, it won't look so good.  for many of the headphones on the market, especially those premium brands, the jacks are basically symmetric at the bottom, that's we settled with the present design. it's a trade off, and it took us a long time to weigh in different issues. if you look at the btunes on beats, it's plugged in, and you can actually rotate around the stem.  any small bumps on the btunes generally will turn the btunes around the stem. when you wear the headphones, it's basically over your shoulder and close to your neck. it's mostly shielded as you move your head around. i've tested it many times sitting in the airplane (the space is quite limited) by making all kinds of head movement, much to the chagrin of my neighboring passenger at one time.
@creator, thanks for the reply being light is good and as you suggested should be removed from the headset when not in use however i think there may be a risk of 2x the mechanical force transferred via the fulcrum point into the connector if accidentally   bumped from normal activities like adjusting your glasses or chasing a fly from your face etc. have you though about some type of ball joint in the unit body to limit possibility of damage if bumped? another benefit of some form of ball joint is to align the main body of the unit where the headset connector is not at the bottom of the headset, aesthetics.
curious if you've tested btunes with skullcandy over ear headphones? also wondering if the two devices hat can be connected simultaneous include mac oxs - would i be able to connect to my mac & iphone at the same time? thanks.
hi. darrell, if i understand you correctly, you are worried about the socket on the headphones. the btunes itself is very light. when you wear your headphones with the btunes, in general, you won't bump it with anything. when you put down the headphones, there's a chance for it to bump into something. however, as soon as you put your headphones on your desk, in a way, the btunes is shielded by your headphones. if you put them into your backpack, yes, the chance of bumping increases. i suggest to unplug it when you put your headphones into a backpack.
hi. joe, we took a lot of care in designing the btunes, and we need special tools to replace the battery which is oem'ed specific to the btunes. the most important consideration is to reduce the overall dimension, and to prolong the battery usage with bigger capacity.
greetings, cool idea, my only concern is protecting headset connector from damage from being bumped. i have had a few pc headsets over the years with a mic attached via a 3.5mm socket and over time they have seem to fail in or around the socket. how does your design look to minimise the risk of damage to the headset socket or unit from accidental bumps? cheers darrell
@creator, is there an easy way for us to replace the battery? although it comes with 10 hours battery, however in case the battery is degrading, an easy swapping or replacing would be necessary.
