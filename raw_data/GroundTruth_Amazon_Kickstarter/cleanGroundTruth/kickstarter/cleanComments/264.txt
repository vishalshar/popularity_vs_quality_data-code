go david!!!  so psyched i found this, and super excited you met your goal.  all the best to you, and can't wait to see this amazing film spread its wings out even further into the world.
dear matteo, thanks so much for your comment, and apologies for taking so long to respond the issue of making downloads available internationally has been a logistical one, but we've just resolved it. and i'm happy to say that we are now able to offer the digital download to anywhere in the world -- including milan! so, if you're still interested, please visit our site again and you'll see that we've created a new reward called the walter salles.  best, david
