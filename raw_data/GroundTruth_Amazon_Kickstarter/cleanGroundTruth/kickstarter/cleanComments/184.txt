great work! i love the film.
congratulations- glad you made your goal
best of luck.  as a long time city resident and (legal) dirt bike rider i look forward to seeing the finished product.
hey man i was first shown this in my video 1 class at mica almost three years ago apparently by the same teacher where the idea came about with. i supported you on your fort run and hopefully this second time will complete all you guys have been working for and if i remember correctly what she said to our class but that you get no more hard drive malfunctions and everything goes well! living in bmore i see the boyz riding around all the time. it is defiantly a true one of a kind culture, even if other cities are now trying to form their own versions. nothing could replace the original city of dirt bike gangs. would be awesome if your film ever did a one night screening across america in movie theaters! hope you get what you need can't wait to see the final version!
is lofty your name or an adjective? as soon as i saw the pitch video i was hooked. i wish i could have contributed more at this time. i do pray that this project gets funded. i shared your project on fb.
this looks sick, i love seeing documentaries on aspects of the world that you would likely never see, unless you live there. the types of things that would normally never get mainstream media attention. good luck man.
good luck lotfy nathan! happy to support a local, awesome looking doc! tweeted and fb'd! if you practice yoga or know anyone who does, i'd love any help spreading the news about the yogomat (also a md project)! please let all backers know if you're having local screenings to the dc area too! best regards, ryon lane
looks amazing! hope this gets funded
