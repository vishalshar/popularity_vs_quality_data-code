yes, i received it and is working well.  thanks for following up!
hi mark, just to confirm, bill answered and has made arrangements for you to receive yours in australia correct?  feel free to let everyone know how well it works after you install it. thanks ~victor
hello victor & bill, i backed your project last year and was notified that the item was shipped and funds taken from my credit card.  it's been over 5 weeks and i haven't seen it. i have also sent numerous emails to contact you in regards to the whereabouts of my device,  why don't you respond?
wow, really amazing. i'm buying more!  we need a travel version!
wow.  we were lucky enough to receive the odorless on a test run and cannot.live.without.it!  it's easy to install and works incredibly well.  the added benefit of filtering out germs makes the odorless even more invaluable.  we are excited for the product launch and are ordering more for our other bathrooms!
absolutely amazing...coolest thing ever !!! i was lucky to be one of the testers for this product and i must say i was impressed...bad odor goes away immediately !!! the best thing is one doesn't feel self conscious about the people who will be using the restroom after you. i just can't wait to have it in my place !!!
i have tried a sample unit. installs in about 5 minutes and more importantly it works! don't "go" without it... seriously... i call people into the bathroom to do the smell check immediately after and it's amazing - no odor. the stats say 99% of micro-organisms that cause #2 odor are removed - that's been the case in my experience in my bathoom.
sooo happy to have been a part of the test group for the odorless. in a lake house full of people over the 4th of july...this product could not have come at a better time!!!
