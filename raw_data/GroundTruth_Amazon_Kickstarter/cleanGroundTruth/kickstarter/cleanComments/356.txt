my package has never been opened. can i return mine for the newer model that won't break?
how long will we be able to return broken headphones? i am currently not using mine, as i am still waiting for the android drivers - so they are not broken, yet. i fear they will break soon after the android drivers are released and that by then the replacement program might be over.
hi everyone, we'd like to remind you that the broken headband issue is now 100% solved on our new units!  and we're sure many of you will be interested by the release of our sdk! go check it out at http://www.3dsoundlabs.com/category/developers/ enjoy!
@altaf, we don't have any date to provide yet, we're working on it! @jian h, unfortunately we never got a chance to test these bk9 studio headphones, but again we just used a design, not technical characteristics. @matt carleton, our team will contact you in the very next minutes, stay tuned!
my headphones also cracked during light operation. the sound is great but pretty ridiculous to break within 3 months of use.

@creator you said: "...in order to roll-out our technology in the best time, we used a design created by an oem, that may thus also have been used by other manufacturers.  this was only for design purpose, everything in our headset was custom made (drivers, foam ear-cups, head-tracking module, etc). as a matter of fact, our product, even though it has the same design is completely different from the headphones you are all describing..." can you show us backers the proof of the performance difference between neoh and other phones with the exactly same design (e.g. bk9 studio headphones), such as frequency response? thanks.
hi. when can we expect an android app for the neoh ?
@victor @ shlomi blushtein we contacted you to let you know about your replacement. the issue is now completely solved on our latest batches! have a nice day
head base is broken. the plastic simply snapped over normal operation.  please help.
my neoh had cracks in the middle and seems breaking down into two pieces soon, and i rarely use it for now!   any replacement or a refund??
hi have som hard time to get my to work on windows with 3d sound are there any there have it working ? on windows 10 whit a asus xonar dx  the help and guide dont help me but i think it just me
hey everyone, in order to roll-out our technology in the best time, we used a design created by an oem, that may thus also have been used by other manufacturers.  this was only for design purpose, everything in our headset was custom made (drivers, foam ear-cups, head-tracking module, etc). as a matter of fact, our product, even though it has the same design is completely different from the headphones you are all describing. we hope this addressed your concerns. don't hesitate to contact us if you have any question. hello@3dsoundlabs.com
can we have an update on why the headband is seen all over the web for a really cheap price? is it you who copied sony and other chinese products or the model you are using is simply a basic model used by all manufacturer?
hi everyone, our fresh new batch is finally ready and we should be able to ship the first units in around a week!
me too azael.. @3dsoundlab: when can we expect them? i pledge your project 10 months ago and get the message "your package is ready" 4 months ago... :-(
never got mine :(
i think 3d sound labs bought the headphone itself from a discount chinese manufacturer and added their sound processor. i did some searching and was able to find the same headphone for as low as $13 retail... or for bulk sale on alibaba for $4 each. glad i paid$150 for a bolt on audio processor and a $4 headphone!
yes i see the same ones, the "bk9 studio headphones" look exactly the same as these ones, besides the logo. other than that they are in fact on sale for $20...what's up with that? is this another manufacturer or is it the same one?
interestingly, i just found these exact same headphones on groupon for $20, just missing the surround sound processor hanging off the side.
hello. the headband snapped. i just took off the headphone of my head and the headband broke. please contact me. thank you.
@philip tong we're really sorry your headset snapped. it seems you're in the 7% of our unlucky users touched by this issue. we just sent you all the details by email.
n€oh !!!  oh n€ !!! my neoh had band just snapped ... broken at the left hinge. since mine is hardly used, anyway i can get a refund ??
ok, that's partially good news, thx!
@spitfire_ch we are actually working on an audio driver for windows and not a simple application ! it is in fact already available to download in beta version on our website. i'm really sorry that we haven't been clearer on the windows 7 version, but we're already working hard on the compatibility with the latest versions of windows (8.1 and 10).  we really hope you'll find a way to update.
"@aaron unfortunately we currently have no plans to support windows 7." well you could have mentioned that during the campaign. i won't be able to use your headphones for 1 to 2 years. i supported you because you claimed you would support windows (which i assumed would be an audio driver i could use in any video player, games etc.). you did not mention you would only create a windows app :(
@aaron unfortunately we currently have no plans to support windows 7.
hey guys, as i can see here you have alot of stuff on your mind. but i still have a question not regarding refunds or broken headpieces. will your windows app be available for win7 64bit? i checked your beta link and it was win 8.1 or higher. i'm not in the mood to update anytime soon, so i just wanted to ask if thats a thing you were thinking about. thanks anyways aaron
@mikhail zenchenkov what your experienced with your headphones is not a normal behavior and is not representative of our product at all. you chose to opt for refund, and we perfectly understand that. though, as i told you by email, please bear with us as we’re still waiting to be able to process our first set of refunds through paypal.  we sincerely apologize that your refund process is taking so long, but keep in mind that you’re on kickstarter, and refunds remain exceptional.  we’re trying our best to create a great product and provide the best service to our customers, so we hope you’ll all be able to enjoy our 3d audio experience.
the worst experience ever!!! i've been waiting for this headset, buying it as a present for my friend, when he tried it - it was a disaster. this head set didn't even perform at the cheapest chinese level device - it was a mono sound, it didn't work!!! at all! the app didn't work, the bluetooth didn't work! nothing worked. i contacted the company they asked me to send it back, i did it on sep-8-2015 right away. i didn't want this thing anymore and asked for the refund. they are so ineffective that even after multiple promises to do it it has not been done! even when they promised last time to do it before oct-15-2015 - it's not there! kickstarter please help me do get my refund - this company does't seem to be responsible!
i would like to say that the people at 3d sound labs have been very courteous to me ever since i have reported the broken headband issue.  i have been told they will be shipping out a december issue for new headphones and i hope these are just as good in quality and also that they rectify the issue of the headband.  to their credit, the customer support has, in my case, bent over backwards to correct the issue. this being kickstarter, issues are sure to arise. this being their first and flagship product, they seem to genuinely care about correcting the problem. thank you @creator for making the effort. this makes me view you in a better light before and i will again show others your creation. hopefully this new batch remedies the fault in manufacturing so there are no future issues. to those with issues, please remember this is kickstarter. but also that they have responded kindly, professionally, and timely. i would not ask for a refund, rather just a replacement. new products can be fraught with issues but if you give them time then you can brag about how you got there before everyone else. (my view, but still)
hi everybody, thank you for your patience. we tried to contact everyone of you that reported an issue with their headphones in order to offer a solution.  if by any chance we forgot to contact you, please feel free to drop us an email at kickstarter@3dsoundlabs.com. this little setback will soon be behind us, we sincerely hope you'll keep enjoying our 3d audio experience.
i have not received the email for the replacement of the headphones. please get back to me soon on this. i paid good money to obtain these headphones, and would like either a replacement or some form of compensation for this.
my second headband just broke, have email back and feedback on the design on the headband hope the december batch will improve the headband. love the sound, so i opt for replacement. please don't use the anti-slip coating on the plastic, it will degrade and become sticky very fast.
good contact whit 3d sound labs  are reday to ship my to be replase ind december so can we hope the problem are fix but think the keep the good work
@wai can li  we are sorry about that.  you should have received a message with explanations for a replacement.
@edward, it also says "direct customer service" but all of us who have posted on here know that hasn't been the case unfortunately.
it says on their website "satisfied or your money back". does that mean we can get refunds?
mine have broken after using it 3 times!!!
so what's going on with the headbands? are they good now or what. i still have a broken pair of $200 headphones sitting in my closet.
hey. i did contacted 3d sound labs (via their website) about my broken headband and have not heard back yet. is there an address where i could send the headphones back so that you can have it replaced ?
@andré i don't really know what to say. it's hard to send back the project "reward", at our expense without any guarantee it will be fixed or when. i'm not sending mine back until this issue is figured out.
i have just received a reply from them and they answer me by saying that i have to send my headphones back to them to further inspection. i couldn't agree less with them because firstly i will have to pay for this delivery, second i live in brazil a country that has a really high tax rate which i already had paid in the first place, third how long does it going to take to them to solve the problem and send brand new headphones to everyone with the same issue. i am really tired of waiting some action. any suggestions?
bought 2 of these and now my turn, one of it the headband, like others, broke. any update from the team on how do we rma the cracked headphone? i'm afraid that my other one will break too... anyone any idea on reinforcing the headband?
@brian kimmel maybe it looks like this because people where just work dont go in here and type but my work 100% ;-)
http://gizmodo.com/sketchy-kickstarter-campaign-ordered-to-pay-back-the-do-1730506492
well that seems to be happening with lots of people although the headband issue is only affecting 5% of customers. presumably, once they are finished checking with their supplier and testing the materials to discover what went wrong, then they will give an update. until their scientific detective work is finished, i doubt we will hear anything.
after 5 days no answer from anyone, i wrote here in the comments, i sent an email through the webpage, now i am trying on their facebook account? why are they not answering to anyone with the procedure to follow for the broken pieces? the update in kickstarter was completely insuficient. we still don't know what to do with this broken piece of 300$
@creator my neoh headphones has never be able to be discovered by either your app or ipad's settings. the green light keeps flashing. please advise.
hi. my turn to have a broken head band. it gives off several crackling sounds before and today it just snapped. total usage was only less than 5 days. had been careful after hearing all those cracks and feedbacks here but guess the material was too light weight to handle the head size (just my guess). sadly i am still unable to try the 3d sound effect yet. how will i be able to get a replacement?
i have also stopped using my 3d sounds headphone ... for fear of damaging it. earlier on, apart from occasional use for listening music. i have been using it mostly as "ear muff". it is that comfortable enough to wear to sleep without hurting my ears. but all these broken headband feedback had me worried!
hi, i'm another one whose headband broke on the second day of use, it started making a few cracks sounds when i put the headphone, but in 2 days of use definitly broke in the middle of the  headband. i can't start to describe my disappointment. i spend the last 4 months speaking to everyone about this headphones. after 300$ i can't explain how is possible that the quality is worst than any other cheap headphone i've ever tried. it last considerably shorter than anything else for sure. please let me know how can obtain a new one with this flaw absolutely corrected. of course after paying 300$ i can't believe you will make me pay the delivery of the headphone to you isn't it. the 300$ pays for much more than the materials this headphone was made.
i asked about the cost of return shipping on august 24th and have yet to receive an answer. i am hesitant to pay any more money to ship the headphones back until a fix can be worked out.
i just received the new headphone after i returned the broken one. the head band material looks  as same as the first one. i sent a message for refund included 2 postal fee. very disappointed and another kickstarter failure.
@judy daniels, they gave you an option of a refund in your reply email? did they mention covering the return shipping cost as well?
hi, i got my neoh 3d headphones, and on the first day wearing them, i heard a crack, which turned into many, realizing that the head band of the neoh was made with cheap material and had horrible build quality to last long. though the audio is great, however the build quality of the neoh 3d headphones are as cheap as they can get. i would love to have mine replaced due to the excitement of having good quality headphones to be turned down by how poorly the materials have been implemented into this product. its a shame spending $300 on headphones that broke on the first day.
we purchased two sets. after a delay in shipping we finally got them. same issue as many here, both broke after their first use. sent the first set back after they broke costing $38.00! the second broke a week later after being leery to try them. maxime responded stating they have a set that they tested so i have the choice of refund or replacement. in all honesty, i am too disappointed to take a chance on another set. if they were manufactured by the same company, they inevitably they will break. after reading so many comments, from those who are not impressed with the sound or the quality... i think i will take the refund. this is not good at all. there was so much hype and so much expectation only to be such a miserable failure.besides, i have an android and i am not interested in waiting for another year for the software only to have that suck too. to date, it seems this is a kickstarter bust.
mine headphones are working correctly. however, today i took i really good look ar the headphone and find out that my headband is a little bit broken, and the worst is that i took a really good care of it. is there anything that i can do to replace it or at least fix it? thank you guys i know its hard to control all the producers but i really admire your amazing job best regards
i want to get the refund included postal fee i sent back!! don't want to wait another year or thousand years fix all the problems!!!! please just do it!!!!
@creator i got mine. i haven't tried its 3d effect. but for some reason i found that its sound quality is worse than my $20 monoprice headphones. it seems that it lacks both ends. do you have its frequency response chart?
after all the issues and limitations that have been documented with these i've decided to keep them sealed in the box and i'll sell them.  lost complete interest in the product and after hearing and witnessing their community and customer lack of care, i've lost complete faith that this company knows what it's doing.
i cannot believe this is what i have been waiting for all week. this is like a cruel joke. why don't they understand that there the app is worthless and pointless with broken headphones. they have not answered my email that i sent out to maxime 16 days ago about the cost of return shipping. does anyone have anyway that we can just get our money back? i do not want to ship the headphones back at my expense further reducing my refund value. i think it is maddening that they have had our money for 6 months with nothing on our end except a glitchy app and broken headphones.
great! the app is fixed. but it is useless to me with broken headphones...
unfortunately nothing about the quality problem in the last update...
mine just snapped in the middle also just while trying to put them on.  not even game to get any of the others out of the boxes.  this is a total fundamental design flaw. who exactly screwed this up?  is the design really that bad or poor manufacturing? can i send them all back collect? for a refund?
soooo no update at the end of the week??
hi everybody, we are planning an update this week. we have answered to your emails first but we will write to everyone who posted a comment.
i used their facebook to be heard and i received an answer. https://www.facebook.com/3dsoundlabs/posts/1124994114181571… you can probably all put your claims on this thread.
@claire benz, we won't be able to post a review on amazon until the product is released. what i've tried, is to reply to everyone of their twitter posts asking for a reply to their ks backers. i did this to @3dsoundlabs, and to their ceo xavier bonjour @xbonjour. maybe it was a coincidence but they posted here a few days later.
you all have to remember though, we're essentially the beta testers, and we're seeing behind the curtain of the growing pains of launching a product. i'm sure they've worked very hard to get this to us and are doing their best from a production stand point. however, from a customer service stand point, i feel they've failed miserably. numerous posts begging for updates, and instructions on what to do going unanswered for weeks. considering it requires an app that needs continual updates, you'll have to continually beg for a response if a future update bricks the unit. i got my headphones, didnt open them, and am actively trying to sell them. i just don't have the time to tinker with a product if dealing with the manufacturer is like pulling teeth.
this is how smart 3d should work. https://www.youtube.com/watch… but it seems like impossible for our headset.
this is sad. i thought the 3d thing was something like binaural audio. turns out it only adjusts the audio levels of the l and r depending on the location of your ipad/iphone. never got to use the headset because of poor reviews. never should've opened it so i can sell it or something.
if we (the kickstarter backers) want to get 3d sound labs attention, leave bad reviews on amazon! i havent had a response in over four days, this is absurd. i contacted them about the broken headphones, and they responded with a paris address to return them to. shipping the headphones back to paris is expensive, but i would be willing to pay that for a better quality pair. im not going to return them yet because the pair they ship back to me will most likely crack.
6 days in with no response from anyone. there is no place that i know of to report this to issue to kickstarter. their place of business is overseas so it isn't like we can file complaints to any agency in the us. it seems as though there is no way to fix this problem and we are out our money.
it seems as though every person who bought these now has a pair of broken headphones. also i highly doubt anyone of us wants to replace them until this hardware malfunction is corrected because shipping to a different country is the cheapest thing to do only to receive the same headphones with the same hardware malfunction
mine just broke as well. i didn't apply any pressure, just trying to put them on. literally got them like 2 days ago. very disappointed. please respond to this problem for i'm not the only one.
i hate to sound repetitive but mine broke as well. they broke the day after i got them. i literally went to unfold them and put them on my head. right down the middle they cracked. attached are links with pictures. i sent an email to maxime sabahec along with the pictures. they said to send them back and they will replace them. only problem is they came from paris, france and i am not paying to ship them back. i asked how they would cover shipping and received no response in over 5 days. i would like to know how this problem will be addressed since clearly i am not alone. http://imgur.com/8tr1g6o http://imgur.com/dugrzqj
my headphones broke as well.  the plastic used feels really cheap, and weak. this is something that should have been spotted at the factory during the initial test run. headphones that break when you take them off your head are useless. use better quality plastic, and reinforce the entire product. this is not worth  $300! by the way.  i was told that the pledge level i had would have something special because i gave up my early bird pledge thinking it was going to be something different than just the regular early bird. i'm extremely disappointed with this project.  where do i send this junk in for a replacement?
my headband broke as well. i emailed them and they said to send it in for a replacement but i haven't had the time to do it yet. but in the end if i get another one, the possibility of it breaking again is incredibly high and also there's still no android app so i still wouldn't be able to use it for its main purpose
to explain in further detail. there is a major crack in the middle of the headband of which renders the headphones useless.
my headphones just recently snapped in half whilst trying to put them on my head. please reply soon. this is major.

@3d sound labs  can we have an update please on what to do with the cracking issue, poor sound quality, headset size not fitting an adult's head, cables too short to use with a pc for gaming and no apps other than apple version available?
if #d sound labs would get back to us on what we could do about the cracking headband issue, that'd be great. i would have no issue on sending back my 4 headphones for a redesigned, more flexable headband set. that's the only issue i have had with these so far. i now have a crack leading from mid-headband almost to the center of the headband, so they will most likely break
my headband just broke!!! i didnt apply any stress to it, just took it out fo the case that was sitting on my desk, unfolded them, and then they snapped. i dont know if mine are defective or what, but i know i didnt cause this crack mid-headband.
i have to say that i am really disappointed with this headset. the feel is really the worst it feels cheap and the headset already cracked just by putting and removing it from my head to set it right. i am really disappointed that android and windows will not have any apps ready before the end of 2015 and probably not before 2016 summer... the sound quality is at best average compared to my 7.1 razor headset. i wanted a good wireless headset to replace my wired razor that is falling apart but i received a worst product than my ducttaped headset... i don't have a big head but it is hard to see how someone with a bogger head than me will be able to wera this over a long period. the size of the ears are really small and far from comfortable. i will not recommend this product to anyone.
received my 2 pack of headphones last week. like the 3d tracking, but not impressed with sound quality. it is similar to my son's beats on-ear and far inferior to my munitio pro40. but since the price was similar to my munitio and this has 3d effect, i guess lower sound quality is the trade-off and to be expected.
neoh works  via air play. env: airserver 5.3.2, os x 10.11 beta 7. * el capitan has a problem
the headphone has two subsystem, a headphone and a sensor subsystem. the following line is my opinion. "one player does all  calculation and sends the sound through audio cable." so, the headphone amps does not  interfere the surround effect. i use audio-technica at-pha31i. at-pha31i uses the doc connector, not headphone port. even through the doc connector, i enjoy 3d effects.
it seems i've found the answer to my particular issue (headset not connecting through the app on my ipad 2 [from the neoh faq]: "what ipad/iphone versions are compatible with 3d sound one? you’ll need a ble enabled device: iphone 4s or newer, ipad 3rd generation or newer, ipad air, ipad air 2, ipad mini, mini2, mini3, running ios 7 minimum." oh well. i've waited this long to hear what seems to be an amazing way to experience audio via headset, i guess i can wait a little longer until the neoh is compatable with devices other than those of the newer apple variety.
the 3.5mm bundled audio cable has a straight jack on one end, and angled jack in the other. i found plugging in the angled jack into the headset will eliminate audio issues. it's a perfect fit with good contacts.
i tried the 3d sound one app on ipad mini. works well with head tracking. the ios app still contain word 'neoh'.

@creator @edward this is how it works. www.accessorygenie.com/image/cache/data/products2/march2014/gg-bluegate_headphones_wood-320x320.jpg this example is for bluetooth audio receiver only. get one with call receiving functions for added convenience. there're many models to choose from at amazon.
i'm baffled as to why the entire headphone wasn't made wireless. i plan to use this with vr gaming and now i'll have to dangle a wire. also how do you expect to game with these? how do you input live audio to make this work? not happy with overall product and the sound quality is terrible. also the wire can't be moved around or the sound cuts in and out. agh!
@philip, how did you convert it to a wireless one?
@shigeru haruyama  hello, thank you for your feedbacks.  we are working on it, it will be fixed on the next release. don't hesitate to send us your feedbacks to kickstarter@3dsoundlabs.com regards
@jonathan chew hello, what is the format or file extension please ?
@philip tong hello ! thank you for your comment. your idea sounds great. have you got some pictures ?  kickstarer@3dsoundlabs.com
received my '3d sound one" branded headphones today. sound is great. now waiting for andriod app. had to pay us$32 import duties. converted it to wireless headphone using a small bluetooth receiver/transmitter. can answer calls too. life's wonderful with 3d sound one.
one player does show no movie file and no music file of upnp servers. other app buzz player shows the files and plays them. env: server: kido on mac and buzz player on ipad
alright, i seem to be able to import songs, but not videos through itunes. may i ask what is causing this? no videos can be seen at all. quite the purpose of this pair of headphones.
gone through the tutorials but seem to be unable to import movies which i purchased off itunes into the sound one app. quite frustrated.
mine is still stuck in customs
hello guys, many of you have contacted us regarding 3d sound one: please find some answers to your questions: 1. we have uploaded some tutorial videos that could be very helpful for you: https://www.youtube.com/channel/ucjdq-qv21kfeymxm0mmn9bg 2. if the sound comes from the left side only, don't hesitate to push harder to plug the cable on your headphones. the internal jack connector is a bit tight when new. 3. we are working on the android app, but can’t give you a release date as of today. of course we’ll keep you informed. 4. if you’re experiencing another problem, feel free to send us an email to kickstarter@3dsoundlabs.com. we’ll be happy to help. lastly,  your feedbacks are important as we are working to improve the  3d sound one and its app, the 3d audio player. thank you very much for your feedbacks, the team
when i attempt to connect the headset through the app on my ipad 2 nothing seems to happen. i turn on the headset and get the blinking green light, hit 'scan' in the app and it displays 'scanning' for approximately 2 seconds and then goes away with no indication of anything happening. the green light continues to blink on the headset. i tried the 'rescue' option, but when selected a box comes up saying 'updating' and never goes away; even after left for 45 minutes. i actually really wanted this for use through android devices (as well as my tv/windows pc), but as it can only be used to its full capabilities through apple devices i dug out my ipad 2 in order to try out the 3d nature of the device. is the app not really compatible with the ipad 2? i would also like to echo a recent poster and request an update on the impending android/windows compatability. other than the fore-mentioned issue i truly like the overall design and feel of the headset and look forward to using it a great deal!
i got mine, build quality decent, good packaging. i played around with them, but i am not sure if i will use them much. i have been using cordless earbuds for 2 or 3 years and am not thrilled with the cord. i have my music on apple music match, so downloading and then sticking it in the app is a step backwards for me. i will not use a 15 foot cord to my tv to watch movies. too bad all data is not via bluetooth and too bad about having to do everything in the app. i may just sell them, but likely would not get much back
@tony carey please refer to my youtube tutorial on how to fix the update issue and or to prevent it from interfering. it is posted below in the comments. if it continues to be a problem i suggest speaking with the creator.
is there any eta on an android app. would really like to use the headphones for their intended purpose rather than just any like any old headphone. i have faith in the capabilities of the 3d soundsound so please give us some kind of update for your android/windows users
for me the app keeps crashing when asks update. i click it the it just crashes. i even watch that video someone posted. anyways the demos suck. the war one is alright. if anyone is looking for some links to post in the url section here's a few. just copy and paste into app. name it whatever you want, enjoy:) http://download.16bit.fm/creomix/com003/com003_bitefisch_-_unidentified_ost.mp3 http://download.16bit.fm/imho/imho_s017/16bit.fm_imho_s017_by_coldicus_imagination_2011.mp3 http://download.16bit.fm/imho/imho_s015/16bit.fm_imho_s015_by_dj_cool_underwater_2011.mp3
so far so decent. the headphones seem to have decent sound quality so far, the build is quality, and the 3d effect, when using the app, is noticeable. i just wish it could be used more. one thing i would really like to see is drivers for both windows and windows phone. having everything inside the app truly restricts things.  i hope 3d sound labs is able to get with apple and build some drivers that can be integrated with ios in the future. so far? i'm pleased i backed this. i like the case they came in, the packaging was clean and professional as well, and what i said earlier about their build quality and so far their sound. thanks for doing a good job so far @creator and i hope things only get better.
@claire i just received mines and it was through fedex
@kris chambers hello, could you send us those informations by email to kickstarter@3dsounlabs.com please ? you must have a problem with your headphones, we're going to fix it. device : os :  serial number : thank you, have a nice day
probably the worst sound quality from any headphones i've had. the free ones from virgin airline beats these. more crackles than listening to vinyl. so disappointed in what promised to be a great product. zero stars. �����
@ sergio also in florida, yesterday morning it said it was out for delivery, and have already recieved my regular mail (usps) today. anyone in the usa know what carrier delivers the package?
looked at the head part of the set, and mine too has a crack in it. not fully detached yet, but there is a crack in the plastic band.
still haven't received mine (florida) says its been out for delivery since yesterday morning but i have no problem with that. any eta on the android application?
after testing the conversion of different dts and ac3 files, i can confirm that it works: - you need the wondershare video converter ultimate (there is a free test version which only converts a 1/3 of the movie) - convert the files to m4v files, and ensure that the audio codec is aac and the channel set on 5.1 surround. the converter is very fast (10 mins for a movie) and even reduces the size of the files a bit. now that i was able for the first time to experience the 3d effect on the headphones i would say it's ok - i'm not overly excited about the effect, but yes, it works and it's recognisable when a noise comes from behind.
just incase people want to see a tutorial. i uploaded one on youtube for the problem with connecting the headphones. link: https://www.youtube.com/watch… as for the humming and so forth try checking the connection of the cable, and maybe swap it out with a different one. if that does not fix it, see if you have any devices that may operate within the bluetooth frequency. (this can often cause the speakers to produce interference) otherwise, contact 3d soundlabs and see if you can get it repaired without charge. it should not be a problem since you are one of the backers, and this being the first batch. there are bound to be bugs. i hope they get those fixed soon. :)
ok so update number 3: leaving the headphones plugged in and charging while using the rescue option worked. a big thank you to alexander jian for coming up with the fix. now that the headphones are working i have experienced another problem. when the app is not in use i frequently hear humming amongst other strange nosies through the headphone. also, moving the jack connected to the headphones results in crackling. i'm still interested in getting this fixed as well.
people, my head phone is broken when i took off. can't  believe it! i am not sure will they replace or repair it for warranty or even don't know is the product has warranty. very dissapointed. see the photos. http://imgur.com/wf185lh http://imgur.com/swtdpyx
@ shigeru - sorry, i misunderstood you ;-) no, the one player does not play dts, even it appears like it would. it just shows no error message and plays some of the channels - but it does not play correctly all channels.
@alexander - you hit the spot!!! i was able to convert successfully a movie from dts into acc which the one player accepted and really played in multichannel. still, this was a one time incident. i will do further testing to see which option make the most sense.
@ shigeru - sorry, you misunderstood the problem. the problem is that the headphone only plays multichannel sound with the one player app, but this app does not support ac3 or dts, which makes it almost unusable....
one player plays dts musics. for ex. one of which is free and downloaded from  http://www.diatonis.com/downloads/diatonis_dts_wav_secret-universe.zip the file format is wav. loss less m4a cannot be played. do i misunderstand the problem?
@sascha wyss try http://www.wondershare.com/convert-video-audio/convert-dts-to-ac3.html
@alexander jian this worked! thank you very much. i think if you have time, a tutorial on your youtube channel will help a lot of people!
what's the status of the app?
coded workaround progress report (mac user): i tried the ac3 killer - did not work, crashed always after 5 sec. then i tried the "aunsoft mkv converter" - also  here no luck - no matter what conversion of audio i use, either it compresses all the channels into stereo, or if it is multichannel the app can't read it. so if anyone has a successful way of converting dts and ac3 files into a format, which is multichannel and can be read flawlessly by the ios app, i would be thankful for a feedback.
@ken lum and @brian kimmel plug it back into the charger and this time when it turns solid green. do not press the power button and switch to your phone and turn on the app and click headphone. do not hit scan, instead hit rescue and then wait for it to finish and it will be able to be back into working order. also do not update it if it pops up asking you if you want to update it. anyways hope you can get it to work. i am thinking about posting a tutorial on my youtube channel about it. if you guys would like me to i can make one.
@ken lum i've had the same problem and haven't gotten a response yet. i hope to soon.
i received mine yesterday. i have a problem. i charged them overnight and the light is green. however, when i try to power on by pressing the power button, the green light turns off and nothing happens. no blue light for pairing. please advise how to reset the headphones or return for exchange if this is faulty.
got mine 2days ago. looks like sound is pretty good but there is one thing i really hate. body shape should be ergonamical;u-shape,not half circle. too much pressure on my head even i use it for a minute. thinking give to somebody for present. =( dissapointed.
just got mine. seems like everyone have the cable connection issue. needs to be jammed into the plug of the headphone for the right side to receive audio. unable to fully enjoy and feedback at the moment until the 3d sound app is released either on windows or on android. eta please.  though i had left it to be charged for over 6 hours while i slept and the led indicator has been showing solid red after i woke up in the morning, which the manual says still charging.  audio quality wise it's decent than i had expected but i am mostly being pampered by my shure n ue on a daily basis. will continue use it normally for a while listening to audio in flac format. very nice work on the light weight and feel of the headphones. i like it much in these 2 aspect.
@alexander jian oh. well mine seem to be working as i expected once i made a solid cable connection :) including bluetooth
for my headphones, when the led remains green, the instant i push the power button it turns off and the light doesn't go back on. i wish i knew of a way to reset the headphones.
@tomasz suchecki i was referring to the people who cannot seem to get the headphones to connect. this being that the led is constantly solid green.
i felt a distinct click when i connected my audio cable. before i got that feeling the headphones were mono and weak
i got mine. haven't tried to update yet. will wait on that until we hear back from the team. for those that don't have theirs yet. i am liking the build quality. the only question i have is :is there a way to turn off the bluetooth radio. not all of my audio needs the 3d :)
oh and do not update it, it just seems to crash it after you rescue it.
here is the reason. in order to get it to work properly, the headset needs to be updated. to do so, you need to go into the app and then select headset. then instead of choosing scan, click rescue. this will update it and hopefully it works.
@spitfire_ch so jamming the cable into the headphone port did work. i didn't think i would have to push so hard for it to connect. now i am getting sound from both sides. @james s. galco, hugues meyrath i am still having the exact same problem. i have charged the headphones many times. when i first received them they had a little charge and connected to my phone. since fully charging them the headphones no longer power on. when connected to a power source the light is solid green. after pushing the power button one time the light disappears and it does not turn on.
was there any quality testing with these?  i received mine and piece had fallen off in shipment so i put it back in place.  next the device does not power on.  i plug it in and the light shows solid green.  which per the instructions means its fully charged.  i unplug and press the power button and nothing happens.  can support please assist ?
received my headphones yesterday. i charged it and see a green light when connecting it to a charger. but the unit won't turn on at all with the power button. i plugged it in to see if i was getting any sound and just have a little in one speaker. totally unusable. please advise on how to get support. thanks
how to see a move on imac or macbook pro use lightning cable and connect iphone and imac. use audio cable to connect imac and neoh.(you may connect the iphone and neoh. ) it is my opinion  that neoh-imac connection gives you better sound, because imac's headphone driver more powerful than that of iphone. start quicktime player and file->new  movie recording on a new recording window click the right side of the red record button and chose your iphone as audio and visual sources, and begin the recording. oh do not forget move the volume  slider to listen audio.
how to see a movie on the big tv. use hdmi and connect your iphone  and tv. use long audio cable and connect tv and neoh.
got mine. thanks!
@ brian kimmel: i had the very same problem. it seems to be a contact problem of the plug. just plug the cable in real hard, and both speakers start to work. problem is, once you let go, you're back to mono. what helped for me is plugging it in real hard and turn it a couple of times. i am not sure if this "cleaned" the contacts, but since i did this, both speakers are working.
thank you chanh le. i did not think it would be sent through a separate email address. sorry 3d sound labs. i will wait till the product is received. then i shall run some tests and then give opinions at that time.
"also, when we’ll have the pc drivers ready, you’ll be able to use your favorite “codec-licensed” video player on your computer with our 3d sound one." ok, that's good news! this means 3d sound one will work through a special audio driver, and not through a special software on pc. so, basically anything that has 3d-audio output - be it a a movie player, game, music or whatever, has a good chance to work with 3d sound one?
just got mine in about an hour ago, 4 of them nicely packaged. i cant use the 3d feature yet due to having windows and android, but the audio on these are great. i also had the "left ear only" audio issue until i looked at the headset and noticed the jack wasnt seated fully in, after i seated it properly, it played audio perfectly.
hi any there can test lpcm you can convert to it whit clownbd from dts and ac3 https://www.avforums.com/threads/clownbd-and-lpcm.1220384/
hi, in case you’re referring to ac3 and dts codecs that we don’t support, let us explain why: this is not a technical issue; it is a licensing issue. dolby and dts have very strict licensing terms. therefore, like many other video player app providers on the app store, we have decided to disable those codecs to avoid any legal prosecution. we understand it is frustrating, especially as this was not anticipated at the time of the campaign. we’re still under discussion with those codecs providers to find a compromise. in the mean time, there are some workarounds that can be used to transcode your movies such as ac3 killer (https://github.com/ac3killer/ac3-killer) or ac3-dts killer also, when we’ll have the pc drivers ready, you’ll be able to use your favorite “codec-licensed” video player on your computer with our 3d sound one. thanks for your understanding,
and by the - let me quote from the 3d sound labs website: "you enjoy a true 5.1 or 7.1 sound experience that places you at the center of the action. immerse yourself in your movie the easiest way: you don’t need any specific format or recording, just drag&drop your audio/video files into the 3d audio player application and … enjoy !" "play your movies and music without having to change formats. our app is compatible with most multimedia formats available today." at no place on the website it is mentioned that ac3 and dts do not work..... now, not being able to use dta or ac3 files, means i really need a very specific format that it works - and no, there is no room of interpretation. so the text on the webpage is incorrect or at least strongly misleading..... as is your amazon.com product description.... as was the kickstarter campain!
dear 3d sound labs you are joking, right? could you enlighten us, how we should enjoy 3d sound, if all the codecs that are used to play 3d sound, are not supported? this is like selling a car and afterwards stating that it does not support fuel..... if you do not plan to integrate the codecs rather soon, i would like to return my headphones, as they are this way completely useless.
hello @antony martin if you've got some problems, you can send us an email to kickstarter@3dsoundlabs.com with those informations : - device - os we will fix it. thank you very much !
@alexander jian your package has been shipped on august 7th.

thank you chanh le. i did not think it would be sent through a separate email address. sorry 3d sound labs. i will wait till the product is received. then i shall run some tests and then give opinions at that time.
got my headphones today. it turned on 2 times and connected twice. i fully charged it. ever since i charged it the headphones will not turn on. the audio only plays through the left speaker and never the right. i tried adjusting the balance on my iphone and macbook pro and nothing works. right now its an expensive paperweight.
check your inbox for "engsupportahe@tnt.com" my tracking number was within that email.
@ceator  your recent update indicated that you had shipped 500 units on aug 4th. i am the backer #220. how come i haven't received the tracking info after more than one week?
i still havent recieved a tracking number yet... are they sent out via email? maybe i missed the email? oh well i will comtinue to wait two of them. thanks
this is extremely disappointing. i have been waiting for quite some time now. i responded to the survey quite soon with all the correct information, yet i still have no clue as to where my package is. i placed an order for 2 of them. people are receiving them in texas (where i reside) and i have not received mine. please let me know what i can do about this, or what the status on my order is. i truly am starting to lose faith, and i hope all the issues are being resolved. i hope i was right choosing this as the very first and probably only kickstarter campaign that i will support.
wai-shan lam have you remember to chard it ?
received mine. but i can't even turn it on anymore. it turned on a few times, but now when i press the button, nothing happens. led remains off....
app crashes every time i press play on a video i have added. can't add any of my itunes films.

i completely agree. ac3 and dts are the only popular 3d formats (well, to some extend also aac). so what's the point of 3d headphones that doesn't support them? i can't test it myself as i have to wait for the windows or android release. but i am highly shocked to read the comments here :( hopefully, there will be some feedback on this issues by the devs, soon!
i can't believe there is not a single word yet about supporting ac3 or dts. i know the license cost is huge (about $80k last time i checked) but if you're making a product to do 5.1 audio this should have had been taken care of since day 1. otherwise this is just pointless.
given the 1.1 version of the app was released yesterday, i decided to do a complete retest with all the media (based on an ipad air): regular mp3: sounds great – sometimes the head tracking  made problems, and needed a reset. flac: still crashes the app – tried different files from different artist, some multichannel , some stereo - none was working. ac3 – still not supported (error message displayed) dts: it’s a mixed bag – it plays some tracks, sometimes even with some 3d effects, but not correctly, by some movies the voices are missing, others have some disturbing noises and others again seem to be missing some of the 3d tracks. bottom line – the 1.1 one version did not bring any improvement! (at least not codec wise) given the neoh team ignored until now my testing completely and did not reply at all, it would be very kind to have a statement about these codec issues. do you acknowledge them and until when do you estimate they will be resolved? thanks sascha
what audio codecs do it run if i need to encoded some :-)
@andré henneboh  thank you for your feedback. have you tried with a multi source sound, like 5.1 ? don't hesitate to send us your device and your os to kickstarter@3dsoundlabs.com
@chanh le your package has been expedited on august 7th. it should arrived soon.
@raphaël garagnon and @christopher goodgame  don't hesitate to send us feedback to kickstarter@3dsoundlabs.com. tell us which device with witch os you're using. we are going to fix it. thank you for the folder idea. we really think about it ! neoh is the project name, we could not use it after kickstarter. also, 3d sound one is much more understandable as you had well said.
@antony martin thank you ! you have to connect the cable, it's not wireless. bluetooth is only for the motion sensors ;-)
got mine today. lovely look and feel. cable works fine.  bluetooth connects but won't play on the headphones.
@claire benz your package has been expedited on august 7th. it should arrived soon.
mine landed at jfk at midnight. shoukd be here within 2 days would be my guess
i still havent recieved a tracking number yet... are they sent out via email? maybe i missed the email? oh well i will comtinue to wait.
it gets even better - after my frustration with the movies i though, ok, lets listen to some multichannel audio and downloaded some flac files. and what happens? as soon as i start them, the app crashes.... seriously, is there anyone out there who was able to do anything useful with these headphones until now (except of using them as regular headphones)?
so, my neoh arrived today and the question is answered - dts is also not played correctly - the speech channel is not audible at all..... so i will put neoh back in the box where it will collect dust until the app does support dts and ac3 - very disappointed.....
even my neoh is still on it's way, i played a bit with the app today and uploaded different movies. strange is, that dts movies are played, even it states that dts is not supported. but ac3 movies can not be decoded and no sound is played. also i don't know if the dts sound would be all channels - i only know that when i receive the headphone. fact is, most movies are today encoded in either ac3 or dts - so if the app does not support that, the headphone is almost worthless, no matter how good the hardware is. i assume it is a cost issue that they did not include the codecs, so my question: could you provide it as an in-app purchase?
@christopher : i am sure you're right on this point ! the creators will probably have other explanations and i would be interested to know. @all : [edit on my previous comment] i have been using the neoh / 3dsoundone for the past two days and i am quite happy with the results. i have noticed that the 3d effects on the headphone are a lot better after calibration which can be found on the settings while playing music or movies ! in the next update of the app, i would suggest to the creators/developers to implement at least two categories : one for the audio and the other one for the video files instead of this list which is not very legible when many files have been imported. or even better, the possibilities to make folders within the app !
@raphaël garagnon, i fully agree with you, i think neoh was a better name and rolls off the tongue a lot easier. the only thing i can guess about why they changed the name was that they felt it was better to have their first headphones with a name that basically said they were 3d headphones without someone having to read about them - just read the name of the headphones and bam, they would know they're 3d headphones. that's all i can guess, though it may be a poor guess. still, i prefer neoh. eh, oh well. also, i've also received my tracking number and its passed through customs so hopefully in the next week or two it will get to me in texas.
instead of 3dsoundone, i have the old name "neoh" written... anybody else as well ?
got mine ! the packaging is nice and the quality looks good so far ! i need to look at it more closely but the 3d effect is not as good as expected from my very first (and short) try.. all the sound is going left when i'm turning my head left, same for right but doesn't feel 3d that much. maybe the movie was not good (interstellar) for that. i'll try it more tomorrow.
just checked my number again, and its on the move! woo hoo, eta, aug 14th :)
just got my tracking # here in ohio! :)
from what i got for my tracking number it says it was just created. so if anything they're going to ship it soon if not already in the system
got my tracking info as well, but says the number is invalid. :s
same here, scott. also in texas. hopefully they arrive here on the same day.
also me denmark ;-)
just got my tracking information. -texas
still a-waiting in michigan. ups guy keeps going to the other houses next door... can't wait for my turn :p
no tracking yet. here in cincinnati ohio.
@andre, where are you located? just trying to figure out how far the headphones have gone. nothing in socal yet.
hi, i have received my headphones yet, but nothing goes right with the headphone and the app. no url no own video works? so far, i have not heard any surround sound to date. i am very sad, but i am looking forward.
still waiting :d
hello, i received mine. thank you very much! now i try to understand how to use it correctly.  france
havent recieved mine yet. -florida
hi guys, we're preparing an update but we can already tell you that we have sent 508 headphones today. have a nice day, the team
haven't gotten mine yet or any info on it -texas
haven't gotten mine yet. michigan, usa. can't wait to see these 4 beauties at my door! :d
if i had to guess,  we would probably get ours (united states) in about a week or so
haven't received any email/tracking info or the item itself. in the united states, ny
anyone from the united states received their headphones or tracking information??
vinzius, from what i can see, you do need bluetooth and the cable, the cable enables the headphones, and bluetooth is the 3d virtualization part. havent recoeved mone as of yet, will be looking a lot more now that people have recieved  theirs
it's only working if i connect the sound cable. not sure it should work like this with a bluetooth device... plus i don't really feel the "3d" sound experience. not sure if not working, or just me who can't differentiate :-/ and the ios app is very buggy...
received mine today (france). paired with my iphone. when i try demo sounds, it's not working (sound comes from the iphone and not the headphones, despite being correctly paired / enabled). didn't try with a cable or with "real" music yet.
well im glad to eat my own words lol
jean-pascal perrein  nice so there are on the way.  and good the sound also are good whit out 3d
hi, i receive mine. great packaging, very sober (need some light explication on cable, guess one is for iphone other for the rest ?).  try it on iphone, very nice feeling with demo sound. but a little disappointed because media need to be imported via itune and since i borrow the iphone, cannot try it more.  would be better if it could read already present media on iphone. i try it on android [need to use the right cable] to check without application, the sound is very good (without any 3d stuff).  i am very impatient to test the android and windows application !!! (any date of delivery ?) very good product, bravo !
i hope its not true, but i'm pretty sure the headphones haven't even shipped yet. cause anytime something really positive goes on, that when they say something, but when things aren't looking too good, they just keep quite. i'm really looking forward to these headphones, but if theyre going to continue making new product, they would really need to consider  better customer service
some information about the shipping of the headphones would be great as it is now past the "target shipping date."
i've been checking my mail box. front door, email, kickstarter, and 3dsoundlabs website, for package information every day since mid july... some info would be great... :|
are the headphones shipped yet? will we receive a tracking number? some update on shipping would be real nice.
any change of getting a tracking number for when the headphones are shipped? honestly, this campaign has really turned me off to the whole kickstarter idea because of the atrocious lack of responses or replies on this site, email, or any other social media site. i really dredge that an issue will come up with the app and not be addressed until months down the line. would it be asking so much for 3d sound labs to hire a customer service or community manager to answer these peoples questions? they believed in your product and your team, and get little to no responses.
i pledged neoh to go with cmoar (cmoar virtual reality headset with integrated electronics). hope all goes well.
end of july, still waiting some info about my pledge :-)
just downloaded the app. is there dropbox, google drive ftp etc integration? didn't find it....
the app "3d audio player" has been approved by apple and is now live on the apple store ! @3dsoundlabs : j'ai bien rempli le formulaire et je suis en france. vous pensez que je l'aurai la semaine qui arrive ?
how long would the shipping take?
thank you for your support ! @daan, yes we are shipping the firsts headphones from europe.
ar the units shipped from europe?
great news, looking forward to trying them out
checked the website, saw some changes on it. can't wait for mine to arrive! thanks for the updates lately!
hi guys ! the firsts headphones will be send this week ! however, we are still waiting for answers to the survey from some of you. have a nice day !
@daan staes the app will be available very soon. we have sent it to apple and we are waiting for the app validation by apple.
should be ready soon, i suppose !
so its the 20th. are the headphones good to go for a shipment?
are you still on target for a july 20th release from the factory?  are you shipping straight from the factory or is it leaving the factory to you and then you will pack and ship out to us?
hello, is the app already available in the app store?
hi everyone ! sorry for the delay. headphones are almost ready and we're going to post a picture of the production. if you did not received the survey, don't hesitate to send us a message.
to the people asking for responses, i can just tell you wait: be patient. i have personally tested these headphones in an event in paris a few months ago and they are awesome. this is no joke, so just sit, relax and wait.
once you pass ignoring my massages you would understand, i'm really not in a position to go with this product. i humbly request you to please cancel my pledge. i have been patiently waiting for a response for almost 4 months, please cancel it.
can't wait to receive these, will be awesome. got four of these, hope they work as good as they say! :)
really appreciate the update. glad to have an idea as to when ill be receiving my headphones. but im still curious as to how gaming is gonna be with these headphones. i feel like that was never clearly stated
thank you for the update
@chanh le, ditto..thanks, 3d sounds labs seems more business minded, they came to kick-starter asking for support and once that's done, well twitter, is more suitable to attract more customers.
@deepak yadav, you can do what i did before they finally gave us an update on may 10th. i blew up their twitter account asking for an update. every time they posted something on twitter, i would reply asking for an update. now a days, you have to resort to public shaming to get any kind of response.  @zhenxing gu, its not july yet, so i dont think they have sent out the survey. and from the way they've treated the backers, i would assume its going to be the last week of july when you actually see the headphones in your mail box. lesson to be learn for 3d sound labs, be a bit more respectful to your backers and future customers when it comes to support. also, hire someone that actually responds to emails. seems like the running joke here is no one gets any response.
@raphaël garagnon, i do understand that we made a pledge but the promise was from both sides. getting 0 response and no updates at all, makes one cranky sometimes, and i do apologize for being impatient. however my reasons to backout is not just that and i send the many massages to 3d sound labs hoping for some response but the result points to 1 very unhappy customer/pledger.
has anyone gotten a survey? i haven't got one yet tho they said shipping is in "the next weeks"
on their website it says "shipping estimated in 4 to 5 weeks." and thats for people who would just buy them now. so maybe we might be getting them a little bit earlier since we are backers
guys, you can't back out a project just like this! they needed the fund to make the 3d soundone (aka neoh) a reality, you'll get your headphone in just a few weeks ;)
please cancel my pledge too.
sent multiple massages, not a single response. please cancel my pledge.
how to back out of the project?
looks like another bad ks project... ;-(
at this point i don't think they check this page often anymore. i say light up their twitter page until we get some kind of acknowledgment.
at this point i don't think they check this page often anymore. i say light up their twitter page until we get some kind of acknowledgment.
guys, as you can see from the comments below.... an update regardless of positive or negative content is well past due. even if you have nothing to talk about i am sure that anything from you would regain some voter confidence. thanks in advance.....
an update would be great, you are actually supposed to tell people about issues and other buisness things on kickstarter. step it up guys. give an update on the process, not the popularity of the product.
so i went to their pre-order page from their facebook page and they pre-orders will be shipped by july... i'm hoping that's not the case for us kickstarter backers. please update on the headphones asap.
yeah even if theres not gonna be a june shipment i would still like to know whats going on... and if we're getting game console compatability
are we still on track for a june shipment ? it's seems very unlikely to happen given the huge silence for more than a month now
time for an update?
so i backed boss monster 2 and it also ships in june. they've asked me for a shipping address, so far nothing for the neoh cans. little respect for your backers and get us a production update please.
i agree brad.  they updated us to tell us about the ppl brought onto their team but absolutely nothing about the development process or where this project stands.
an update would be fantastic.
@brent roberts +1   it is almost end of april, and we are supposed to get our rewards in june. a update is much needed.
can we get an update sometime since it's coming to the end of april?? would be nice to know how things are going.
i am hoping that 2 backers want another neoh set each or could help me get in touch a friend(s) who might be interested in 2 neoh headsets. unfortunately, i was recently hospitalized. my doctor has recommended a transplant, which means i would not be able to go out in public to work. i would very much appreciate any help in finding people to take over my pledge and could reimburse via paypal or check. thank you.
@abdulhadi could you send us a message please ?
why do you want a refund?
i want to cancel and get refund how ?
@claire benz we are working on it ;-)
3 solid weeks without any updates?
nevermind it was just that my internet connection did not look up the dns properly, so i used my lte connection and it worked.
why is the website down for me?
hey! i was wondering if you were also planning on making an api for developers? i have an roland electronic drum kit and it would just be perfect to have it output sound in 3d like an acoustic one
i can't wait to use these, awesome.
congrats on being successfully funded!  please keep your backers updated with regular communication and updates :)
@brian they are building an inline "compatabilty" box so it will work with everything.
@brian if i understand correctly, it won't support netflix through ios(i.e. iphone, ipad due to apple limitations for developers). if netflix supports 5.1, 7.1, or higher via computer, tv, android etc., it should work!
i just read somebody's comments...so this will not work on netflix?.... i'm starting to worry that it wont be compatible with alot of my uses then...and going back to when you said that the headphones will be like a really good pair of headphones...any comparison?...like beats by drdre?  i don't have any apple products but supported this kickstarter in hopes that it will be able to be supported by my samsung smart tv, computer, and android phone.... which is why i am willing to wait for the compatiblity issue to be resolved...hopefully at a very minimal cost to use early bird supporters.....but in the mean time use it as a very good top of the line head phones for example the popular beats head phones or bose headphones....
abdulhadi it finished why not think befor pledged bot think it to late by pledging, you are committing to supporting that person’s project; canceling that commitment is discouraged. if you must cancel, visit the project page and click the blue “manage" button that appears next to your pledge amount. at the bottom of the next page you’ll see the “cancel pledge” button. happy we made it
i want to cancel how
@bismire: msrp = 299 usd
@bissmire: we're working on such a box ...
argh spelling... p.s. what's the m.r.r.p. going to be?
any more news on the feasability of a serepate box that would be able to run the software so neoh might be usable with a tv (watching films) or gaming consol?  if such a box is created it could also act as an amplifier.  maybe even mean that the haedphones could move from hybrid to full wireless... the headphones have a lot of potential!
@john: yes. we'll do mac as well.
i hope pc support includes mac osx support....it is a pc after all... tell me it's true. please?
@saulo: unfortunately, on ipad we don't have access to other applications' stream.
hi guys, one simple question: i am using an ipad and watching netflix on it. would neoh convert the netflix videos?! best
42 hours to go!!! let's go neoh!!
@jian: we're still working on the app so the list of formats could change. but at least, we're planning on supporting: mpeg (es,ps,ts,pva,mp3), avi, asf / wmv / wma, mp4 / mov / 3gp, ogg / ogm / annodex, matroska (mkv), real, wav (including dts), raw audio: dts, aac,, ac3/a52, raw dv, flac, flv (flash), mxf, nut, standard midi / smf...
@noel: difficult to say: it's up to oculus to decide to include our libraries into their product...
@creator do you have the complete list of neoh player supported audio and video formats with details (such as supported levels and profiles)?
will the headset be compatible with the oculus rift consumer version?  thanks.
@brian: the dongle is a usb to bluetooth key for a laptop or desktop computer that does not have bluetooth capability.
what is a bt 4.x dongle? and suppose my laptop or tv doesn't have bluetooth.... and by extension i was meaning like to extend the aux wire from tv. so i can sit far away and watch.
@justin: noted for xbox. we're working on it but it's not so straightforward to design a device that would process 3d audio and feed to the headphones. we're also looking at carrying case options.
@3dsoundlabs i said this earlier, but using this headset with my xbox is definitely my biggest hope. i hope to hear something real about that possibility soon! i also wanted to support the idea of a carrying case or bag to come with the headset. i will be putting it my backpack when it's not in use, and that environment may be damaging without some kind of buffer! please take this option seriously. thank you!
@brian: yes, laptop will have to support bluetooth to connect to our motion sensors. also, any dongle that supports bt 4.x will work.
@mr.gomez: yes ... redbull pleaaaase ;-)
quick question.... does the device we use...ie tv or laptop...need to have bluetooth? what do you mean when you say the headphones use bluetooth for the 3d part. also how.will putting on an extension sure work?....any specific one we need? thanks! and congrats on teaching your strech goal!
so we all get a can of red bull now!?! :p
@eric: noted.
@alex: thanks!
please with the console support ;]
and we as a community all appreciate the help. :3
i'm happy to be the one that pushed the project over the number for the stretch goal
@jeonicde: yes. if you don't turn on the motion sensors, bluetooth will be completely disabled.
@aaron: noted!
@mr.gomez: neoh uses its own battery, and because motion sensor infos are transmitted in bluetooth low energy, it does not drain your device's battery.
hi, let's say i will use your awesome headphones during a flight trip, is there an option to disable that bluetooth? or is there an airplane mode available?
i was hoping for a case or something too. i travel alot and hope something will come up your mind. but i don't think it could be another stretchgoal.
another question sorry! what kind of battery impact might the neoh have on devices, if any? how long is the cable and what would be the best way to wrap the cable up when not in use? i only ask because i'd like to look after it as best as possible :)
ok, thanks for the reply! hopefully its something you guys can figure into the budget!
@mr.gomez: right now we have not planned any case or bag for the headphones. but we take your comment into consideration and we'll check whether we can include a bag in the package.
hello, not sure if this has been covered in the comments or the information you have already provided. i don't own anything that starts with an i, i have backed in the hopes of using it with my laptop so i'm quite happy to see the pc support stretch goal nearly reached. my question is whether the headphones come in a case or bag to protect them when not in use. i live in aus and with our dollar as it is these phones will be costing me nearly 300 aus dollars. so it would be good to know if i require further investment! :)
@judy: we don't have an exact schedule for android yet but we will inform our backers as soon as we'll have a release date.
hi there, android is mentioned a couple of times. however i do not recall seeing a timeline for when these will be android compatible (in terms of enjoying 3d sound). do you have an idea when android will enjoy the full benefits of neoh? thanks
@zachary: yes! both the internal firmware and the companion software will be upgradeable, so that we're ready for new formats and new platforms.
will these be "future proof"? i don't remember reading if the internal headphone software is updateable. thanks again!
@jian: the software is not optimised for those platforms yet. therefore we can't answer this question. thanks for your understanding.
@creator "...neoh is compatible with iphone 4s or newer, or ipad2 or newer. however, we're recommending iphone 5 or ipad air minimum is you want to process 11.1 or 22.2 sources..." how about android and windows devices?
@zachary: neoh has been designed to give you great sound quality, in particular for movies and gaming. also, because we know the entire audio chain (from signal processing to headphones drivers) we're able to digitally tune the sound to your particular taste....
i just backed for 4 of these, i would like to know how the bass and overall ingame sound quality will be, as i personally will be using this for playing first person shooter games. i have a good feeling about these, but don't want to be turned off them for bad or sub-par sound quality.
@jian: neoh is compatible with iphone 4s or newer, or ipad2 or newer. however, we're recommending iphone 5 or ipad air minimum is you want to process 11.1 or 22.2 sources.
@creator  "we're processing sound sources up to 4th order ambisonic sources (up to 30 sources)"  what is the minimum hardware requirements (e.g. which versions of ipad or iphone) for neoh app to process the 3d audio (e.g. 9.1, 11.1 or 22.2 in channel-based format) contents?
@sergio: based on many requests we received, we've studying the development of an accessory that will plug on the console to process audio in 3d. we don't have a schedule or cost estimation yet, but will keep our backers updated.
@alvaro: having full bluetooth headphones requires we solve significant technical challenges, especially about audio latency induced by the wireless transmission. we're working on that but it won't be ready anytime soon.
@doug: thanks for backing us! as you mention, we're making sure that audio and video are synchronised!
so i know read the comments about being able to ise neoh with gaming consoles. but for some reason im still confused. are we going to be able to ise the headphones with consoles? and if so, will this ability come with the headphones are dl we have to pay separate, $200 was already alot for me and i really would like to play xbox with these
will you ever be able to use the app with bluetooth?
proud to be a backer. after reading a lot of the technical posts here, i am even more interested in the future of this technology, especially as vr takes off, and the natural differences between the speed of light and the speed of sound will become necessary considerations in software for the ultimate immersive experience. this is just the beginning, but hopefully this project can help bring the mobile cinemaphile inline with where audiophiles have been for years... good stuff.
@jian: our algorithms are plugged either after audio decode in the case of "usual" digital contents, or takes directly hoa inputs for "real" 3d content.
@brent: understood. thanks for sharing.
@creator when you say "we're processing sound sources up to 4th order ambisonic sources (up to 30 sources)", do you imply that your app decodes the audio encoded with ambisonic? if so, what is the relationship or compatibility between ambisonic and  various dolby and dts formats that are used to encode the surround sound audio in dvd movies and other existing digital videos?
@creator i think that incorporating the functionality for xbox one and ps4 shouldn't be too large a hurdle to overcome. while there would be some initial hurdles, there is also plenty of time to get something developed but just be careful of wires lol. gamers normally dislike having tons of feet of cord between them and the console. if it was possible to integrate something with the controller then it would be ideal.
@tapejara: yes, our algorithms will take into account your position relative to the screen.
congratulations for having achieved its initial goal! :) i was thinking ... if i'm watching a movie on your phone, as the neoh will know where the central source of audio coming from? i'm not exactly in front of the cell, or if i'm moving my device? your software will take into account the position of the smartphone? that is, it will also use the phone's sensors?
meus parabéns por terem alcançado sua meta inicial! :) eu estava pensando... se eu estiver assistindo um filme no celular, como o neoh vai saber de onde a fonte central de audio está vindo? se eu não estiver exatamente na frente do celular, ou se eu estiver movimentando meu aparelho? o seu software vai levar em conta a posição do smartfone? ou seja, ele tambem vai usar os sensores do celular?
@brent: based on all the comments about gaming consoles that we got, we're studying the feasibility of developing a small box that would interface with xbox one, ps4 and others, where we would run our 3d audio algorithms.
will these be able to be used for console gaming and if so, what consoles?
that's what i like to hear!!!! great approach to this!!! now you got me f'ing salivating for a pair lol
@ jian: we're processing sound sources up to 4th order ambisonic sources (up to 30 sources)
@brent: we don't use multiple drivers to create some sort of 3d effect. we're re-creating the 3d sound using dsp algorithms together with motion sensing to create a binaural signal. we're actually modifying the sound just like it would be modified if it travels from the virtual source to your ears.
@creator what is the max number of sound sources the neoh app can actually handle? 5.1? 7.1? or 11.1?
as a headphone addict i'm very excited to see what your company is creating here! could you possibly provide more detailed information on the drivers, performance figures and more "geek speak"?  to designate a direction from such a near field, most companies are using multiple drivers that fire on a delay and with a difference in voltage to trick our minds into hearing things behind us and more, and i was wondering if that's the case here?? great job with this project!!!!
sorry, i meant site. this was just something that i thought might be included as some have payed in excess of 3 to 4 hundred dollars to back the project. i believe that anyone who has exceeded the 5 dollar mark should have their name on the site. that is my perspective. it isn't absolutely necessary. after all, it is your website. thank you for the consideration.
@alexander: it was not planned initially, but you guys are so amazing that we'll include you on our site. of course, we'll check with everyone that you're ok with this (with a survey we'll send after the campaign is completed).
do people who pledge for early bird specials also receive their name on the wall of fame?
+1 android support +1 tv/ console support +1 win support
@aaron: noted !
+1 android support +1 tv/ console support +1 win support
@allen: noted !
+1 for os x support +1 for android support
@alvaro: well noted your request for os x. it was not planned initially but as some of you requested it, we'll add it to our development roadmap.
@marco: unfortunately, the accessory to make neoh compatible with box one won't be ready for when we ship the headphones. indeed, it is not only a simple connector: we need to embed a cpu in that accessory to run our software, and develop this software for this specific platform. this is not an easy task, but as many of you suggested that it would be a great use case, we'll work on that!
any support for os x?
just to be clear (btw congrats for making the 80 000$ goal). for example me i'm a early bird and i want use the headphone with my xbox one. is the development of an accessory that you plan to do will be available when you gonna ship me the headphone or you gonna contact me later ?
@vincent: only the price of the reward differs between "early birds" and "rocket". as we had a great campaign start (thanks to all of you, backers!) and the early bird deals were gone, we decided to open a new reward, called "rocket launch", at a discount from the original price we had setup for the unlimited "original kickstarter" reward.
@brian: the headphones will work on any device just like any other pair of headphones. to render 3d sound, we need a quite heavy piece of software: we have developed it for ios so far and are working hard at making it available for pc and other devices (like android) as well.
so having only compatibility at the moment for ios devices would mean that we could not use these headphones for android phones and watching movies on tv?.... is the headphones a plug and play?...or we will need to buy additional parts or software etc?
@3dsoundlabs what is the difference between early birds and rocket launch?
@justin vignola : yes there would be an additional cost because its not only a simple connector as we need so kind of processing power to run our software. of course we would contact our early stage backers to offer you a good deal. @trond lossius : thank you ! well noted ! we will keep you updated on this !
congrats, and +1 for osx support and an sdk for osx. i'm really looking forward to trying them out. thanks!
@3dsoundlabs an attachment for tv and console support would be great. would that be at an additional cost? even for early adopters and supporters?
i do vote for osx support!
@brian: it is working with ios now. we are also developing a pc driver so that neoh will be compatible with any application on your windows pc. the date of availability of this will depends on whether we can reach our 1st stretch goal. we could accelerate this to make it available as soon as when we ship the headphones to our first backers! we don't have many requests for android, so this is likely to be developed with a lower priority. many of you have been asking about tv, blue-ray and gaming consoles: our engineering team has been boosted by the great campaign start, and they are planning the development of an accessory for neoh (that would plug on a tv or xbox for instance) to enjoy 3d sound on such device.  of course, this development is not easy and cost money, so the more pledges we get on our kickstarter, the fastest we can get this to the market ;-)
this will work with my hd tv's right? android device? laptop? will there be any compatibility issues?
@niclas fogwall : you will receive from us an invoice when we will ship. the invoice will show the vat amount you have paid and we guess you should be able to get rembourse from local sweden tax authority.
congratulations on your extraordinary product. i have always been waiting for this. i notice you will ship from europe, i will buy the headphones for my business here in sweden. would it be possible to have the vat amount deducted from the order if i can show a valid vat number? how is the procedure for that?
@tapejara: yes, we can render stereo into 3d space, placing the 2 speakers around you. we'll also be able to render anything that has been recorded with 3d playback in mind, but such content is not mainstream ... yet ... we're ready ;-)
hello 3d sounds labs, i look forward to see your product working! the application will also be able to convert a stereo audio source to a simulated 3d sound? it would be awesome, for example, be able to hear something that was recorded with a binaural system, or even a musical performance (2.0) having the sense of where the sound is coming every instrument played.
@karmeck: you need the motion sensors to track your movements and rotate the sound scene to take your movements into account. imagine you're in a virtual reality scene; you hear someone talking to you from your left. you turn left to face the person: if we don't take your movement into account, you'll keep hearing the person talking to you from your left, even thought you turned to him already...
i still don't get it. why do i need your technology to keep the sound coming from the right direction. it's headphones they follow my head then i move it. sorry but the video was not very informative on this point.
@tobias: yes, we're building the app so that you can stream from your personal server.
that way i understand it on the ios you use your app to play the files for it to work. do the files need to be on the ipad/iphone or can i play from a smb shere over the network if no, can you make it so i can download from my smb shere to the app so i dont nede to power up my computer ? and happy to se we are on 76k
@brian: the battery we're using is rated as follow: after 500 full charge cycles you have still more than 70% capacity.
what is the average life span of the battery charging wise as in how many times can we charge it before we see a drop in the usage percent? also is there any chance with the rechargeable battery being replaced?
@zack: we're sorry it was not clear enough.
i think the $209 rocket launch tier should be different than the early birds.  because i was an early bird, but i switched to the rocket launch because i thought it was something different.  i wish you all had made it clear that it was the same.
@marc-antoine: yes! obviously we're already thinking about what we'll offer as stretch goals ... but first things first, let's reach our goal: we're almost there !!! go backers !!!
any stretch goals coming ?
@erik: yes, we don't see any reason why it would not interface to your subpac. this is actually a great suggestion for everyone interested in an "ultimate" immersive experience.
@nikolai : we use a wired audio link to provide a great sound quality, and the motion sensing information are sent to the ios device using a bluetooth low energy wireless link. we don't plan to do a wireless neoh now. but we completely understand your request.
@nikolai: at the time being, we use a wired audio link to provide a great sound quality, and the motion sensing information are sent to the ios device using a bluetooth low energy wireless link. but we're considering developing a fully wireless version in the future. it will take some time as there are many technical challenges to overcome, mainly related to wireless latency which impacts the user experience.
can this be used along with my subpac?
hi neoh team. sorry if some one has requested or asked this question. can the headphones connect wireless through bluetooth  if not could you look into making it wireless or the option to have both wired and wireless. i'm also asking for wireless because apart from that i hate wires, if i use my vr headset, when the phone goes inside the vr i then won't be able to connect the wire.
@arthur: good suggestion. we'll definitely look into that!
you guys don't need to wait for microsoft / sony to be onboard of anything. why don't just use hdmi/optical output and "grab" the surround sound source from there?  both xbox & playstation (and just about any surround capable device such as blu ray, tv box, media player, pc, even minihdmi for android) use at least either one of those connection.  1 strike kill all devices, rather than wasting resource to build compatibility for each different devices separately. waiting and waiting for big corporate to agree to work with you guys for me seems a bit pointless. dont you think?
@alvin: yes, the original kickstarter is at 249$ or more. as the early bird reward at 199$ or more are almost all gone and as  we've had a terrific campaign start, we introduced a new reward "rocket launch" at 209$ or more, for a limited 200 neohs
hi what does the rocket launch and special reward mean at 209? does it mean its cheaper than original kickstarter price thats all?
@scott: at the moment, only ios. but if we keep this momentum, more will be developed (windows, os x, android?)
osx for the win!  at the moment, what are the items that will work with the neoh?
osx for the win!  at the moment, what are the items that will work with the neoh?
@paul: noted !
osx please!
@renrid: we'll do mac osx as well if there is enough demand for it.
thx for the clarification. when you say pc(windows) do you in- or exclude mac?
@tobias: thanks for the kind words!
@3d sound labs thx for the answer and good luck whit the kickstarter  sure we all together will reach the goal in no time :-)
@renrid: yes, this is correct. apple won't let us interface with itunes player. however, your music library will play in our neoh application. for amazon instant video, or other streaming application the same restriction applies: apple won't let us interface with the audio. but on other platforms like pc (windows) we will "grab" the audio data and virtualise them in 3d space with a driver.
@martin: > a2dp or aptx are bluetooth codecs. getting a fully wireless headset (audio streaming in one direction and motion sensing data in the other direction, both in real time with low latency) is quite challenging. but we want to tackle the challenge... even more as we see more and more people backing our neoh !!! > the mic is in the remote control, with the mfi cable ... just like the earbud cable that comes with the iphone. and yes, there is no active noise cancelling, but the natural type (over-ear) and shape of neoh creates a natural sound bubble to isolate you from the external environment and immerse you in your 3d sound experience.
just to ensure i'm not misunderstanding something, the 3d audio effect won't be present while listening to music from the ipad/iphone's itunes app through your app(if this is possible, is it?)? do you plan to support amazon instant video?
@3d sound labs: that's all sorts of awesome, cool. another thought that crossed my mind; i know that it's lower quality than a wired connection, but what about support for a2dp? or, for cd-quality, aptx? it would probably mean lower runtime, but it would mean no wires at all when used with a mobile device supporting the appropriate protocols, which is pretty much every modern android and windows device; i presume support is similar for apple devices as well. what/where is the built-in mic? given that the headphones replace a home theatre setup, you wouldn't need echo-cancelling, and are unlikely to need noise-cancelling (the biggest 'noise' being the game being played), but i'm intrigued, as the more effective microphones in the past have either been boom-mounted or multiple-microphone combinations.
@martin: > we could run audio over usb connection, or use the standard output of the sound card. this is not decided yet, but in any case, there will be only one cable (motion data are sent in bluetooth, not going out by the usb connector) > we have not planned for confort testing with various 3d goggles but that's a great suggestion. thanks. > yes, we will develop a pc driver, and getting sound source from another device to the pc, then process it in the pc is another great suggestion. you rock ! > we use hoa (high order ambisonic) in our software. specifically 4th order which means we can compute up to 30 channels (in real time, with motion data). so we're ready for the future of 3d sound !
would it be feasible to run audio over the usb connection, rather than having to have a second cable, for when being used with a pc/laptop? is there going to be compatibility testing with the various 3d goggles available? ie. to make sure you can wear both comfortably at the same time? i would think that the least painful method to support (insert random object here that produces 3d sound) is to have the desktop/laptop drivers be able to accept 3d audio, and process it to be fed to the headphones, so you would connect the audio out from your xbox, ps4, tivo, ... to your htpc (or your regular pc), then connect your headphones to that. or perhaps, a companion device that converts spdif via magic to a 3.5mm jack. how about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ambisonics sound sources? specifically, those with a height channel? i'm fairly certain that one of the dirt series of games internally computes sound using ambisonics, then mixes down to whatever speaker configuration the user has.
thanks! i'm pray for the success of this campaign.
@tohru: neoh uses a standard bluetooth low energy chip to transmit motion data. even though this is pretty standard, it needs to be certified in every country you use it. this is one of the reasons we are running this campaign. so if we're successful, we'll include japan in the list of countries.
is it legitimate to use neoh in japan? http://www.tele.soumu.go.jp/e/sys/equ/tech/index.htm http://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/joho_tsusin/eng/resources/legislation/mra/index.html
@eric: and you can replace it by a longer standard audio cable (3.5mm stereo jack connector)
@eric: 1.2m
assuming that the headphones are not cordless, how long will the cord be for device attachment?
@tobias : sorry, i have posted too fast ! indeed, it will not work with the power plug in.  you'll still have a regular stereo sound though... but no 3d
@tobias : neoh will work like any regular headphones when the battery is discharged. but you won’t have 3d sound, only regular stereo.
will it work whit the power plug in or do it need to be charges before
@adam : without 3d, the sound is good ! we have let test some professionals journalists and bloggers and they liked it. neoh has a natural noise canceling because of the confortable foams.  you can call somebody and listen music like regulars headphones.  for now, our headphones are working with our application on ipad and iphone. tomorrow, we will develop the project for gaming and virtual reality.
pardon my ignorance in this field, i am not very technically gifted when it comes to sound.  my question is that if these are being used as a standard headset (i.e. without 3d sound) what is the quality like then?  are they noise cancelling headphones? it just seems that using the 3d technology will be very limited so the main use will still be as a normal set of head phones... would i be correct in this?
@yves: when we will ship neoh, it will only render 3d sound on ios devices. we're working hard at increasing the neoh ecosystem by making our software compatible with other platforms such as android and windows for pcs. we're also looking into being compatible with, or embedded in consoles, but at the time being, we can't guarantee this.
i understand this correctly? i need a tablet or an iphone to the 3d sound to use. so i can only watch films from one of these devices. or do i use the headphones as a stereo headset via 3.5mm jack. not want your still build a digital broadcast station. then you could use the headphones anywhere. consoles support for such a brilliant 7.1 headphones is simply a must. it would be a shame who could not properly use it.
@justin: yes, of course they will work as ordinary headphones on any device with a 3.5mm stereo jack audio connector. and yes, it would be great to get microsoft and sony on board.
@3dsoundlabs well, they should at least work as ordinary headphones on game systems, correct? if you connect with a 3.5 mm jack. though, it would be great to see microsoft and sony support your effort for 3d sound!
@yves: neoh is not compatible with ps4 or xbox one. maybe in the future ... it all depends on sony & microsoft. we're ready to work with them on that!
is the neoh compatible with ps4 or xbox one?
@jb: yes, shipping is free for europe. but because we are shipping from europe, we need to add vat for those headphones. thanks for your understanding.
$31 is for vat.
description says free shipping to europe. however when i pledge i need to add $31 for shipping. whats up with that? thanks!
sorry for my bad english.. i've understand that neoh will initially work on iphone (connected in aux?) but how will work on pc? they will be able to decode dolby atmos or the upcoming dts : x ? and last but not the least, the will work playing a movie on a standalone blu ray player? thanks a lot and good luck
