i just received my copies of the book and they're great!  i work at a library and want to add them to our collection.  however, we're not allowed to add books that haven't been "published" yet, and since the pub. date for the book is october 11, 2016, i can't do anything with them yet.  so i guess my question is: is the official pub. date still oct. 11th as listed on the microcosm site? thanks, joe
super excited! my wife loved these books growing up and now i'm reading them to my daughter. her only complaint will be that she can't actually meet ramona.
