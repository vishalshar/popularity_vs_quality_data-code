got my cd in the mail today!  congrats!
congratulation! awesome, can't wait to get the new recording!
really jazzed to hear the recording!  loved the show at bam.  ugh. sorry for inappropriate use of the word jazzed...
dja - brilliant project, i couldn't be happier to contribute what little i can... waiting a year will be agonizing, but will make the album's arrival just that much sweeter. thanks to you and the whole crew - alp
