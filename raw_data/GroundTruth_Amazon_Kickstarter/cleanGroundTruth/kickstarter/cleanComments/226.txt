i did receive my replacement. it worked well during several days in the field. i appreciate the quick response. i am looking forward to the under and top quilt campaign!
@joe i shipped your free replacement tarp and the tracking info shows that it has been delivered. i just wanted to verify that you have received it. thanks! -jason

@joe sorry to hear about the problem with your tarp. this is an unusual problem and we will take care of it right away. as you know from our updates, there is a 2 year warranty on all of our gear and we will always go the extra to ensure that every backer and customer is 100% satisfied. i will send you a replacement tarp immediately and ship it for free.  i will send you a direct message with your tracking # today.  thanks for your support!  -jason
although i was initially impressed with the quality after a few uses the stitching is already coming apart. i am in the army and have been using the tarp in the field were others have commented on the tarp. i am supposed to be out this weekend and during my pretraining inspection, i find that one of the ridgeline loops is almost completely unraveled. i will attempt to restitch it myself. i was very excited about the upcoming quilt campaign, but i am not so sure now.
just wanted to say- you guys are awesome!
@steve glad to hear that you are getting into hammock camping and that you are pleased with our gear! i am going to make some instructions for the door kit very soon and will post an update when they are ready.  i will send you a message with some basic instructions. jason
this was my first ks backing and i am very pleased to announce that i have received my tarp and door kit today. i was very keen to have this tarp since i have never tried tarp or hammock camping before. now with the apex, i will definitely give it a try, plus i don't need to drag around 10 pounds of weight from my tent. thank you guys for delivering on your promise and getting the product out in time and with such quality. i would not hesitate to recommend my friends to get one of these once they see me string it up. ps. could you please make a video or perhaps send some instruction on the additional door kit attachment? it would really be helpful. cheers
@ sawadee thanks for your feedback and support! i'm really happy that you are pleased with everything:) @ jibbs  thanks for your feedback about the quality of the apex! @ marc thanks for the kind words! glad you got to test in in the wild already!!! @ chs girl   glad that you are testing your gear this weekend! yes, the seams are factory sealed. enjoy!
received my 2 tarps yesterday. attached the rl. looks great and will be testing them this weekend. 60% chance of rain. one quick question. are they seam sealed?
got my tarp just in time for a multinight canoe trip. it worked great and all my buddies were jelous of its quality. thanks apex.
i recently received my tarp. spent some time playing with it this weekend.  worked great! looking forward to using it on many outings this fall.
thanks, got my package today and impressed with the quality of the tarps.  haven't had time to check out the hammock, but i'm sure it will exceed my expectations, just like the tarps.  good luck in the future!
just received my last tarp. this makes three hammocks and three tarps. i love them all. very very well made. i hope to use them forever. at 67 forever has some limitation but i am sure these will be in great shape to hand down if i ever stop camping.  (i doubt i will stop willingly.)   thanks for a great set of products and thanks for the extra double pull bags.. good luck with your business. i will you all the luck you deserve and am sure you will continue to succeed with this and other ventures with quality and value like these products.
@jeremy thanks for the kind words!
got all my loot yesterday, everything looks great! really good job handling a wildly successful ks! especially impressed that you shipped the supplemental orders with the tarps.
@ ken thanks for your comment. glad you like it!
got mine today and popped it up real quick ... need to dress the lines for next time but very nice sun shade
@ joshua thanks for the feedback! really happy that you are already putting the apex to good use! -jason
just wanted to swing by and let you guys know that i finally got a chance to use my tarp. verdict: 2-thumbs up! worked really, really well. i was camped right at the edge of a mountain pass in alaska with some serious winds ripping over my tent and tarp. the thing was rock solid. i woke up a few times just to check, worried the high winds would be a problem, but it was good to go. very pleased with how smooth this whole campaign went. now i feel confident enough to pull the trigger on the camping hammock system.
@john i appears that you did not fill out the survey yet. i will send you a message now. jason
hey jason, just wanted to get an eta on my order. i couldn't message you through the kickstarter app. thanks  john
@shawn i will send you a message. i am planning to post an update in a day or two. -jason
can you give me order a look over? curious on shipping eta. cheers. - shawn
@ tchayman glad to hear it! enjoy:) @ stephen glad you received it. thank you! @sam i checked on your reward. your survey shows that you selected changed your color  selection to coyote brown. production of these is nearly complete!  i will be posting an update very soon with more information. -jason
i haven't received mine yet. i have the slated grey color. will there be a tracking number for the packages?
got mine friday in the uk. thanks again guys.
most excellent. mine arrived today in new zealand. looks great. hoping to use it on a up coming 3 day tramp (hike in usa words) as a porch in front of the tent. just have to sneak it into my wife's pack. thank you for a quick backer reward.  cheers craig.
@ mikkel the coyote brown tarps are in production now! i will post an update on the progress soon. @ gregory i will be happy too!
@creator when mine ships, can you send a tracking code please :)
man the weather in denmark is so nice right now. can't wait for it come so i can go out camping :d
@ angelica glad you received it so quickly! enjoy! @ mark thanks for the feedback! i am glad it arrived in ireland so fast:) thank you for being a backer! @ justin yours has shipped! i will send you the tracking info in a message.
will we get a shipping notification when it ships?
got my hammock and tarp yesterday morning and i am so excited for the weather to come and use them! packaging and delivery to n ireland was superb! thank you so much for this great campaign!
got mine in this morning, can't wait to use them this summer on our camping trip!
@joshua  glad to hear the apex will be traveling all over alaska with you! please send me some photos of your tarp in the beautiful alaskan wilderness! -jason
@brooks thanks for your comment! glad that you are stoked! if possible, please send me some photos of the apex in action!
got mine =) this thing is going to be traveling all over alaska here in a couple months.
just got mine today!  so looking forward to backpacking season, and getting to leave my bulky tent behind with this thing.  stoked on stoked!
@soxcited i will send you a message to take care of it. thanks! jason
@ tracy glad to hear that you have an adventure planned with your apex! i would love to see some photos of the tarp on your hike! jason
@michael glad you received it! we are planning to offer this on amazon lat this year. i will post an update when we do. i really appreciate your offer to review it on amazon! reviews are very important on amazon and it would be a huge help! thanks, jason
i'm really looking to receiving mine. i'll be hiking the pictured rocks national shoreline trail. i ordered the doors, and upgraded lines as well. i think this will be a great set. i can't wait to set it all up.
came home to mine sitting on the front porch today. (shipping envelope came open, but it looks fine) are you planning on adding this to your amazon store? being a kickstarter supporter, i'd love the chance to give a review after i've used it a bit.
received the tarp today. i ordered the gray one received green. any reason why i didn't get what i have requested?
tarp came in today. can't wait to get out tomorrow and try it out! thanks jason!
@kent sounds awesome! i would love to see some photos of your tarp being used when you go motorcycle camping!
@kimberly glad to hear that you have an adventure planned with your tarps! i will send you a message to let you know when to expect them.
i am very excited to get this tarp!  i have 4 hammocks and 2 tarps (one does include a tarp).  this is a great value!  i ordered the doors to ship with my green tarp.  looking forward to using it motorcycle and car camping this year.
camping for the first time, this season, in two weeks. excited to receive our tarps!
got my tarps yesterday wow that was fast for a kickstarter.
@joe sorry that you received the incorrect color! ! i will send you a message so we can get you the correct color. jason
hello. just recieved my tarp. i cant wait ti put it to use. it looks great but i recieved green instead of coyote brown.
@ tim yes, coyote brown tarps are expected to be shipped in may.
in the color survey, it was mentioned that coyote brown may add additional lead time.  has that been determined to be the case?  the update that revealed cb did not say one way or the other.
@ eric  thanks for adding the ridgeline! yes, your ridgeline kit will ship with your tarp! jason
i just bought the loop alien ridge line. will that be shipped with the tarp?
@ ryan sorry to hear about the issue you are having. all charges are done through kickstarter. i will look into it and send you a message. don't worry though, we will get it resolved. thanks! jason
i've been charged 2 times for this product.  who can i contact about this?
@soxcited because the tarp  has a catenary cut (curved) the doors were designed to be about as long as the center of the tarp. since the hammocks are much higher at the ends of the tarp than at the center,  the additional coverage that the doors provide is dramatic!
curious, any reason why the door kit doesn't cover the full side length of the tarp?
@tom the surveys have not been sent yet. the will be sent by monday. thanks! -jason
just got update and survey have not been sent yet, thanks
i haven't got my survey yet, have they been sent?
@eric great! i will be posting an update tomorrow with the info. -jason
when will you be posting the details on the loopalien deal? i am definitely interested!
@adam thanks for the kind words! glad to hear that the apex will lighten the weight of your gear! @julio yes, you will be able to change your color selection when we send out the survey this week. jason
so stoked to use this product!! it will take my camping setup from about 9-11 pounds to about 5 total! keep up the good work!!
on the survey i mentioned i liked the coyote brown and that if it became available i would like that color. my pledge shows as forest green. will i be able to get the one i asked for in the survey? coyote brown?
@a k yes, i see your reward in the backer report. we will be sending out the survey when the campaign ends. thanks! -jason
i haven't received my survey. is my order intact?
@michael thanks for changing your pledge to include 2 tarps! i checked the backer report and it does show that you are a backer for the 2 pack.
i believe that i changed my pledge to get 2 tarps @$109. but my app still shows me with 1 super early bird. just want to make sure i get the 2 rather than only 1. thanks.
sure thing! thanks
��
@sam yes!  i will send you a message with instructions. thanks! -jason
i've selected the hammock shelter combo. before i selected that tier i was looking at the 2 shelter or 3 shelter tier. will there be a possibility to select an extra shelter as an add on?
thanks for the fast response
@darren the go! hammock and the go! camping hammock have  400lb. weight limit and both are 11' long. when in use the hammocks have a length of 112". jason
what's the weight limit on the hammock and can you tell me the length as well
@ benjamin i'm glad to hear that you are excited about this tarp!  thanks for your suggestion. i considered adding a loop as you mentioned but i decided not to because sewing a reinforced loop into the middle of the tarp would puncture the waterproof pu coating. although we could seal the seams, it creates an area that is likely to leak. you can easily add a loop with a "tarp pull" by tato gear without damaging the waterproof coating.  here is a link to it: http://www.tatogear.com/product/tarp-pull/ jason
i'm super excited about this tarp because this will be my very first hammock shelter.  i was wondering if you would consider putting 1-2 additional reenforced loops in the middle of the sides of the shelter itself to allow for guy line attachment iot create more headspace.
@ jibbs, thanks for your good idea! i did consider that but adding loops to the tarp ridgeline would affect the waterproofing of the sealed seam, especially in the long term. most people using a hammock will also be using a ridgeline, which also makes a great place to hang gear! -jason
have you thought about adding some gear loops to the ridge line on the tarp?  something that could be used to hang a small light or something like that?    just a thought...
@mark thanks for your support! yes, it will arrive as you mentioned. happy camping! jason
just backed the top tier! hope this will arrive like all other backed campaigns with the value on customs notification :p i dont want an import tax on this bad boy and seriously cannot wait to go camping again! :d
@brooks, all people who have already backed our project should realistically expect their tarps to ship before the end of march!
what is the timeline for delivery?  when should we be expecting to recieve them?
@frederic n. i understand how you feel. we are not profiting on the shipping. i appreciate every backer's support and i would never attempt increase profit by charging high rates for shipping. please take a minute to visit usps.com and calculate a price from our zip code, 33314 to yours. you will see the rates for yourself. if you do  know of a more economical way to ship please let me know.
if your tarps are up to 28oz with the stuff included why in **** is shipping so damn expensive to canada??????? 25$$ is quite high don't you think for such a light product.  with china causing issues to every dollar outhere the exchange rates are low so 25$ is more like 45$ cad
@emilio thanks for your question! stretch goals are a possibility. i will post an update if and when there will be any.
are there going to be any stretch goals for this project?
@emilio  thanks for your question! with proper care, the apex will last for many years. it is guaranteed against defects in materials and workmanship for one year! jason
been looking for a good versatile tarp for awhile now. this looks to be the one. do you have any kind of a warranty on this product? thanks.
@stéphane thanks for the nice comment:) jason
i want to thank jason for this product and to wish you luck with your campaign! this will be a nice addition to my hammock camping gear. best regards, stéphane.
@david thanks for your question and for backing our project! the pre-production samples i weighed were between 20-21 oz. with the included stuff sack. jason
i'm happy to be a backer on this project! i do see one discrepancy i am hoping to have cleared up. your page puts the tarp at 20oz, but derek reviewed it at 23.6. were changes made since derek's pre-production review that made post-production almost 20% lighter?
@dallas glad to hear that you are excited about this project! i can't say what the possible stretch goal might be yet but i can say that it's cool!
hey, i'm excited about this project! what were you thinking of possibilities as far as stretch goals?
@jp  a stretch goal is a possibility, especially if funding keeps progressing! jason
will there be any stretch goals with this one like there were with the hammock?
@stephen thanks! i am blown away that this project is already funded! your support and the support of all of our backers means so much to me:)
congratulations on hitting your goals already. can't wait to try this out with my go! hammock.
