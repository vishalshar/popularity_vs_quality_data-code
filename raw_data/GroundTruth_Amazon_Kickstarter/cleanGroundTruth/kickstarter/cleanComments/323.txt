hi really excited about getting my hands on the new iphone 7 plus, will you be making a case to fit this? i really hope so hopefully  steve
@stephen rowlatt - same thing is starting to happen to mine. the first thing that i noticed when i got the new wallet was "wow, this cheap plastic card holder is eventually going to fail". what is happening is the plastic hinge tabs start to weaken by opening and closing the wallet and become dislodged from the hinge assembly.
oops my plastic card holders have now broken away from the housing, admittedly i use it constantly, is there any way of getting replacement plastic card holders?
i'm 128 out of 383, can someone who has gotten theirs, please let me know what number you were as a backer?
hi i've just received my wallet, absolutely awesome, thank you for doing such a good job in developing this product, how many tags can be used with the app and if more than one where can we buy some  steve uk
hello everyone.  today i reveived my new wallet in ostend, belgium. very happy with it and many thanks for the great product ! keep up the nice job and kind regards from belgium.
received yesterday in uk. thanks :)
i'm still waiting to hear back from the personal messages i have sent as to when i'm going to receiving my case i have told you on many occasions that i have not been receiving your weekly updates and have only received two emails back from natalie on 4/12/15 saying you about to start shipping that week, please send me shipping information with true update. ps happy new year �
so i got my new wallet today and it is the wrong one :-(  i got an email confirmation that it would be changed from iphone 5 to iphone 6 and still you sent me the one for the iphone 5 - after the long wait this is really a big disappointment

*your updated contact information.
not only is this project a "go" we are shipping and have been shipping.  updates go directly to backer email addresses through our database.  you will need to check your spam settings and make sure we have our updated contact information at info@newwallet.com.  happy holidays!
i asked them to give kickerstarter backers an update and this is the reply i got from them on twitter: new wallet ‏@yournewwallet  9h hours ago we have been sending out weekly emails to our backers. we are in the shipping process
is this project moving forward? an update would be appreciated.
i want to change wallet for iphone 6 to wallet for iphone 6 plus. can you change my bracket? so long shipping that i change my phone already.
where are we on shipping or an simple update would be appreciated team....
no factory updates, no details of technical developments, no plausible photos... nothing.
karen, what going on?
hi team.. we didn't receive any updates on shipping.. also i didn't receive any individual email on shipping.. have we sent any updates last week or this week??
any updates on shipping or progress?
it looks like by the time will receive this wallet, all of us will have a new phone and this product will be useless. we were supposed to receive it in august. then we were told in september/october. what's next? 2016....i understand the technical issues, but we are getting close to december and still no ship date.
when are you shipping?
i sent an email 5 days ago askinh if i could change my wallet from an iphone 5 case to an iphone 6s case. can i have a reponse please?
can i have an update on my refund? please don't be one of those kick starters who become sketchy after receiving our money.
just a question out of curiosity, will there be a bit of wiggle room to fit the 6s into the new wallet? i've provided the comparison measurements below: weight and dimensions 6s height 138.3 mm (5.44 inches) 6 height 138.1 mm (5.44 inches) 6s width 67.1 mm (2.64 inches) 6 width 67.0 mm (2.64 inches) 6s depth 7.1 mm (0.28 inch) 6 depth 6.9 mm (0.27 inch)

hi, i did not receive an email from you on the 28th.  can you provide an update on this project or a refund of the money i paid? the last update promised delivery in august it's now approaching the end of september.
please put updates on this comment section of kickstarter as its easier to find them! and it must be easier for you to update in one place,i'm looking forward to some good news i.e shipping date and tracking information.
it is getting quiet, please update us!
team.. any updates on progress and shipping ?
an update was sent to all backers email directly august 28th.
finally thanks for the update.. an update on every 10 -15 days would be best, so that we will know where are we at.. we know team is working hard in the backend to get new wallet in our hands, but still updates will keep us going.. thanks again for this wonderful product..
the silence is deafening!!  this has almost been a month since your last update. where do things stand?
3 more days.. team any update..?
hi, i have already emailed kickstarter regarding my refund and they said it will be done through you because the money is with you now. if you need my credit card information for the refund, i would be happy to give it to you. i just want my money back. thanks. also, i have read other projects returning their backers money, so it is possible for you to do the transaction. one such project is prynt. if you need help, please consult them.
team.. any tentative date of shipping or update on progress??
hi do you have a date for when you will be shipping the case out?
when will we be receiving the newwallets?
thanks for the response karen.. sent an email to you yesterday..
all backers should have received an update last week directly to your email.  if you didn't receive it, email me directly at karen@newwallet.com and i will be sure you do!
hi newwallet team.. any updates on the progress ? getting excited as we are close to end of july.. :)
hi, can you tell me if apple pay will work with the new wallet case?
hi i haven't received a survey ?
hurray...
things are going well.  update coming tomorrow!
any news on how things are going?
hi, i've sent questions and have yet to hear from you. can you give an update please? i would like to get an iphone 6+ casing and to my understanding, the iphone 6+ casing will only be produced later on. so i need to know if i will be able to keep my fund while waiting for the iphone 6+ casing to exist or will an iphone 6 casing be delivered anyway despite my messages and requests. if that's the case, i would like to get a refund. would be nice to actually get an answer from your company. even an update once in a while will be greatly appreciated. it has been dead quiet unlike other projects.
@ ollie navarro: no
hello, is the key fob waterproof ?
do we need to always switch on phone bluetooth when we are using this case?
hi! about how many cards, including id, fit in the new wallet? thanks!
can't wait!
what a great product! this is going to save me about ten minutes every day (that's how long i spend looking for my keys when i need to leave the house...)
so stoked for this. my wife is going to be shocked when she sees it!
