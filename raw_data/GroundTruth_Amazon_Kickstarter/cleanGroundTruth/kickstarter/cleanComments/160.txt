i still haven't received my copy, i pm'd you recently but haven't heard back, please send me my copy, thank you.
i never received my book. i'm pretty sure i filled out the survey. is there a way to still get mine? thanks. dan
i was very late in checking back on this project and have only just submitted the backer survey. hope that there are still copies left.
can we expect a volume 2 next year because this is a fantastic piece?
i live in sydney, australia who hasn't received a copy yet and then i see a fellow australian commenting about receiving theirs and i'm like "!!! where's mine?". i'm also really sad because i paid $15usd for shipping too and that's not cheap at all, ha ha
i got my copy, and it's great, but it was pretty badly damaged- the envelope used to mail it wasn't nearly enough to protect it, and it's pretty banged up. i agree with the other backer who said they would have much rather just paid a few dollars more to get a properly packed item. it was really disappointing to finally get my book and find it damaged before i even had a chance to read it.
i still haven't gotten my copy. earlier i a request to resubmit my address, which i did. now i'm wondering if maybe they're still having problems shipping my book to me. is there any way i can contact the campaign runners and figure out what's going on?
received my copy today! i love it, thank you backers, creators, and artists for making this happen!
i just got my copy today and read it all in one sitting! what an amazing book you created. the diversity of voices and experiences made the book as much a learning experience as a genuinely pleasurable reading experience, and a powerful narrative when viewed as a whole. you've done something beautiful with this book, from the appearance of the book itself to the rich stories within. i will be sharing it with friends, family, and classmates in university. thank you so much for the opportunity to support this project!
my book was waiting for me this afternoon. it was in great condition and i already finished reading it, and i couldn't be more thrilled that i backed this.
i'm really enjoying the book, and can't wait to find out what my 13-year-old super-geek-girl niece thinks of it!  also, a huge thank you to june vigants - i love my character sketch and am having it framed for my computer room wall!
got mine today, the top of the spine is kind of chewed up, and it was bent in the middle, as others have said. the bend in the middle will probably go away after a while, but the part on the spine makes me sad :(
my book arrived but i still have not received any communication from the artist that is supposed to do my drawing. how does that happen? (also, my book was do geared on the bottom right because of shipping materials.)
recently got my copy! it looks lovely~ unfortunately it was mailed in an envelope so some of the edges are a bit nicked and dented, but nothing too serious!
just got my copy. wish i could say i'm as excited as everyone else. unfortunately because it was mailed in an envelope instead of a box, it was heavily dog-eared, and bent to fit into my mailbox (as opposed to being left at the doorstop like a box would have been) and suffered more damage as a result. it really deflated my excitement about adding this book to the rest of my collection, which is the entire reason i opted for the paperback instead of the pdf. all in all, i would have rather paid a few bucks more for a properly shipped item.
i just got my books today and i am so excited! i had no idea (probably because i scarcely read a couple paragraphs of the campaign before i knew i was backing it) there would be 36 freakin stories! thank you for making this and congratulations on the endeavor of putting it all together, handling the project and the logistics, and for getting more inclusive gaming stories onto the shelves! beyond that, you beat the estimated ship date on an ambitious project. i'm glad to have backed this project and hope you're able to continue producing the work you want to in the future.
just got my copy today! it looks wonderful! canada post damaged the packaging during shipping (they wrapped the parcel in a plastic sleeve with a printed apology on it), but the book arrived in good condition luckily! it just has a tiny dent at the bottom, which is negligible. i'm so glad to have backed this project! the stories and art are all wonderful, and i love seeing everyone's experiences with gaming. like various people's efforts in making amtgard a safer more inclusive game in maggie siegal-berele's story, i expect this anthology to be a valuable step in fixing the still-prevalent negativity in not only gamer culture, but in the world in general as well. thanks to everyone involved!
i received mine in australia today...it should be devoured before the end of the week...a quality product and a fantastic celebration of women in gaming.
just arrived! i'm already halfway through. thanks so much for not only producing such a wonderful book but also keeping on schedule! i'll definitely be buying another for friends when it becomes available.
my copy arrived today here in madrid, spain. i'm already half through it and i'm loving it. thanks hazel and everyone else involved!
just received my copy in london, uk! thank you, hazel and all the contributors!
yay! it has arrived! even if it did arrive a kilometre away, dutch postal service, can't live with them, can't live without them (mostly). thankfully, by sheer coincidence (and completely the wrong address), it arrived at a coworkers house. :d
received my copy this morning, surviving a trans-atlantic flight and the french post office !!. thanks a lot hazel !
my copy arrived today here in montreal. congrats on a successful, on time kickstarter. can't wait to read through it!
yay! i just received my copy here on the west coast of canada. the mail man jammed it into the box but it still looks pristine :) thanks!
congratulations on the delivery!  i'm looking forward to getting my copy... which i suspect i'll have to hide from my nieces, at least until i've read it!
yay! i just downloaded my pdf and it looks great! i pledged to receive a copy for my wife for xmas and i think she's going to love this. i'm really happy i could help out so many talented artists and writers. thank you for this book!
brilliant!  congratulations to all involved in the project - but most especially the artists themselves - their work is the inspiration behind all this.  fine, fine news with which to start the easter weekend.
i am beyond excited to see this project come to fruition!  this is a big step forward in the evolution of creator-owned comics and giving a voice to thosw who are not always heard!
really cool to see my home town on kickstarter, and for such a cool project.
can you make a .cbz available as well in addition to pdf copies? love me some comicrack.

jezebel recently posted the link to the kotaku article and (for what its worth) i posted it on my facebook page.
@bryan the description says it's 6" x 10".
the book 200 page but what the size of the book?
*apologies, i misread the shipping costs! please disregard my last message, haha.
thanks for your timely response! i'm still very interested in pledging the additional $25, also i didn't realise it came with a signed and personalized copy, thanks for pointing that out, i can see the extra value there. is there any way canada could receive cheaper shipping? i'm not sure how much kickstarter allows customized shipping charges, but it seems silly that shipping from the usa to canada would be equal to shipping in australia. thanks again.
lovelyaddict, the $10 extra for shipping is only for international backers.  for usa backers, shipping is included in the $25 pledge. yes, the print is small. you also get a signed and personalized copy of the book. it's a little something to show our appreciation for people who choose to pledge extra—like donating to npr and getting a tote bag.
totally love this, and i loooove the print of the cats playing magic. is there any way you could make the prints bigger? maybe a stretch goal? it seems pretty small for an additional $25 pledged... also, in your funds pie chart, there's a large portion of the funding goal reserved for shipping, but we still pay an additional $10 shipping? is that $10 shipping counted towards the pledge goal? so in truth it's $35 added to the displayed goal per $25 pledge?
steven: the prints are about 6"x10", the same size as the book. this allows us to ship them together cheaply. no plans for a hardcover currently.
oh forgot one!  any chance for a hard cover?
i'd bump up to $50 but i'd like more info on the cat print lol.  like, how bag is it? would it be shipped folded?
saw the title and hit the backer button. looks like a fantastic concept and love that it includes so many different styles.
this is so rad. i cannot wait to see this on my shelf!
i'm a big fan of jade f. lee, and am totally psyched for this collection of works. i look forward to all of the different styles and stories!
as a gamer since birth, i am excited to see a book like this being available.  i have gm'ed so many games, become a board game master, and am constantly corrupting other women and girls to become gamers.  the oldest woman i corrupted was a 70 year old who had been ranting that day against the evils of gaming...  turned out she was just jealous of us having fun and no one had ever invited her to join in before.
not gonna lie, i pledged for this just because i saw "jane mai" in the artist list. i love you, jane mai! i hope to find more amazing artists through this book! �
i'm really stoked to read caitlin's comic!
