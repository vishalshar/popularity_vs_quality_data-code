@simalblau.  make sure to open up each box.  for shipping purposes we packed two into one box.  so you may have got two in one retail box and only one in the other.
hi  i get the wrong package with a wrong name i buy 3 and get only 2 :(
i've got a huge problem..... my wife won't stop eating popcorn out of this!! someone please help she won't share!
just got mine. most evenly spread popcorn seasoning ever. well done - simple but excellent idea, well executed!
got my ball this week. my son and i love it. if you make an xl one i'd buy that too. feels very sturdy. i don't use a microwave but it's good to know that i do have that option for it.
received my two balls here in germany! thanks
i was supposed to be one of the first of 200. did that happen?
no balls yet.
my wife uses her ball every night thank you!
got mine today! great timing since i am going to go see a movie tonight! it looks amazing and i can't wait to try it out!
just got my 5! impressive. i'm glad i backed you mike. packaging is beautiful and the ball doesn't feel like it was made in china. very sturdy.
received mine today! they are so awesome and i can't wait to try them out! thank you! absolutely worth the wait! you did good! :)
the last update has cooking instructions.  it was supposed to be on a paper insert inside the box but was left out by mistake.
i am also wondering how to microwave the popcorn. i was hoping there would be instructions. how much popcorn for how long?
got my balls today!! can't wait to use them this weekend at the theater.
mine just arrived in los angeles... says you can microwave cook the popcorn in the ball as well...  any instructions re how much corn and how long?
when we get our popcorn ball and we end up loving it and want to get more will you be offering discount for kickstarter backers?
happy national popcorn day!!!!
i want popcorn!!! in my belly!!!
cool to see 1 project that is legit on kickstarter  happy to get mine�great job
sssssooooo excited
shipping informations please
how goes it?
mmmmmmm popcorn
bread chicken cutlets
i just had the wonderful idea to use this to season french fries... yup. can't wait.
after reading some comments i can see some people might be upset, which my be reasonable as a consumer. i am also a consumer and things don't always go the way we plan, especially, when ordering items, but mike has done everything he possibly can to get this to you by christmas, and hopefully he will. mike still works a fifty hour work week and takes care of his two children (our grandchildren) while his wife works a full time job, needless to say this is not easy for anyone, it's a big project and a lot of what happens is out of mikes hands.              thanks, to all who have been there for mike and his popcorn ball
@the tees the sample was mailed to the fulham group in boston instead of direct to me, manufacturers mistake. the sample arrived in boston last week and i got them on tuesday.  i will be making an update this weekend.  i have some actual  completion dates from the manufacturer to share and i will get a photo in the update with the sample and logo.
@creator you have been very transparent on what is going on, i'm curious what the current status is based on your last update you provided on october 20th. "  i still do not have an exact date as to when the first shipment will arrive.  after i put in the order for the red and kickstarter green the manufacturer needed to run a sample of the green color and print the new popcornball logo on the lid. then they wanted to ship the sample over to confirm the color and logo are exactly what i want before proceeding with the  expensive order. this has added a bit more of a unexpected delay. my goal as of today is to have all units here by thanksgiving and then shipped out to all of you as quickly as possible. i really never expected it to take this long." have you received the samples with the colour or the logo?
@ mike - i get it. manufacturing anything from scratch is a challenge. i would caution you about one small thing: the closer you get to the end of the year, the longer shipping from asia can take. also, i can't remember if this product is being made in china, or where - but if your production rolls into december/early january, be aware that many factories shut down for an extended period for the chinese new year. finally - one last gentle thought to consider: as we're now in the holiday shopping season, you may get some backers who were expecting to gift these as christmas gifts. so make sure you keep your backers updated frequently, even if it's to say, "here's where we're at and here's what i know." it's ok to tell people what you don't know - and to let them know you're staying on top of the process. just my (very long) two cents! ~patricia
as soon as possible.  i am hoping it's weeks before that but looking at way things are going i am not so sure. this first order is the hardest, working out all the logistics. i still can't work out all the shipping logistics till the order is made. it's just a new process that i have to learn for the first time. i hate waiting any longer i had many plans of getting this product into movie theaters this past summer. i apologize for the delays.
looks like it's now thanksgiving?
@aaron mudrow take a look at the last update... he said 45 days from the date he posted, so i'd say at the end of the month, maybe a bit longer... but hopefully not
time line please.......
od - the popcornball can stand high temperatures. it is microwave and dishwasher safe meaning it won't melt in those high temp appliances. the lid has silicone gasket which makes a water tight seal. however, the two halves snap together tightly without a silicone gasket and when i tested with just water inside it had minor leaking.  with a thicker substance like sauce and using it to coat the wings i don't see any problems.  keep in mind i filled it with water and you would only be using a small amount of sauce in comparison. when i use it for popcorn i like extra butter and i haven't had any issues with leaking. when i take it apart to clean i can see trace amounts in the seem where the two halves meet and inside the rim of the lid which is normal.
was wondering if these are heat/leak resistant enough to sauce things like chicken wings ?
nevermind. i don't want an update any more.
update please
any status update? excited and anxious to see the packaged product. :)
status on delivery?
....
any news?
completed survey! exciiited!!!
just got my survey.... excittted!!!!!!
hopefully there's an update about something before the 90 days.. don't know what.. but maybe about the production and that its still on track? thanks again creator for the updates
@creator thanks for the update, can't wait to hear more. its nice to see constant updates. appreciate you keeping us in the loop for all the ups and downs =)
yes.  just got some really good news in yesterday.  just trying to find sometime to get it down in an update.  basically my wife and i never see each other. she works mornings, i work nights. when we are home we are raising are two young children as a single parent. i will get an update out this weekend for sure! thanks for everyone's patience, it is much appreciated.
@creator any new updates?
any recent updates?
hey backers!  i will be putting together an update this weekend.  i am holding off on the surveys until we get closer to production. probably in may sometime. reasoning being because people move and addresses change.  i know you can change your address after you fill out the survey but trying to keep it simple.   we still have plenty of time.
mike, will you be sending out a survey to get our shipping information soon?
any update?
i can only say that continual updates is the only way to ensure the pitchforks and sticks of fire don't get brought out. keep up on the updates creator =)
@ rich - i couldn't have said it better myself! some people need to put this into perspective (are you listening rhodelt?) for each of us it isn't really a big deal , not in the whole scheme of things, but for the creator its huge and i'm so glad to be able to help someone realise their dream.  hang in there mike!
people need to quit whining. the pb ball is coming and if anything you all should be happy that you were able to help fund a persons dream into becoming a success. everyone's name here who helped find the project has they're name written on it. the fact that the creator has been able to take this project in a bigger direction with the little funding that was supported is amazing on it's own. i'll be waiting for my pb as long as it takes and i'm proud to be a part of it. cheers to mike baxter for the way he's executing this project. onward and upward!
update coming soon.  andrew, i will give the timeline breakdown in the update.
so just out of curiosity have you and the new company worked out a time line?
@creator i feel no bait and switch. i agree a made in usa would've been nice. but the reality is that for mass production you'll have to take your production outside if the usa. and i agree @rhodelt this isn't a cure for cancer or your carbarater. so let's not think that usa production would've changed all those lives either.
not "bait and switch"  at all. never my intentions.  i am sorry you feel that way.  originally on my first kickstarter attempt i had a minimum goal of $50k. which was based on usa manufacturing.  the second attempt at $25k was because another kickstarter creator was going to help with the manufacturing process.  all that changed with this licensing deal to the company in boston.  i am sorry it turned out this way. i will eventually bring back production to the us when i can afford to do so. manufacturering is just one small part of the whole process. and yes more money will be made in the us compared to the china manufacturer.  every where this is sold and everyone that distributes the product will make the most profit. it may not have a huge impact for the employees of a walmart but a small town movie theater could see quite a bit of extra revenue and use the popcornball for promotions and incentives.  this is my first attempt at bringing a product to market. i will make mistakes. i will have to make changes. however, i am very honest and my best intentions is to make a quality product that everyone can enjoy. that is why i am partnering up with a professional company and most of the decision making will be theirs to make. i am sorry that you feel this way but it was not what i intended. i have apologized. if you would like to me to send you a refund i can do that.  i hope you stay on to see the finished product.
well, this is a perfect example of bait and switch. the "made in usa" aspect was a huge selling point.  your explanation goes further into questionable claims, such as how you envisioned raising a couple hundred thousand dollars on kickstarter, yet you only asked for $25,000 to be fully funded.  as for how all those people you list are going to profit, let alone give raises to their employees because of a simple popcorn container, puleeez!!  this isn't a cure for cancer or a 100 mpg carburetor!  giving control over production to another company, and thus manufacturing location, isn't an excuse for not honoring your video commitment.
@creator was just going to come in and ask for an update. thanks for keeping us apprised. look forward to the update
update coming soon.  there has been some new developments in past couple days just waiting for one more piece of information before i share.  i will make updates at least once a month, during the first week of each month.
well this is the most "dead" project i have backed so far.. seems like the creator is busy with other things! cant be right that there havnt been anything to update the backers with for 1 month!
i have the stainless upgraded model of the whirly pop and me and the wife are at the popcorn every damn night and we're at it hard! can't wait for the popcorn ball to finally make that cheddar topping operation smooth at last.
i can't wait for my popcorn ball 2.0. got a popcorn popper for xmas and it's become my go to nightly snack, but adding toppings is always messy endeavor, so this will make my snack prep easier.
patricia,  you will receive your first 10 popcornballs at the same time as all other backers.  after all backers rewards have been shipped we will then start fulfilling orders for retail.  i am not sure if the partnering company will work with individual store owners. they may only work with there existing accounts and possible some new strategic ones. if that is the case i myself will be able to fulfill orders from my own inventory supply for the popcorn concession market.  either way you are going to get popcornballs in your new spice shop. as for the $400 credit i don't know if the partnering company will honor that if they decide to do business with you. in that case i will work out a refund with you when the time comes.  thanks for being the first retailer and your donation. congratulations on your new spice shop. i will come visit one day when i am visiting my hometown chicago.
hope the meeting goes well, mike! i'm just curious, how that will work for us in our reward? we sponsored at the wholesale level for retailers and movie theaters. (we wanted this for our soon-to-open retail spice shop.) so, does this mean that we'll be receiving product separately, from an outside producers - and possibly after other sponsors receive theirs? thanks for any insight you can offer, mike! ~patricia
yes. i am planning on licensing the retail half of the product to the company. i, myself will pursue movie theaters, sporting venues,  etc.  you the popcornball backers will receive the product first. i have already expressed this concern with the partnering company.
thanks mike for the update. so to understand the update you gave us you are possibly partnering with a company to license the popcorn ball or to manufacture it? maybe both? i have funded a project where the creator did the same and i still haven't received my product. i suppose from your update that you don't know when the product will ship. i can understand that, but please remember that we kickstarters helped fund the product and with respect we deserve to receive our popcorn balls before the world. i am excited to get mine, thanks for creating it!
7 days and still no update ... ?
@creator awesome can't wait for the update
update coming soon with some exciting news... stay tuned.
any update @creator?
how's the fulfillment going?  the funds should have been released by now.
congratulations!
thanks everyone!
congrats!
congratulations mike!  i had no doubt you would make.
stuck in an extra $10 — red & green for christmas — in may — or june!
thanks mike and congrats!!  i'm looking forward to your continued success. this is an awesome product for the popcorn lover.  i can't wait to get mine and write a review about it on my blog.  cheers to mike and the popcorn ball... happy holidays everyone and keep on poppin'
we would like to thank everyone who helped make the popcorn ball a reality for mike, this has been a long hard road for him, going through the launching of a product is not easy or cheap as the time mike has had to put in has been rough, he works over 50 hours a week in a steel factory and then come homes at 2:00 in the morning to work on this, and then gets up early with two kids so his wife melissa can go to work full time also, so needless to say this has been hard......  so we just want to let mike know we are proud of this accomplishment of getting this funded, and that we are and will continue to be two of his biggest supporters. congratulations mike!                                                 love, mom and dad
congratulations! i wonder, i fii were to bring my popcorn ball to a theater would they allow me to have ththem put it in at the snack place?
congrats on hitting your target! lets keep going
taaaa  daaaaaa congrats!!!! you did it!
thanks chuck for breaking the $25k mark!!!!  thank you to everybody who has helped make this possible!  you all are amazing and wonderful! keep spreading the word only 22 hours to go.
here you go mike. your goal is complete. now make it happen cuz
gonna make it easy!!
just 151 left, now. almost there.
$300.00 left. let's get this done.
if i had the $$ i'd get more, but already increased my pledge a couple of days ago.  so glad that this is going to make it!!!!
just adding another popcorn ball to my order. let's make this happen!
great product, looking forward to enjoying my popcorn ball and gifting a few to friends (yep, i increased my pledge, too!)
increased pledge to get 4! we're so close.
i increased my pledge. i'm with you until i get one!
i'll bee here till i get get one.
i think we are going to make it this time.  in my experience there is a certain segment of backers who wait until the last 24 hours on tight funding projects for any number of reasons.  and sometimes people just sort by ending soonest and come across an idea that for some reason they skipped over before. in any case, i'll be sending the link out to my social network again today and encourage you all to do the same.  mike really has a product i want to see come to market here.  $2k in 37 hours shouldn't be hard.
i have increased my pledge again too! if every backer adds $10 then it will be funded. let's do it!
let's make this happen ~~ i have increased my pledge again ~~ i'll also return if you have to re-launch, but with this many backers all we need is to pitch in a few dollars each to make the goal.  let's get this done, then we can all be in popcorn ball heaven.
i will return for the re launch if needed
i can't wait to see the popcorn ball in action! hope you can get funding finalized.
you can do it! i believe that so much i'll even be here for a 3rd try! :)
get it mike! you can do it!
i'll be back if you do need to relaunch. i like the idea. ;) i do hope you'll get funded though.
wow i can't believe we haven't hit the goal yet. i upped my pledge and sent a couple of friends over. if it doesn't fund, i'll be here for the re-launch!
i'd definitely re pledge, but we're so close i bet we'll make it!
just increased my pledge!  i'm definitely in if you need to do a relaunch. but with less than $2000 to go i hope we make it!!
you're going to make it mike - 100%. you have a great product!!
you have my backing now and in the case of any relaunch.
i want my popcorn ball! even if i have to wait for a relaunch...
mike, this is an amazing project and if you have to relaunch know you have a popcornball supporter here 4ever!. hope for all great things towards this goal and all your future ones. don't lose hope! 頑張って (ganbatte) -> do your best!
you have my support if you have to relaunch!!
mike,  i hope you meet goal!  this is such a cool product idea and i really want to see it made! if you need to relaunch, i will totally back you again.  thank you for keeping us updated throughout the campaign!  stay strong and don't lose hope!
upped my pledge! popcorn ball is an awesome product.
i don't want to relaunch. i will if i have too. i have worked so hard to get where i am now at.  coolest cooler relaunched and went from 100k to 13.2million.  i know we can get the $25k. i just need your support one more time, if there is a relaunch..
relaunch is the kiss of death on ks. backers lose confidence.
if you relaunch again, you'll lose me. i already doubled by order from the last run.
final days!   we are so close! please keeping sharing! in the event we do not reach the funding goal we will relaunch and hope to have you as a backer again. we can carry this momentum into the new launch and we will for surely make it on the next one! perfect popcorn will be possible. (it may take a couple days to get the relaunch approved by kickstarter staff. we hope to be up by december 24th or 25th.  please stay subscribed to the popcornball updates and i can send out an email after this campaign has ended. thank you.
share like crazy everyone, it's so close to the goal i can nearly taste the perfect popcorn
that is correct @creator.  it's that easy!
i added $10 more to my pledge...
somebody please correct me if i'm wrong.   to add money to your pledge.  i believe you log in to your kickstarter account,  go to your backer history, find the popcornball campaign,  click on "manage my pledge"  then lets say you choose the one popcornball for $15. you can keep it at that reward selection but at the top is your "total amount pledge" it should have $15 as the total. you can change that to $25 or more. you will get the same reward selection plus be donating an extra $10. for every $10 over your reward selection you will have sent an extra popcornball,  if you want it or you can tell me to keep the change.
that is a possibility too but i am not sure they would be able to purchase the green inventory as promised. the $25k is needed for all the red inventory nd tooling.
raised my pledge by 10$. i can't understand why so amazing product/project even with help from kickstarter which featured  it cannot get over 1000 backers and reach funding goal :( @creator maby ur parents could make an investment and in last minutes pledge remaining $$ to fund the project?
love the updates... get the idea if cross promotion.... but.... yours hasn't hit the goal yet. might want to concentrate on that first before promoting someone else. because i can tell you from past experience i delete those emails and never pay attention to them.
i had quite a few backers increase their pledge amount in the past day or so.  i thank you all so much.  it's going to be down to the wire.  keep sharing!
i added $30 to my pledge i'm at 8 popcorn balls now :) eee the anticipation is killing me. i shared it and tagged people so they can share also!!
just bumped up $20. i would've liked to get the silver membership, but i am giving these as gifts and i don't know the time frame of the new products. my wife works for a private movie theater here in california. can you email me some details of wholesaler costs. i think with the different sizes this could really take off.
just added 20 thinking of adding 20 more. let's make this happen.
i just added $20 to my pledge.  let's make this happen.
we will make it we have to i want some!!!
doesn't look like we are gonna make the funding goal :(
thanks mike!  that is awesome news! you might have answered me... i am a student in college and i am lucky if i see half the things sent to me that i should... and then comprehend them... finals should be over in a week or two. maybe my sanity will return!
hello cindy,  yes i remember question from earlier in the campaign and i remember writing the reply and sent it as a direct message.  i may have sent it to the wrong cindy.. sorry, my apologies.   to answer your questions yes and yes.  i have plans on making three or four sizes. the popcornball featured here on kickstarter would be the medium sized(1-2 persons).  i want to make a kid/toddler sized(small), a large, and extra-large version.  possibly even a collapsible silicon version.  every time we make a new mold whether it be size, shape, design, or acquire a new license you will get a single free copy being a silver member. lets say next year we come out with the baseball design you would get a free copy.  then maybe the following year we get the mlb license you would be able to choose your favorite team and get one copy. maybe we get the disney license and have 6 different disney movies to choose from you will be able to pick one and get a free copy.  thank you for the questions and sorry about the mishap in the reply. thank you for your pledge!
i don't think i have gotten a reply to my question...can you help me with the answers?  thanks!  **are you planning to make any future editions that would be larger that this? and, for the club members, does that mean that if you make the baseball and basketball ones (in the stretch goals), that one of each of those would be sent also, along with the plain ones?**
got an air popper and corn for my wife to go with the announcement card that i am going to put in her christmas stocking letting her know her popcorn ball will arrive later.  just upped my pledge $20 to help it reach the funding goal.  hope we make it.  silver club member pledge. ben
why isn't this funded yet..?!? 18 more days though..
slowly but surely we are getting back there!! � can't wait to get my order!! ��
so i had three for $33 than decided i might need more.. so now i'm at 5 for $50 :) best of luck
thanks james. glad to have you on board!
so glad to be a backer. saw it earlier and thought "maybe later." later has arrived. this is great for personal use and as cool, inexpensive presents for friends and family.
are you planning to make any future editions that would be larger that this?  and, for the club members, does that mean that if you make the baseball and basketball one (in the stretch goals), that one of each of those would be sent also, along with the plain ones?
woohoo, my future popcorn is so happy to get into a ball!!!
love the product idea, and still want one.  i lost interest because of all the emails and updates :)  however, i think because i keep getting updates, i'm jumping back in.  go popcorn ball!!!  -  braon
thanks for thinking of all us snow locked here in buffalo. today it felt almost warm at 29* . have a great day ! anna
founding is going very slowly :( i don't know why, becouse your project is even kick starter staff pick.... would be sad to lose chance of getting such a useful product .... one month to go so all hands aboard ^^
awesome.  thank you!
ok just added two more to my pledge
thanks leila for the comment.  m&ms and popcorn.  yum!  anyone else have a favorite popcorn mix??
i loveee mixing my popcorn when its hot with m&m's!! it's the best! the chocolate melts a little on the popcorn. yum yum! best of luck!!
enjoy the popcorn.  thanks for the comment.  i am excited too!
enjoy the popcorn.  thanks for the comment.  i am excited too!
just made a batch of popcorn and all i could do was think of the popcorn ball. so excited
yes. thank you for your pledge. there will be a serial number on the popcornball #001 - #200
if pledging for the $20 and $25 level , is the #001 - #100 / #101 - #200 somewhere on the ball?
forever
how long are you a member of the club for ?
@jessica - you can star a project before you back it but once a project is backed it shows up on your profile page, starred or not, and you have quick access to it there.
remember folks let's have a consorted effort on tuesday at 630 pacific time 930 eastern to hashtag twitter and facebook about #popcornball remember to include the link.
it is hard to determine exactly who has come back and who has not. some people wait longer than others. just remember, tuesday night at midnight i will be shutting down some of the early bird specials that i promised to leave open for one week so everyone had a chance to get the rewards. i think eventually most people will come back on board. i am glad you all joined me so early.  if we don't make funding somehow this time, then i will relaunch again. but i know we can do it this time! thanks everyone!
i was glad to come back to help again
i don't understand why the people that funded the first one aren't here for this... their loss i guess... have you contacted them directly mike? i heard pledgers can disable update notifications from a kickstarter project, so some people may have thought you just cancelled on them...
cannot wait until i get my popcorn ball. def will be going to the movies as soon as it gets here.
i love popcorn and i eat it just about every day.  if you like popping popcorn on the stove top then i suggest you try tiny but mighty.   i cannot wait to get my popcorn ball.  thanks again mike!
lightly-seasoned, air-popped popcorn is great low-cal snack, but mixing in the seasonings is difficult.  the popcorn ball will make it a snap!  so, we'll want to enjoy it much more often.  thanks mike!
so i have decided the first thing i'm going to do with my popcorn ball is make puppy chow... muddy buddys or whatever its actually called...
i can't wait to get my popcorn ball !!!
to add to what mike said, i am a huge fan of whole foods popcorn. i get the best popping rate and it has flavor even with nothing on it.
i'm so excited! can't wait to use it!  endless possibilities! colors, themes, characters perhaps? woohoo
i would check at whole food stores or online.  i don't have any that i can recommend.   i usually buy popcorn kernels from local boy scouts.
where do we get organic corn to make popcorn wholefoods?
my prototype works very well.  nothing noticable.  when we get a molded finished product the overlapping seams will snap together and be even better.
hey mike. i am happy to be a backer, i however had a question about dressings/oil or butter in the popcorn ball. has there been any noticeable spillage from the seams or lid? i am eager to try the popcorn ball out at my local theatre.
@jessica - are you on the website or mobile app? on the website, it's right under the main video. hope it helps! =)
yes. 6 seasoning packets to first 1000 backers.  we had 475 previous backers.   plenty for everyone.
so i was 130 and i backed a club lvl am i still getting free season packs
question, not about the campaign, but about kickstarter since they've been doing updates: does anyone know how to "star/remind me" a project once you've pledged? used to be you could. now it seems the star button is masked by the pledge button and i usually like to star the projects i like, whether i'm currently backing them or not because the snapshot on the starred projects page makes it easier to see how projects are doing as a whole, rather than having to dig through my backer history to find them individually. can't find a general questions to kickstarter location as everything has to have a reason for contacting them it seems, so i'm hoping of you might know. thanks oh and the popcorn ball is very cool! i can't wait to try mine ... i wonder though if we might possibly have more color stretch goals vs just sports design goals..?
1. asked it in the previous kickstarter campagne. is the #001 - #100 / #101 - #200 somewhere on the ball? 2. some goals are strange? no limit on it. like #001 - #100 can be taken unlimited.
i think i figured it out.  please change your reward to the new reward level at the same value you were trying to donate.
i'm from australia and it says $20
i cannot fix the us shipping on any of the reward levels that someone has pledge on. i will have to create a new identical reward with the us shipping corrected.  in previous campaign us was automatically set to free. now you have to add the us and mark it $0.
it's making me pledge an extra $20 for us shipping. please confirm this will be fixed.
mine said $12 for canada and $20 for the rest of the world including the us
i have no idea why it is saying anything for us shipping.  from my end i cannot apply a shipping charge for us.  the us shipping is including in the reward level.  in the previous campaign i could add a fee for all international shipping at one price.  kickstarter now allows you to pick and choose different countries.  except i can not choose united states even if i wanted to.  i choose canada(one shipping price) and "rest of world" (a different shipping price)  i will have to ask kickstarter why you are seeing a us shipping price when i don't even have the option to charge you one.  if you live in usa your shipping is free.  can anybody tell me what it says for canada and "rest of world" or international shipping
it said $20 us for me.
it's free us shipping..  is there a reward that says $18.  kickstarter changed there platform on shipping.  i may have made a mistake somewhere.
first backer! $18 to the us?
