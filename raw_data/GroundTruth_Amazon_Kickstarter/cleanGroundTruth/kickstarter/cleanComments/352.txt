received my bowl a couple days ago very nice... looks great on the library coffee table.
you may use it for any food product. the glass is not reactive to any food. thanks!
i got my 8" bowl yesterday. quick question: can i use this bowl as a fruit bowl, for bananas, oranges, apples, pears? will the tempered glass react with the fruit? thanks
i have a feeling you mean 18" in diameter. 18' would be huge. looks beautiful. good luck. david.
