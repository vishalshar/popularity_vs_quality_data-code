@worasit - strange - i show a shipping and delivery confirmation for you from november 2014. it went to an address in arizona. does that sound right to you? the shipping confirmation was sent to the same email address you have on file with kickstarter; it was package #1897775 if you want to look it up in your email! let me know if you have trouble finding it and i'd be happy to help out.
i never got the goods. what is wrong?
some discount codes floating around for our holiday buying?
eager to find out more about this new kickstarter...
think what we need is an ultimate flip with slots?? but also definitely an ultimate flip. something in between sizes. feels like the flip we have now is the mini/skinny?
thanks for the feedback! sounds like you're referring to a "skinny" size of both the flip and spoon (that's our go-to inbetweener) -- and i think you'll be very happy with what we have in store for 2016 ;) spoons v 2.0, with a stronger handle, are also in the making -- actually, we're tooling it right now! we will definitely keep you all in the loop with new product launches, kickstarter or otherwise :d
i think i own every gir product, and they brighten up my kitchen and make cooking more fun. i use the original spatula and 6" round lid, most often, by far. my suggestions: you need to make a flip, larger than the small, but smaller than the large. the large flips, for me, are too large. also, a new spoon size, in between the two current sizes, which is a little more rigid. thanks again for the great products!!!
@unknown_anonymous // we should have them up in a couple weeks, but in the meantime we have a little backerkit widget helping us out so that you can order right away. check out https://gir-lid-series.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders to get them now!
missed out on the backlit for the spoons (i was undecided then it was too late!).  just wondering if they will be available for purchase from the official website?  if you could provide an approximate date, that would be fantastic!  otherwise, before christmas would be even better! :)
i've been using my new gir products for several weeks now and if i wasn't in love before...i definitely am now! the mini spoon and the mini flip are my absolute favorites. they are the perfect size for most of my cooking and tasting. the perforated and slotted spoons were excellent during a recent canning session. i haven't used the rectangular lids very much but they have met my expectations so far on the few times i did. the round lids proved to be perfect when covering small containers of jam or fruit that was waiting to be processed. as usual, the customer service of gir was excellent. there was a slight issue with one of the spoons i received. samantha was quick to respond and get a replacement sent to me.
amazing! i can't wait to get in the kitchen and play. looking forward to back the next gir project.
@gir, thanks for shipping the rectangular lids ahead of eta. now i need to find more cooking time.
@div3r5ity // absolutely! they're oven, freezer, dishwasher, and microwave safe. @james // should have them up by early september - will send an update to let everyone know when they're live!
can you bake with these lids on?
@gir: (virtual hug) any idea when the individual lids will be for sale? i'd like to order all at once.
@james // sorry to be the source of heartbreak! well... not too sorry ;) more mini flips and spoons are available via backerkit for the next few weeks while we prep everything for website launch. individual rectangular lid sizes are coming - you asked, we listened! @grant // well they *are* the mini sizes ;) keep your eyes out for skinny versions next year... they might be the in-between that you're looking for.
i received my latest gir shipment yesterday, and i am not happy. i have been using my gir tools from the previous campaign for several months, and the flip quickly became my favorite. now, here comes the mini-spoon. heart. stolen. come on, gir! you can't keep doing this to me. as a bachelor, i cook a lot of meals for one, and i'm all too familiar cooking and eating with the same pan. until now, my cooking utensils were too large to eat with, and my eating utensils would scratch my cookware. problem solved! so, how do i get more of these damn things? also, still looking for a way to order multiples of a single size of rectangular lids.
first impression, oops mini spoon is too small. new flip could be bit bigger
excellent! can't wait to hear what you think :)
got my add ons today, can't wait to try them out!!
yep got it! woo
@patrick // looks like it got there today, yay! @alexandre // awesome :d
missed my delivery! ah!
received my add-ons today, and as usual, great job!! thanks
oh great! in that case, the wait is almost over ;) woohoo!
fantastic! i did get that email and i do have the perforated spoon as well. can't wait! i've been using your products daily and they're great thanks!
@patrick // we're about 25% through shipping add-ons. packages with perforated spoons will start shipping friday/monday, so look out for an email around then! we did send an email with an address and item confirmation in mid july, though, so if you didn't see that check your spam folder. the shipping confirmation email with tracking will go to that same email address in a couple days. @corey // awesome! happy cooking :)
deliveries are going out? should i have an email about this?
my rectangular lids just arrived along with the flip...  looks great as always
@maxine // we haven't opened it up for new additions yet, but we'll let you know when we do! in the meantime, i'll send you a message with your items and a link to log in to your backerkit account to review.
@madalena // sent you a message :) yes you can - we'll let everyone know when it's open season.
hi, want to check what is in my backerkit and add some items. please advise how to do so. many thanks, max
can i update my backerkit to add some more lids??
@james // just sent you an email invite and kickstarter message with a link to your backerkit profile -- maybe earlier email invites were filtered as spam? your lids are ready and waiting! you'll also be able to include any add-ons if you'd like (which is what the recent comment below addresses - we're trying to make it possible for backers to add a "second round" of products through backerkit so that they can ship alongside any pre-pledged add-ons).
wait! backer kit?  we didn't get no backer kit....  i fear it was spam filtered. help?
@rob // thanks so much for the feedback! means the world :) @grant // got mini flips just a couple days ago! check them out on instagram @gir. waiting for final samples of perforated spoon and mini spoon.
hey guys, i'm guessing it won't be long now till you have images of the new add-ons ?
great customer support.   many projects could take a page from your book.   thank you!
@jean-stefane // sorry for the slow reply! missed this somehow. we're working with backerkit to customize some elements of the platform so that we can use it exactly as you've described. the second delivery window (and accompanying bells and whistles like address updates, new items, color swaps, etc.) isn't usually how creators use their platform for a single campaign, but max and rosanna at backerkit have been helping us figure out the best way to pull things off so we don't have to go to a different system for address updates or extra add-ons. either way, we will absolutely give everyone the opportunity to do all of the above - backerkit would just make it easier for everyone, so that's what we're working toward. @grant // hope these mini-updates in the comments are somewhat satisfying :) there's a ton that we're trying to make happen all at once, but i know we owe ya one.
@rob // original schedule was september, but we're ahead of the game :) looking like june or july -- they're full production right now.
i completely forget when we were expected to receive our rectangular lids.  can someone remind me?
@creator - will you be using backerkit for the shipment of the rectangular lids, etc.? i'd probably add a few more items to my order now that i've used my first items that i absolutely love!
.... and the update is coming??
@james // understood. we'll do our best to explore other configurations, and keep you all in the loop!
well, what i really need is six of the 9 x 5 rectangular lids. i don't have much use for the larger sizes, or the round lids.
@james // you thinking something like three of the 9x9 lids all together in one package?
have you all given any more thought to selling sets of rectangular lids, all the same size?
really looking forward to the mini flip so now hopefully my wife will ditch the rubbish one that she insists on using cause the pro is to big
@jim // ah, i see the jan 15 exchange now. i did send a survey link that day - just resent it to your kickstarter email address. i'll also shoot you a note directly via kickstarter messages, and of course you can also follow the backerkit link below to get there as an alternative. sorry for any confusion!
@jim // sorry, not sure what you're referring to re jan 15th. still on track for super early delivery of all add-on rewards as mentioned in the most recent update. did notice, however, that you haven't had a chance to fill out your backerkit survey for your lid set. you can head on over to https://gir-lid-series.backerkit.com and log in with your kickstarter email address to let us know where to ship and which colors you'd like. shoot me a message if you have any trouble and i'll gladly help out with a direct link or any other needed info. @grant // all items finished! we're awaiting factory approval of our models before releasing images, which is taking a couple weeks longer than anticipated. nevertheless, we're way ahead of our original september delivery estimate for the add-ons, so there's nothing to worry about. thanks, everyone, for sitting tight while we pull the last pieces together!
now may 3, how's that stuff coming that you were talking about two months ago???  or january 15th?
must be soon now
okay so not quite as close as we thought to sending that update ;) it's comin, promise. just polishing up our models and prototypes for you all to see!
we're close! should have something for you guys to feast your eyes on this week :)
is there an april update on progress??
thanks for the quick response! all set and can't wait to get the shipment!
@josh // brian's on the team, pinch hitting today :)
@josh // just sent you a message :)
i have yet to receive my lids. can you please help with this.
@grant and jim // sit tight, good things coming! just waiting for rectangular lid samples to arrive from the factory so y'all can see real pictures :) @jeffrey // awesome, thanks so much!
i ordered a double set of lids. they have performed marviously.
any update on your comment from january 15th?
come on update update, already
@jean-stefane // awesome! yep, i do believe that we'll be able to give everyone an extra chance to add other items. sorting out the details with backerkit to make sure we can pull it off seamlessly; if not, we'll find another way that's as fun and easy as possible. so glad to hear that things are doing their job in the kitchen!
@creator - i just checked in to see what was new since receiving and enjoying my rewards! love my gir utensils and lids! glad to see you're ahead of schedule which makes the timing of the question good; given you're going to ship to some/many of us another batch of rewards, will you allow us to add more items to our rewards, like you did initially? there are a few items i'd add now that i've been using my gir items. thanks in advance!
great work guys!!
@ken // we're ahead of schedule! sept 2015 was our original target, but it looks like we'll get them to you way before that. can't say exactly when quite yet, but we'll share the final designs shortly :d @grant // project update forthcoming! the highlights: we worked like bees all january to get the designs locked down, and we should have models to share in a week or two. we are super duper ahead of schedule. rectangular lids are in sample tooling at the factory already, spoons and flip in final design volleys between us at factory engineers to confirm manufacturing specs. will share more details in a full update soon! (we're hoping to have lots of pics to include when we post it.)
any updates on the new products/add-ons
what's the timeframe on the additional items?? i could really use that large rectangular lid...i use my 9x13 casserole a lot...
@robert // not your imagination :) we'd love to swap photos on twitter or instagram @gir, or facebook.com/productofgir. you can also email feedback to hello @ productofgir.com! @vince // awesome! thanks! @peter // i'll send you a message in just a sec :)
could you check the status of mine also? no news about it since the shipment info.
just got mine today, they look great...many thanks!
it seems you had a site to post pictures on and give product feedback, but i seem to have misplaced the card i received with my rewards. was i just imagining this? thanks
@jim // i'll take a look and send you a message. traveling for a couple days but should get back to you over the weekend at latest :)
i would swear i filled out a survey, but i haven't seen anything yet.
@ian // working on a solution for that ;) (they actually do stack, but it's a tight fit due to the undercut... won't hurt them to squeeze together though) anyhow, our upcoming storage solution will hopefully be a lot more elegant. hope to have it ready for showtime by the end of summer! @geumtian // awesome! hope they're coming in handy already. @holden // not at the moment, so sorry! previous campaign discount was valid through the end of 2014, though we might have some backer-only specials later on this year. tomo has a limited number of skus available for the sale this week (though they're sadly charging for shipping, unlike our website/backerkit), but if you're looking to add a few pieces and they've got what you need at a deal, i'd go for it!
hi gir - is there a coupon code that the backers can use on your site for a discount?  the one from the previous backing doesn't work anymore or will you match touch of modern pricing? much appreciated.
received mine a few days ago. look great! cant wait to get them in use
i got mine a while ago.  they're good, but they could be great if the suckers were stackable.  there's an inset on the underneath where the handle is, if another handle could fit in that hole, it'd be freakin' awesome.  instead i have another messy pile of lids in a drawer. (the spatula is still awesome)
cheers, all! we've already got something brewing for 2015 ;) (aside from all the extra goodies from this campaign, haha)
sam, you guys are always amazing... please, keep the kickstarters coming, with your new amazing products... and you even more amazing kickstarter campaigns and customer service..
recieved my today ^^ melbourne!
received downunder
@gail // wow, that's wonderful! sounds like a beautiful bowl :) glad the seal is so tight -- probably goes without saying, but just be careful to have a hand under the bowl in case the silicone shifts and breaks the seal on accident. a broken crystal bowl just wouldn't do!
my seals arrived this morning - am very impressed.  i have a lead crystal salad bowl which weighs a tonne and i love because it retains the cold when it has been put in the fridge for a while- not only does the 20cm seal fit perfectly, but i can carry the salad bowl by the handle on the lid!  great product!  thank you.
looks like aussie packages are finally arriving. so sorry that transit took so long! what a journey. we'll have to start a week or so earlier next time if we want those aussie packages to make it for xmas, from the looks of it. we did our best, but looks like some elves were sleeping on the job ;) if anyone has a problem, shoot me a message or email hello a.t. productofgir.com and we'll get it sorted. @patrick // just sent you a message :) we've had studio white for so long now that we didn't realize so many new backers would be surprised by the color. sorry about that! we'll do a better job of giving everyone a heads-up about our exact pantones (which are available for everyone to see on our website, but should have made it into an update as well, from the sounds of it). glad to be getting so many messages from happy backers! hope everyone had a great holiday. here's to an awesome new year!
from sydney and mine arrived this morning.
in melbourne, and havent got mine yet as well :-)
anyone in australia receive theirs yet? i must of deleted my tracking email thinking it was for another item that i've already gotten. i know it'll come pretty soon but is it possible to get that email again?
when i first saw the size of the pro items, i thought "holy crap these are huge, when am i ever going to use them?" turns out, they're the ones ive been using the most! the huge spatula is so useful. like others, i'm a little disappointed with the color of the white items, its not quite as nice as i expected but nothing to get excited about. one thing, i got the spoon in green, i noticed at the bend at the bottom of the handle, on the back side, its not that green, i can see through to the plastic on the inside. it has silicone over it, it's just thin. was that intentional or a defect? thanks.
@melissa // wow, thankee! maybe we will ;) @grant // i know! champing at the bit here for some oz packages to arrive. a few of the larger ones were sent by dhl and made it, but it looks like our main shipment is still on the way. @yishan // not unusual, but nonetheless nerve-wracking! we're our eyes on all of these tracking numbers, too. we'll let you know if anything starts to look suspicious, but so far it's just slow holiday transit to blame from what we can gather. @pao-lan // wonderful! thanks for the feedback :) the polybags are recyclable, but sort of a necessary evil -- we have to protect each product from dust and damage at the warehouse, and almost all of our fulfillment and retail partners require that each product is individually bagged and labeled with a barcode (the one on the tag isn't machine-readable since it can flop around). wish there was a better solution! stickers won't stick directly to silicone for the barcoding bit, sadly, so even if we bulk-packaged and opened a few at a time for fulfillment, we'd still get caught out. anyhow, thanks again for the awesome feedback - food for thought! if we can find a better way, we're all over it.
i forgot to post here that i received my package a few weeks ago. i'm always so happy receive stuff from you. last year i made my mother a christmas gift with spatulas, this year i kept the lids (and extra spatulas) to myself. everything looks really pretty, sturdy and i do hope to use them often (especially my new kickstarter flip). only small constructive comment i'll make : i found that there were too many plastic bags in this story. i'm not sure if there is a real need to wrap every single item into plastic before shipping them (as i don't think this gives extra protection). as a someone who's trying to reduce her waste (and help save the planet, step by step), i'd be glad if you found another way to wrap stuff (may it be recycled paper or recycled cardboard). else i've got nothing else to see except that you guys rock.
**sigh** expecting my lids this couple of days, hoping to get them real soon! singapore's not that far from oz either.  tracking stopped after leaving us on the 9.  is this period of wait normal....? :(
strange that nz would be before oz, they are further down under haha
gir, you need to write a manual on how to run a successful campaign with excellent customer service :-)
just saw from tracking that packages are starting to arrive in nz as well. australia won't be far behind!
i think it would be cool to have the name, size and color printed on them in a small font.
received mine today in holland. i'm happy with the nice colors and quality.
got mine yesterday, they are so pretty i may just frame them.
gir was great at helping me with the grey/white problem. contact them privately and i promise they work to find a solution. my husband opened the set of black lids for 2nd night chanukah (this will be our meat set) and he is excited to find a good place in the kitchen and to stop wasting aluminum foil and plastic wrap. can't wait to see what he thinks of the teal (dairy) tomorrow night. i have one small mold change suggestion for the future - add the size of the lids. otherwise thrilled with the product and support.
@sachin // great to hear, thanks so much for letting us know. sleeping much better now that int'l packages are starting to arrive!
@sharisse // can you send us a message with the details of what was mis-shipped (or missing)? we'll get you sorted out right away, and can help out with the studio white issue as well.
hi, the quality is fantastic! i'm looking forward to using them. unfortunately i did not receive my full order and it was not made clear that the white would be gray. i do not care for the color at all. please let me know how to address. thanks
hey guys - my lids arrived in london today - they look great :-) thanks!
@alexandre // thanks for the help! (and - wow that arrived quickly!) @marie-andree // our "studio white"is indeed a very light shade of gray (pantone cool gray 1!) -- sorry if the pictures didn't do it justice. the gray tone helps the silicone stay colorfast for a much longer time, as opposed to many white silicones that discolor quickly. and of course, if you start to see lycopene from tomatoes/curries stay past their welcome, you can wash with a nonabrasive cleaner like baking soda and some lemon - always does the trick for us. @robert and patrick // woohoo! so great to hear. thank you :)
more surprised than not liking it! tought they (or i) made a mistake.
marie, yes, studio white is kind of gray-ish... but if you do not like it, talk to sam... she is always eager to help... one of the best customer support you'll find
i received all of gir priducts today and everything is most excellent. the quality, design and finish exceeds all expectations. thank you again for these great products. i still have items currently in development and look forward to those next year. i am anxious to be involved in your next project!
is it normal that the white lids and the white spatula are not white, but light grey?
wow cant believe i actually got mine already! awesomeeee
just received mine in spain.. sam, as usual... amazing!!!
thanks, all! thrilled that packages are arriving safely :d
definitely going to keep backing gir campaigns :-)
received my package. all of the lids and accessories are beautiful and functional and everything was delivered on time. you guys ran the perfect kickstarter campaign!  congratulations!
saw that after i posted here. thanks.
@marie-andree // i know we covered some of this in our earlier messages exchange, but it may be useful for other backers (in the us and abroad) who are still waiting for their rewards to arrive despite receiving a shipping confirmation a few days ago: we've tried to get your rewards into the postal system as fast as humanly possible after the campaign ended - and virtually everyone who has completed backerkit has received a shipping confirmation by now. many packages have arrived already! but as closely as we try to manage every step of the process from design to manufacturing to fulfillment, once the packages are in transit we lose the ability to control and communicate every detail. i wish we knew more than what the postal providers tell us via the tracking information, but we don't - we're good, but we're not that good. (maybe one day we'll launch a kickstarter to revolutionize international shipping too...) happily, marie-andree, in your particular case we were able to ship your rewards just two weeks after the campaign ended and the tracking data today shows that the package has cleared customs and is well on its way! @robert // faster than by horse, but not fast enough! @michelle // wonderful! thank you so much for the feedback :)
unfortunately, i received nothing yet.
i see they are traveling to sweden faster then across the u.s :-(  i think usps is moving mine by bicycle :-)
i love my lids. the 12" fit my one pan i have been missing a lid for when i cook. works sooo great. can't wait for all the other lids and tools to get sent out next year. thanks for finally making a product that works and that is actually worth the money.
@andy // second that on the rack! we have an in-cabinet one that we use, but i bet a custom-built version would be super cool. also, jack (director of diapers) like to smack them on the refrigerator door for storage, little rascal.
@flying buttonz // sent :) also sent you a message with a direct link. @claudia and joakim // right on! holder is a great idea - will try to think of something cool :) transparent has been tough to meet our quality standards for stain resistance, but we're making some samples to test it out!
my wife and i got our lids last weekend, we've been using them for various heating/re-heating tasks, and we like them a lot. we got them in red so they wouldn't show tomato sauce, salsa, et al. stains and are very happy that we sprung for the "complete set". i hope this (linking to other, complementary items) isn't out of line here (and, to be sure, i have zero interest in either vendor), but we found an inexpensive metal rack at ikea to which i plan to add some short pipes to accommodate the larger lids: http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/70154800/ the container store sells a "tall" maple rack http://www.containerstore.com/shop… but my wife liked the ikea one better. thank you for making such a quality product, delivered in such a timely fashion.
already full action in the kitchen with the lids! what about a holder for all lids and even is possible to make transparent lids?
gir, i got them! i am very please! thank you : )
could you resend the survey? i think i deleted it by accident. thanks
@elles // no problem at all. that's why we call it studio white ;) shoot me a message via kickstarter messages or email (rather than a comment) so that we can talk details, and we'll get you sorted out right away whenever you're back.
hi gir..i am out if town on business for a few days but  will get u photo..if it is off white wish u had said that. i like dead white and it looked white in offering. never thought it abt inquiring as to colour since white to me is white..can i exchange colour please??. .i would not have gotten this, not sparkly...i do love the design.  smashing looking!..when i get home i will reassess..
*and fyi for anyone wondering, i'm in the beautiful tar heel state (north carolina). @melissa, that's hilarious!
got mine today! all beautiful and high quality. it's so so hard to get my mother anything (as she says she doesn't need anything and frowns upon frilly/superfluous things), but she saw these and just lit up. thank you!
@steve, miike, leslie, joakim, melissa // amazing! woohooo! @elles // studio white is an off-white, very light gray, which helps make them extra stain resistant. but we may have mixed them up! can you send one of the skus to me via kickstarter messages and i'll confirm if it's right or not? thanks! (you can also send a photo to hello@productofgir.com if that's easier.)
hi..got my kids and they r wonderful but i think u sent gray and not white..can we do a switch?  the design is lovely however!
got mine today in saskatchewan.  made me giggle when i saw the item description as "silicone novelties", hahaha.  poor mail guy. love them! the utensils are super awesome too.  may just have to order more for gifts next year.
shipment arrived in sweden! thanks for fabulous project and service!
using the little one right now to keep kitties out of my coffee.
git my lids, they're great, just wish i'd bought more of one of the sizes!  doh!
i've got my lids today!!! and no taxes! thank you!
right on!
yay my lids arrived. love them:)
@debbie // awesome! so glad to hear it. and yep, we're working on it :) that said, the flip was tested by a bunch of lefties and passed muster, at least with them - although it's not symmetrical, it should be okay for either-handed use. but i totally understand the note, and should have some surprises in store for next year! @remiam // you're welcome! @christine // awesome, and not awesome ;) just sent you a message to sort things out, no problem.
got my lids today and they are super awesome! unfortunately one of them arrived with what looks like a pen mark on it and i can't scrub it off. any chance of doing an exchange?
@gir: thank you for the tracking number!
received my lids and they really impressed my hubby when i showed him how they sealed one of our bowls.  (i picked it up by the lid while it was sealed)  i love everything gir.  my hubby's request...left handed flips.  he won't use the flip i have since he's left handed.  i'm sure there are others who would be interested. thanks
@lex // just checked, and it looks like yours is on schedule for delivery tomorrow :)
@remiam // we'll send you a message with the number, no worries. @nancy // thank you! @marie-andree // that's when it crossed the border :) our freight forwarding puts the packages directly into the postal system of the destination country, which gets things delivered quite quickly but has the unfortunate side effect of not showing tracking scans once the package leaves the us. (we note this in the shipping notification as well to give everyone a heads up, but sorry if it's confusing!)
@lex // looking into it, and will shoot you a note. most international tracking stops updating once the packages leave the us, but they'll get there! @kerry // sure thing. melissa, thanks again for the pinch-hit! @jason // shoot, sorry about that. had it right in the spreadsheet. looks like a little packing-line snafu. sending a replacement today!
tracking don't seems to work (it usualy do). it says "no data available" since 2 days.
i received my lids yesterday and love them! i can't wait to get the spoons and spatulas.
i don't know if you can do this, but i seemed to have deleted my tracking number.  before i did i know that my reward was to be delivered yesterday.  it was either not or the mailman put it in the wrong mail box.  this is a real possibility as recently the mail person put someone's prescription medicine in the wrong box.  could you please resend my tracking number.  thanks!
hello, i received my complete set kit yesterday and they look great but unfortunately my 6" teal lid was missing. i'll send a private message if you don't respond on here. thanks
cool that's what i thought as well but some people think they know everything. thanks for the right info.
my delivery stop tracking on dec 1st. was scheduled delivery for today.
@linda // yay! @kerry and melissa // you got it! we've actually sold to dozens of commercial kitchens, both restaurant and larger foodpacking operations. everything's fda and lfgb approved as food-safe, and can be cleaned using commercial dishwashers / cleaning solutions as well.
@kerry; i don't see why there would be. silicone is anti microbial so it should be no riskier than any other commonly used kitchen prod g material.
are there any hygiene risks with using silicone products in commercial/restaurant kitchens?
hi, i'm in california and i recieved the complete set of lids with stretch goal bonuses today! yay, thanks!
@creator: let's hope for the best ;)
@marguerite // your message got to the right place! we'll pick it up with you there and get you sorted out right away.
i know others have been delivered! hope you all love them!
hello there - i never received by backerkit by email and anything thing else covered in the updates (tracking info for my stuff, etc).  where do i contact for this problem? i cannot find any number or email addresses to send my questions to.  i am a bit concerned my order is being processed with my input (i.e., colors, etc).  thank you.
i'm the first to report i got my lids? i only ordered littles, but got 'em.  thanks! you've made my coffee drinkers happier.
@steve // sorry about that! for international packages over 4lbs, we had to send dhl. everything else is usps. we did claim modest customs values, though, so that should really help mitigate the fees!
got my notification too! sadly, it's a dhl shipping and not usps... broker fees will be expensive. :(
just got my notification too. woohoo!!
also got confirmation.
i got my shipping confirmation!
has anyone got their lids yet? :)
@trashman // you're very welcome! @patrick // we got lucky - our first-day funding meant that we could tell the factory to start production a few weeks early! also, sending stuff via fedex vs the slow boat cuts a good month off lead times. a little more expensive for us, but making you guys happy is worth every penny ;)
i can't believe how fast you're going to start shipping! insane!
thanks for the replies.  i was just reading the comments before doing the backerkit and wanted to ask.  i didn't need it open later and you started shipping, which is good for me.  i have had some backerkit surveys on projects and they never state when they are ending it and taking the funds.  thanks for telling us, letting us have the option to wait a bit, and never be scared to do it early.  i am sure many of ours are for us and for gifts this time of year.
@terry // just sent again. if you can't find it, send us a message via kickstarter (rather than a comment) and we'll give you the direct link!
checked my email, spam folder and trash. no email for the backerkit survey. have emails from backerkit for other kickstarter pledges. could you send me an email so i can get my pledge. thank you.
awesome!!! you guys rock!
we're getting there! should start shipping some segments in a day or so - just taking some extra time to check our work.
what's the survey completion rate at? i'm hoping at least 50% of backers have answered.
awesome :d
got it and filled out the kit. thanks!
@juan // link was sent already - maybe check spam? i'll send your personal link via messages. folks, if you're missing your invite and need us to resend, best method is a direct message to us (rather than a comment) - that way, when we respond we can include your personal link, which we don't want anyone else to see!
hi, i got the same problem as john. problems with the payments, which have been sorted now. so i'd like to receive the link for the backer kit and start ordering all those great products. thx!
@john // no prob. sent!
hi, is it possible to get the link for the backer kit. there was a problem with the payment which is sorted now, look forward to it! thanks for a great product.
@firedancer // we can probably pull that off!  @brian and gaye // i'll send you each a message with a personal invite link as well. @aaron // couldn't have said it better! thanks :d if you're having trouble finding the backerkit invitation email, you can follow aaron's super helpful post below, or send us a direct message via kickstarter and we'll send you your personal invite link right away. (send a message rather than a comment, since we don't want to post anyone's personal info on the comments board.)
i've never had problems getting backerkit emails but there is always the advice about checking your spam folder, making sure you're checking the correct email account, etc. the backerkit email doesn't come directly from kickstarter at all but instead comes from the name "gir: get it right" with the subject line of "gir silicone lid series pledge confirmation". you always have the option of going directly through backerkit too by going to https://gir-lid-series.backerkit.com/sign_in and putting in the email address you use on kickstarter.
i didn't receive a backerkit email....?
i received your email saying the backerkit invite went out early yesterday but i did not receive it.  please advise. thank you!
what's the thought on making a ladle by this coming september? that'd be a fantastic addition to the set.
@mike // perhaps a little confusion between the 60k and 80k stretch goals here - alex was asking about the 80k specifically. at 60k, we upgraded every "official" 4" lid to become a 2-pack of that 4" size. which means that if you pledged at the $80 level for two complete sets, you'd get four 4" lids total. effectively, every complete set will always contain six pieces total because of the extra 4" lid in the packout. so you're totally right - the complete set and double and triple and so forth contains 2x the 4" lids across the board, for as many sets as you include. if you get two sets, you start with four 4" lids. if you get three sets, you start with six 4" lids. we won't even sell single 4" lids, except... at 80k, each individual backer got one "unofficial" singleton extra 4" lid in gir red (no packaging, etc.). we made these in a special production run as a thank-you to backers, and we're putting one in each envelope that goes out. you can add it to your collection or share it with a friend! they're not for sale - just for you guys. hope that helps to clarify!
@davis // happy to help! @trashman // we can keep yours open longer if you want (and of course, if you don't finish the backerkit process it'll keep it open automatically).
so: a little surprise that we weren't going to announce yet, but since you're asking... we could start shipping packages as early as monday! we had the production run put onto a plane at the first possible moment, with the hopes of surprising everyone by shipping out before thanksgiving (or at least, those who'd answered their surveys). we'll do rolling lockdowns of backers who've finished and confirmed their pledges so that we can start packing up orders monday morning. if you don't want your package shipped early or you want us to keep your backerkit open for a little extra time, send us a message and we'll hold up!
@scott and nigel // sadly, kickstarter changed their brand colors, which rendered our initial kickstarter green a bit moot for future product launches. i'm so sorry it won't be a perfect match to your current set! we made the other colors complementary to that green, but i'm sad to see it go too.
now that i have gotten close to completing the backerkit survey, it says that estimated lockdown date is december 1st.
i would like to know when the backerkit will close also.  that will help in planning and possibly getting more.  thanks!
my selections have been entered! bring it on!
i think i must have clicked canada on the first screen.  thanks for checking!
so to piggyback off of alex's question. purchasing 3x full sets (5-packs) only gets 1 extra 4" lid? maybe i just had eyes bigger than my stomache here, but reading the stretch goals i thought that at 60k everyone who got at least one 4" was now getting two. so a $15 pledge got extra, and the complete set and double and triple and so forth would get extras for every 4" lid....ie double would get 2 more, triple get 3 more, and so forth. this is not the case?
@gir two questions: when will the backerkit close? i know that you said there was no possibility of kickstarter green for the dec 14 deliveries but what about the sep 15 ones?
is "kickstarter green" not a color option, or am i just missing it? i was planning to have these match the rest of the set!
@davis // not seeing it on our end. do you think it might be because ca = california and ca = canada? maybe the ca you selected was an international one and not the state? still looking, but that's my first guess.
@davis // checking now! back in a jiffy.
@alex // the 80k stretch goal is just for a singleton extra 4" lid, in gir red. we had the factory pack some as individuals (just in that color) so that everyone whose pledge didn't include a 4" lid in the first place could get in on the tiny lid action, and so that everyone who was already getting a 2-pack (or a bunch of 2-packs) could have an extra one to use as a drain stopper or share with a friend. so.... you'll get two 2-packs (pick any two colors) in your pledge, plus one bonus red 4" lid just for fun -- 5x4" lids, that is.
i'm in california, but the backerkit wants to add $10 for shipping my add-ons.  i thought domestic shipping was included?
i might be confused with this, but i know that the $60,000 stretch goal made all the 4" lids into a 2 pack, but what about the $80,000 stretch goal where everyone gets a free 4" lid? i pledged $80 for the 2 pack. does this mean i should be getting 2 extra 4" lids? a grand total of 6x4" lids for my pledge? thanks.
sorry guys! bug fixed - check again? all options should be there now.
same question about colours on backerkit. $80 pledge level. no option for colours on the 12.5 inch. only one option for 10 inch lid colour. correct options for all the rest. confused ! is it a stock issue?
i just chose my colors, but i only got to choose 7 colors for a double set. shouldn't i get to choose 10 colors for a double set?
how can i choose colors for my second set?
@mike // you got it - sorry again for the confusion. in backerkit, we've adjusted post-campaign pricing for the sets so that they will be in line with the "set" price for the $80 pledge level. short answer, yes - we'll honor the discount if you're at the $80 tier!
well what i was trying to ask originally was, i backed $80 for 2 kits, i want to get 3 (one for myself, and 2 for gifts for the holidays) $80 puts each kit at $40. in a previous comment, you said for the 3rd kit, just add $45 to get another. my question was, if $80 = 2 kits for $40 each, would you honor that discount for $40, making 3 kits $120?
@mike // oh no! weird - and sorry. but yes, you can add :) we'll backerkit up before the end of the week.
@gir (from 3 days ago), never got a message....so i didn't update my pledge before hand, funded with $80. hope i can add on after the fact
grats!   now where is my stuff? i can't wait! lol
congratulations! you sent me to the poor house ;)
wow, just waked up here in paris and found out 115k!! talk about boosted in last hours!:) congrats to gir and our fabulous sam! this is how a kickstarter project should be managed. fast response and full communication! many others can learn from gir, well done!
@gir: you too good night :)
@aselwyn // a pleasure, as always :) @aaron // thanks so much! love donna, and will have to send a note to thank her. she gave us great ideas for even more lid types, too. @stevens, tom, charley, melissa, aselwyn, firedancer, sheila, yishan, alana, donnazwa, susan, grant, patrick, robert, and anyone else burning the midnight oil... fun to close out the campaign with you! night night ;)
congrats with this excellent campaign!
so... like... whoopee!
fireworks!! beer!! and music!!
awesome!!!!
great job on the campaign thus far gir. i can't believe how much you guys got me to spend here! i've been wanting to get your ultimate spatula for a while now and with the good review from a friend at the cookistry blog i decided to jump in.
@aselwyn1: don't worry at least you just scraped in by the skin of your teeth to fund this project.
we did it!!!! go team! thank you all so much.
lots of people like me that procrastinated till the last day
wow that was a crazy amount pledged today
woo hoo lets celebrate!!!
10 seconds to go!! brace yourselves!!
just ticked over 1,500 backers with 2 mins left awesome!!!
on behalf of gir: thank you everyone who choose to backup this kickstarter!!!
what an achievement and milestone gir!!!!
congratulations 1,500 backers!!!!
what a milestone $20k+ on the last day and come on lets reach 1,500 backers prior to the conclusion of this kickstarter. just shy of 3 backers. *fingers crossed*
@sheila // if you pledge at one of the lower levels, you can add single products to customize however you'd like! details in project update #7 - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/productofgir/gir-silicone-lid-series/posts/1051017 hope that helps :) @firedancer // we're blown away. what a moment.
congratulations on the last day surge. over $20k in the last day alone!
is there just a spatula group add on with out jumping to the complete?
@yishan // you can mix any colors you want for any of the rewards or custom combos! the only item that comes in a set package is the 4" lid 2-pack, which is two of the same color in the one package. and yes, you'll be able to customize in backerkit as well :) @charley // thank you!
also congrats!
thank you for your prompt reply and i'll defiantly back up any future kickstarter's you guys initiate in the near future. :)
that means for the starter pack, all of them will be the same color? if there's backerkit, it also means that it is still possible to add on even after the campaign is over? i can't wait!
thank you alana and charley! @charley // the survey will be emailed to each backer (using the email address associated with your kickstarter account) - we'll send it out soon, just a day or two from now.
would the post campaign survey link be emailed to us or be posted on the next update?
i might also add a spoon also.
can't wait to receive this innovative product and also i might add a spatula.
totally had the intention to gift some pieces as presents but i think i will keep them all for myself. thanks for such a great opportunity to support gir and your wonderful products.
@alana // it's practically here! the 9x9 square lid in the rectangular lid 3-pack add-on might be just what you're after.
maybe we could also have a square lid for all those casserole dishes.
@susan // we'll send a survey post-campaign! you can mix and match colors, too :)
how can i choose the color of the gir lid series?
@audrey // each 4" lid set is packaged as a single color, so the $15 reward tier effectively contains four lids in two colors of your choice. sorry if we weren't more clear about that from the beginning! we tried to articulate it, but there are so many "twos and fours and 4-inches" flying around that it might have been hard to keep track.
@creator - does that mean i can't get 4 different colours of little lids? was planning to colour code stuff....
@yishan // you sure can! it'll be available as an add-on. they're packaged as a two-pack - so you if you get the "four little lids" set, you get two colors, four lids total. thanks!
i backed the starter pack, but added 15$ in case i could 'add-on' the four little lids one as well.  is that ok/ settle-able via backerkit? also if i cannot decide what colors (because they are all absolutely beeauutiful), is it possible to pick different colors or does it come as a one-color set?
the product dev team might mutiny if i add anything else! if only i'd known, hahaha.
this is fun :d had no idea we'd get this far - you guys are all stupendous. thank you for sharing. @donnazwa // yep, switching is a go! @sheila // i wish! we got the factory to add to the production run last-minute, but they could only get a limited amount to us on time for delivery with all the december rewards. we like even numbers too ;)
still have two hours to post a $110,00 stretch goal !!!
a fourth 4" lid stretch would be great!!   3 are driving me nuts...lol
will it be possible to switch from a complete set to the double set when we get the backerkit? having a hard time deciding on which "goodies" i want.... torn between 2 sets of lids or one set and some other extras. just curious how flexible the backer kit will be.
what's the $110k stretch goal? :-)
yippie!!
wow big last minute jump!
ah! knew it!
whoooo! thanks team!
i fell for it and ordered the starter pack. i just love your company and i just might add some spoons and flips when the backerkit is out.
100k!
@kurisu // hi there! i'm sure we can work something out. i'll send you a message :)
hi! one question about the future backerkit pledge manager: will it be possible to use paypal  to pay for additional items?
@joakin and grant // let's do this thing! @geumtian // kickstarter will automatically help you add it for the december 2014 stuff (everything from the main pledge), but for add-ons that ship in sept, you have to add the $10 manually. sorry for the extra step!
so close!!
do i add the 10 in total for shipping or does the little option at the bottom automatically add it for me?
6k more and are home! share on facebook to your friends!!
@charley // wow, thank you so much! @pclabtech // thank you sir, and see you in september ;) @kelly // wonderful. we'll make the rectangular lids happen no matter what, but every bit helps - thanks for the support and vote of confidence!
just pledge at $150 level + $74 to get all the add-ons.  i hope the last stretch goal is reached so i can get those "squared" lids.
so i am now up to 140.00 (double lid set, and christmas presents) i am going to wait on the "sept. 2015" set for next year.
i can't resist but to back up your kickstarter project whicg could lead up to an award winning design and product. i hope that this and any future kickstarter campaigns that you initiate will be successful.
@alexandre my level of confidence on this one is kind of ... high. i even disobeyed my own ks rule on this one : "never, ever, get a ks pledge as a gift for someone". it says much :-)
marie-andree i did back another gir kickstarter, and i do have to say.. they are amazing!!! great customer service... hope you get the same great experience i've had..
@sharisse // the $150 reward level doesn't contain the rectangular lids or other add-ons, but you can add $30 to that level - or $74 if you want all the add-ons, for a total of $224. yes, you can still order them if we don't hit 100k. we'll make them happen no matter what!
at less than 9k, i'm pretty sure that 100k is a done deal.
will the complete collection include the rectangular lids? can we order the rectangular lids if we don't hit 100k?
@gir want to be impressed :-)
i'm not sure cuz silicone becomes slippery when wet but you let us know how your testing goes and i'll see you on the next kickstarter
@melissa // we were almost going to include that in this project! next time, for sure ;) @patrick // i bet we could add some cool texturing to the silicone to make it really grippy. think that would work? @rob // thank you sir! @marie-andree // we hope to impress :)
@rob not to blow your bubble, but my experience tell me to judge the quality of a ks project and its creators by the hole thing, not just the financing period :-) that said, that stage was very well managed :-)
thank you gir, for a well run campaign. if the silicone cooking utensils thing doesn't work out, maybe you can offer classes to the other kickstarter projects on how to run a great kickstarter.
ya chopsticks might be slippery if made from silicone. they'd need something to help them grip. i saw a pair on amazon but they weren't for sale anymore
just had an idea for a future project... a ladle! that's one thing i have that i'm not in love with/would love to upgrade it :)
@alexandre // you read our minds. this is tyler's pet project actually - he's master of the basting brush!
@mike // no prob. just sent you a message!
@jean-stephan // we'll make it easy for you ;) backerkit to the rescue. sorry if we created some choice paralysis, haha. send us a message if you need any extra info - here to help!
@james // re rectangular lid singles: we'll definitely try to work it out! i know we can't do it at the immediate moment given how expensive mold tooling is going to be, but if we can pull it off and offer it to backers before shipping the first batch, we will. @patrick // yum! do you think they'd be too slippery? i know we could make them look and feel great, as long as noodle don't slip. sounds like some testing is in order ;) @firedancer // can't ask for more than that - thank you so much! @gryphonent // you got it - exactly right.
sam, could you figure out an awesome silicone brush? (way better that these already avaliable...) small, medium and barbecue sizes? thanks!
thanks for the reply! so add $45 to the double pack? the double is $80 ($40 per set)...could the third set also be discounted to $40 as well? ($120 total?)
@creator - just found out about this project and decide to become a backer but you offer so much :) will you be using something like backerkit after the project closes to allow backers to purchase additional items at backer prices, or do i need to decide what i want before the project closes? i have some homework to do ...
thanks gir team for the answer. i reckon the pledges are just an indication of money raised and we’ll be able to distribute and add to the pledge shortly before shipping? i’m at the complete set at the moment but might drop one or two round lids for a rectangular one.
*i'd
if buy more to get you closer to the $100k goal ... but i have already purchased everything. can't wait!
silicone chopsticks????
i second gryphonent's request for single rectangular lids. i have a set of six rectangular glass containers that the lids would great on, but i don't want to have to buy six sets.
@gryphonent // no worries. currently only planning the rectangular lids as a 3-pack (they'll be packaged that way from the start). but if we end up releasing them as single sizes, we'll make sure backers have an opportunity to claim one before we ship the add-ons out next year.
i guess this might be an obvious question: i’d like to get the medium rectangular piece only as an add-on? is there an option for me?
@mike // right on! you can adjust the pledge by $45 to add one more complete set to the double pack (so the total is $125). super-detailed notes and prices are listed in update #7 if you want a good reference - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/productofgir/gir-silicone-lid-series/posts/1051017 we're setting up a platform where you'll be able to confirm all the reward selections, choose colors, and tell us where to ship everything as soon as the campaign ends. and yes, we are 100% on target for shipping in early december :d
oh and how on target is the december 2014 estimated delivery date? obviously it is okay if it slips back a bit, but it would be nice to give these as physical gifts, but pictures and ious have happened before for similar things :p
hey guys! just pledged for two full sets at $80. but i want to get three total (i want two for gifts for the holidays, and one for myself) please let me know how to go about this (up the pledge money (what amount?) and write it in a note, make a new category, or what not) thanks!!
i think i hear my wallet magically emptying right this very second.....
@melissa // thank you! you can add more products post-campaign, too! everything will ship at the same time as your other rewards. we'll have a platform set up to make it really easy. :)
too bad you got me to raise mine ;-) if we decide at campaign end we want to get more products, will we get the option to add them? or do we have to do it all before campaign ends?
@steve // phew!
good to hear. you stopped me to lower my pledge ;)
we'll find a way to make it happen! no need to delete your rectangular lid pledge if we don't hit 100k - they're in the mix, you have our word. yes, 100k would make for a much smoother runway. but we'd never let you guys down :)
i would think you would just create separate projects if we don't get to 100k. i have faith in you guys. like all your products you are awesome!?
if you don't reach the stretch goal of 100.000 what will we do with the rectangular lids pledge???must we delete from  pledge or it will be ok anyway??best wishes
@ben, re comparison visuals // website updated! hopefully the new rollovers will be of help. also put the "specs" tab front-and-center on each product page, and fixed the bug that was preventing the right numbers from showing up. thanks again for the heads-up! campaign update with more visuals and pricing, forthcoming.
we hear you guys! we're working on something really special with the tongs, cool enough that they'll deserve a campaign of their own so you can really see how they work (seriously, it's different than any other pair of tongs you've seen). we probably won't launch it until next summer/fall so that we have all our ducks in a row from an engineering standpoint. we have a few prototypes built out already, but there's a ton of work left to do and really no way we could guarantee a delivery date in sync with the add-ons from the campaign thus far. thongs, on the other hand, sound much more achievable on short notice ;)
i also would like tongs. thongs would be pretty sweaty made out of silicone.
i also like thongs! auto correct strikes again! next campaign is fine but at least if it was an add on here then i could save on paying for shipping a third time!
please make the thongs available as addon...i'm prety sure tha tall  backers would love those despite of their wallets :-)
@ben // you got it. update will be much easier to digest, i agree. we'll include pictures and measurements where relevant to make everything easy to grok. i'll look into what's going on with the website - we just listed those product a few days ago, so there might be some bugs to squish. i know i coded the correct stats, measurements, etc. for display so i'll have to see what's going on if they're not showing correctly on some browsers. sorry for any confusion!
@patrick and rosy // for the sake of rosy's wallet, we're going to go with "next campaign" ;) in all truth, though, we are working on them in earnest.
hi have your original spatulas, and excited to buy more of your stuff. 1. can you, in an update preferably, or here if you must, list every single add-on available and their price. you had a photo of them in an update, but no prices. 2. can you give the differences between your mini/pro/ultimate spatulas, flips, etc. it's one thing to have different sizes, but i have no idea what sizes would be used for what. more information (on your website especially, where they are even all listed as the same size!?!) would go far towards getting more sales
i second a request for tongs... though my wallet wouldn't mind if it was included in your next ks campaign. =)
do you think tongs will make it out this round or will that be another kickstarter?
ah ok gotcha. thanks!
@patrick // yesterday! backer update due to announce (you didn't miss it, haha). $84 international will get you the whole bundle ($10 flat shipping for unlimited add-on rewards). cheers!
omg when did all this new stuff come out?! i'm from canada and a backer of the collection. how much do i add to get everything? $74? or do i need to add extra for shipping?
@rosy // sowwy ;) @cole // you got it!
just to confirm its 65+74 for all the new stuff? 139 total?
i just got the email with the extra add-ons... i definitely yelled "stop taking my money" at the computer.
@joakim // we'll try not to make you update any more ;) just couldn't help ourselves! @mana // absolutely! they're rated long-term for 464°f, and short-term well above that in the 500-550°f range. the rectangular set will be an oven go-to, we hope. @akiko // thankee! everything's listed on the top of the main campaign page, and you can scroll to the bottom for details. adding $74 to the pledge total will get you every one of the add-on products :d
omg!  this is amazing! what are the prices for the new products? do we need to add extra for shipping out of the usa? thank you so much for creating such fantastic products.
would the silicone lids hold up to baking?
pledge updated again! :) grate update!
woohoo!
yeah, free 4" lid
love these indestructible tools!!!!!!! love gir!
@shannon // wow, thanks! you'll be able to add spatulas during the post-campaign survey process, and everything will ship together of course. you can see all our prices at productofgir.com, although there will almost certainly be a small backer discount incorporated as well ;)
how do i add money to my pledge to get a spatula also?  and what are the spatula prices?
@taryn and todd // thank you! @kirk // sure thing. you can pre-order one at our website (will start shipping at the same time as the lids, actually), or back for $1 and then add one post-campaign :d @jane // yes - you'll be able to add single products post-campaign, or you can add $14 to your pledge right now and allocate it to the 12" lid during the survey process. thanks!
is there a way to add on just the 12 inch lid?
what if we just want the scraper?  is that an option?
these look incredible!!  the spoon and spat changed my kitchen. can't wait for the lids to do the same!
these look amazing! i love my gir spoon, and i can't wait for my beautiful lid! thanks for getting it right!
whoa steve, thanks!
gir really is hands down the best kitchen wear you can find.
@linda // sorry for the delay! don't know how i missed you and @chris (hat tip!) silicone is naturally antimicrobial - much like stainless steel, it's inherently inert to bacteria, mold, fungi, and other microbiological growth. the particular silicone we use is pharmaceutical grade, fda and lfgb approved for food and human contact and is molded into lids at an iso 9001 : 2008 certified, quality controlled facility. the base material is manufactured in the us by momentive fine performance materials (formerly ge silicones), and our production factory is in china, at an eco-friendly facility that maintains fair labor practices (they are an absolutely incredible group of people). @melaney // woohoo!
can't wait to get these! my husband and i purchased sets for each of our moms for the holidays. so cool!
@claudia // thanks! @andrew // yes -- $10 extra (above initial shipping), but it'll cover as many add-ons as you want. they're shipping separately in 2015, so we need a bit of help to make it happen!
question for mini flip and mini spoon. update 3 says to add $10 for international shipping. is this above the $10 shipping for the lids?
way to go gir!
@kim // thank you! @cyd // absolutely - ultimate flip is 34cm. pro fip is 36cm. ultimate spoon is 32cm. you definitely have the ultimate size if you already have a spoon and flip, since they're the only ones we've released so far. the mini flip will be approx 30cm, subject to some tweaking. mini spoon is 28cm in prototype form right now, and will probably stay right around there. we'll share some schematics to help out over the next week or so!
i swear to god, y'all keep dropping projects and taking my money. i love the lid that got included with my flip and spoon. can't wait to get some more!
neat project! sorry if this has already been addressed, where the lids are made and what makes them antimicrobial? thanks.
is there a way i can get actual length dimensions on the ultimate and pro?  the flip and spoon i have seem incredibly large, i don't think i have the ultimate size.  if you can state the length different of pro, ultimate and mini that would really help me figure out what i have and what i have yet to get.  thanks
the lids: genius!  can't wait. go get it right!!!
@sherman and patrick // we'll post this in an update to clarify for all backers, but the idea here is that at 60k we'll have enough funding to make all of the 4" lids a two-pack rather than a singleton - they'd be packaged as two-packs before we even get them in our warehouse. if we hit the goal, pledges that originally included a "complete set" with just one 4" lid (the official $45, $65, $80, and $150 levels) would be upgraded so that the 4" lid would come as a two-pack instead. so, while we'd love to be able to give extra 4" lids across the board, the case here is actually that anyone who pledges for a reward including a complete set will have that set upgraded from one 4" lid to two of them. sorry if we made things confusing!
i believe you qualify if you spend a minimum of $45 so you would be okay
for the second stretch goal, would you consider pledges of more than 45usd? the complete set did not fit my needs, but i am still pledging for more lids than the complete set and the total is more than 45usd. would i, could i, still qualify for the free 4 inch lid?
@joakim and kristijan // thank you, as always! @kerry // you can - i'll send you a message to help out. you can also get one on amazon right now (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00olck1fm), or our website in a day or two. @jamie // why yes we have ;) stay tuned! @nigel // wow, thank you! we'll definitely try to work it out. @geumtian // just like chicken soup, we try to make things good for the soul. (bonus: they can also help you with the chicken soup.)
@andrew // the flip and spoon from our last campaign were the "ultimate" size -- sort of the kitchen standard, if you will. (we actually billed that spoon as a pro version during the campaign itself, but did a little naming revamp to keep all of the size families - mini, ultimate, pro - in the right mix.) here's what we've got so far, just to keep it all clear! ultimate flip and ultimate spoon - funded in 2013, completed 2014, available on amazon at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00olcjzsg and http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b00olck1fm pro flip: completed 2014 along with ultimate flip, unreleased - you can be the first to get one by backing the gir collection in this campaign, or adding $20 to any other pledge level mini flip and mini spoon: will be funded in this campaign (we hope!) and released in 2015 we'll provide lots of illustrations and prototype pictures over the coming week so that you can see the differences among them!
mini flip and mini spoon hope we reach them! i feel like i'm almost addicted to the products you're producing. just can't stop myself.
what a lovely product...
when* we reach the mini flip and mini spoon stretch goals might it be possible to get them in glorious original kickstarter green, as the december timeline obviously does not apply?  i am just adding $56 to my pledge for two of each. * which we will definitely do.
i am so thrilled that you guys keep innovating. every product that i have of yours is amazing. have you guys given any thought to creating a silicon cover for 8x8 or 9x13 baking dishes?
can i add a normal spoon through this campaign? can't seem to buy one off the website. should have brought one when i pledged for the spatulas and flip.
looking forward to hit all stretch goals! good work gir! sam you rock!:)
just curious.. was the flip and spoon that was part of your last kickstarter campaign the mini flip and mini spoon?
@firedancer // ask and ye shall receive ;) check out project update #2! https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/productofgir/gir-silicone-lid-series/posts/1030757 @mini flip and mini spoon requesters // ditto the above. there's more where that came from, bwhaha.
@gir. sweet!
@patrick // there will be.... there will be ;) @stevens // you absolutely can. check out project update #1 for easy instructions and breakdown. just start with any reward level, and add on however you'd like. send me a message if you need any extra help!
i really like the idea too choose the lids you need by choosing them seperatly instead of the standard pledge.
i'm surprised there isnt a pro spoon! or is there? dun dun dun....
@riley // so true ;) @firedancer // don't blow our cover! heh heh heh @mana // you got it! @oh lien // so welcome :) direct grill temps might be a stretch, especially if it's over an open flame. our 464°f rating is super conservative (it's a long-term operating temperature... like, leaveitintheovenfortwoweeks long-term). you can push it to 550°f short-term without any ill effects. higher than that, and there's a risk of discoloration. fortunately, there isn't any harmful off-gassing involved when the silicone starts to overheat. no bad actors, as they say. and it doesn't melt. but grill marks are more attractive on steaks than on lids, methinks. all that said, if you're thinking of topping a grill basket and/or generally keeping it away from open flame, they should be fine! it's just the direct exposure that i'd be concerned with.
for previous comment; awesome thanks. new question, since i can steam in the micro or in the stove with this... how about grilling?
i look forward to your other lid (the ones that slip over) esp if they will fit the pyrex containers whose rubber tops break so easily.
what's the chance that you would consider adding a stretch goal to include a second small lid to the complete packages? this would make sense as they're sold as pairs, otherwise there would be an odd number if you add it on (i can't stand off numbers).
stretchy lids, eh? sounds like those might make a good...stretch goal.... /sunglasses
@judith // sorry for any confusion! the lids simply sit on the top surface of a container, creating an airtight seal by nature of the weight of the lid itself (basically, it pushes air out of the container below, which allows it to self-seal on the rim). but you are right to assume that they don't prevent major spills if the whole bowl tips over. we're working on a very different kind of lid that you can stretch right over the rim of a bowl. the current designs are wonderful because they effortlessly fit on almost any container. they do a great job of preventing minor splashes and spills, but a topple off the countertop is a whole other ballgame!
my girlfriend will love this thing,(as well as me!) awesome project!
i've got the original spatula and then i lost contact or something, probably my age.  anyway, i preordered on the last preorder.  that said.  i can't figure out these lids, even though i am an enthusiastic backer!  i read and re-read all of your descriptions.  but absolutely nowhere do i see if the lids fit tightly enough to hold stuff in if it tips over??  if i hadn't learned my lesson many years ago to never assume anything, i would just assume this.  because i did do the collection level, but i know that i would need more lids if they are safe for liquids in a bowl that tip over??
@oh lien // phew - glad it performed as expected ;) absolutely - you got it.
hi gir i was a little skeptical about the lids and then i went to try the one i forgotten i had, it was amazing! hopefully, you don't mind me adding the $15 pledge to my $45 one! cheers!
@patrick // well hello sir! welcome to the party! gir tongs are going to blow your mind. but we're in stealth mode with them so that's all we can say for now ;)
i didnt back any of your other kickstarters although i wanted to. and now here i am backing $150 worth of kitchen products! a slotted spoon would be awesome. how about tongs???
@mana // should create a nice strong seal on any smooth surface, including cast iron. i could see issues if there are dents or divots that prevent the whole lid from contacting the pan's rim, but other than that my guess that it'll work like a charm.
@avigayil // sorry to make your brain hurt! ladle and perforated spoon: game on. shoot me a message if you want to talk pledge combos and i'll help out :)
how is the seal on cast iron pans?  i'm getting my lids anyway, but i'm just curious :)
had difficulty selecting my pledge level as i already have two of your first spatulas (yellow and purple) from your first kickstarter - i missed the second as i thought it was just for different size spatulas.. silly me.. and how many spatulas does a girl need? but i seriously need the scraper and at least the small flipper and the spoon and the lids... and 1 matching spatula would be nice too. i cook with creuset and kitchenaid enamel coated cast iron so i am very careful what i put in them. a ladle is super necessary, as is a pasta scoop in the future. seriously need something that separates out my noodles as i stir. went for the gir collection in the end.
@elles // as with most nerdy things, the answer is yes and no! you can have pharmaceutical grade silicone that isn't platinum-cured (for example, silmedic is a brand of peroxide-cured raw material silicone that's medical grade; there are lots of others). most platinum-cured silicones are pharmaceutical grade, but it's possible to platinum-cure a silicone that doesn't meet pharmaceutical testing standards (there are lots of home kits that use a platinum cure process... one of which was used to make my very first prototype of the ultimate spatula!) our silicone is platinum-cured (though for our purposes, using a peroxide-cured system wouldn’t actually make much of a layman’s difference in the end product.) still finalizing in-store prices, but we’ll send an update with them when they’re set. all of the kickstarter pledges incorporate a significant discount to our approx retail for the lids, though!
@jo // thanks! ladle is a 2015 must-have. in the works :d
@chris // that last comment was for you too!
@pc // haz answers! we can't get lavender produced in time for holiday delivery, but we are definitely adding it to the lineup next spring! yep, you can definitely add a pro flip. increase the pledge amt by $20 and you can select the color post-campaign per usual. flip from the last campaign was indeed the standard / ultimate size. this has me thinking... should we add a "lids+pro flip" level for backers who've been a part of past campaigns and just want the newest stuff? eggs 'n butter!
@andrew // no need to double up on shipping! your whole pledge is covered :d
@w.p. // my heart is breaking with you. weird to say, since i suppose i'm in the driver's seat, but it's so strange to have it replaced by a different shade of green.
is pharmaceutical silicone similar to platinum silicone? is there a difference? and what will the selling price be in your store, out of ks? thanks

awesome product! i can see myself using that alot.  what i also need is a silicon ladle .... would you guys be making one of those anytime soon? ;)
i'm with pclabtech. i would like to add on a "pro" flip as well. then my ks old/new set would be complete.
i haz questions: will there be a possibility of the "purple/lavender" color you had for the spatulas? can i add the "pro" flip to my double order as an addon? (assuming the one i got from your last kickstarter is the "standard flip")   did i mention i love your flip? *butter butter butter*
cool. thanks. do i need to double up the shipping?
well shucks, it's not about color cash for me at least. i just love the "old" ks green. oh well
@riley // oh no you can't! will send an update shortly with all the pricing info so that add-ons are easy math :) @andrew // haha. all in good time ;) yes and yes - you can absolutely combine reward levels. just adjust the pledge total accordingly, and you can select products and colors post-campaign per usual!
now i know what that round thing i received with my flip and spoon preorder is for. i just backed the starter pack. was wondering if there's any chance i can back for the four little kids together with the starter pack? will you guys be doing backerkit after the campaign as well so that we can do add-ons? great product and design. looking forward.
well, i backed the last two kickstarters, and i use the one lid i have every day, so i can't very well skip this, can i? :p looking forward to getting prices for additional lids. i think i'm going to want extras of the small ones.
@madalena // you read our minds! @nigel, eric, and ln // couple things at play here... since kickstarter changed their brand identity, we'll forever run into the conflict of current vs legacy kickstarter green as we introduce new products and campaigns. doesn't make much sense to have three (!!!) green shades on offer, so we had to make the tough decision to consolidate and stick with our trusty original gir lime (which, not to beat a dead horse, very intentionally shouldn't clash with ksg tools even if it is a less emerald-y tone). additionally, given the tight delivery timeline for december, we've already scheduled the order for raw materials - were we to add kickstarter green to the lineup at this point, we wouldn't be able to produce it before the holidays, which is no good at all. it was hard for us to say goodbye. we really loved it too! :/
i too would love the original kickstarter green used in the other campaigns to match all of my other gir goods! i hope this option becomes available!
@eric. from your comment it would appear that you got your flip and spoon in gir lime, is this correct, and did you purchase the flip and spoon through gir's last kickstarter? if you did you should have been able to get them in ks green, i certainly did. whilst i also purchased some gir red items, i have one of each of the the spatulas (apart from the ultimate, as i was not part of the first campaign), flip, spoon, and scraper in ks green. the only odd one out is the ultimate spatula in gir lime.
i'll love to see rectangle lids...please ake them available for us!best wishes
happy to back a new gir product. i was a sidekick in the last campaign and i agree about the kickstarter green. until i received my spoon and flip two weeks ago ( and they are great, just what i needed ) one of my spatulas didn't match the 3 others and looked faded. now it's like half n half in my drawer. not all were available in ks green.
whilst i do agree that gir lime is complementary to your ks green items (i missed the original campaign and added a lime ultimate spatula to the second campaign) and certainly doesn't clash, it does look slightly faded relative to the ks green. i still prefer the old ks green. i think that the new ks green would clash with both the old ks green and the gir lime.
@joe // cheers! oh yes there are ;)
@chris // if you add it to your edc, i'll be so floored! most excellent. largest size should definitely cover - 12.5" (318mm) definitely fits my 7 1/4 qt le creuset, and that's where we cook meatballs for a crowd!
@tom // that's awesome! so fun that you can use them anywhere - drain cover is a dark horse ;) thank you so, so much for the support. hope you love the rest of the sizes, too!
congrats! i love how gir is expanding. are there plans to make a version of the silicone lids in a rectangle, loaf sizes?
i've used the lids for none lid purposes. i'm hoping the largest size would cover my pot when i sous vide. i've used the gir lid to move hot things around, since it is somewhat heat resistant. i like tom's idea. i'm going to try the frisbee thing out today. by the way, i may have to make the gir lid an edc. you never know when it will come in handy.
i have to admit that when i received my pre-order you folks threw in one of your new lids as a sample… and i had no clue what purpose is was supposed to serve, or what i was supposed to do with it. was it a drain cover or a frisbee? i set it on top of a bowl in the kitchen one day then, a few minutes later, decided to pick it up… and the entire bowl came up with the lid. “whoa… how cool,” i thought. since then i’ve been using it as a cover for small saucepans, bowl storage in the fridge and on the table, etc. you folks have done it again! so, i pledged for the “double set” and, when these become available at your online store i will purchase more for gifts. thanks for another fine kitchen solution! cheers, tom
@rosy // nigel speaks true! also working on some slightly more top-secret designs. @pc // should we add that to the product details? they go surprisingly far!
the lid we got makes a wonderful frisbee too!
@pclabtech // hello, sir! thanks for the flip love :d
@nigel part 2 and w.p. // we're making the lids just in gir lime, since kickstarter changed their brand colors to the much different and waaay more minty green. we're trying to figure out what to do in the future, since they threw us for a loop with that one! three shades of green just wouldn't do. but we made sure that lime and kickstarter green are complementary, so the gir lime lids shouldn't cause a kitchen fashion faux pas next to ksg tools.
first off... wow, everyone! that was fast. we're super excited to get these lids to you! @sheila // absolutely, and thanks for the spatula love! just combine the pledge amounts. you'll be able to allocate the extra funds after the campaign ends, at the same time you select colors and confirm your shipping address. shoot me a message if you have any questions - happy to help sort out the details if anything is confusing :) @rosyrazly and nigel // nigel, thanks for the pinch hit! it is indeed larger -- 16 inches long to the ultimate flip's 14 inches. mini flip (and mini spoon) are in the works, looking like spring 2015 for launch. will start giving some thought to stretch goals! @mana // how kind of you! you can absolutely add a pro spatula - just add $20 to the pledge amount. we'll have a system set up so that you can easily allocate the funds and select a color post-campaign.
@rosy, in an email to me sent yesterday samantha stated: 'we are currently working on a smaller flip and spoon (along with a slotted spoon!), which we're targeting for launch in spring 2015... ...ladles are a bit further behind, but in the works as well.'
@nigel - oh right! i completely forgot about that update. thank you! @samantha - have you guys considered a mini flip? i love my flips... but i'd love one that is smaller/skinnier
i have returned! my kitchen will soon be filled with more gir!  love my flip!
+1 for a ks green option (the old ks green to match the previous campaigns).
@rosyrazly. the pro flip is larger, it was shown in update #34 of the previous campaign https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/productofgir/gir-spatula-mini-skinny-pro/posts/929809
would it be possible to add a pro-spatula to our pledge, or would it be easier/more economical for you guys if we just do that through your webstore?
funded!!!!!!!!
is the pro flip larger or smaller than the flip from the last campaign? also, since we're about to hit the goal... are there stretch goals, maybe?
will ks green be a color option? it would be nice to match the color of my previous two backed gir projects.
hello! is there a way for me to add the starter pack to the 4 little lids? thanks so much! love my gir spatulas!
@maxine, ginger, and carol // thank you so very much! @rich // me too! quite the conundrum ;) @brit // absolutely! you got it. @karin // the scrapers are available for pre-order on our website at productofgir.com, and should be shipping in november. you'll also be able to add one in backerkit once this campaign is over, and we can ship it along with your lids! @heather // thank you so much for sharing! absolutely - just add $20 to the campaign total for each additional flip you'd like. we'll post pricing for additional lids shortly!
all of your products are great. you always get it right :-)
this looks great, and i've already pledged. is there going to be a colour the same/similar to sky blue (from the spatula series)
can we add extra sets and a pro flip to our pledge if we are at another level? i'm pledged for the double set. i've got multiples of the other items in the top pledge but i'd love to add the pro flip and more lids. i'm spreading the word about the campaign to my family and friends!
gir spatulas are my favorite kitchen tools. can't wait to try new products from this class act company.
i love all my spatulas and spoon.  the sample lid i received was great so i'm happy to once again back the project and spread the word via facebook. . the only product i don't have is the small hand held spatulas bowl scraper.  are those sold individually?
love all the gir products. looking forward to the lids!
awesome! hope that we will be able to make add-ons in backerkit for more spoons/spatulas etc...
can't believe it's taking you so long to hit the target ;-)
love you guys! can't wait to have another awesome kitchen tool!
