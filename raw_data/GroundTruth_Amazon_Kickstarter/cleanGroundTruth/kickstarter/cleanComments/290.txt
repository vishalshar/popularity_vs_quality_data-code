still waiting in vancouver, canada
still waiting in montreal
still eagerly waiting in brazil
still waiting in canada
package received in france! games look fantastic!
still waiting in france..
just got mine today in alabama.  maybe it was just that the majority of backers should have had theirs by the 14th.  if you haven't got yours yet, there's still a chance it's on its way. good luck!
@chris: nothing received (yet) in barrie, on... sent e-mail using form on perplext website.
still waiting excitedly in ireland.
well, checked my box today in texas and no game....just sent a message to chris....really disappointed.
i'm wondering about the request to notify if we haven't received by the 14th; given that canada post doesn't work over the long weekend, we won't be getting any mail until the 18th at the earliest. :-/
easter 4 day long weekend is here and no games to play - you did say they would be here by the 14th right ???? well they wont be delivered tomorrow or monday so maybe you meant the 18th or was that 2018 ? please tell us where our games are - this is . . . .
just got mine in ny.  hopefully this means that it's finally coming along for everyone else around here...
still waiting in miami, florida
patiently waiting here in the niagara falls region of canada. i sure do hope it arrives before the easter holidays.
it's finally here! so excited to open it up!
still nothing in delaware :( starting to get a bit worried
still nothing here in northern canada
@roman - looks like only one report so far from canada unfortunately :/ i'm also still waiting here in manitoba.
still waiting in houston....third time posting...hopefully it will pop up....getting doubtful.....
still waiting in ireland - hoping it will arrive this week.
@lloyd if people are receiving it all over canada i am a bit less worried and hopeful.
still waiting in vancouver, canada.  interesting that if it is coming from china that people back east are receiving it before british columbia, considering it likely came on a ship to vancouver.
still waiting in charlotte, nc. some people have been getting theirs shortly after posting, so i thought i'd do the same.
still waiting in toronto, canada. hopefully nothing happen with the canadian batch:)
we got ours in chile yesterday.
nice to hear that games are starting to arrive in canada! fingers crossed that it comes tomorrow!
got mine in canada yesterday. ottawa, ontario
still waiting in miami, florida
oh, if the shipping is done from china, it can take a really long time for canadian backers to get the reward. like two months off from estimates.
arrived in atl 2 days ago!
thanks, michael!
peter - i got it at my office in manhattan. hopefully you're next!
got mine in nyc. i am so happy can't wait to get it played
@michael garforth -- where in ny? wondering if i can't figure out if i'm just about to get it (working in the office today)
looking forward to playing the new games on all the cub and boy scout campouts coming up in the next few weekends.  this is the best set of games to pop into my backpack.
michelle, we will make sure you get your rewards.  but, we are allowing this process to take place.
all that said, i hope that they do turn up, but also that concerns such as this are not falling on deaf ears. :)
my concern is still that usps has consistently marked my packages as delivered, then actually delivers 1-3 months later. on a couple of occasions, usps workers have been caught marking packages delivered then dumping them in the woods. without a tracking number on my end to see if this package was marked as delivered already (despite not receiving anything), it is a) letting them get away with this behavior unchecked and b) will be much more difficult to combat them in 2 more weeks. i get that we won't ever see the tracking numbers this go around, but for future shipments, it would be much less of a headache on your end and less stressful on the buyer. this alone has me questioning if i would purchase again, personally, especially knowing that you have the tracking but will not share it.
received my copy in ny. had fun playing dig and explaining rules for a few others!
still waiting in ohio. :-(
not in southern ontario. *sigh
has anyone in canada for theirs yet?
arrived in kentucky! everything looks great!
just checked the mail... still waiting here in northern ontario canada!
received mine via usps in maryland today. fyi, i was a little impatient.
also, i see people asking for the carrier. mine was delivered via usps. hope the rest of you get your games soon.
received my reward in california on saturday. thanks so much, can't wait to try out all the games!
still waiting here in brazil
got mine in alaska, thanks!
still waiting in kentucky, too. (patiently. just adding a data point.)
@peter same here also here in ny and nothing yet
april 2nd, and still nothing in northern westchester, new york. can we please get tracking information?
apparently speaking up here in the comments is the key. games arrived in seattle today!  :)
i received my games in northern germany. the came in an envelop, no tracking number.
thanks @joshua sauer! since tomorrow was quoted: for those still waiting and concerned, there isn't cause for alarm until april 1. hopefully we can get an update or tracking information for those of us still waiting.
@steve ercolini - i got mine via usps, straight to my mailbox. if they are all being sent the same, then that's your answer.
who is the carrier delivering the games in the us? anyone who got there games still looking at the comments or just all of us still waiting? pretty sure i am past usps, fedex & ups today here in seattle. still nothing.  :(
nothing in atlanta still
nothing here in manitoba, canada :( was hoping to have them by the end of the week. alas, it does not seem to be the case.
usps and fedex have come and gone =( delaware
vienna, austria.
game arrived in vienna, man these things are cute.
received in ny, and everything looks great!  hope you'll consider doing a set of solitaire games sometime.
nothing yet here in delaware
bayou city received!
nothing yet here in germany … :-(
patiently waiting for my games in saskatchewan, canada
sweden recieved!
nothing yet in edmonton, alberta
no sign of it here in southern ontario. just thought maybe it'll arrive tomorrow if i commented here like it did for some others in this forum. *fingers crossed for luck
nothing yet in il...
just got my games here in sacramento ca. looking forward to playing them with my playgroup.
received mine in lithuania ^^
still nothing in montréal either...
still looking... :(
still nothing in montreal, canada..
arrived in tucson, az.  such a neat concept.  nut and dig were excellent, can't wait to try more!
reporting from seattle: they've arrived!! many weeks after other folks in seattle received theirs, so chris was accurate saying proximity was not a factor. to those still waiting, have hope! @joshua: i faced the same issue, but used it to my advantage. i just explained to my wife that because these were for my 2016 stocking, they did not count against my 2017 game allotment :-).
nothing yet in vancouver, canada
got mine today in wi.  i look forward to playing them all.
got mine in portland oregon. seem to be in good shape. sadly, since they were so late, and i had planned them as stocking stuffers, now i'll have to wait 9 months to play them...
received in los angeles. perfect!
just arrived in golden, colorado!
april 1 is fast approaching.....still waiting in houston.
still waiting in wisconsin. my buddy who also backed and lives in the same town received it a week ago!
for all the people waiting like myself.  chris very specifically said don't worry until after april 1st.
also still waiting in atlanta, luke. the last update sounded like they have tracking numbers but aren't going to be giving them out (i assume due to volume). however, is there any way to check and make sure that those of us still without anything haven't gone missing already? or marked as "delivered" when nothing has shown up? usps is notorious for losing packages and marking as delivered when it's not.
still waiting in china.i havent gottentracking or anything yet.
mine arrived in miami, fl on friday (the day after i posted on here about it lol) have enjoyed the 5 i've tried so far greatly!
i havent gottentracking or anything yet.
still waiting in atlanta, ga.
@peter and @michael in ny as well and still waiting
received (in oregon) - thanks!
do the eu packages get a tracking number ? i still haven't received any email with tracking, nor any package in the mail (warsaw, poland)
received in barcelona this last week :)
anybody get theirs in tx yet? i haven't gotten mine yet.
just arrived in co for friday night kids. thanks!
arrived. thank you! woot, you nuts.  ;-)
my games arrived today.  thank you so much!!!
so when is the mystery game going to be up on bgg? i want to add it to my collection, and i'm too lazy to submit it to their db right now.
received in denmark. love being able to tell folks i just got 18 games in the mail xd
for those who got the tracking numbers to show up in my usps, where is the product shipping from? i have one mysterious number that appeared today from washington state, so i'm wondering if that's finally it?
nothing yet in south america
hi yannick, also in montréal here... nothing yet.
arrived yesterday in austria. unfortunately some (minor) damages to one game
i'm in california (bay area) and i just got it today. came in the regular mailbox since it's so small!
was going to check here to see if i should be concerned about still waiting in ca. looks like waiting isn't a concern yet, even if things are moving a bit slower than expected.
also waiting in ny, not just you peter!
anyone in montréal, canada received it yet?  or maybe just canada?  it's been 3 weeks... (or maybe i'll just post here and it will magicly appear in my mailbox like few of you haha!)
still waiting in ny. anyone else in my neck of the woods waiting?
received today.  haven't opened the games up yet but the packaging is excellent.
waiting in tucson, az.
still waiting in china. a friend of mine got hers here a couple of days ago, made mine is almost here.
still waiting in houston. a friend of mine got hers here a couple of days ago, made mine is almost here.
received today in ms. took nut out to dinner with us and really enjoyed it. my wife liked it so much we played two more times as soon as we got home!
w00t ! arrived in ohio today.. looks amazing! well done!
does the shipment arrive hong kong yet?
my 18 games have arrived in denmark in perfect condition.
at least three people have added the bonus game to bgg. it takes a while for them to approve new additions.
nothing yet in wisconsin... i'm posting here so it will show up today.
arrived today in pa. please add ??? to bgg - all others are there.
i feel you joe! still waiting in miami, fl as well!
tanja, spy - https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/195456/spy rum - https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/192827/rum
arggh. this is killing me. still waiting here in seattle. :-(
correction, found box and dig, but not the others...
i'm also missing spy, rum, box and dig on bgg...
when are you going to add the surprise game to boardgamegeek? i would like to add it to my bgg collection....
oh i was too hasty because there they came! and man they look like a lot of fun!
got mine last night! i'm so glad it made it to our new place! everything looks great cant wait to start playing xd
finland is waiting for pack 1&2 sets
italy, naples, pack o game are here! :-)
still no sign in lexington, ky.  i am hoping it arrives in the next couple of days.
i got mine a week ago, in melbourne australia. i have already played hue, lie and orc, all have gone down well. i also used the set of 18 games to play jenga with while playing another game.
got mine! i'm in chicago. super excited. i have a whole collection now :)
i got my set in today. it didn't even show up in my usps but glad to get it. upon initial inspection all of the games looked good but while unboxing and looking at all of the sets, the dig game had some bent cards. is it possible to get a replacement for them? thanks. as far as i can tell everything is fine but i will have to play them and inventory the cards later to make sure none are missing. i am super excited to give these a try. the portability of these are great.
received my games in michigan today. i can't wait to try them!
but, urutsini, since chris handy warned us in the latest update, people can hardly say it's not their fault that they didn't know.  there isn't much more perplext could've done to get anyone's attention.
no, martin, i do not read every update of every kickstarter i've backed. i would not have a life if i did.
arrived today in brisbane, australia. halfway through playing them all - favourites so far dig, gym, orc.  spy proved a little fiddly for smaller hands to get to grips with, but looks good for bigger players :)
mine arrived today. the bonus game looks really good. looking forward to trying them all out.
@chris have you considered making any solitaire games in this (pack o game) format?
all i had to do was post here and they arrived today. :)
arrived today in massachusetts. they are so tiny! my roommate who doesn't even play games was squealing over their tininess along with me.
these games are so small.... im going to lose them for sure
my copy arrived today. i had a lot of fun playing dig with my girls. chris, a thought fur future development. if you were to release deluxe versions of these games with tiles instead of cards, i would buy it in a heartbeat. i'm guessing it would be the size of a deck of cards.
got mine!!
any idea how these are shipping or where they are shipping from? i'm in massachusetts and my usps app still hasn't reported any packages coming to me. only package i see is a shipping label that was created (in medford, or) on october 15th, but usps is still awaiting the package.
still nothing in atlanta. slightly worrisome as my packages have been known to go missing for up to 3 months thanks to usps (who i assume is the carrier of these). a tracking number would've really helped me keep an eye on the mail carriers versus the sender.
delivered to rhode island yesterday. they look so great. can't wait to play them!
urutsini, do you not read the updates?  it's in the second paragraph of update 21.
i didn't know i wasn't supposed to say anything about [redacted]. wasn't exactly my fault and should have noted something in the parcel or on the shrink wrap.
well that was quick. thanks for offering the replacement!
played 3 titles today and found that dig came with a bent card. it isn't a huge deal, but will replacements be available?
btw, i made a shelf organizer for these games, including an information-index on the front: https://twitter.com/rev_pee_kitty/status/843151150119567362
no shipping notification at all for me, no. just received mine yesterday in chattanooga, tn.
nothing in tucson, az.  did any of you get email/shipping/notification beforehand or did it just show up in your mailbox?
question on rules. spy: once flipped does the card still count for moves and numbers or is it now skipped? rum: if some one has a captain card for 3 then another player plays a rum trio and a rum from the double side of a card (4 cards) do they take the captain card for 5 (3+2) or 6(4+2) also same question for a rum trio when the card is at 2 is it 4 or 5? thanks
received mine in orange, texas today. looks great!
got mine in the mail in the seattle area today.  i haven't played any of them yet, but i'm very excited to!
evan- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sixty-six_(card_game)
received mine today, both set 1 and set 2 plus the bonus games. minor thing the bonus games not being numbered is ok, but they could have had letters or thing. i did say they were minor. my cases are black, and they're very nice... wish i'd ordered another one, since with the two bonus games they don't all fit into the two cases i have. can't wait to give these a try.
just got mine in mail from fl.   i received 2 copies of sow and not a copy of rum.  was hoping to play rum outta them all.  :(    hopefully this isn't a problem for everyone, and hope to hear from you soon.
:( still havnt got mine yet....i hope there isnt anything wrong with my shipping....
recieved the pack today (netherlands), happy to be able to play the games. however theres one problem. i recieved 2 copies of dig and no copy of spy. i would love to be able to play spy as well. i hope to hear from you.
also sometimes rewards are sent out by region by your backer number order.  so two people in the same city may receive them many days later.
i admit that i have no first hand knowledge.  my assumption is that processing the individual shipments takes many days therefore proximity to others is immaterial if one's package is processed for shipment a week after a neighbor.
received mine yesterday in indiana!!  everything looks great!  played a quick game of nut...very fun!  can't wait to try the others!!  thanks!!!
i am confused by the juxtaposition of these two statements by the project creator: "i saw that a backer in oxnard, ca received them. this backer is right next to the port in socal. the packages will then make their way via truck, cross country." "proximity of other backers having received theirs is not really a factor." so they're going across the usa in a truck... but some people all over the country have gotten theirs already, and some won't arrive for two more weeks, and proximity isn't a factor? i'm not worried, just surprised. i admit that i'm looking forward to these enough that after the first comment i was checking here every day.
in the uk, received mine this morning. orc box was a little squished, but no damage to the cards thankfully. the artwork and print quality is absolutely wonderful, can't wait to get playing!
got mine canberra, australia
got my copy today kansas city missouri
received mine today in seattle, wa. i am also eager to see a bgg entry for the mystery game. am also curious as to what justme is referring to in respect to the mystery game being "exactly the same game as one in every copy of hoyle's" and "that all the mystery and secrecy boils down to a generic card game." if anyone cares to elaborate, a direct pm would solve the secrecy issue.
"fyi" is actually a good name for a game in this range.. hidden information and all that ;-)
i received mine today in indiana. fyi, it did not show up on usps tracking until yesterday. it left frankfort (germany) on march 8 and came via new york on march 12.
just got mine :) lookin gooood
i just did a quick run through for each of the games, basically i just read all the rules and played through them a bit whilst doing so. these are my ranked first impressions (mystery game excluded of course): (most favourite) nut rum dig gym orc boo box sow spy (least favourite) what are yours? note: even the lowest ranked one is pretty good (i just dislike the memory element), the quality of the games and the art/components is great!
y'know, there wouldn't be this much worry and uncertainty if backers were sent shipping emails with tracking numbers . . .
received mine in the mail today in ohio, usa. everything looks good. thanks!
i just received my reward today here in san diego, california.  received everything except my 2nd pod which might be coming separately.  just sent you a ks message about this.  looking forward to playing the games.
for those still waiting and concerned, there isn't cause for alarm until april 1. as mentioned in the update, it is normal to take 3, even 4 weeks. proximity of other backers having received theirs is not really a factor.  thanks for your continued patience.
have to admit being a little disappointed by all the secrecy behind the mystery game only to find out that it's exactly the same game as one in every copy of hoyle's (no spoilers for those who want to keep it a surprise).  granted it's a good card game (one my spouse and i play a fair bit), but disappointed that all the mystery and secrecy boils down to a generic card game.
still waiting for mine in the uk... :d :s :d
arrived safely in the u.k.  which one should i play first?
wonder how long i should wait before being concerned, given that packages have arrived at other oregon locations days ago...
arrived yesterday in sw ohio. now i have a week to learn them all for my next games meet-up
everything showed up tonight, for my birthday, in the mail. very excited to get to try them all out.
just arrived in the post safe and sound to melbourne australia, looks amazing.
nm. i just found my answer way down in the thread (usps). i'll see if i can find some sort of tracking info. sorry for the noise.
for those in u.s., how are they being shipped (usps, ups, etc.)? i live in seattle and haven't received mine yet :-(. given some of the comments from those on the west coast, seems like maybe i should have.
arrived yesterday in japan. did not check the full content yet, but so far everything is looking good ! also found that, by puting games sideway, you can fit 9 games in the pod, hence all 18 games in the two pods, which is awesome :)
package arrived in victoria, australia. i knew they were small, having seen the first set at gen con a few years ago, however, i was still shocked at how compact the sets in the neoprene case are. truly pocket sized! looking forward to playing each and every one of them.
it arrived in tx, usa.  i should have gotten the carrying pod. =/
arrived today in midwest ohio, usa today. looks great, eager to play.
arrived yesterday in corvallis, oregon.  everything looks great, my wife and i played a game last night.  they will be going with me to a conference this weekend.  portable variety... gotta love it!  :-)
i received mine in oregon! looks great! woo!
received mine today in the netherlands!
i got my game today in finland! thanks!!
@chris handy, thanks for the messages. i hope you saw my replies? cheers.
still waiting ... hopefully it doesn't get stolen if the mailperson leaves it on the step or crushed if they actually put it through the slot.
the surprise game was "spoiled" for me on twitter, since ppl are posting pics of their games. hard not to notice the game i hadn't heard of before. i see it was mentioned in the comments here as well. i think the chances were always minute that everyone would keep the secret. oh well, i still know nothing about it, beyond the name, so there's that. looking forward to getting my games.
mine arrived in dallas, tx in great condition.
woohoo! mine arrived today in the netherlands! ;-)
it arrived (yesterday) !! wooo !
there are now spoilers beyond this point, so please be aware.  thanks.
to be honest for those of us who don't necessarily care about being "surprised" i wish someone would release information on the surprise game (marked clearly that way so as to preserve the surprise for those who do care).
@urutsini, woo is the surprise game of the pack, and perplext asked us not to reveal the surprise for those who had not received their pledge. so... no spoilers, please! (and that includes no info in bgg for a while) ;) by the way, received mine today in madrid, spain.
no bgg every for woo?
games received in ohio. unfortunately several are moderately to severely crushed. orc is so bad the tuck box top is split down the middle. hopefully the cards are okay inside.
got them. you hit it out of the park. awesome production. looking forward to many games.
erik and diego: nut and ??? rules videos will eventually be posted, likely in 2 months or so.  yes, ??? is actually fairly challenging...and i plan to post an update about that game, why i chose it, etc.  it's probably best to try a few games with the rules close by, and work through them slowly while playing.  i have found that the rules take some "practice" to understand them dynamics of the game, which can take several games.
got my games in ny!  they all look great, thank you!
just got my games in southern california.  the bad news is two of the games are pretty badly crushed.
very eager to receive mine in brazil! ps can't find rules for nut, pdf or video, anywhere. @chris? is there any?
i've got through 9 of the games and have pretty much got the rules down fine without any mistakes but i can really do with a playthrough video for ???. these style of games confuse me at the best of times and there is a lot of rules condensed into the rule sheet! ps. loving these new games!
just got mine in the uk. look really good, very pleased with quality.
haven't received mine in taiwan, a neighbor to china. is there a way to check to see if it's been delivered?
i should note that i did check the my usps site and it doesn't show anything for delivery or anything as having been shipped.
will the shipments have a tracking number? still nothing here, but it's obvious that shipments are actually going out as people have received them. i was hoping to get these prior to a flight this weekend, but it seems like it won't arrive in time. don't mind the wait but a little concerned since i can't follow it to make sure my post office isn't losing packages again. :(
received in chicago yesterday (sat. 3/11). haven't had a chance to play yet, only opened the package. everything looks awesome!
simon: that's the best thing i've heard all week!  makes 3 years of hard work and anxiety somehow worth it...
arrived in the uk and very happy! had a game of dig and loved it! :d
thanks very much chris. hoping pdfs appear later on. plus the two missing rulesheets for nut & ???.
erik: please visit packogame.com and look at the individual game pages. there are jpgs there.  you can also use the shortcut: packogame.com/"gametitle" danielle: i would estimate the games won't arrive in ma for another week or so.  please be patient. in the usa, i saw that a backer in oxnard, ca received them.  this backer is right next to the port in socal. the packages will then make their way via truck, cross country. thanks!
have not received in massachusetts. can we get an eta?
arrived in the uk. was not expecting a black pod! cool!
maybe i missed it but are there pdf rules on the interwebs somewhere? i have some for the 4 base games, 4 jpegs for stretch goal games, and no nut or ??? yet. i understand nut won't be retail so that's probably delayed and the secret game probably won't have a pdf until later to keep the surprise (although i know the name of it as someone posted a picture by mistake in excitement).
just got mine in the uk, wishing i'd ordered another pod for the last ls games but very impressed
just did an inventory check and all contents of the games are there in good condition. thanks!
fyi, for those in us, usps allows you to track things to your home address even if you don't have know the tracking number.  just have to create a my usps account which is free.  then on the dashboard it will show all scheduled deliveries to your address.  that is, once the transfer has taken place and it is in their system.  i can't vouch for how comprehensive it is but i have certainly used it for game shipments.
the games were not shipped dhl. laura made a mistake about the duty issue. however, some of you with 2 pods may, but so far there haven't been any. in the usa, the games will arrive via usps.  as you would expect, it's a smaller package.  we will not be send out tracking numbers to individual backers. please remember, it can take 3 weeks, maybe even more in remote areas.  your patience is appreciated.
just received in california. will be opening up each game very soon!
@ laura: dhl is never canada-friendly, no matter what they tell the companies. always expect to pay duty with them. :-(
... awaiting delivery.. and like others have said on here... the lack of tracking numbers is very unnerving.  my house very often has incorrect deliveries.. .sent to wrong house with similar address...etc..etc... i understand why it's not possible in this scenario.. and perhaps all will go well in the end... but it's that guessing game / waiting game on if it's yet to arrive or if there has been a problem. good luck to all with their own deliveries!
also got it in the netherlands by mail. looks good.
are we getting tracking numbers? and which company is delivery in the us? my area the delivery people are horrible so tracking number lets me know if its coming. they never try to deliver and never even leave a notice  at door they just write in computer they attempted delivery when they didn't. so i would love to have a tracking number when and or if it has shipped. thank you ���
so sorry, the duty was for another item. thanks for getting back to me anyway!
i won't get my hopes up too much, but it would be brilliant if this made landfall on the states by march 17th.  :-)  i'm going to a conference and the idea of being able to take this many games portably is awesome!  glad to hear folks are starting to receive these and am looking forward to it.
i received them too, in the netherlands. all in good shape. thanks!
gives me hope that i'll be seeing it soon here in oregon. surely we're closer to china than the uk is? ;-)
games arrived in u.k. today! thank you!
hi, just received a call from dhl that i have $21 and change to pay in taxes on this order before it gets delivered. the campaign said it was canada friendly... who do i contact for the reimbursement? thanks!
angus: great to hear!
got the games in hong kong on monday! the games look great!
will there be a tracking number sending to backers? i lives in hk but still no news in my mailbox. thanks.
whoop whoooop! thanks for the update ^__^
we will have an update tonight.
??
@jonathan it is eu friendly according to the campaign page...
didn't realize this project wasn't eu friendly (shipping directly from china). hope you'll be able to post an update soon.
it's nearly march, 3 months late, any update on what's going on?
thanks for the explanation. i hadn't understood those details.
jared: they are being mailed direct from china to backers.  the "retail" version will be coming by boat...and will likely be in retail stores in june. i'm still waiting to hear confirmation that the games have indeed arrived at the china warehouse.  once they are, addresses will be uploaded, and they will ship out immediately.  the shipping time is about 2 -3 weeks on average.  in the usa, and a few other areas...it's closer to 10 days.  i'll explain more in the next update, as soon as i can confirm that they are shipping out.  thanks for your patience.
when it is mentioned that they will be shipping does that just mean that the journey from china begins and it is going to be another 2 months in transit?  or is that when they are shipping to our houses?
@ chris - thanks for the info! i'm really excited to finally get these games!
the plan still the same with the shipping company getting these next week?
chomping at the bit
while we wait, can we get some cryptic hints or rules of play for the mystery game?
@ami of the first pack of games, perhaps tko can be played on an armrest but all the other games require some space; some as much as 12x12 (i'm thinking of gem, bus, hue and fly). hope that helps!
@ami i don't know about an armrest at the movie theater, but certainly at a restaurant, even on one of those small tables for two. i've played several of them at restaurants and it absolutely is a better way of spending time than on the phones.  i find shh to be maybe one of the better restaurant games to teach on the fly (incidentally, fly is another good one for it, ha) because everyone has experience with word games. bus and hue are others that i enjoy at a cafe or restaurant.
hey, quick question for those who got the first pack: i saw someone say that they've played while waiting for food to arrive at restaurants and i loved hearing that and it's essentially why i backed. while these games are small, do they all need a lot of space? are any of them playable using something as small as an arm rest at a cinema or theater? i just love the idea of having an alternative to tapping away mindlessly at a screen while waiting for things.
thank you for the updates. please could you advise what i need to do regarding change of delivery address including country: there is no longer any point in mine being delivered to the usa. i originally intended to collect while there (building in extra time on top of proposed schedule in case of delays) but that is now not feasible.
i do feel like it is reasonable to expect something for backing besides the game at a later date and more expensive price than retail, ben.  so, i can concur with you.  some combination of discount (which often ends up being the price anyway), early reception, and exclusives should be included in every project.
bryan : i'll be in the same situation and gave my new address to chris by private message, without any issue. i advise you to do the same.
re: backer surveys.  when i'd filled out the backer survey, in september, i was expecting to be receiving the games by christmas.  we are planning to move between the end of february and early march.  is there a way to update the backer survey to reflect our upcoming new address (we close on the house at the end of january)?

sorry...i was just confused. very excited to get them and i know that stuff is out of your hands. i don't blame creators, but i will tell you that i will back every roxley project because i have had santorini for over a month before retail, and i nearly through my copy of pursuit of happiness away when i received it in a damaged box after it was in stores from artipia and will never back them again. i know people can say we shouldn't feel entitled, but backers wrap up a lot emotionally in their choices and we want to feel part of the family that brings the project to life. i am nearing the end of my kickstarter patience and will be much more selective. that said i am still a firm believer in you as a designer chris and looking forward to it....just a bit jumpy from other disappointments.
ben: the "retail" games won't be shipping from the factory until late march.  also, we are currently out of distribution. thanks
did this update just imply that these games will be in stores before kickstarter's hands?
diego, the plastic versions you've seen are our homemade prototypes.  they're all what you see an any preview video (thus far).
thinking about the sleeves...i saw some games that had some kind of coating on the cards, kinda  plastic waterproofish. eager to discover what the secret game is like... makes me wonder if all the mystery building up will make me more judging towards the game
alex : i'll be in the same situation and gave my new address to chris by private message, without any issue. i advise you to do the same.
bgg's 20 most anticipated games of 2017 is now in the voting phase.  pack o game is included in the crowd-funded category.  at the moment, it has only 9 votes.  go here to vote: https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/220042/20-most-anticipated-board-games-2017-voting-open-2
hi chris - i just moved! is it too late to update my shipping address?
disappointed about the delay, but very glad for the transparency as opposed to radio silence.
getting excited for release... looking forward to giving these games a go. no issues here with the delay... production delays happen... not the first.. nor the last time a ks has this happen.  happy to be apart of making your product a real thing!  happy new year!
even if you could find sleeves, you well never get the cards back in their boxes.
i wonder if there are any sleeves that fit these cards? my first copy of lie was pretty worn out after playing it a lot on vacation.
we heard from the factory that we will be receiving the mass production copy samples in early jan, so we expect to be shipping in late jan.
@perplext do you have any further update on production?
such kind of delays do happen. dont let the haters bother you, chris! a lot of folks are cheerign of everything to be as perfect as it can and eager for playing the games as soon as they are able to arrive! wish you good holidays and waiting for more projects from you! cheers!
that's an estimate.  not a promise.  board game kickstarter projects often run into difficulty and a delay of a few months happens frequently.  not the worst delay i have experienced.
i was hoping for some holiday gaming...but understand waiting for a finished, superior product. carry on!
it says december 2016, but i doesn't matter, i can't wait to play my games.
i don't see anywhere that says they promised delivery at a specific date.  that would be foolish of them to do.
in light of the delay, this project has been added to the 20 most anticipated games of 2017. https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/217265/item/5041057#item5041057 thumb the entry to show you want it, and add a comment with any other categories it belongs in.
delays do happen, but since the first batch of games was so good i will more than willing to wait until they get it right. we are talking about their livelihood. if they send out inferior product to market it would give them a bad reputation.
why do people back kickstarter if they will get very angry about delays? most of my kickstarters have arrived late. i'm not going to stress out about this, especially when unexpected delays are to be expected. i know some publishers are better than others about estimated release dates; i don't care. expect delays.
i personally don't care about the stinking display box (its going in the trash as soon as this arrives). the orc "miss-print" doesn't bother me. the fact that you promised 2016 by x-mas delivery and now it won't arrive this year pisses me off! i get why you'd want it to be perfect, it just shouldn't affect everyone as most of us are not retail shops! i am not happy about this!
update:  "time to get excited" me: w0000000t!!!!!!!!!
address confirmed. you may send the rewards. ;-)
*you're ... should always proof read more than once...
@chris handy of perplext i know you guys are planning to ship soon and i have some money for the holidays and was wondering if there was a way i could buy any of the first set of games and have it all shipped together to save you some shipping effort and hopefully me some shipping cost... hell i just noticed your less than an hours drive! i'd totally be willing to drive and pick it up. i'll even throw in a sandwich or starbucks or something. adventure!
update please?
i don't see an option for survey
at the top of this page if you click on [view pledge] you will see a survey section that will show your answers.
i don't think we got our survey. is there a way to check?
i still did not get the survey,pls check that for me
is there anyway to have the survey resent if we didn't get it?
is there a way to change our survey answers?
i am running a gaming club at the middle school i teach at.  my students love the first set of the pack o games. thanks for such a great idea
@matthew i've always found that the cost is listed in the local currency of usd when i buy stuff from the usa. normally this isn't a huge deal as there isn't a large fluctuation between the value at purchase and shipping, but the gbp has dropped significantly recently.  i don't know what the rules are for value of goods, in this circumstance.
@phil/jurassic: wouldn't the value of the package be based on the price you paid for it, which would have been fixed at the end of the ks campaign?  if so, it might just be a matter of chris making sure to specify the cost in your currency, rather than us dollars, at the time of sale.  you might need to pull out your receipts to help out with that -- assuming this logic is legit, of course...
@phil the sheep - i definitely hear you. it's similar here in canada - anything valued at greater than $20 cad (~$15 usd, ~£12) is subject to taxes and duty fees when being imported into the country. so canada-friendly is definitely a necessity for me to back a campaign.
@jurassicmatt yes, but i'd rather they were aware of the problem so they can work out a more cost-effective solution (if it's a problem) - i suspect from the wording that they're working on the cost of the package being under the customs threshold.  i view kickstarter as supporting the company, as well as getting the product, so i don't want to see them get stung when reimbursing people - i don't know if you get the same (possibly not if projects ship from the usa) but unpaid customs charges are crippling over here and it will, most often, stop me backing a project if it's not eu friendly.
@phil the sheep - i wouldn't worry about it too much. that campaign was marked as "eu friendly", and under the "shipping" section that they would reimburse anyone that was charged for any vat/taxes/fees as a result of delivery.
"now, obviously" below, not "no, obviously"
for uk/eu shipments, are you shipping to a distribution centre within the uk/eu or direct to people?  if the latter, then you then you may want to check into the customs charges (certainly to the uk) as the gbp has dropped significantly, recently. in the uk the limit is £15 and when the campaign funded, i was charged £20.07 which is $20 + $10 shipping, so the product was £14.05p.  however, now $20 is about £15.30 which will probably incur customs charges and the problem isn't, in themselves, those (about £3), but it's the "admin" (i.e. free money) charges the couriers slap on top for "kindly" paying the customs charge for you - this is normally about £8 which works out to about $10.45 - so with the duty this could be about $14.45. no, obviously, i'm not asking you to falsify the customs declaration, but i don't want to see you stung with reimbursing people (i don't know if you will cover just the customs charge, or also the admin fee), so you may want to look at either:- - checking with the courier and pre-paying the customs charge so we don't get hit with th admin fee (i've done this before when buying from amazon usa) - checking what value you need to put on the package, and whether you can put it in gbp.  technically, the value of the product (without shipping) for me is £14.04 because that's what i paid for it at the time, not what they gbp equivalent of the dollar price is now - so if you can legitimately put that price in gbp as the customs declared value then it fall under the customs import duty threshold.
when do you expect the games to arrive in europe? i am asking because i am moving on 1st january and want to enter correct address in the survey. thanks!
got my survey just now!  woohoo!
am i the only one eager for updates and for the games to arrive? fcs, march will end before january begins!
@alex ya mint works does look good!  but the art sucks
while we wait for our sets, you guys might want to look at this cute game that scratches the same itch by being as big as a mint tin so you can bring it anywhere - http://kck.st/2bkh8tm (mint works).
surveys have not gone out yet.  thanks!
did i miss any surveys or address requests?
the art is great, i will be very confident with what i will receive from this campaign.
boo is ok, but i am much happier with sow. i understand the minimilist look, but that game would have been a tough sell to casual gamers with that art.  i still say orc made the most improvement in art. i am excited to have these and i look forward to teaching many people to play these games.
@roger,  for us to get the games in december they need to be printed long before then.  i believe that it usually takes about 4-6 weeks on a boat after production plus another month or so for delivery to backers.  so for a december delivery, they should be on a boat around october.  that should give us plenty of leeway for chinese new year.
if there is any delay to production, then we won't be receiving our orders until after february. chinese new year for 2017 is jan 28. but factories slow down production and even shut down 2 weeks before the date. the employees then come back about 2 weeks after the holiday and resume production. december delivery is always a scary thing.
right?  i can hardly wait for december!  it will be like getting a christmas present from my nine-months-ago self.  :)
man, 1 month of waiting from one to update to the other is killing me. so eager to have my games!
all games will be shipped from the same site, at the same time. thanks for your patience.
will my set 1 be expected to arrive earlier then set 2 or are you bundling together?
i was just thinking how perfect these games are for traveling. we're going too early this year to take them, but i have a sneaky suspicion that from next year on, they'll be a regular feature in our travel cases
@chris i'll have to wait until the december to find out the 18th game ? o.o oh cheese... so thrilled to find that out. also, great new artwork. are there more reworks scheduled? december, please come running!!
awesome feedback ben!  we're glad you're as excited as we are!
i was excited about getting these games mechanically, but it seems the art direction is really taking off in a positive way. i will confess to backing mostly because gem and shh looked so good to me and gym caught my eye, but since then this new art blows me away. i am a first day backer of all future pog!
jeffrey, yes, set 1 will be available at gen con.  and, we'll have prototypes of set 2 on display as well. see you there!
will it be possible to pick up the first packs at gencon this year?
looking forward to the july update :)
anyone able to send an "invite code" for tabletopia?
second @ben's comment! amazing artwork! loving the new look...getting more and more excited �
that orc art is phenominal!
waiting....  the struggle is real
@joe: hey joe!  the survey won't go out for another couple months, so as long as you reply with the correct address there, you'll be fine.  all the best!
hey chris, it's joe from cardboard architects podcast. i just moved to sf so my address changed. how do i go about getting that in your logs for shipping?
@ annemarie: sorry, these will be shipped together at once from our fulfillment house.  thanks for your patience.
@ diego carvalho barreto: the game will be a surprise until you open the package!
really excited about the project. wish december were closer to now! any guesses when the 18th game will be announced?
i was wondering if i could pay some shipping to get the pog set 1 from my reward tier earlier than december.  i'd love to get my hands on these games sooner!
@profplum: we will have an update in the next few days.  we just had a great weekend of testing and it went extremely well.  thanks for your patience.
so, how's it going guys?
@ sam williamson: yes, it'll be december.  thanks for your patience.
is december 2016 really when we can expect fulfillment? or is that a padded date in case of problems?
@raymond: 18 �
excited to have backed this one! only one from first pack i've played is lie and it was a blast. heard a lot of good things about some of the others too. now, to figure out how many games i'm actually getting as i backed for both packs ... lol!
you guys should do a pod mini that'll hold 2-3 pack-o-games
bien! enhorabuena! ya estoy deseando tenerlo en casa...
congratulations. the first group of games have been popular with my playgroup and i doubt these will be any less so.
congrats!!
congratulations!  the only drawback is having to wait for several months before they are in my hands.  in the mean time, though, i can play more with the pack o games 1.
wow! way to go, chris!
congrats!
congrats on the massively successful campaign!  the games looked good in the bgg gama video.  can't wait to see the sg games in action.
congrats on a great campaign!
thanks for the reply. the only hump for me is the pods themselves. i want all the games but no pods.
@ gem abed: we will not be using pledge manager. the survey will only allow extra pod cases to be added on (but pre-paid for).  thanks for your consideration.
i backed for a buck to ask a quick question. is it possible to increase my pledge amount in the pledge manager (assuming you use one)?
i'm backing at the $24 level. any chance i can order a second set as a gift for a friend?
i agree with @dustin.. ..does the set 1 games ship separately from the set 2 games? december is a long time to wait for ones that are already made.
@ daniel • board game circus: thanks daniel!  and glad to have you on board!
so when this campaign ends i'll be in the middle of my beauty sleep. i checked double that i am all set with the "all set". congrats to a successful campaign! — daniel
i have an earlybird pledge of $20. can i just add $10 to the pledge for a pod as an add on?
backed at the all level. wahoo! does the set 1 games ship separately from the set 2 games? december is a long time to wait for ones that are already made. just so looking forward to playing these great games on summer vacation!
two exclusives? which is the other one, beyond the surprise game?
@ chris: maybe ocd could be a game title.  ;)
@ sam oppenheim: sorry, but we are not shipping singles this round.
love set one. can i add extra copies of my favorite set 1 games and bundle with set 2 to save shipping?
nice work, chris! i love the games i have played so far and really looking forward to more.
@ jared mccomb: i'm likin' that ocd!!!  ;)
upgraded my $70 pledge to $72 so i can pay an even $4 for each game.  :p
upgraded my pledge so there's one 48hr. early bird slot up for grabs :-)
i'm still hoping for ??? personally.
at the end of the video, when the mosaic of games appears, there is a game called any that i don't see in either of the packogame sets. that must be the ks exclusive, i'm calling it now.
well, it's a mystery until some jerk posts a picture on social media or creates a bgg entry for it...
@docknock- nope. as someone who tests these games with chris on a regular basis, i can tell you that the mystery game is finished. it's just a really cool idea that you'll be getting this one game out of the whole bunch that will be a complete mystery until you receive the games in the mail.
so is the reason we don't know about the 10th game because it isn't finished yet?
@matt if you're happy to get 8 games and a carry case, but not 10 games and a carry case, then just donate the last two to a charity shop once they arrive. problem solved!
@ chris handy of perplext : had so much fun doing so :))))
great to see that we're now up to 10 games! i was going to order a second set as a gift, but they need to be colour-blind friendly. maybe pog set 3?... :-)
@matt - why would you want to carry around all 10 games? some are 2p only; some will wotk better with different players, etc. and being a deal breaker? seriously? you are getting 10 games and a carrying case for about 30$. just enjoy the good deal being offered for helping these games get produced!
so excited for 10 amazingly tiny games!
@ matt mamba: the pod holds 8 favorites.  thanks!
@ goforit: i appreciated your countdown to 100k!  ;)
now that there are 10 games in set 2, will the pod be made bigger to accommodate all 10? the pod not being able to fit all 10 games is a deal-breaker for me..
huzzahhhhhh! :)))))))
woohoo! final goal met! awesome! i can't wait to play with my complete pack o' games collection :d
way to go!
wahoo!  thanks, jessica.  :)
i upped my pledge for a second pod to put us over :d
and last stretch goal! hopefully we keep it now
$4!!!!
$89!
someone must have backed out - $128.  still, so close!
$88!!!
it's gunna happen!!! suspense is killing me...
$444 :)
@docknock ... yaye!
$575 now
$686 * dancing*
@creator will be able to add on to our pledge after the campaign ends (i can't afford set 1 right now). also, i agree with @paul, i would be more likely to add on set 1 without the pod.  i have to pay in canadian $$ so this nano game is really expensive with the pods.
almost 100k!  woo!!
@a mandible: that's not true. set 1 is not being offered at msrp. msrp is $6 / game. the difference between the set 2 + pod and the sets 1 & 2 + 2x pod pledge levels is $36. so $36 gets you 8 games and an additional pod. even discounting the pod, that's $4.50 / game, a 25% discount off msrp. the ks also clearly posts the cost of a pod at $10, putting the price of the 8 set 1 games at $26, or $3.25 / game. i get your statement that the publisher does not have to offer older products at ks prices and are free to offer them at msrp. i respect that. but the numbers clearly show that that is not what is happening here. set 1 is being offered at a discounted rate, it just so happens that it is not being offered in a manner which some backers find accessible. i do not like the set 1 offer because i do not like the pods, but others do not like it because they have early bird pledges and would have to give those up in order to pledge for set 1. the world isn't going to end if set 1 isn't made an addon, but there are several backers who have indicated that if it were an addon we would purchase it. if that doesn't make good business sense to the creator then they don't have to do it.
$929 *doing a dance* :)
the pod isn't the big expense with set 1. it's that set 1 is being offered at retail pricing (about $6 per game), not "help me get this printed" discount pricing.
yay, $979 to go with already 1188 fb likes
@paul i agree. i want the same. i went for the whole shebang at first, but it was just a little too much. i don't need the pods, and they're relatively expensive if you don't want them. so i dropped my old pledge and just went for pack 2 instead. the creator thought i had left.
@matt: it currently is not. i wish the creator would put an addon in for it, because i personally would like to be able to get set 1 without ordering one the pods, but alas it isn't meant to be.
is it possible to order set 1 through this kickstarter without having to change my pledge level?
@chris handy see? i'm still here ;)
sorry for that mini essay i swear it was shorter in my head...
the way this is going i wouldn't be surprised if we got to $100k in the next day, and that's not even with the 48 hour email reminder! i'm guessing this will end with easily $110k minimum! also to the backers who are concerned with the extra two games not fitting in the pod (since the retail version will only have 8 games this totally makes sense) i have the first pod and can say that it fits 8 games perfectly but can also just manage to fit one extra game very snug on the top if you try and it will still zip closed! so if you get both sets of games and pods (or, like me already have the games and pod from the first kickstarter) they will all fit in the two pods! all 18! just packing the two pods regularly then laying one of the two extra exclusive games on top of each pod makes for a perfect fit for all your pack o' games! :d hope that sways some people who still don't want the pod since without it there's no way i would still have kept track of all 8 of my games lol
$1,735 left before we get the $100k stretch goal mystery game!
i think 6 games are more than enough for rewards as stretch goals.
are we going to have another stretch goal after the 100k?
@goforit we will!!
four days remaining... will we unlock the last sg? *thinking & gazing in the blue sky*
$2,493 ... :)
$3,418 ... :)
the ks video for rum had me running in the other direction...what the heck is going on? the gama video just posted didn't make anything clearer. thankfully the rule sheet makes things pretty clear. still have a few questions, though: 1) still not sure what "the castaway clock's current valye should always face the shipwreck" means. having trouble picturing how 2d cards that face up face each other. 2) i assume your score at any given point is the total of the numbers at the right-side-up edge of the captain cards you currently control? 3) "as soon as the last card is taken from the shipwreck..."  this would only happen if the parrot is face-down on the beach, correct? seems like this might be a rare thing? maybe not even happening once in a game, if you're lucky? 4) not a question, but there's a typo next to the caption on the diagram at the bottom of the first column: this is the only place where you use "captain*s* cards).
here's an interview with chris handy that covers the main set of games in case anybody is curious. https://youtu.be/rt5f7iu89t0
actually you can get bigger eggs that fit a pog inside, just not the standard ones
@shanda: that's great to hear!  if only they were smaller, they could fit in to the plastic eggs!  ;) @ragrad: please check the faq.  thanks!
how do i pledge for two sets?
$4,717 ;)
we are so close...
i got hue, bus, and taj in my easter basket today! i'm hoping to get the 10 from this campaign in my christmas stocking this year. yay!
whoops! someone had second thoughts!  now $5265 to go.
now $5005!
$5,776
$6,753 :)
$8,300 :)
@paul: we think it is called any, because a game called any was shown at the end of the ks video. but maybe it was a ruse!!
@ erik downie: thanks erik, yes it was fixed a few weeks ago.  all the best!
i mentioned this on bgg but unsure if it was seen. in the orc rule sheet the card descriptions is wrong (as far as i can tell). shouldn't it say "2 orcs in 1 territory and 1 (not 2 as it currently says) in the other."?
i'm going to laugh if the 100k stretch goal game's three letter name is "???". congratulations, you unlocked ???!
kicktraq suggests this project is trending towards 124,000. if this forecast, and yes i know it's only a prediction, comes true, are there any further stretch goals beyond the mystery 100,000 one? are you going to dip into the best of pod one?
$10,300 :)
@jordan: i appreciate the concern. not every design lends itself to being color-blind friendly, especially in this format where card real estate is a premium. we run the games through the 2 color-blind filters in photoshop ("protanopia" and "deuteranopia") to see what colors may be trouble and try to tweak them.  in the case of rum, there are symbols on the bottles. but unfortunately, the other titles with heavy color will not have large symbols to aid this demographic.  thanks!
$11,803  :-)
it seems like a ton of these games are reliant on color. do you have any plans to make sure their designs include colorblind-friendly shapes. symbols to make it playable for everyone?
stinj there are also some benefits: - he is saving on the pod cost - he is shipping the games in the same package - he sells more to people who wouldn't buy the $70 package. and those people will obviously not pay retail either. making more money from those early birds.
$12,756 :)
in case you missed it, there was an interview on the live stream that the dicetower did at the gama trade show last week.  here is a link to the video at about 21 minutes in where the interview starts.  if you check probably later this week you should see a edited version of the interview with higher quality sound and two camera angles.  https://youtu.be/tgt1xdbpeyu…
we have $86, 978 at the moment.  so if the campaign sees a steady $54/hr then we will hit the $100k sg at the end.  i have no idea how to factor the 48hr reminder in, but that could change things up a lot.
additionally, selling retails games at a discount means we achieve the free stretch goal faster which means chris would probably lose even more profit.
$13,265 :)
a mandible, you're mistaken: set 1 + pod = $50 (on the website) set 2 + pod = $30 (kickstarter) total price for both if you buy them now would be $80 (or $76 if you got the early bird). no matter how you slice it, $70 is a discount. it's just that he's already kickstarted set 1. there is no benefit for chris to offer kickstarter prices for the previous set again now that it is in retail.
same thing. i'm an early backer and really would like to have the option of adding the set 1 "games only" as an add-on without having to switch from 20 to 70$.
friends, if you look at the perplext website, you'll see that the price available here ($50 for all of set 1 plus a pod) is also available there, and the pod is not the main cost-- without the pod, those games are $48 ($6 each). the $70 pledge level for this campaign isn't a kickstarter bargain price for all the games. it's a ks price for the current set, which is actually being kickstarted, and a normal-ish retail price for the rest, which are a normal-ish retail product.
@brett yes, i asked the same thing here and in private message. i have no interest in the pods either but very sad i cannot add the first set (without pods) to my pledge...
$15,344 to go ... :)
$15,344 to go ... :)
set one games rock. i also like the pod!!  :-)
agreed. as others have already said, i got in at the $20 early bird price, but have no interest in the pods, so upping to $70 to get set one as well, isn't that enticing. however, if i could do a $20 to $24 addon to also get the 8 set one games, i would seriously consider it (even though i already own bus).  though i completely understand if you don't want to do this b/c it would make fulfillment a bit too messy.
hey everyone! check out this interview i did with chris over on all us geeks about this newest pack o game. excited to get my own pack o games! http://www.allusgeeks.com/2016/03/the-game-of-crowd-funding-chris-handy-interview-02-25-2016/
like others below. i'm an early backer and really would like to have the option of adding the set 1 "games only"  as an add-on without having to switch from 20 to 70$.
at the rate we are going, we might hit 100k at the 48 hour mark, so it sure would be great if there was a final sg to hit once the pledges start rolling in.  11 games makes that extra $10 for an extra pod more attractive, too.
yep, let's hope we can get that sg unlocked sooner.
$16,834 to reach the big sg.
i' m an early backer and really looking into adding the set 1 as a add-on without having to switch from 20 to 70$ since i don't really need the pods!
would love the option of getting set 1 without the pod. that'll help the campaign and reaching the sg too!
1000 facebook likes ------ check!
any chance that there will be a way to get the original set without having to buy another carrying pack? i wouldn't mind getting the original set, looks like there are some good games in there, but i'm not sure if i want any of the carrying packs, let alone two of them. one at most, so i can decide the 8 i want to bring with me.
we have reached the "1000 likes" portion of the surprise pack o game stretch goal!  incredible support backers!
@teshia - try reading the faq at the bottom of the campaign page before you post.  and in regards to stretch goals, $100k is our next goal and if we exceed that, they have teased that there will be more.
only 7 more facebook likes to reach the 1000 threshold.
no more sg? i think the next sg can be upgraded components like better quality cards, box, pods etc.
80k! fantastic backers!
the draw for me of these games is i can easily fit the individual boxes in and around other packed items on trips.
@lauren, yes; the $10 is just for a pod.  nice going on the $70 level; that's what i did also. @docknock, you could likely pick up a car stereo removable faceplate case to accomplish your goal.
what i really want is a case that can fit one or two games alone that fits in my pocket because my cardboard box is getting worn.
@nick and @brad, that $10 add-on is for the pod case, not the games...right? i've been immensely tempted by these games at cons before, so it was a no-brainer to back at the $70 level. :d
i'd definitely keep the four original games - gym, rum, sow, and orc. the pack should include at least one level 1 game, so dig would be in too. nut and boo have to be included, so that leaves box and spy to fight it out for the last spot. i think box rounds out the collection nicely, so spy gets left at home.
since i'm getting both sets and pods, my 'leave it at home game' might be hue or box since they appear to scratch the same itch.
nice idea to engage the backers in commication. haven't gone for the pod, but if i had, i reckon box, or boo would be the odd one out, or the one when they all rolled over, fell out!
how about a quiz while we wait for the $100,000 goal? if you had only one pod and could only take eight of the nine great games in this pack on a trip, which one would miss out? it's difficult to choose, and it's also a bit hard to say without knowing as much about some of the stretch games as we do about others, but i might say box, because it seems a bit themeless and i love me some themes (although the same could be said for hue from the first pack, which a lot of people liked). the other contender for me might be spy.  what would you choose?
42 likes left for the facebook requirement
@ matt mamba: the pod holds 8 favorites.  thanks!
will 9 games fit the pod? and what if the 10th gets unlocked?
finally finished playing pog1 last sunday - i'd been having my '1st game' of each game with a special friend and we hadn't yet played bus. played 3x on sunday. twice with normal rules, once with 'challenging rules'. very interesting amount of screwage with the construction yard and plenty to think about. though there were 2 games from pack 1 i'm in no real rush to replay, i definitely feel i got my money's worth. and carrying them all is so easy - you can put them all in the 'airspace' of a larger game. if pog2 has a similar quality, i think this will be incredible value.
@nick, i hear that!  although, you can get the 1st generation pod for a $10 add-on.  see how easy it is for me to spend your money?
thanks brad, i hadn't seen that the set 1 games were available individually for $6 on the perplext website. now i might get a couple to complement the set 2 pack. it'll make it more difficult to choose 8 games for the pod for a long trip though!
@nick and alan; individual games can be purchased on perplext's website.  i think chris is bumping up against the content limitations of ks and the shipping costs may not be viable for adding individual games to the ks project.
i'd also love the idea of a mix 'n' match set or of the possibility of individual add-ons from the first set. but i can see that this might not be practical or profitable for the publishers.
heh, i see @karl frank suggested the same.  somehow i missed it when skimming the comments.
@chris: instead of putting all the info about the games on the main page, you might give shorter descriptions of each and then links to updates that describe them in more detail. also, i fully support the idea of being able to add on one or two of the games from the first set, if it doesn't complicate your fulfillment process too much.  i misplaced my copy of hue!
@creator: here's an idea for a stretch goal, allow add ons from the first pack-o-game. something as an in between for those like me who couldn't be convinced to get "all", but would still like the odd game or two from the first set. i'd get more games at, say $3-$4 each ( which would be allowing for shipping etc). if the shipping's too complex that way, the option to swap in a pack 1 game for a pack 2 game would be pretty awesome too. ( as awesome as 10+ games for $20 plus shipping is, i doubt that works out well for your production costs so probably not happening. if not extra stuff, extra choice is always nice)
you could move some of the full game desciptions into news updates maybe and link to them rather then having them on the main site.
@nick: thanks! but the ks system won't allow anymore content on the page. i had to delete the  "how to back" section and some other text to make room for nut. so, i'm not sure there will be additional info posted on the ks page, but rather on the perplext.com site.
thanks for the more detailed explanation of nut on the campaign page. it looks fun! looking forward to reading more about the other stretch games too.
@dreamitdoit - while i don't believe it was ever explicitly said, the $10k game as the final one of the campaign, it has been inferred.
yay!! 75k!
did i miss something? was it announced that there would be nothing between 75k and 100k?
yes! excited to see the mystery game at 100k. we can do this!
this is such an awesome kickstarter.  i always get so excited to see the stretch goals getting met. ahhh so excited to get this set.
huzzah! $75k stretch goal complete! awesome! :d let's get those likes rolling on the fb page now so we can get the final game ^_^
@ brent mair: glad to hear it brent!  thanks for the support.
i'm just loving these games! played sow for the first time last night and i was again amazed at the thoughtful gameplay. i'm very much looking forward to exploring what i have and playing the rest of these games! we recommend this kickstarter on our podcast (meeple nation) tomorrow.
i have a question about dig... i like the updated design, but was wondering if maybe it could be made colorblind-friendly by keeping the scents and colors matched (green scent always looking a specific way, etc)?  just a thought.  keep up the awesome work, guys!
really liking the new look for dig, and excited for the next stretch goal to be unlocked!
dig's updated design looks great (on main page)! and next sg coming very soon \o/
i heard about pack o game from the podcast ding & dent. very happy i did. worth a listen! https://soundcloud.com/ding-dent/episode-14-pack-o-games-gordon-calleja
ye guys ... i should enjoy what we already have. so true. cheers to all of you.
2000 backers! another fantastic milestone. thank you to all backers.
sorry, was off by one-- 9 publicized games, plus "any". the point stands; lowering the stretch goal amount won't change the number of games, because i very much doubt there's another stretch game after the mysterious 100k game.
@a mandible: there are nine publicized games (gym, rum, sow, orc, nut, boo, box, spy, dig) and then there is the mysterious 10th game (the "another fun game") at $100k. @goforit: the "thousand likes on facebook" is an easy target. when the campaing will reach the $100k, the likes will arrive very quickly ;-)
@goforit: i strongly suspect that the 9 games we know about (the 8 already publicized, and the game "any" seen in the promo video) are all the games designed for this campaign. so whether that ninth game is unlocked at $75,001 or at $100,000 doesn't make much difference. relax and enjoy the 9 games and don't stress out about the exact staging of "stretch goal" events. (at current rates, this campaign may not reach $100k until the final 48-hour reminder email goes out, but at that point it should get there easily.)
they would require to have $100,000! that's a huge jump from 75k! + they require a thousand likes on facebook! that's just too much to ask for another sg!
does anyone have any idea what other games could come along?  anyone?
@goforit, i would expect it's likely the $100k exclusive ks game.
zoo!
@jessica: wiz? i am waiting for elf and owl :)
what's the sg after dig? can't wait to find out what & how much?
my friend said that you should make a wizard themed game.
@ nick leonard: great to hear! it's a good mix. dig is probably better and more unique than bus, as a "pick up and deliver" game.
great, thanks! really looking forward to getting this set and taking it on a very long trip next year. rum, orc, nut, boo and (potentially) dig are the ones that have jumped out at me so far.
@nick: yes, that's correct.
for dig, can we assume that there are two identical front sides of all scent cards so that players (dogs) won't know which of the two bones is on the reverse side?
$4k away from another game!!
@brad thanks.  i know but i figured more money here would just help out tho
@ brian chow: not yet. these likely won't be filmed, edited and posted until after the campaign. thanks!
are there videos for the stretch games? cant seem to find any beyond the base 4 on youtube
i like the updated design on the dig cards with the colorful scents replacing the dog nostrils.
@shadowbooth, you can purchase them right from perplext's website.
is anyone actually signed up for that tabletopia site where u can demo the starter games? seems like a rip off but if it works well i might get it
could we get an addon for individual games from the first set?
@pg don't know anything about your wife, but mine always makes sure we have our pod whenever we travel. makes a great thing to do during a hotel breakfast!
@chris ya i watched zee to a review on bus. looked like a solid game!
i think my wife will like these games. she's all about quick set up and quick play.
@pg bus is awesome! i was really impressed with how well he did a mini pick up and deliver.
i also have no facebook page or access.  sorry.
new to these games they look fun. bus is the game that attracted me to this series. being a bus driver thought it would be cool to have a game that matches what i do for a living. i am in for both set 1 and 2.
63k!  awesome progress!
i can't believe the facebook page is such a big deal. just like the page people! he's giving you a free game for it for crying out loud.
i'm all about helping creators, but don't have facebook so can't contribute to that part of the dual element sg.
@brett- if you really think ks should be about supporting the creators and not being selfish i would think liking their fb page would be a priority of yours to help them out vs. something you are "certainly not" doing due to personal reasons, but hey, as you said, it takes all kinds!
@marissa - lots of creators do great without exclusives, look at the campaign for scythe - didn't seem to struggle despite no exclusives.  i don't mind cosmetic upgrades for kickstarter backers - but a whole game? i dunno, if its a good game, i'd kinda like other people to be able to get their hands on a copy easily, whether they missed the kickstarter or not.  throw something in for free - no problem - restrict something from retail availability so backers feel "special"?  rubbish.  nevertheless, i'm backing this project despite it - i'm excited about these games and happy to support the creators (not to mention their availability is a bit rubbish in australia!).  that's what kickstarter should be, not selfish scrambling for exclusive collectables...  well imo anyway - you back whatever you want, for whatever reason you want, kickstarter is big enough for all kinds.
yehey we reached the sg!
ryan is correct. i didn't mean to imply that dig is similar in role to fly or tko, just that with its lower complexity it is very likely the most accessible of this set.
in address one aspect of steven said: as someone who has spent many hours playtesting these and other pog games with chris since the last campaign, i can assure you that dig is more than just providing a similar role to fly and tko. keep in mind that one of the goals that chris wanted with this set is to top the set 1 games in both depth and fun, so dig, while a level 1 game, is far from being similar in depth to fly and tko. dig is legitimately a great game in this set. it's a simple game to grasp, but there's a lot of depth and choices that matter in the long-term. that's what makes dig such a great game: it's approachable and playable for younger or casual players, but there's enough depth of strategy there to hang on its own merits with the other games in this set. judge not the game by its complexity level, these are all legit games that are worth having by themselves, let alone all together like this!!
i'm happy to see dig make the cut. it serves the same purpose that fly and tko did in the first set. generally, this second set is much more meaty than the first one was, so to me, dig is a welcome addition. with digs low complexity and accessibility for kids it should be welcomed by many, especially since there are already 8 other games to choose from. the fact that dig did not win the 3 voting events is probably more a matter of what it was up against than it was a rejection of it as a good choice. in the first vote it missed being picked by only 14 votes. besides, if the dig sg is met, we will be getting each game for $2.22 or $2.66  ($20 and $24 pledges)! i doubt you will find any game that sells for that amount that is better than dig will most likely be. actually, i'm not sure you could find any game that sells in this range...period. whether you like every game that chris and his team have created, it is hard to argue that you aren't receiving incredible value for your money, including poor dig or not. last but not least, we backers have been able to pick 4 games so why not let chris pick one? if chris thinks enough of it to offer it, then i trust him that i will be happy with it once i've had an opportunity to play it.
my kids will be happy to see that dig is finally getting its due! that was the one they were most excited about! dad wants to play gym personally, if only to wax nostalgic about having to be in the actual gym...
@a mandible a lot of people voted for dig, but more voted for the competing game then and there. anyway, if chris is looking for ideas for the next batch, please tell us because we can probably come up with some combos for you :)
"nobody voted for dig... so it's your next stretch goal!" hmm...
@kate - add 10 on your pledge and indicate it's for a pod in the survey. source - a little down the thread.
kate: please see the faq.  there's a reward level for including the pod, and the survey will ask if you want to add one as well.  thanks!
how can we add on a pod?
dig deep! let's unlock it!
we want dig...we want dig...we want dig!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
hooray!
@ brian's got game -   we are on the same page -   we  need   more  people to  jump on board.
i am feeling bad for the under "dog" -  if there is another vote i  am going  with dig.
so close!!!! i don't care what the new one is this time. i'm voting for dig!
so excited for the next sg to unlock! yehey!
only about $800 away from getting spy! can't wait to see what the next game for voting will be!
i like the fb page!
ks exclusives are one of the main reasons i back games here so i'm in and have liked the fb page!!
i'm in and would love to see spy, dig and "any other game" in the pack!
@brett b- how about you like their facebook page because it's a great way to show support for creative people who put up a lot of time in their personal lives to provide you with fun, amazing experiences? @_@
@marissa: it's also one of the main reasons those of us far from the states bother to back things. without exclusives and extras we're much better off waiting for retail here in australia.
the hate towards ks exclusive stuff- which is one of the major draws and perks of crowd funding, totally baffles me. when it's something that majorly changes a game's gameplay and may alienate non backers that's one thing- but if the creators want to make one out of literally 17+ of their games exclusive to ks backers i see no problem with that whatsoever, especially if, as they stated, they will most likely have extra copies of it available for purchase from their website once all is said and done. exclusives are what got me into ks and crowd funding, same for a bunch of my friends, so you can rally for taking away exclusives but i'm pretty sure they aren't going anywhere given how insanely successful they've been to copious kickstarter campaigns, not to mention the creators have already said they don't intend to change their mind about it.
eh, i don't like exclusives so i'm certainly not going to like the facebook page, unless the backers reject the idea, creators will keep doing it.
https://www.facebook.com/perplextgames come on people!
57k!  we're keeping a great pace!
@andy nice find there. you're right! i'd give anything to find out more about it. i'm sure we will once the next game is unlocked!
@brad gilbert: thanks, i missed that info earlier.  bummer, but i'm sure that between set 1 and 2 there will be some relative duds i'll be ok with exiling from the bags :)
just a fun idea for a future set: a solitaire game called zen where the player tries to empty their hand to achieve enlightenment.
@mentatyp, it was answered earlier that the pod will only carry 8 games; so you'll have to choose your favorites to carry with you.
sorry, i'm not on facebook
yeah apparently i'm not being clear. i'm interested in the pod question though. i guess you might just have to put your favorite 8 in the pod? though that is assuming we open some more. this deduction game sounds cool.
@mentatyp he's talking about buying set 1 from perplext's website or amazon to play it sooner rather than much later.
@jared schulz: delivery is december 2016 for both pledge levels, so you have to wait until then for your shipment regardless of if you're in the $20 or $70 tier. @chris handy: if we unlock all the sg games will they all fit in the pod?  or will you be making a bigger pod for set 2?
like the perplext facebook page backers!! we have 1580 backers atm and only 448 likes on th fb page. we could already be half way to the goal if everyone just liked the page. milestone goal is a dual-goal of 1000 perplext facebook page likes and $100,000. this lofty goal will reward all backers with a kickstarter exclusive surprise pack o game, that will not be available in any other way. https://www.facebook.com/perplextgames
if i did the $70 pledge instead i would have to wait for the first set to ship rather than play now.
@jared - what do you mean wait? the earlybird pledge doesn't mean you get your stuff any earlier. if you want all the games, just go for it! hue, fly, and gem are tons of fun.
clever, @andy. i'm looking forward to that one!
yeah so if i decide i would want all of them, it would be cheaper to move from my early bird pledge to a $70 pledge.  though then i would have to wait.  yeah that is pretty much what i'm thinking on now.
i just watched the header video again and at the very end there is a screen with all the pack o games set in a grid. all of the games on there have already been introduced, except for one. any guesses what it is called?
@kyle: yes, and indicate that you want a pod in the survey.  thanks!
so, if im reading the campaign correctly, if im backed at the early bird level for 20 dollars, all i need to do is up it to 30 to also recieve a pod?
@michael: extremely likely
i'm in but really hoping these arrive before christmas. is that realistic?
@jared you can get them directly at the perplext website or on amazon i'm seeing many of them for $4.99. additional pods can be added for $10 extra it seems here on the ks.
i think there is a good chance we will unlock more games than will fit in one case.  wondering what the best way to pick up the first set is at this point.
both sets will ship together.  thanks!
@chris handy will both sets 1&2 ship together? or do you have stock of set 1 which will ship earlier?
well, we barreled past the final pledge total of the first campaign already. neat.
congrats on the new sg. i'm sure we'll reach the next one. :)
50k!!!  what a great milestone to reach! a special thanks to everyone who has backed so far. @brian: yes, it'll be on the survey.   @gadget: yes, and mentioned in the pod section, it can hold 8 of your favorites.
this looks great. one question, will the second pod hold more games or will it be capped at 8?
okay, previous comments answered my question.  i backed at the $20 early bird, but then decided to get the pod 2, but that early bird was expired.  now i know i can get the pod as a $10 add-on, right?  will that be part of the post campaign survey?
thank you for clarifying this in the current faq section description.  is it possible to get the set 1 pod if you have any left?
brooke is correct: pods (from set 2 - with the "2" logo on it).
@karl hedstrom i'm assuming "set 2" is referring to the fact that the pod is the one for this--the second--set of pack o' game, as opposed to the one for the first set. so, just one pod.
in your faq section you say that "you can buy additional pods (set 2) for $10 each."  so for a $10 add-on i get (2) pods?
@dreamitdoit you leave one at home or carry it separately.
i want to try out orc on tabletopia...anyone have an invite code? packogame put a copy there for people to try out, but you need an invite code to register.
so what happens when there are 9 games but a pod with only holds 8?
should have a pledge level with all the games but no pod
horray for the new sg achieved! :)
45k sg unlocked!!
this looks very cool. i ended up backing out of the original one because of the word and dexterity games (or very simple ones). this one looks more meaty :) now if only we could unlock some 5 or 6s on the complexity scale :)
tomorrow we'll meet our next goal!!
almost to 45k!
44k!  really fantastic!  you can help spread the word by sending folks to the ks with this link: http://www.packogame2.com let's keep up the momentum!
@chris handy - thank you for the swift reply. i hope we get reach the $100k sg then!
@mauii, i'm beginning to see why it's $70, it's really double of the $30 level, and there's a bit more shipping involved with twice the weight, i'm guessing. that said, we're quite accustomed to some sort of discount for buying in bulk, so i'm not sold, i'll stay on the $20 level for now. @creator thanks for the quick replies though :)
donald: sorry, no, just one set per backer. shipping and vat can be potential problems if we ship more than we are promising. thanks!
asked this before but didn't get an answer. if i pledge enough for two $70 level rewards will it come with stretch goals for each one? i would like to keep one set and gift another.
jason: they will be sent together.  thanks!
if i go with both sets, are they both being sent together in december or is there an option to get set 1 sent straight away so i can enjoy it earlier?
prof. plum: it is chosen and will not be a vote. we'll have a print run to satisfy the backer count. any extras may be sold at the perplext website, but they are not going to be in retail or at cons.  thanks!
im glad that the set 1+2 level isn't an early bird. sitting on a set 2 early bird but may upgrade later :-)
please add the possibility to buy also set1 without pods
do you already have a game picked out for the $100k sg?  or will it be put to a vote?
to order two sets, just open another kickstarter account (i have three) and order from there.  better do it quick before the early bird closes!
"could there be an add on for set 1?" same here. i'm not that much interested in the 2 pods available in the set 1+2 pledge, so an option would be great.
this comment has been removed by kickstarter.
you can't just double the price (and shipping) and fulfill as two separate orders for people who want multiple copies? seems like a shame to turn away potential profit.
could there be an add on for set 1?
sorry, no, just one set per backer. shipping and vat can be potential problems if we ship more than we are promising.  thanks!
almost the same question as jan,min-jeng: can we add multiple sets? i mean: can i add $20 (or $24) to my pledge to get 2 sets (or more) and what about shipping cost?
@chris:  so far i pledge $70, can i add extra $70 to get another "all"?
37k!!!  we're doing great!  noted the input on the 100k reward.
+1 sterling wright: i don't need exclusives. i prefer it if everyone can play everything. i know some people want exclusives as incentive to back but really, gaming with friends is the spirit, not to have rare stuff :-) – daniel
just reading through the project page and saw this under the milestone goal. "this lofty goal will reward all backers with a kickstarter exclusive surprise pack o game, that will not be available in any other way." i hope you reconsider making this unknown game a kickstarter exclusive and make it a timed exclusive (release to the general public a six months or a year after the backers get their copy or not until series 3).  i would hate to think that a possibly really good game gets stuck in limbo because of some kind of exclusivity notion.
and yes i agree with andy, i saw that little logo and got excited. still seems worth it at $35 but i was hoping for less.
@ryan: while i'm sure $70 is still a decent deal, compared to $20 it's far from ideal. add the $15 shipping and it quickly goes well outside the realm i'm willing to pay for a collection of tiny travel games. if it can't be done cheaper it's completely understandable, i'll be happy with the set 2 games (especially if we get the doggie game!). is there a chance of finding set 1 at retail maybe?
bit of a stretch to claim australia friendly shipping given we are just being lumped with the rest of world.
so great to see such enthusiasm for these great little games! and while we'd love to make all these games available in the ways you'd like, there are many considerations in production, fulfillment and retail that would make this prohibitive. thanks!
go boo! woo!
or perhaps an early bird option for the $70 tier as well? the current early bird tiers are a little too good to walk away from for the time being ( i'll settle for this but if i can get some set 1 games while i'm at it at a good price, why not)
first up, just wanted to say i like the variety i see. i've pledged for the early bird set 2. i'm in a similar position to mauii, except i'd like to pick and mix from set 1 and set 2. there's definitely some in set 2 i'd like to switch to set 1, just a personal theme preference. i understand perfectly if i'd need to pay a little extra for this option, just not as much as having to buy everything. ($70 tier)
@mauii- i think $70 is still a bang-up deal, even if you take the pods out of the equation. you're basically getting 14 (and most likely 18+ by the time the campaign is over at this rate!) games for $70, which is less than $5 a game. for early bird you are getting them at a lower rate per each game, but you're also not adding in the costs for shipping an additional set of games, so the $70 tag makes total sense to me. plus, if you look through this comment thread, many backers of set 1 said they regretted not getting the pod with their games, so i think the pods are more useful than they seem. ^_^
so i've backed the early bird set 2. don't have set 1 though, any chance of that being an add on? the $70 tier doesn't seem worth it compared to the early bird and not really caring for the pod thingies.
boo wins! now we need to get dig! :) chris, thanks for pack o game set 2. 1st pack always travel with me.
boo wins by a 6 votes margin! \o/
i'm in! getting 1st pack o games and second here.  :0) only played lie so far, but it was a lot of fun!
amazing progress we have here. i know we can hit the stretch goals! :) more stretch goals please? :p
go dig!
i hope boo makes it in!
34k!!!! awesome progress!  boo and dig are really close in the polls.  currently: boo: 49.7 vs. dig: 50.3
tabletopia is in closed beta, so the links to try don't actually work until you get an invite.
1000 backers!!!  woo hoo!  so glad to have you on board!  i'll be addressing some of the questions in the faq! still more than a day left to get in on the early bird, so please help spread the word and send folks to "www.packogame2.com"  thanks!
the first set is made with around 310gsm cardstock. if memory serves me, i believe they have linen finish on them as well. in the plays i have had with these as well as other cards games using a similar stock and finish, they have held up great.
@chris: same question as syaoran's,  are these card made with thick high cardboard or plastics? and can i back multiple copies by adding value to my pledge?
i would be in the market for two complete sets but would need to know if this would also include two sets of stretch goals. i'm currently at the $70 level but another complete set would make a perfect gift for someone that i know.
missed this the first time around and have been staring at set 1 on your website for months! really excited! is there any chance for those of us who have 'caught up' by getting set 1 as well that these could be sent out early? would be great for my holiday in october!
i'm really excited about these. ended up getting all of them, also from the last time. these look like great fillers! i was wondering the same as blodhemn. any chance of getting all the games without the pods?
@blodhemn +1
i kicked my self for not getting the pod for 1, corrected now
is it possible to add an extra pledge level for just the two sets without the 2 pod's? or make a bare set 1 add-on?
-@brett: that was me  ;d as soon as i saw the mail, i hurried.
i would like to know the quality of these cards, are these card made with thick high cardboard or plastics for it's durability game play and keeping from scratches and wear an tear on term playing?
shh, i bought these during one of my classes.  we were playing shh at the time (an if you finish your english assignment early option).
looking forward to seeing a new stretch goal tomorrow. perhaps any will be up for a vote? :)
when will we see next stretch?
it's looking like nut, with 223 voters so far and (nut 56% and boo 43%)
set 1 was the first kickstarter i ever backed. i'm happy to be able to back a second set! congrats guys and gals! on a side note, i just voted for one of the games in the poll. they both looked fun....will the other game be made available in some way? they were both cute!
great to have you 2 on board! there are no plans to have add-on singles.  though, you can get any of them now at www.packogame.com thanks!
any chance set 1 games available individually as add ons?
i love bus and hue, and will get round 2 to support these type of games!
very excited to be a part of the 2nd round.  missed the 1st one so i'm all in.
chris, this looks so neat! i hadn't heard about the original set, so i figured i'd back you for the lot! i'm looking forward to learning about the other games you've got up your sleeve. best wishes for a super-successful campaign!
congrats on funding!  thanks for making the pod much more reasonably priced this time around. i passed on the pod for the first ks because of the price tag, but this pod is reasonable, so you get more of my money :-).  good luck with the campaign.
marissa, glad you're back!  nut is looking like the favorite for now....but, boo will push to the next vote if it doesn't make it on this round.
jumping on the "how can i get a series 1 pod" bandwagon!  i just discovered the first series of these games at a local-ish game shop this weekend - picked up two there, and the other 6 on amazon earlier this week!  would love to get a series 1 pod to keep them in to go with the series 2 pod i'll be getting here!
pods: these are limited now, and our obligation will be to the "all tier" backers.  so, i'll have more information later in the ks about whether they can be sold as an add on.  thanks!
congrats on such fast funding! this set of games looks just as fun, if not more so, than the last! i was sad we didn't unlock boo as the final game for the last campaign so i'm thrilled it's one of the first options to unlock for this one ^_^ @fwfr - the "all" tier gives you set 1 and set 2 as well as both pods, so i think that would be ideal for you! unless you are talking about add ons for even more sets, then i'm not sure!
congrat!!  now that is impressive.  any chance that set 1 could be added, at cost of course, when ordering.   ditto on pods -- where else can the kids carry them around in.
just posted an update!  i'm really overwhelmed by the support, and am super excited that this set is going to happen.  please take a second and vote, and help spread the word...  thanks! vote here: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/22003786#22003786
pog 2, wow! just have to back this, based on pog 1 being such a hit in my family.
congrats.
well that was amazing! funded in like 8 hours, right? as much as both the first and second days of the last campaign combined!
i am in for your 2nd project in the level that includes the pod.  i didn't get it in your first project and afterwards  i wish that i had.  like @ricbret i am interested in what and add-on pod would be for my first set of your games.  thanks!
will there be an option to add an additional pod?  my family loved the first set of games, so i am back for more.
gym especially looks awesome!
please add additional pods as an add on!  how about buying single games from the first set?  i'm missing a copy of hue to complete my set!
cannot wait!! i want alllll the games!!! come on december!
is the plan to have 4 stretch games like the first campaign?  really looking forward to these games.  i also want to suggest to anybody considering it to get the pod.  it is so convenient and keeps these games from getting lost.
i can't express how excited i was for this kickstarter to begin :) i missed the last one :(
*high five*
whoa! 10k in under 2 hours! (we don't have that many stretch games ready to go...)  :)  tremendous support!  let's keep it up and spread the word!
great momentum!!!  so excited!  thanks for so much support and so early.  you're going to love this batch.
i was late to the table for set 1, but this was an insta-back for set 2. let's do this thing!
for those on the fence about what level to back at, you are definitely going to want to get a pod. makes it so easy to throw pog in a bag or suitcase and have a ton of gaming goodness with you.
yassssssss. i've been waiting for this campaign since aug 2014!
it's good to be back!  let's get both boo and nut this time!
instant backing games and pod. same as last time. let's get this funded and get even more games like last time!
an insta-back for me.  i haven't even read up on all the games yet, but the first set (and the campaign for it) was so congenial, and the price is so good, that i'm sure i'll be happy with this one too.
happy to support your campaign and best of luck!
amazing, chris! i'm very excited for this new set of games - the first one was great. best wishes on the campaign, from brazil!
woo! my 10 year old daughter is obsessed with gem and bus so these'll be a welcome addition to our collection!
hey chris! good to see this, backed without a second thought. i didn't go for the pod in the first kickstarter.  any chance of buying one separately or as an add-on for this kickstarter!
ugg...so close, thought i'd be backer number one (for the first time), but someone just beat me out.
