is it possible for me to use the other checkbox on the survey to add another item to my pledge?  thank you.
what a great idea, i'd love to get a few for me and some friends but that postage is a bit high for international orders. as they can fit on lots of containers, would you be able to offer an option (or add on amount) without the jar to cut down on general cost and postage?
i just backed this very good product idea. what about lids for the small and large container? to me they seem a logical addition to the product, for keeping the flu√Ød in the jar; e.g. in the fridge, on the move, preventing from drying out, spreading odor to other products, keeping bugs out etc.
this product is such a great idea. i used the waste not nut on my lotion and it worked beautifully. such a money saver if you use expensive lotion.
great question, beatriz! we have planned it so the early bird specials will be shipped out to international backers first, in the first half of november, to ensure they arrive well before the holiday season, around the first half of december.  we have taken shipping time into considerations and already have a special limited batch reserved expressly for this purpose, so there should be no delays other than any unforeseen postal hold ups and allowing one month for shipping will greatly reduce the likelihood of this.  please let me know if you have any other questions about waste not nut.  we love hearing from our backers! eve & vincent
just wanted to double check that international orders will arrive in time for the holiday season too. thank you for this great product!
