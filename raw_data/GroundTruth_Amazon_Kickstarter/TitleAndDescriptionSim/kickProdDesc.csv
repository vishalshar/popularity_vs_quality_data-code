The minimum amount of money we need for a printing is $4,000, which we're raising with this project.About Us We first created Cards Against Humanity for a New Years party with a huge group of awkward friends. The game was a big hit, and we've been working on it ever since. We offer Cards Against Humanity as a free print-at-home project on our website, http://www.CardsAgainstHumanity.com, where it has been downloaded and enjoyed thousands of times. Now, we're excited to sell Cards Against Humanity as it was always meant to be played - as a high-quality, professionally-produced, boxed product.Shipping Each set costs $15, but if you want us to ship it to you, you'll have to pledge $5 more ($10 international).

Up to 10 days of battery life. We're back on KickstarterThis is where it all started. Three years ago you supported our vision to make the world s first real smartwatch. The Kickstarter community and our early adopters believed in us before anyone else even knew we existed. You blew us away with your support and kicked off a worldwide movement!With your help, we set the bar very high: Your overwhelming support and feedback has shaped what Pebble is today. We re back on Kickstarter to give you - the community who cares the most - an opportunity to support our vision for wearables and get exclusive access to our newest product. Get more info at a glance...in color!At its heart, Pebble Time is an awesome watch. The new color e-paper display is easy to read and always-on, perfect for displaying incoming notifications and your favorite watchface. Compared with display technology like LCD or OLED, power consumption is minimized, enabling Pebble Time to achieve an industry-leading battery life of up to 7 days. Send a quick reply by dictation Pebble Time's new microphone lets you send voice replies to incoming notifications* or take short voice notes. We used the latest technology to maintain water resistance so you can swim or surf with Pebble Time (we do not, however, recommend talking underwater).*Sending voice replies works with most major Android apps including SMS, Hangouts, Gmail, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and hundreds more. For iOS users, voice replies are currently limited to Gmail notifications. We re working to enable voice replies for more apps. Pebble Time is 20% thinner than the original Pebble at just 9.5mm. Its ergonomic, curved design fits comfortably on either wrist and slides easily under dress shirts. Pebble Time and Pebble Time Steel is stylish and durable. The lens is crafted from scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass with a bezel made of stainless steel. Like our previous watches, it's water resistant - perfect for a run in the rain, water-balloon battle or a swim.People love to personalize their Pebble watches. We've included a soft silicone band with each Pebble Time and a fine leather band for Pebble Time Steel, but any standard 22mm watch band will fit. All new Pebble watch bands include a quick-release pin, letting you swap bands in under 10 seconds. Now it's super easy to find the perfect style for you! For DIYers, accessory makers and advanced customizers, we'll be publishing the 3D data you'll need to create amazing straps, covers and docks. Pebble Time comes in three colors: Black watch case and silicone band with black PVD stainless steel bezel White watch case and silicone band with silver PVD stainless steel bezel Red watch case and silicone band with black PVD stainless steel bezel Pebble Time Steel is available in three stainless steel finishes: Silver with a stone leather band Gunmetal black with a black leather band Gold with red leather band All Time Steels come with both a leather and matching metal band. Special Engraving for Kickstarter Backers All reward watches are engraved with Kickstarter Edition . For those who are backing Pebble on Kickstarter for the second time - thank you! Your Pebble Time watch will be engraved with something extra special. We've been making smartwatches for almost 7 years now. Our ultimate goal is to make Pebble an indispensable tool in your daily life by helping you accomplish more each and every day. While developing software for the original Pebble, we uncovered an important problem: apps are an inefficient way to interact with a smartwatch. As we increased functionality by adding more apps, our Pebbles clogged up. It became harder to quickly find the app we wanted. No one wants to manage another homescreen! To make Pebble infinitely more useful, we needed an expandable system for organizing information and interactions. Luckily, the answer was right up our sleeves.It turns out the best interface for any watch...is time! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 You already plan your day around time, so it makes sense for your Pebble to be organized around the same principle. Now your notifications, news, reminders and events are laid out chronologically instead of being trapped inside separate apps. With one click, see what s coming up next. Your timeline connects to calendars, alarms, and apps, organizing all kinds of relevant information along with quick actions. Similarly, recall the past. Scroll back in time to see that email you missed, your step count for the day or the score from the game last night. Your timeline takes an incredible amount of information and makes it super easy to access. This is the new app menu, featuring new app faces with glanceable content. With timeline we've also created a system that dynamically loads and caches apps as needed, letting you access as many apps as you need.As with all Pebble software, we ve built an open platform. You can allow apps and developers to add pins to your timeline, so you can keep track of things like upcoming events, sports, weather, traffic, travel plans, pizza specials and more. The Pebble operating system has been re-imagined with a new visual style. While all existing Pebble apps will still work great, we re inviting developers to upgrade their apps to support color. More details coming soon! Simplicity and focus, without compromise We ve added all these new features - color screen, microphone, slimmer design and timeline - without compromising what you love most about Pebble: Always-on, daylight readable screen with a great backlight Up to 7 day battery life (Time Steel battery life is up to 10 days) Use any standard 22mm watch band Water resistant and durable Tactile buttons for easy eyes-free clicking Silent vibrating alarms Step tracking with Misfit and Jawbone Language and international character support (Chinese coming soon!) Timeline will work on Pebble and Pebble Steel (exact date TBD) Works with iOS 8 on iPhone 4s and above Works with all Android 4.0+ phones including Samsung, HTC, Sony, LG, Google, Motorola, Xiaomi and more If you re already part of our community of backers, developers and, early adopters, that s fantastic! If not, we invite you to join those who have supported and guided our journey so far. It's pretty straightforward, just back this project!We pledge to do the absolute best we can at creating amazing products and supporting them for as long as possible. We ve gone out of our way to develop new features, release software updates and provide technical support for all Pebble owners. Check out our Amazon reviews or our Twitter's @Pebble and @PebbleHelp to get a taste. Developer communitySince the first Kickstarter campaign, developers have been an integral part of the Pebble community. We are very proud of the 26,000+ developers who have created over 6,500 apps and watchfaces for Pebble.Pebble Time greatly expands possibilities for wearable apps, building on top of the existing Pebble SDK and tools: Rich C SDK for apps and watchfaces running natively on the watch, even when the phone is disconnected Best in class online development environment: www.cloudpebble.net New emulator that can be used on CloudPebble or locally Rich set of APIs: accelerometer, compass, bluetooth messaging, background tasks, GPS and HTTP request, etc (NEW) Color APIs to support the 64 colors of the new Pebble Time screen (NEW) Support for PNG and APNG (NEW) Timeline APIs to push information from the web into the user s timeline (no watch or phone apps required) (NEW) UI framework to create beautiful applications that take advantage of color and animations (Later in 2015) Voice to text APIs: add voice recognition to your apps (Later in 2015) Smart accessory port for hardware hackers. (Later in 2015) Bluetooth Low Energy API. Use Pebble to control BLE-enabled objects.

5`If you missed our Kickstarter, you can pre-order an Oculus Rift developer kit now at http://oculusvr.com/preorder/!Hawken to Launch Oculus-ready 12.12.12! Game Critics Awards E3 2012, Best Hardware/Peripheral, Nominee "Rift could be the closest we've come to Star Trek's holodeck." - Gamespy ...the effect of using the Oculus Rift as you play is mind-blowing." - G4TV "...we found ourselves entirely absorbed; a gaming experience with a level of immersion genuinely unlike anything else we have ever encountered." - CVG Step inside your favorite game.Oculus Rift is a new virtual reality (VR) headset designed specifically for video games that will change the way you think about gaming forever. With an incredibly wide field of view, high resolution display, and ultra-low latency head tracking, the Rift provides a truly immersive experience that allows you to step inside your favorite game and explore new worlds like never before.We're here raising money on Kickstarter to build development kits of the Rift, so we can get them into the hands of developers faster. Kickstarter has proven to be an amazing platform for accelerating big and small ideas alike. We hope you share our excitement about virtual reality, the Rift, and the future of gaming. Designed for gamers, by gamers.The Rift takes 3D gaming to the next level. There are a number of VR headsets out there, but none that deliver a truly immersive gaming experience. Most products either lack the technical features required for believable immersion or sit at a very high price-point ($20,000+) reserved for the military or scientific community. We set out to change all that with the Rift, which is designed to maximize immersion, comfort, and pure, uninhibited fun, at a price everyone can afford. We re working with the best teams in the industry. "What I've got now, is, I honestly think the best VR demo probably the world has ever seen."John Carmack, id Software "Needless to say, I'm a believer... We're extremely excited here at Epic Games to get the Unreal Engine integrated with Oculus." Cliff Bleszinski, Design Director Epic Games "I think this will be the coolest way to experience games in the future. Simply that... that big."David Helgason, CEO Unity "I m really looking forward to getting a chance to program with it and see what we can do. Michael Abrash, Valve "It looks incredibly exciting, if anybody s going to tackle this set of hard problems, we think that Palmer s going to do it. So we d strongly encourage you to support this Kickstarter. Gabe Newell, President and Owner Valve Bundling DOOM 3 BFG with the RiftWe're including a copy of DOOM 3 BFG Edition, the first Oculus-ready game, with every Rift dev kit on Kickstarter. John Carmack showed DOOM 3 BFG at E3, stunning the press and creating incredible anticipation for the release. Virtual Reality Headset Amazes Users (MSNBC at E3) Join the development process and make your voice heard.We have plenty of Rift prototypes internally - A few are even out in the wild, in the hands of developers like John Carmack. But we want to make the Rift available to all game developers, today, so they can be part of the development process. Kickstarter makes that possible. Your voice will be critical to making the Rift hardware and software as great as they can be. The cutting edge of virtual reality hardware.Even though the consumer version of the Rift is still a ways down the road, the early developer kit s hardware design is cutting edge, with technical specifications above and beyond other consumer headset available today.Technical specs of the Dev Kit (subject to change)Head tracking: 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) ultra low latencyField of view: 110 degrees diagonal / 90 degrees horizontalResolution: 1280x800 (640x800 per eye)Inputs: DVI/HDMI and USBPlatforms: PC and mobileWeight: ~0.22 kilograms And we re confident we can make the consumer version even more impressive, all without increasing price or sacrificing an ounce of quality. The SDK makes integration easy.We re already hard at work on a robust Oculus SDK that developers can use to integrate the Rift with their new and existing games. Our team has built great SDKs before and we re excited to do it again. All of the Rift dev kits include access to the Oculus Developer Center, which provides the SDK, technical support, and serves as a community for Oculus developers.The SDK will include clean well-documented code, samples, and tutorials to make integration with any 3D game or application as easy as possible. We re also working on out-of-the-box engine integrations for Unreal Engine and Unity, so that anyone interested in working with the Rift, including indie developers, can get started right away! Oculus TeamThe Rift is developed by a team of industry veterans passionate about changing the way people experience video games forever. We ve tackled projects of similar scope: we ve designed and manufactured consumer hardware; we ve built well-adopted software development kits for the game industry; and now we re excited to build a product that can so radically change the way people play their favorite video games.Join us in the movement to take games to the next level!

Nearly 38 billion water bottles are discarded annually. Soma supports you in being part of the solution.
7`Hi! We're excited to introduce Simply Gum, the first all natural premium chewing gum. We came up with idea for Simply Gum after learning that the regular chewing gum you see on grocery store shelves is filled with artificial substances, including some of the same components used in the manufacture of car tires, and white glue, as well as artificial sweeteners like aspartame. Not exactly the stuff you'd want to throw in a mixing bowl!As we did more research, we found that consumers are kept in the dark about what they are chewing because conventional gum brands hide up to 80 synthetic ingredients in the catch-all term "gum base" on the label. And we soon discovered that although there are a few gums in the US market claiming to be "natural," none of them are actually 100% natural.So we set out to make a better chew. We decided to make a gum that was made from all natural ingredients. One that was better for our bodies and our planet. One that told the truth and made us feel better about ourselves for chewing it. After lots of experimenting and tinkering, we came up with a formula for an all-natural gum, using only six ingredients. No toxins, no synthetics, no hidden substances. At the Simply Gum kitchen in NYC, our gum chefs handcraft these ingredients into the highest quality gum available. Our commitment to you is that we will never put anything artificial in our chewing gum. And we will always be totally transparent. How does our gum taste? We're starting with a Cinnamon flavor. It's not synthetically sweet like most brands that use artificial sweeteners. And the flavor is extremely long lasting - much longer than regular gum. Our gum has a nice, soft texture that provides a wholesome chew. We think you're going to love it. Additional flavors will be introduced down the road. How does our gum look? Our gum is handcrafted right right here in NYC into the shape of little round balls. We don't use any artificial colors, so it's a natural light brown color, versus conventional gum, which comes in artificially colored medicinal tablets. We like to say our pieces look like little truffles! While we were at it, we also decided to make an amazing package, made of recycled paper. One that you will be proud to carry around and share. A prototype of our pack. A square that is roughly 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches We're asking for your help to re-invent chewing gum. We will use the money raised on kickstarter to make our first production batch of gum and to purchase our first round of packaging.Feel free to email us at info@simplygum.com with any questions and comments. We'd love to hear from you. Thank you! And Happy Chewing!

11`Hi! We're excited to introduce Simply Gum, the first all natural premium chewing gum. We came up with idea for Simply Gum after learning that the regular chewing gum you see on grocery store shelves is filled with artificial substances, including some of the same components used in the manufacture of car tires, and white glue, as well as artificial sweeteners like aspartame. Not exactly the stuff you'd want to throw in a mixing bowl!As we did more research, we found that consumers are kept in the dark about what they are chewing because conventional gum brands hide up to 80 synthetic ingredients in the catch-all term "gum base" on the label. And we soon discovered that although there are a few gums in the US market claiming to be "natural," none of them are actually 100% natural.So we set out to make a better chew. We decided to make a gum that was made from all natural ingredients. One that was better for our bodies and our planet. One that told the truth and made us feel better about ourselves for chewing it. After lots of experimenting and tinkering, we came up with a formula for an all-natural gum, using only six ingredients. No toxins, no synthetics, no hidden substances. At the Simply Gum kitchen in NYC, our gum chefs handcraft these ingredients into the highest quality gum available. Our commitment to you is that we will never put anything artificial in our chewing gum. And we will always be totally transparent. How does our gum taste? We're starting with a Cinnamon flavor. It's not synthetically sweet like most brands that use artificial sweeteners. And the flavor is extremely long lasting - much longer than regular gum. Our gum has a nice, soft texture that provides a wholesome chew. We think you're going to love it. Additional flavors will be introduced down the road. How does our gum look? Our gum is handcrafted right right here in NYC into the shape of little round balls. We don't use any artificial colors, so it's a natural light brown color, versus conventional gum, which comes in artificially colored medicinal tablets.

13`This Kickstarter campaign is now over thanks to everyone for such tremendous support! To download a free PDF, buy print copies, or anything else, please visit www.leannebrown.ca/cookbooks.This page is now frozen until the end of time, but to see what the page looked like while the Kickstarter campaign was still active, read on!-----Good and Cheap is a gorgeous cookbook for tight budgets. It's free online, but let's get it out to more people by funding a print run.You can already download a PDF for free on my website at www.leannebrown.ca/cookbooks. Thanks to the support of a bunch of awesome strangers on Reddit, on Tumblr, and elsewhere, it's been amazingly popular over 200,000 people have downloaded the draft version!But I want your help to fund printed copies so that we can get Good and Cheap into the hands of people who don't have computers or who wouldn't otherwise see it. The expensive part of printing books is the initial set-up; the cost of each additional copy is fairly low. The more books you buy, the more I can donate or sell at a massive discount to organizations that support low-income families on SNAP (the modern name for Food Stamps). What's the book like?Just download a free PDF and take a look for yourself! But since you asked, it's 132 pages (so far!) of beautifully designed and photographed recipes that fit into a $4/day budget without seeming like it. This is good food that happens to be inexpensive.If you downloaded the book when it first when viral, grab a new copy: the earlier version was just a draft, but the final version of Good and Cheap has been edited and redesigned throughout. What's your plan?I want this book to be as accessible as possible. That's why I've made it free online, and nearly 200,000 downloads to date proves there is both a willing audience and a need.My dream is that everyone who could benefit from this book would be able to get a copy, at whatever price they can afford. For many, that means keeping it free even in printed form.Because printed books cost money, a scheme was born: $25 buys one copy for you and a second copy that I'll donate to someone who needs it.Once I reach my goal, I'll approach organizations to figure out who to entrust with getting these books into the hands of low-income families and individuals. I hope to be able to work with a variety of organizations for the greatest reach. Where'd this come from?I created this cookbook as the capstone project for my master's degree in Food Studies at NYU. I wanted to make something that not only summed up the work I had done during my studies, but also had a useful life outside of academia.It bothered me that so many ideas for fixing the food system leave out the poor: it seemed like they didn't have a voice in the food movement. I wanted to create a resource that would promote the joy of cooking and show just how delicious and inspiring a cheap meal can be if you cook it yourself.Even though Food Stamps help millions of people across the United States every day, benefits were reduced in November despite rising food prices. It's more important than ever to make the most of what you have with savvy shopping techniques and skillful cooking. That's Good and Cheap. Stretch goals!If we reach $145,000:TWENTY-SEVEN THOUSAND COPIES TOTAL available to non-profits at $4 apiece, plus shipping (in addition to the 6,300+ donated copies so far).

14`Exploding Kittens is a highly strategic kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.The game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel). We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.So if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality. We think you'll love it as much as we do. Hugs and enchilada kisses, -Elan, Matt, and Shane. The Origin StoryExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called Bomb Squad and it wasn t any fun at all.Over the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is HELL YES .)We changed the name to "Exploding Kittens" and our little team was born. BUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.We struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.First, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs: But that felt too Angry Birds ish.Next, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible. In the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution. Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on. From there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens. HELP US BUILD THIS GAMEWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community. We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.So, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. With love and pork missiles,-The Exploding Kittens Team (Matt, Elan, and Shane) --------------------------------------------------------------------For more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.comFollow us: Facebook TwitterMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.

While NanoHolds may look like simple pieces of plastic, they are powerful and can hold hundreds of times their own weight. NanoHold material has microscopic suction "cups" on its surface. Because they use suction, NanoHolds stick without being sticky. NanoSuction does not leave a residue. Each NanoHold is engineered with 5 layers: NanoHolds have two sides, the top side with nanosuction (blue in the diagram) and the bottom side with adhesion (red in the diagram). The bottom side of each NanoHold holds tightly to your device. NanoHolds are shipped with a protective liner on both sides that must be removed to use the product. WHAT WILL NANOHOLDS STICK ON?

NanoHolds will not work on wet or oily surfaces or surfaces that are uneven, dirty, or porous. Certain chemicals or solvents can damage NanoHolds. Unsure of your surface or suction contact? Exercise caution before letting go of your device. What is the "NanoHold" Test"? Use the NanoHold Test to assess the suction contact with a slight pull on the device, like checking a suction cup for suction. The device should adhere tightly to and not come off of the surface. Do not let go of your device if it does not pass the NanoHold Test or if there is any doubt about whether there is sufficient suction to hold the device. Will NanoHold always work? Test your application. Make sure the condition of the NanoHold, the surface chosen, and the suction contact are sufficient to support the device for the amount of time you plan on NanoHold supporting the device. NanoHolds stick temporarily, and like all suction devices, the duration of suction cannot be predicted. Use NanoHolds responsibly and at your own risk. Be smart and enjoy your NanoHolds safely.

As well as Crowdreach How does BetterBack compare to other back support products? It actually works! Check out raw and honest reviews. The keystone to posture is actually your pelvis. BetterBack supports your low back (it feels like the most comfortable hug), but it's most important job is making sure your pelvis is stabilized. On a neutral pelvis, your spine rests in alignment and it stops slumping stress on your body that leads to the vast majority of back pain. It's a posture trainer so you're not stuck using it forever. Wearing BetterBack for just 15 minutes a day helps you improve your posture when you stand or sit without BetterBack. Which new in BetterBack Therapy (compared to BetterBack)?

(29.1.2014) Children's book Hello Ruby teaches 4 to 7 year olds how to code (28.1.2014) Book That Teaches Kids to Code raises 250k on Kickstarter (4.2.2014) Getting Girls Into Programming, One Children's Book At A Time (4.2.2014)The story Ruby is a small girl with a huge imagination. She stomps and stumbles around her own little world while her dad is traveling. On her adventures, Ruby makes friends with the lonely Snow Leopard, visits castles made of windows, and solves problems with the wise penguins. She bakes gingerbreads with the green robots and throws a garden party with... well, if you like to hear the rest of the story, I need your help.Ruby's world is an extension of the way I've learned to see technology. It goes far beyond the bits and bytes inside the computer. This is the story of what happens between the ones and zeros, before the arrays and the if/else statements. The book and workbook are aimed for four to seven year olds. I believe stories are the most formative force of our childhood. Everyone has a book that made the world seem beautiful and full of possibility. My book is about little Ruby. Ruby and her friends Why this matters?Code is the 21st century literacy and the need for people to speak the ABC of Programming is imminent. Our world is increasingly run by software and we need more diversity in the people who are building it.More importantly, writing software is about expression, creativity - and practical application. Our kids should learn to bend, join, break and combine code in a way it wasn't designed to. Just as they would with crayons and paper or wood and tools. I believe there's plenty to learn in programming logic and culture before showing children a single screen. Here's what I want to do Hello Ruby is a children's book that comes with an activity book. The two books teach the very foundations of technology through stories and activities that serve as a simple template for all future learning. The book and workbook are aimed for four to seven year olds. Why a storybook? We all have treasured childhood stories that have affected the way we see reality. Instead of only focusing on how applications are built or code is constructed, I want to tell about the architects, principles and personalities behind software. And I believe the best way to tell this story is through a book that will be read with children and parents at night, and live in the bookshelf for years to come.Hello Ruby will be a classic journey of discovery that teaches the readers about different people working together, how problems can be solved in small sequences and how remixing and sharing helps everyone.Illustrations are as important as the story. My book will be full of detail and whimsy, with cutaways and magical moments, a world where everything is not apparent at once. Hardcover book, 8 x 8 inches and 32 pages Traditional story of friendship, being different .. and technology. Why an activity book? The activity book teaches kids early programming skills. It s designed to be enjoyed by a kid alone, but can also be worked through with an adult. And best of all - the workbook is designed to be doodled, wrecked and drawn all over. The foundational knowledge structures, like sequences, variables, patterns, loops, lists, conditionals, operators and events. Taught through exercises of dot-to-dot, pairs, odd-one-out, all from Ruby's world. A sprinkle of software culture, by teaching them to abstract and modularise, work iteratively and incrementally as well as encouraging them to reuse and remix work. Creativity and DIY attitude. Tons of doodles, logic puzzles and even a foldable miniature laptop that allows the kid to peek inside a computer. The Budget The book will be hardcover, 8x8 inches and 32 pages. The activity book is 16 pages and paperback. To make the minimum order of 1000 copies, I need you. You'll get a lovely old-fashioned storybook that introduces Ruby and the other characters. In addition there will be a workbook with puzzles, exercises and additional materials for the parent to teach web literature for the little ones. I'm writing and illustrating all of this myself. Most of the funds will be production costs: printing the books and workbooks and hiring an editor. And you'll get to be a part of the journey of a first time author. Breakdown of budget Editor for spelling and storyline Purchase of fonts Book and workbook layout design Obtaining ISBN numbers, registration fees and costs associated with getting listed in online bookstores Production of the books Shipping Who am I?Prior to writing this book, I co-founded Rails Girls, a global non-profit teaching programming to tens of thousands of women in over 160 cities. I also worked at Codecademy as one of the first employees. I first got excited about programming when I was 13 years old and madly in love with Al Gore. However, it took me almost ten years to learn more than the basics, so beginners are close to my heart. I'm a Ruby Hero 2013 and the Digital Champion of Finland. See my talk at Heroku Waza 2013 on Ruby and a talk on girls & programming in Railsberry 2012. Tell me more about Ruby! Gladly. I've actually already drawn a few of her adventures here.Ruby is one of the best little girls I know. She has family all around the world. Her father is from Japan, but she has aunts and uncles and siblings and cousins everywhere. Ruby loves her family, wants to be helpful and make people around her happy. Sometimes Ruby is a little bossy. She says things like Get me the milk from the lowest shelf of the fridge and Combine two spoonfuls of cocoa with the milk . Ruby learns quickly. If you show her how to make her bed, she ll have no trouble doing it a hundred times over. And she s independent: Ruby doesn t like other people telling her how to clean her room, only what should be done, while she prefers to figure out the process herself. All the adults say Ruby is a sensible, nice kid. But sometimes she can be mischievous. If you re not very precise in ordering your chocolate, the kitchen might end up be flooding with hot cocoa. Ruby s favorite things in the world are her precious gems. The colorful, glittering gemstones are presents from all over the world. When Ruby closes her eyes the gems become magic and help her do things she never could have done alone. Ruby's friends are pretty mischievous too. Androids are messy. Snowleopard doesn't want to play with other kids. Penguins are booksmart but sometimes hard to understand. Oh, and the coolest thing about Ruby? She and her friends have their own secret language. Can you guess what happens when Ruby says: puts hip hip hooray *5In Ruby s world there are words that mean things and words that do things. And magic happens every day. Past updatesFri Jan 24, 2014Oh wow. What a day.You are amazing. During the first 24 hours of the campaign we surpassed $100k. I'm so excited to be able to work on Ruby's world with all of this overwhelming support.Every additional dollar will go towards building the magical world of Ruby. A larger budget means I can commit to making everything so much more better. Let s do this! Thank you so much for your support.Hugs,- Linda
18`COLLAR PERFECT: The Perfect Transforming Ironing Solution for the On-The-Go LifestyleCollar Perfect was formed with the vision to redefine the personal appearance in today's busy lifestyle. No longer does an individual need to spend hours laboring to iron their clothes. Today, we are a generation of on-the-go and convenient living. We don t have time to find an ironing board, track down an iron, and tear apart a shirt in frustration. Think of all the polo shirts sitting in the closet because the collars no longer stay flat, button up shirts that never flatten out, or pant creases you just don't have time to perfect. Until now, there seemed to be no simple solution to the centuries old problem of how to fix a wrinkly garment. Ironing Board Frustration We invented a new solution that forever ends the frustration of conventional ironing. Collar Perfect allows quick touch-ups in traditionally the hardest places to iron. Collars, pockets, between buttons, pant creases, and every thread in-between can now be pressed on the go. Collar Perfect speeds up the ironing process through spot treatments of the garment, and promises to remove frustrations around the ironing board. It is the only on-the-go, on-the-body solution, yet is versatile enough to transform itself for traditional ironing applications when needed. This patent-pending solution is the Perfect solution to iron out the wrinkles in your life.

The Perfect Solution While we continue to find endless ways to use Collar Perfect, here are a few to get you started. Shirt Collars Between Buttons Skirt Hems Shirt Pockets Pant Front Creases Conventional Ironing The Perfect Features Rotating Power Cord - perfect to provide improved user ability in detailing and ironing scenarios Support for 110V or 220V power requirements 5 Adjustable Temperature Settings - perfect for any temperature (Poly, Silk, Wool, Cotton, Denim, and Linen) Adjustable Wings - perfect for when you need more than a touch-up with conventional ironing Small, Light-Weight, and Compact - perfect for any situation Our Journey's Evolution We initially stepped out for our Journey in February of 2013 with the need to find a simple solution for wrinkled collars. Along our journey, we couldn't find the perfect solution that was simple enough to use and that actually solved our problem. So, we decided to make our own design. Early Concept Drawing We went through multiple concept design models and settled for the one that provided the best features and capabilities. We wanted something that would be quick and easy to use, and what we arrived at was the idea for Collar Perfect, a patent pending, simple ironing device that sits within the palm of your hand and doesn't need an ironing board. Early Prototype Drawing Originally, our journey was after something to just resolve issues for shirt collars. But then we found an opportunity to do more. We added an angled design to better fit along the flow of a collar. Next we streamlined the design to fit perfectly around buttons. Then we scaled the size to fit perfectly for pockets and other small spaces. Finally, we added the ability to transition the wings 90 degrees for when life demands more than touch-ups. Conventional Ironing Position Next Steps in Our JourneyWe have completed multiple patent-pending steps to safeguard our functionality and design. We have completed several prototypes and are ready to enter into our pre-production phases. With your support on Kickstarter, we will be able to complete our tooling expenses, manufacturing expenses, and cover the minimum order requirements from the manufacturer. Additionally, your support will allow us to complete the packaging, logistics, and shipping requirements to get Collar Perfect into your life as soon as possible. Projected Production Plan: Design Finalization (Aug. - Sept. 2014) We will complete the final prototype designs and improvements. Manufacturing Sourcing (Oct. Nov. 2014) We have selected an experienced partner to find the Perfect manufacturer that has proven experience and quality. Production & Packaging Qualification (Nov. - Dec. 2014) - Once a contract manufacturer is selected, we will need to validate the manufacturing process so that we can deliver the finished product within defined specifications and tolerances. This stage will also complete the packaging specification and perform a live shipment test to confirm packaging suitability. Kickstarter Order Production and Fulfillment (Dec. - Apr. 2015) - The manufacturer will produce the orders for our Kickstarter backers, complete UL rating certification, and perform quality control to ensure you receive the Perfect Collar Perfect. We will begin making shipments at the end of March through early April. Why Kickstarter and How You Can SupportWe are a small team with a Perfect vision. Kickstarter is amazing because it allows those who believe in what we are doing to help bring our dream to life by supporting our efforts. By backing the Collar Perfect project on Kickstarter, you enable us to put Collar Perfect in your hands first! With your help, we can make Collar Perfect a reality.

19`----------------Even though our Kickstarter project has ended but you can still pre-order an OmieBox at: http://www.omielife.com/shop/ We'd like to give a huge THANKS to all our amazing backers and we can't wait to start shipping all your OmieBoxes!---------------- A Simple Solution for Hot & Cold FoodOmieBox features a built-in vacuum insulated bowl, so you can store hot and cold food all in one lunchbox. Kids get one-third of their daily calories at lunch, so don t let your lunchbox limit what you feed them. It s all too easy to fall into a rut where you are rotating between PB&J, chicken nuggets and deli meat. Break Out of the Lunch Rut! OmieBox makes it easy to pack their favorite meals. Add healthy soups & pastas to your lunch repertoire so you can nourish their growing bodies. Our insulated bowl keeps food warm (or cold) until lunchtime, while the leak-proof compartments keep food separate and mess free. Lunches taste good and look good, so kids are more likely to eat it. Lunchtime is as Easy as 1-2-3 You can t always be there to open lids or clean up spills. But you won t need to when you use OmieBox! Our smart features will make lunchtime their favorite part of the day. No Setup RequiredOmieBox requires no setup, so kids spend more time eating, less time opening lids and laying out containers. Easy Open LidLittle hands have a hard time taking off tight lids, so we designed a special handle that's easy for kids to use. Wide and ShallowOur vacuum insulated bowl is wide and shallow, so kids can easily scoop out the food. Good Things Come in Small Packages Small, versatile and tough, OmieBox will be your child s trusty companion for years to come. Parent s Favorite HelperWe loaded OmieBox with smart features to make life a little easier for parents! Dishwasher safe 3 Leak-proof compartments Integrated handle (so you don't need to buy a separate lunch bag) Small footprint means less clutter in your kitchen In a Nutshell ColorsWe chose 3 playful color combinations to kick off our campaign. But we know purple and green (like the one featured in our photos) are also favorite colors for kids, so we re offering these color combinations as stretch goals. If you can help us hit minimum order quantities, we will be able to unlock these additional colors! Specifications Media Stretch GoalsWe've achieved our Kickstarter goal but we are still far from reaching our goal of helping every child eat healthier at school! By helping us unlock our stretch goals, you'll receive special perks that'll make your OmieBox even more delightful! Our Inspiration Moms and dad make, on average, 180 lunches per child each year. These super parents are on a mission to pack a variety of nutritious lunches. And it s no easy task. Much to their dismay these carefully crafted lunches come back uneaten or as a big heap of unidentifiable leftovers. Warm, unwrapped cheese sticks. Half-eaten mushy sandwiches. Squished strawberries that have drained into their child s back pack. There s nothing simple about a child s lunch. Which is exactly why we set out to design a lunchbox that protects all the hard work and love that mom and dad put in. So when your child opens their lunch, it s exactly as you intended it to be fun, healthy, and filled with love. Team Design EvolutionWhen we set our sights on designing a lunchbox that ll make a meaningful difference in people s lives, we knew we had our work cut out for us. We debated every single design detail at length, with multiple rounds of prototyping, testing, and re-designing. We went to schools to watch kids eat lunch and talked with dozens of parents about how they pack lunch. Every single millimeter of OmieBox was designed with care, so that we can (hopefully) make your lives just a little bit better. StatusWe ve completed the design and selected a highly skilled factory to help us bring OmieBox to market. Your pledge will help us pay for tooling and materials for our first order.

21`Hi, my name is Denny Tedesco and I m here on Kickstarter because I need your help to get my film The Wrecking Crew released for distribution. I started the film in 1996 when I looked like this: (17 years younger and 30 lbs lighter. That's me on the left!) Denny and his father, Tommy at first day of shooting in 1996 This is a documentary film about an elite group of studio session musicians in Los Angeles in the 1960 s who played on hits for the Beach Boys, Frank Sinatra, Nancy Sinatra, Sonny and Cher, Jan & Dean, The Monkees, Gary Lewis and the Playboys, Mamas and Papas, 5th Dimension, Tijuana Brass, Ricky Nelson, Elvis Presley, Johnny Rivers and Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and that s just a few! The amount of work in which they were involved was tremendous. These musicians have since become known as "The Wrecking Crew". Top: members of the Wrecking Crew recording with Phil Spector at Gold Star Studios. Left: Tommy Tedesco. Right: Joe Osborn. Bottom: Hal Blaine From "Be My Baby" to "California Girls;" "Strangers in the Night" and "Mrs. Robinson;" "You've Lost that Lovin' Feelin'" and "Up, Up and Away;""Viva Las Vegas" to "Mr. Tambourine Man," the group dubbed "The Wrecking Crew" played on all of them.For six years in a row, the Grammy Award for "Record of the Year" was recorded by Wrecking Crew members. Just look at this list! Herb Alpert & the Tijuana Brass in 1966 for "A Taste of Honey" Frank Sinatra in 1967 for "Strangers in the Night" The 5th Dimension in 1968 for "Up, Up and Away" Simon & Garfunkel in 1969 for "Mrs. Robinson" The 5th Dimension in 1970 for "Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In" and Simon & Garfunkel in 1971 for "Bridge Over Troubled Water" Photo: Beverly Hills screening, honoring Hal Blaine for 7 Grammy wins. Left to right- Denny Tedesco, Lou Adler, Jerry Moss, Hal Blaine, Herb Alpert. In 1996 my father, the guitarist Tommy Tedesco, was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I knew we didn t have much time with him so I started filming his story and that of the other session musicians of the 1960 s & 70 s.Unfortunately, my Dad passed away in 1997 without seeing a frame of the film, but I continued to film his friends and the artists of the day. The film includes wonderful interviews with Brian Wilson, Cher, Nancy Sinatra, Herb Alpert, Glen Campbell, Roger McGuinn, Gary Lewis, Dick Clark, Al Jardine, Peter Tork, Micky Dolenz, and Leon Russell and others.Why do I need Kickstarter?The story of these musicians cannot be told without the music. There s a lot of it and music costs money. I was told from the beginning, You won t get the labels and publishers to agree on favorable licensing fees." Well, you know what? I proved everybody wrong. I didn t give up. The record companies and publishers have been incredibly supportive and have agreed to extremely favorable terms. However, there are over 120 music cues in the film and that adds up to a huge amount of money, so I kept trying to raise the money to pay for the licensing while continuing to film interviews. By 2006, I had been shooting interviews for 10 years! My wife/producer Suzie was concerned we possibly had made the most expensive home movie ever, but I compare it to building your dream home. You have all the lumber, the best appliances, the best fixtures and an amazing view, yet until you build it, you don t have a home. So, we brought in the talented Editor/Producer, Claire Scanlon (who, by the way, won an Emmy this year for her outstanding work on The Office"). Claire and I worked together to finish the film and we were finally able to enter it into the film festival circuit in 2008. Our first screening in front of real people to whom we weren t related was at SXSW and it was an amazing experience. The film went on to play in over 50 festivals and win a dozen awards. The reviews were outstanding. However, the film still had a huge price tag for music licensing and was not picked up for distribution due to that high cost. It was a pretty bad year for everyone being that 2008 was the beginning of the recession. So, I kept on trying to raise the money to pay the licensing myself.In 2010, I realized the only way to get this film released was through donations. The International Documentary Association (IDA) became our fiscal sponsor. Over the last few years, we ve raised nearly $300K in donations to pay off labels, publishers and some of the stock footage, but we still need to pay a fee directly to the musicians through the AFM (American Federation of Musicians). This is called a re-use fee and is one bill I can t wait to pay. I m happy to be able to pay the musicians for the memories they gave us. These musicians are the reason I have stayed with this project for over 17 years. I want to finally give credit where credit is due.The money raised on Kickstarter will not only pay for the AFM costs, but also the last few song licenses, some stock footage licensing, an online edit (so I can add new footage) and the final mix. It s been a long road with many ups and downs. I ve had such a huge amount of support from the musicians, artists and fans. I want to tell their story to the world. It s a story that needs to be told. As Nancy Sinatra says, The musicians really are the unsung heroes of all these hit records, and it s time for the world to know who they are. Please, help me tell their story so music fans everywhere will know the truth behind the music. This film is not just for musicians. It s truly the soundtrack of your life. You ll never hear these songs the same way again. I have financed the film myself over the last 17 years by refinancing my house and maxing out my credit cards. And now, I m tapped out. My family has supported me in this endeavor, but we ve gone as far as we can, so now we re reaching out to Kickstarter for the finishing funds we need in order to get this film released to the world. Our Goal: The $250,000 we raise in this Kickstarter campaign will be used to pay the last licensing bills for the music and musicians. Once all the licensing is completely paid off, I will be able to sign a deal with a distribution company. My hope is to get a small limited run in theaters, but mainly this film will be available as a VOD, digital download and DVD. If in the unlikely event a distributor doesn t pick up this film, I will literally drive around the country myself and sell it out of the trunk of my car, but I really hope that won t be necessary!Please, check out the rewards we have to offer. Other than the film itself, there are T-shirts, bowling shirts, caps and Dickie jackets with the Wrecking Crew logo. We also have coffee mugs, bumper stickers and posters as well as signed memorabilia from Nancy Sinatra, Don Randi, Joe Osborn and Hal Blaine. I thank you for your support.

Here are a few pre-release interface examples. The original jamstik was well received in 2014, but we knew there were improvements we wanted to get into more users hands. We started by adding a hexaphonic magnetic pickup to give the jamstik+ a more realistic guitar feel with a higher resolution signal. Thanks to advancements with Bluetooth technology, we equipped the jamstik+ with wireless Bluetooth LE connectivity that works seamlessly with the latest BLE MIDI Protocol supported by Apple. The jamstik+ has real guitar strings and real frets just like the original, to best match the experience of putting your fingers on a guitar. And yes, the jamstik+ handles string bend and vibrato with improved dynamics. jamstk+ features We're reconnecting with you, our tribe of supporters, early adopters and music lovers because although we've accomplished a lot with the original jamstik over the past year, we're far from finished.

23`What's a go-comb?Go-combs are combs that fit right in your wallet like a credit card. Made from a variety of plastics and metals, they're durable, waterproof and work well in all hair types! Some even double as a mirror, for the ultimate grooming accessory. Who are go-combs for?It's pretty simple: if you have hair, you could use a go-comb. We have a variety of materials and styles to provide stylistic options for everyone, men, women, kids, pets, you name it! Whether you carry it with you every day, or use it when you need it (travel, beach, night out, etc.), you'll find it's a handy piece and a fun gift.Tell me more about the rewards.Below are some photos and descriptions of each reward level. If you have more questions, please don't hesitate to ask!Plastic go-comb The classic go-comb: waterproof, slightly flexible and durable plastic, works in all hair types. Choose from 1 of 3 styles through a survey at the end we'll offer styles for men and women, including the mirror go-comb (other two may differ from above). go-comb Designed by Julia Rothman: A Campaign Exclusive We've teamed up w/ talented illustrator Julia Rothman for an exclusive go-comb, only available through this campaign. This will be a plastic comb with her original design. Aqua Steel go-comb: A Campaign Exclusive Snag this bright Kickstarter-only go-comb.

We can help execute your vision, whether from a photo or sketch to technical drawing. Other RewardsThe rest are multiples of the above, so more for you or share the go-comb love!Why are you raising money?So far I've been able to run my go-comb production through laser cutting. This was a great way to test out the product and concept, without a lot of up front cost. Now that the interest in go-comb is growing, I need to bring manufacturing up a notch to meet the demand. Your support of go-comb will go toward two areas:Scalable ManufacturingI've done a lot of research and have found local manufacturers I want to partner with we've come up with a new process that will both bring costs down while improving quality. These processes require a significant up front investment, which is why I need to raise some funds.Personalization EquipmentOne thing I've learned (and love) is that people enjoy giving go-combs as gifts. Whether a stocking stuffer, a Father's day gift or groomsmen/bridesmaid set, personalized go-combs were really popular when I offered them. In order to offer personalized options again, I need to invest in my own laser cutter, which will allow me to fulfill personalized orders quickly and efficiently.Last but not least...I want to give a huge THANKS to everyone who contributed to building this campaign: my awesome friends who braved the camera, Andrew who lent us legit photo equipment and most importantly my husband Zack who shot and edited the video I love you!And here's an advanced thanks to anyone who decides to support the campaign or shares it with their friends. This will not happen without you!
24`The Smart Garden 9 is a meticulously designed, self-growing garden that revolutionizes how fresh food is grown. From crisp kale and spicy chilli to sweet strawberry and calming mint, this self-growing garden helps all plants thrive, automatically making sure they have the right amounts of water, light, oxygen, and nutrients. With healthy foods grown right on your windowsill, you can enjoy a higher quality of life 24/7. Most people don t have a backyard or the time to garden. But does this mean they should have to forgo quality for the spray-covered, fresh food supermarkets offer? We don't think so (and neither, we re betting, do you!) The Smart Garden comes in three colours. Our system is the easiest indoor gardening solution on the market, and it involves far less noise than the hydroponic systems. All you have to do is fill the water tank, plug the garden in and boom! - the Smart Garden 9 takes it from there. Using the garden is as easy as 1-2-3 With more than 7 years of R&D under our belts, we've spent a long time developing the backbone of our gardens: The Smart Soil. This 100% safe, nanotech material supplies plant roots with the right amount of oxygen, water and nutrients at all times. It's no regular soil, but a material that breathes with the plant and evenly disperses air and water mixture based on the plant's needs. Made of natural materials, the Smart Soil is biodegradable. The Click & Grow Smart Soil Our Smart Gardens are neither hydroponic nor aeroponic, but use a completely unique technology that grows food without using pesticides, herbicides or any other harmful substances. Faster growth without any harmful substances The single greatest lesson the garden teaches is that our relationship to the planet need not be zero-sum [we can] provide for ourselves without diminishing the world. -Michael PollanThis quote by the renowned journalist Michael Pollan hints at why so many things are wrong with today s food industry. Increasing urbanization has distanced us from nature and the knowledge of how to grow food sustainably. We at Click & Grow want to change this. Part of the Click & Grow team With our Smart Gardens, you can easily get back to growing your own food and stop buying into the waste (of energy, resources, harvests, and more) that defines corporate farming. The Smart Garden 9 is small enough to perfectly fit any apartment, yet big enough to transform the way you eat. Grow anything from tomatoes and parsley to trees and flowers with your Smart Garden 9. Mix and match the wide variety of plants we offer to find the combination that s right for you. Just a few of the available refills for the Smart Garden 9 Click & Grow is the only technology that reduces the moisture level in the root zone in a very controlled manner, and thereby uses water stress to increase bioactive compounds (antioxidants) in plants. By doing this, we've been able to raise the percentage of antioxidants in some of our plants by almost 600% that of store-bought alternatives. Keep in mind - this is done without using any chemicals or fertilisers! Our system is completely safe and clean. The Smart Garden 9 in Grey The antioxidants found in our plants, such as vitamin C, vitamin A and rosmarinic acid, are widely used in dietary supplements and have been shown to help prevent cancer, coronary heart disease, and even altitude sickness. Basically, the more antioxidants of different natural sources you consume, the better your health. The Smart Garden 9 in Grey Our technology is not only more sustainable than the current food production practices, but it also grows plants faster and helps them attain superior antioxidant levels. Instead of using the messy pumps, mixers, filters, nutrient applicators, etc. of other indoor gardening systems, we use simple materials and nanotechnology to help you get better results effortlessly. Get better results sustainably Drawing upon material and plant science, our technology optimizes plant's growth cycles by carefully monitoring the factors that affect their growth on a micro level. This means we can keep pH, aeration, moisture, and nutrition right where the plants need them to be without relying on the expensive mechanical control systems of hydroponics.THE SOIL. We've worked long and hard to create our Smart Soil, and thanks to this unique, patented nanomaterial, our Smart Gardens don t need expensive sensors, pumps and filtering systems. The Smart Soil THE WATERING. Our advanced watering system uses safe sensors to continually distribute the perfect amount of water to each plant. This keeps your seedlings happy and healthy at all times. All you need to do is fill your Smart Garden s water tank once every two months. The lamps offer perfect hues to support photosynthesis THE LIGHTING. The lights used in the Smart Garden 9 reduce light pollution through the use of highly transparent optics. The garden s lamp mimics nature s most efficient photosynthesis peaks and maintains a healthy and natural environment for the plants. Better yet, the Smart Garden 9 features new OSRAM LEDs that offer maximal efficiency and the perfect spectra for photosynthesis. This means faster growth, a bigger yield, and less waste. Are Smart Gardens connected to the internet or cloud? There's a specific reason we didn't make this a connected product. Do you really need a 500$ garden kit with an app that allows you to turn the lights on and off? We didn't think so. We don't want to offer you a fun gadget, but a garden that will grow you fresh food. And this is exactly what the Smart Garden 9 is. The lights will be on, plants watered and nutritious even when the AI's finally take over the internet. The Smart Garden 9 in white After successfully launching our second generation product on Kickstarter three years ago, we re thrilled to present this new creation to the community that first helped us take off. Today, more than 350 000 people have Click & Grow gardens, and in 2015 we asked these folks what they d like to see from us next. More than 80% of respondents said they wanted to be able to grow more food, and more than 60% said nine plants would be the ideal size. Since we had so much support and love from the Kickstarter community when launching our previous product - the Smart Herb Garden -, we wanted to give you the first opportunity to get the Smart Garden 9! Measurements: 23in x 5.5in x 11in / 59cm x 14cm x 28cm Weight: 5,3 lb / 2,4kg Growing capacities: 9 plants Warranty: 1 year Automatic watering Watering tank: 1,45 gallons/ 5,5 liters 10 LEDs; 10 000 lux Over 35 different pre-seeded plant capsules with fruits, herbs, salads and flowers + plant your own seeds in the experimental seedless capsules Subscriptions available (get up to 30% off retail price) Fruits: Mini Tomato, Wild Strawberry, Chili Pepper, Sweet Paprika, Chillies, Physalis Herbs: Basil, Thai Basil, Red Basil, Dwarf Basil, Parsley, Peppermint, Lemon Balm, Stevia, Thyme, Chives, Oregano, Sage, Catnip, Hyssop, Dill, Garlic Chives, Coriander, Garden Cress Salad Greens: Leaf Mustard, Bloody Sorrel, Red Oak Leaf Lettuce, Green Lettuce, Frillice, Butterhead Salad, Bok Choy, Leaf-Beet, Kale, Komatsuna Flowers: Mimosa, Petunia, French Marigold, Moss Rose, Lavender, Sweet Alyssum, Busy Lizzie, Cockscomb, Painted Nettle Grow Anything refill: Seedless smart soil, grow any plant you want The Smart Garden 9 is available for US and all EU countries, Canada, Iceland, Norway, Andorra, San Marino, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan and Macau. Shipping is free for US, a shipping fee of 10 $ applies to Europe and Canada and 15$ for Hong Kong, Malaysia, Taiwan, Macau and Singapore. We can't offer shipping to other regions due to strict seed and soil import laws many countries have, but we're definitely working our hardest towards making this product available for everyone.

25`WE ARE PRE-SELLING. PLEDGE NOW - Receive your TipMeNot(s) in mid-July. Thanks.-------TipMeNot is a revolutionary product designed to help infant children learn to drink from a bottle. Babies begin drinking from a bottle with the help of the caretaker. We hold the bottle at an angle to let the baby drink.Slowly, the baby learns to grasp the bottle. At this point, we lay the baby on its back or in a swing or car seat and allow it to drink from the bottle. We use blankets and baby cloths to prop up the bottle so that it is angled toward the baby s mouth. This has been shown to be unhealthy and potentially dangerous. This is where the TipMeNot comes in.The tripod design allows the bottle to sit comfortably on the baby s chest. It keeps the bottle from falling or rolling off the baby s chest. Further, it creates a fulcrum at the top of the bottle that shifts the weight of the bottle and the milk away from the baby s mouth. The baby is prompted to use her arms to tip the bottle toward her mouth to drink from the bottle. This is difficult to do without the TipMeNot because of the weight of the bottle. The fulcrum allows for tipping the bottle toward the mouth without having to bear the full weight of the bottle. This allows the baby to learn to feed herself before she has the strength to fully lift the bottle.Further, as the baby becomes stronger, it begins to lift and tilt the bottle to drink. The TipMeNot allows the baby the ability to easily maneuver the bottle using her arms and hands (as opposed to just holding the bottle with her hands). Allowing your baby to easily maneuver her bottle before she has the dexterity to clinch the bottle effectively with her hands is essential to the early learning process.Lastly, the TipMeNot prevents spillage when the baby drops or pushes the bottle to the side. The tripod system keeps the nipple elevated, preventing the contents of the bottle from leaking. No more wet floors, bed sheets, car seat, etc.The TipMeNot is made of Food-Grade (FDA approved) rubber. The TipMeNot is dishwasher safe and is a great teething toy for your little one.Note: Studies demonstrate the advantages of holding a child close to the chest (preferably against bare skin) while feeding. This includes when feeding from a bottle. The TipMeNot can easily be used when the baby is laying in a parent s lap or arms. Remember, this is a learning tool. It is all about allowing your little one to practice as early as possible (without the parent holding the bottle).
26`The Foodie Dice campaign is now over, which means Kickstarter has frozen this page and it can never be updated. Everything here is likely to be out of date. In the coming months, we plan to create an online community for sharing tips, recipes, and Foodie Dice meals. Please visit us at www.foodiedice.com to order Foodie Dice and join the community.Thank you so very much for an amazingly successful campaign!Liz & Sarah DowneyTwo Tumbleweeds CONNECT WITH US: facebook // twitter FEATURED IN: Wired.com // Co.Design // ABC's The Chew Original campaign begins hereThe perfect gift for any foodie! We re on a mission to make cooking fun.Even foodies fall into cooking ruts sometimes. Recipes have their place, but they can be restrictive and intimidating. Foodie Dice, on the other hand, encourages you to play with your food! Cooking doesn t have to be complicated or take a lot of time or skill when you start with whole, seasonal ingredients and a playful spirit. What is Foodie Dice? Nine laser engraved dice 5 primary dice and 4 seasonal veggie dice that provide inspiration for creating simple, seasonal meals (Protein, cooking method, grain/carb, herb, bonus ingredient + Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter Veggies) The dice have a range of ingredients some are more common and some are meant to get you to be adventurous. Over 186,000 combinations to inspire creativity in the kitchen. You ll be surprised at how many rolls may be something you never thought to pair together, but make sense. Takes the guesswork out of eating seasonally. Eating veggies that are in season just plain tastes better. It s hard to know what s in season these days with all of the access that we have to food in the grocery store, but the dice make it easier. If you live in a colder region, it might be a little more challenging, but at least you ll be eating things that came from California instead of South America. You ll never want to eat a mealy tomato in December again. Naturally gluten-free and can easily be Paleo-friendly just leave out the carb/grain die and roll the veggie die twice. Pasta can easily be substituted for a gluten-free version. Laser engraved wooden dice are made in the USA, and come packaged in an upcycled wine bottle tumbler or cotton muslin pouch What s on the dice? It s easy. Just roll, shop, cook, & EAT!

InspirationTwo sisters from the Midwest, we originally created Foodie Dice for ourselves because even though we cooked often and liked to experiment in the kitchen, we tended to cook the same things over and over again. We wanted to find a way to take advantage of all that s available to us. Once we started to play with the dice, we discovered tons of new combinations that we wouldn t have thought of before. We believe that whether you re a self-professed foodie, or just starting to think a bit more about your food, cooking can be an adventure rather than a chore. Once you start cooking with seasonal ingredients, you start to connect more with your food and where it comes from. And there s nothing better than sharing the meal you ve created with friends and family. We hope Foodie Dice leads you to new foodie adventures, too. Want to learn a little more about us and our experience? Read our bio. Please help us reach our goalWe ve spent a lot of time developing Foodie Dice because we believe in it, and have a passion for food, cooking, and design. Now it s time to ask if you like it. If you do, please help us reach our goal by pre-ordering and sharing our campaign with everyone you know. Anything you can do will help.Our Kickstarter goal of $7,500, added to our own investment, will cover the costs of our first run of Foodie Dice.

27`Records are made to be......made! And then sometimes they're made to be completely smashed. We are here to do both! First, we wanna smash the old Kickstarter record we have of raising $14,000.00 and then second we wanna actually make a record! It's taken some time since we started working on the album but I never make records just because it's time to do so , or for any other reason other than I have some songs that I am really excited about sharing. I finally have those songs and we are all ready to get rockin'. This is an exciting time to be a passionate believer in the power of music as well! For the first time the general public gets to peak behind the velvet curtain and see what goes into making music. There are many, many ingredients that go into making a record. It's like great bbq- seems simple yet it's very complicated but in the end it's mindblowingly fulfilling, as you'll soon see. The most important ingredient we need is a fussy little green called money. Sometimes even referred to as cabbage, it takes a lot of money to make a record. Once upon a time, artists relied on record companies to have the green thumb needed to supply the artist with album budget, tour budget, promotion, publicity, distribution, production, packaging and many other various money sucking deeds. Now, it all falls on the artist. In 99% of the cases nowadays the artist no longer has the record company to help carry the load. Enter our heroes! The PEOPLE! Time and time again the people themselves have stood and decided that they love their music. It's important to us. It has value. It's personal. It's liberating. It lifts us up when nothing else can and it even pulls us together when all else has failed. Look around Kickstarter and see for yourself. Tens of thousands of people from all walks of life, pitching in so that the world can have a chance to hear the music they love and hold dear. It's truly moving, to say the least. So to finish our record, we need to record 6 more songs, then we're done, right? In the famous schmaltzy words of Karen Carpenter, We've Only Just Begun ! Making the record is just the beginning. What's the point in having a record if you can't share it with anyone? First, you have to hire someone to actually print the record, put it in a super hip package then we're gonna need to hire someone with a really big mouth (in the biz they're called publicists) to tell everyone about it, and then we're gonna need to find enough money to actually go and take the music to the people because as fun as making a record can be, LIVE is where it's at!! So our goal is going to be to cover making the record but bear in mind that in reality we need so much more than that. Any money above and beyond our goal will go toward artwork, manufacturing, distribution, publicity, promotion, and touring. We all know what happens when we get the band in front of people. It sells itself! It's pure joy. This music awakens people to the spirit of God inside! And that's not my horn tootin' either. I'm in as much awe of music as anyone. The bottom line is, because what we do is so unique and the fact that the band is a large one, we have many challenges, beyond simply making a record, in getting this music to people who would love it, if they only knew it existed. With all the success we've had, we are still a very small little club, you and I. It's up to all of us, working together to get this music out to the masses. Together we can make it happen. Together, we can make the best "soul food" this world has ever seen.
28`The adventure continues on our site, where you can find our products and information about the process: www.lumi.coWe have big plans for how to take the technology even further thanks to your amazing support and enthusiasm. Keep an eye on our Facebook and Twitter pages as the campaign unfolds! You can also sign up for our email newsletter. Take a peek at what you can design with the Lumi Process: What is the Lumi Process?The Lumi Process is a revolutionary photographic print process for textiles and natural materials. The process is based on Inkodye, mixable, dilutable, water-based dyes, which develop their color in sunlight. Currently available in three colors: red, orange and blue.Inkodye can bind to any vegetal or animal fiber, such as cotton, linen, wool, silk, suede and wood. Once fixed, the color becomes permanent and can go through repeated machine washes without fading.Inkodye's light-sensitive properties open new possibilities for artistic and commercial uses: True photographic prints that show a range of tonality rather than half-tone patterns. Turn your smartphone pictures into beautiful designs. Permanent. Your prints will be soft and machine-washable. The dye actually becomes part of the fiber. Works on any natural fiber. Great on 100% cotton tees and delicate materials like silk, suede and wool which are not capable of going through pH or heat-setting stages. Prints over rough materials such as burlap, jute and sewn garments, into recesses that typical screen-printing could not reach. Uses the sun! No need for electricity, silkscreens or high-end equipment. The SystemStarter KitThe starter kit includes 4 ounces of each color (118ml), instructions, a vignette-shaped stencil and a negative that you can cut out and start experimenting with. This kit will allow you to print between 12 sq ft. and 48 sq ft. (1.1 m2 to 4.4 m2) depending on how absorbent your material is, and whether or not you dilute the dye. Transparent FilmThe film provided in our Full System Kit is 11x17" (equivalent to A3 paper) specially coated for laser printing. It absorbs more toner than typical transparencies allowing you to print dense negatives. This will ensure that the whites in your image stay white. Each transparency is connected to a carrier sheet of paper which makes it run through typical copiers more effectively.If you prefer to use your own transparency, there are a few ways to get dark negatives. The easiest we've found is to print two negatives on your home inkjet printer and double them up.Textile DetergentTo make sure your prints don't continue developing, you'll have to wash out the unexposed dye in hot water with a strong textile detergent. The one we provide is specifically made to clear residual dye. However, it is possible to use regular laundry detergent, but you may need to run your print through the washing machine twice.How can I use the Lumi Process? Design photographically-printed garments. Create colorful artwork on natural materials. Give the objects around you a new life. Start a business printing with light. Make shadow prints, like this design by Jessica Jones from "How About Orange". What's the app for?Lumityper is a simple utility that helps you create negatives from your smartphone pictures. It also gives you mobile access to printing instructions and troubleshooting guides.Once you've turned your image into a negative, you can save it or email it to yourself. The file can then be printed directly on a copier such as the ones found at Kinkos/FedEx.The app was designed for iPhone, and will be available soon after the campaign ends. Thanks to your support we will be working towards an Android version too! If you're an Android user please fill out this form which will help us decide which devices to develop for.Negatives can also be made on your computer, using Photoshop, or even web apps such as Pixlr.com. We have a guide that helps you through the process. The app will be free to download for all backers. Why are you using Kickstarter?We've been selling Inkodye for the past 6 months and it has already been shipped to customers in over 60 countries! Some of them have already created amazing things. Along the way we realized that additional tools, like clear films, textile detergent and apps could help make printing with Inkodye even easier . We're using Kickstarter because it's the fastest way to bring the Lumi Printing System directly to the people who want to use it. Over 2 years ago we ran a Kickstarter campaign to fund research on this project. Thanks to all of you, we made our printing process a reality. Now it's time to share that technology with the community that made it possible!In order to provide this system of tools at an affordable price, we need to buy supplies in large volumes, which is why we are raising $50,000. Any funds that exceed that amount will be dedicated to improving the process, like developing new colors, and bringing the Lumityper app to Android and desktop computers.Take it further...We've created several great options if you want to take your Lumi printing projects further.

32`Veggie-Go s are the chewiest, fruitiest way to LOVE your veggies! Veggie-Go s are an organic, chewy fruit and veggie snack (along the lines of a fruit strip or a fruit leather) made with organic fruits AND veggies!Like us on Facebook and we will add one pack of Veggie-Go's to your reward! The Project We have been making Veggie-Go s for a little over a year now and have really made a splash in the Boulder area! We are in about a dozen stores in the Boulder/Denver area including a few Whole Foods (and a few elsewhere) as well as available nationally online! We also have a booth at the Boulder Farmers Market (one of the best in the country) where we sell out of Veggie-Go s on a regular basis and enjoy chatting with customers and listening to the insights of little kids! We currently make Veggie-Go s in a local pie shop where we rent space. It has been a great place to start but now our demand is growing faster than we can keep up with in a shared space! It s time to take a leap and get our own kitchen! That s where you come in. We are reaching out and asking for help with funding to fill our new kitchen with equipment. Luckily Veggie-Go s are minimally processed so we need a minimal amount of production equipment to make them! But as anyone who has looked into commercial food production equipment knows, it s expensive. We already have a fair amount of our own equipment, including our crown jewel dehydrator, but we need things like fridges, freezers and sinks. Having our own space will allow us to grow and keep up with demand. We will be able to hire help and have our kitchen, office and warehouse in one place (so we won t have to spend all day driving in circles!) We will also be able to buy ingredients in bulk which will lower our costs and allow us to use the resources for more important things, like getting Veggie-Go s into more hands as well as reduce our waste! We will also be able to get our USDA Organic certification (a challenge when sharing space with a non-organic company.) Of course none of this will happen in an empty warehouse, the equipment is what makes it a kitchen! More about Veggie-Go s Veggie-Go s are like nothing you have ever tried before! They are similar in theory to a traditional fruit strip or fruit leather, but as soon as you try them your tongue and your body will know they have never had these before! Not only are Veggie-Go's good for you or your kids, they are also easy on the environment. We use compostable packaging, source ingredients locally from organic farms and of course use organic, GMO free ingredients. Please check out our website for more info and reviews! nakededgesnacks.comCheck out these amazingly unique flavors!
33`Everybody has suffered from cold feet, whether on their way to work, while walking, skiing, hiking, or even riding their bike or motorcycle. What if you could control the temperature of your shoes with a simple click on your smartphone and also keep track of the distance you have walked and calories burned? Thanks to Digitsole, this is now possible.Media coverage And there's more here!What is Digitsole?Digitsole is the first connected, interactive, heated insole that can be controlled via your smartphone. This innovative foot product is designed for your health and comfort. Available on Android and iOS, the dedicated Digitsole app is connected to your insole with Bluetooth 4.0 so you can warm your feet and track your day with one easy click. Once you have connected your insoles with the application, the warm up function can be activated with the on/off button on the app screen. You can then adjust the temperature of each of your insoles separately by adjusting the slide temperature bar up or down. This unique independent adjustment allows you to get the perfect temperature setting for each of your feet. Once the temperature of the insole drops below the preset setting, the built-in thermostat adjusts to the pre-determined temperature. Digitsole app By entering your weight and height when you first log onto the dedicated app, you can keep track of how many calories you ve burned while wearing Digitsole. Thanks to the placement of our sensor system in the insole, our tracking is much more precise and efficient than the typical tracker wristbands and other devices that you could find in the market. Digitsole is at the forefront of the new generation of connected products. How easy is it to use? We have designed Digitsole with you in mind, so we want to ensure that it is very easy to use. Once you ve got your Digitsole, download the dedicated app. When your Digitsole is fully charged via a USB charging device, simply switch the on/off button on the back of the insole, launch the app and connect it with your smartphone using bluetooth. Next, set the temperature to the desired level or track your activity. You can check and monitor your battery level at any time on the app. Functions of Digitsole Warm your feet - Connect your insoles with the app to access the warm up function and activate heat. You can then adjust the temperature of each of your insoles separately by adjusting the slide temperature bar up or down. Track your day - Through the Digitsole app you can track how many steps you take during the day, the distance walked as well as the altitude. Calories burned - Check how many calories you ve burned throughout the day via the app. If we are lucky enough to hit our funding goal, our Digitsole engineers will work on adding additional functions to the app. Where can I use Digitsole? We understand the need to have more than one pair of shoes in our lives! This is why we have designed Digitsole to be thin, very comfortable and easy to place in most shoe types so you only need one pair. Digitsole can be used in just about any shoe, replacing your original insole. So, you can enjoy warm feet whatever you re doing. With only one pair of Digitsole all your shoes can now be connected. Key features of Digitsole Shock Heel System - The Poron cushion placed at the back of the insole softens the shock and spreads the vibrations of the foot associated with walking and running Flex Zone Section - Flexible section placed near the toe box to optimize the natural movement of your feet Arch Support Section - Additional support in the arch helps with balance and posture What is Digitsole made of? The Digitsole platform is moulded from Neotech, which is excellent for controlling vibrations and is an extremely lightweight material developed exclusively by Digitsole engineers. The next layer of the insole consists of Poron which has superior shock absorbing characteristics. The Poron TX3 layer is covered with high-quality Soft Touch PU micro-fiber, which spreads the heat in an optimal way. General Specifications Stretch Goals With your help and backing, the Digitsole design team will update Digitsole products with the three items noted below: * $100,000 stretch goal : 1. Dual Insole Charging - Our design team has listened to your feedback regarding charging each insole individually and that charging both insoles at the same time would be far more convenient. This is why we would like to offer a dual charger cable that splits in two parts. This update would allow consumers the ability to charge both your insoles at the same time. 2. Neotech+ - A new generation of foam material. Neotech+ is even lighter than our current Neotech and offers better isolation of heat. This update would increase heat efficiency by 20%. 3. Electronic Component Upgrade currently our electronic package uses several metallic components. Our desire is to manufacture several of these key components of Polycarbonate/ABS materials. The net result is an additional savings of 15% in weight without a loss of efficiency. * $200,000 stretch goal: With your help and backing, the Digitsole design team will update our water-resistant technology to water-proof technology. With this updated design, Digitsole can be used is the harshest of environments. * $400,000 stretch goal: The Digitsole design team will update our charging system to a QI Induction Technology wireless charger. With this updated design, wireless charging will come to Digitsole products as a truly revolutionary innovation. Size Conversion Chart Pledges Timeline:
34`Kickstarter is over, but you can still get info and BUY from the MaKey MaKey website.What's MaKey MaKey?MaKey MaKey is an invention kit for the 21st century. Turn everyday objects into touchpads and combine them with the internet. It's a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art, engineering, and everything inbetween: It comes ready to use out of the box with everything you see above: MaKey MaKey, Alligator Clips, USB Cable.What Can I Make?That's up to you! First, load up a computer program or any webpage (yes that's right, you're surfing the internet to invent). Let's say you load up a piano. Then, instead of using the computer keyboard buttons to play the piano, you can hook up the MaKey MaKey to something fun, like bananas, and the bananas become your piano keys: Or let's say you Google for an online "Pacman" game and draw a joystick with a pencil (yes, an actual ordinary pencil): Then you can play Pacman by touching the drawing with your finger.Or you could load up facebook or gmail and send a message on a custom-made alphabet soup keyboard: How Does it Work?Alligator Clip two objects to the MaKey MaKey board. For example, you and an apple. When you touch the apple, you make a connection, and MaKey MaKey sends the computer a keyboard message. The computer just thinks MaKey MaKey is a regular keyboard (or mouse). Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input. Make + Key = MaKey MaKey! Who is MaKey MaKey For?Artists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers... Really it is for everyone. Here is an 8-year-old girl in a Maker Space: She invented a "knife-and-log" interface for cutting virtual wood in an online game.We ran a workshop in February 2012 with some professors and grad students who specialize in interaction design. One grad student made this beachball game controller: Another grad student made this working pressure sensitive switch by layering Play-Doh under a spring: The workshop took place at Queen's University during a conference.With MaKey MaKey, kids can start inventing right away, and experts can make working prototypes in minutes instead of days.What materials work with MaKey Makey?Any material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work (if it doesn't already work, just rub it with bananas, spray it with water, or apply copper tape). Here are some materials people have used in our workshops including Ketchup, Pencil Graphite, Finger Paint, Lemons, etc.: Other materials that work great: Plants, Coins, Your Grandma, Silverware, Anything that is Wet, Most Foods, Cats and Dogs, Aluminum Foil, Rain, and hundreds more...Requirements?MaKey MaKey works with any laptop or computer with a USB port and a recent operating system. How recent? We have tried it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OSX.Why Are You Creating MaKey MaKey?We believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way.We are inspired by the Maker Movement. We want to help people start to think of themselves as Makers and agents of change. When you have the "Maker's Mindset," you know you can change the world.Before we created MaKey MaKey we worked on other creative tools and invention kits such as Drawdio, Singing Fingers, and Scratch.Why Are you Doing a Kickstarter?If we raise $25,000 then we can do a large first run, which brings the retail cost down significantly, so that we can sell the kit to you for $35 (including shipping). We want this to be accessible to beginners, educators, artists, inventors, engineers, and anyone else regardless of income. We are raising Kickstarter money to fund the first large run of MaKey MaKey kits. That is why most of the rewards are kits themselves. That's what we're spending the money on: manufacturing the kits.Have You Prototyped This?Everything in the video is real, running on either the first or the second prototype. Two years ago, we created the first prototype for MaKey MaKey, and ran a workshop at the San Francisco Exploratorium where people made "Drum Pants" and "Tweet Tea": Then we built the second prototype from 2011 to 2012, and we tested it with professional interaction designers. It looks like this: Our third prototype was just made, and will be tested at the Maker Faire and by 100 beta testers. It looks like this: Now we are designing the kit a fourth time. This will be the kit you, our KickStarter supporters, will receive. It will look mostly like the third prototype, with some aesthetic modifications.How Are You Manufacturing the Circuits for the Orders Placed on Kickstarter?We are collaborating with the amazing team at Sparkfun. Sparkfun is the perfect choice for us because they make safe, environmentally responsible (RoHS compliant) circuit boards. They are located in the USA (in Boulder, CO), and they treat their employees fantastically. Workers are paid a generous wage with benefits, can bring their dogs to work, listen to music while they work, etc. That may sound like it should be "normal", but in the world of circuit production it is very rare and there are lots of sad working conditions elsewhere. Also, Sparkfun is the world's largest manufacturer of Open Source Hardware, which is critical to MaKey MaKey, an all Open Source Hardware project.We worked closely with Jim Lindblom and others from the Sparkfun team to get the board ready for manufacturing. We re grateful to have them as our partners in this project. With their help we will be done manufacturing and shipping by the end of August. They have a lot of experience meeting deadlines.What Does the Back of the Board Look Like? The back of the board has hookups for 6 keyboard keys, and mouse control. It also has the open hardware logo, a link for help getting started, and an area for using the board in Arduino mode.Wait... Is this thing an Arduino?You could say this board is 2 for the price of 1. MaKey MaKey runs on top of Arduino. You can start using your MaKey MaKey board in "Arduino mode" at any time. This would allow you to spin motors, turn on LEDs, or anything else that an Arduino can do. If you want to learn to use Arduino or other electronics, but want to start without any programming or breadboarding, MaKey MaKey is a good starting point. There's no need to understand Arduino in order to use MaKey MaKey.Seriously, I Am a Geek, Tell Me All the Krazy Tech StuffMaKey MaKey is a printed circuit board with an ATMega32u4 microcontroller running Arduino Leonardo bootloader. It uses the Human Interface Device (HID) protocol to communicate with your computer, and it can send keypresses, mouse clicks, and mouse movements. For sensing closed switches on the digital input pins, we use high resistance switching to make it so you can close a switch even through materials like your skin, leaves, and play-doh. We use a pull-up resistor of 10-50 mega ohms. This technique attracts noise on the input, so we use a moving window averager to lowpass the noise in software, saving money on hardware filtering. There are six inputs on the front of the board, which can be attached to via alligator clipping, soldering to the pads, or any other method you can think of. There are another 12 inputs on the back, 6 for keyboard keys, and 6 for mouse motion, which you can access with jumpers via the female headers. If you wish to use a different set of keys, or otherwise change the behavior of your MaKey MaKey, you can simply reprogram it using the Arduino environment. By cutting a trace on the back of the board, you can disconnect the large pull-up resistors if you want to, which would be necessary in a small minority of Arduino-style projects. Have more geeky questions? Post them in the comments and we'll answer them. OMG This Is Awesome Where Can I Find Out More?MaKey MaKey was at Maker Faire in the San Francisco Bay Area on May 19th and May 20th. There were MaKey MaKey giveaways at Maker Faire for teachers, maker space organizers, etc. (limited supplies)The homepage for MaKey MaKey is makeymakey.comHere is the Press Page for photo links etc.

We welcome developers and hardware teams to join the Quantified Gaming community, where players can share applications and data to give gaming a long awaited new impulse. Stay tuned for more info on www.quantifiedgaming.org SOFTWARE The Quantified Gaming software can be used with any game (and even with other apps). No matter if you are hunting panzers in World of Tanks, zerging in StarCraft II, facing a penalty in FIFA 15, sneaking by the witch in Left4Dead2 or playing Online Poker, Quantified Gaming will add a new experience to your game. It is completely independent of the game or play The QG software takes screenshots and time stamps, so you can easily can analyze your peaks or certain patterns and relate them to situations. Top left to bottom right: Hearthstone, World of Tanks, Battlefield 4, StarCraft 2 with Quantified Gaming activated OVERWOLF ON BOARD SENSORS NAOS QG contains sensors that track and monitor your body reactions for real time information whilst using it Heart rate sensor - optical heart rate sensor, using 515 nm InGaN PWM controlled LED, high-sensitivity photo sensor and advanced noise-surpressing algorithms to extract heart rate from blood flow variations. Galvanic Skin Response sensors, measuring galvanic skin response as an indication of excitement and stress. - high resistance voltage dividers, low noise amplifiers and software algorithms especially optimized for gaming to derive changes in stress from skin moisture level. The sensors are positioned on the back of the mouse for smooth and interruption-free tracking. Due to the ergonomic shape of the NAOS, the sensors' positions are optimized for right-hand gamers using the palm grip. Please note that sensor placement and design may be adjusted during the development process for optimization. OPEN APIsOh yah, one last thing: we kept the APIs not only open but also free for everybody to use. We invite all game developers and hackers to incorporate QG data into their games or applications. Wouldn't it be awesome to have sweat running into your character's eyes in BF5 when the sensors detect your hand is perspiring? C mon DICE, your turn! REWARDS SCHEME MIONIXLABS MionixLabs is a rough group of developers and designers inside MIONIX that develop new concepts and craft state-of-the-art gaming hardware. When looking at the lack of true innovation in the gaming peripheral industry over the last years (Oculus Rift aside, we truly love you!) we simply went berserk over the idea to add a new aspect to the mouse. Ok, also because we knew it will be fun for everybody involved: players, broadcasters, viewers and us gaming vikings. TEAM A Special Thanks to all our friends and supporters that have taken time off to review our work, provide us with insights, made introductions and helped us come this far: Hampus Jakobsson, Nils Mattisson, Joakim Borg, Christoffer Suess, Claudia Pellengahr, Benjamin Sigmon, J rgen Blixt, Annika Johnson, Jonas Henningsson, Amir Pllana, Martin Walfisz, Jesper Berg, Anna Silbersky, Fredrik Ademar, Andre Erb, David de L on, Petter Johansson, Ola Lilja, the Idyllen and Jard clans, SK Gaming, Team Orbit......and the The Malm Model: An open collaboration between companies on innovation, development and resources. We thank the clan at Form, the teams at BRISK.IO, MODCAM, TOPP and Malm H gskola. WHERE WE ARE NOW The NAOS QG mouse you can see today is a real working prototype. It's the result of many months testing, developing, designing and building. We will keep improving and expanding the hard- and software based on your feedback and we will make the APIs accessible for developers so everyone can contribute. In order to make this happen, we need your support. Your pledge will help us to order production tooling, moulds and electronics from the lined up suppliers, obtain the necessary global certifications and to launch the production.

About the FundingAll of the money raised by this project will go into issue #1 and otherwise launching Nightmare Magazine. This includes webhosting, web design, paying authors professional rates for their work (at least 5 cents per word), and promotion. Anything raised above and beyond our stated goal will go toward the production of future issues of Nightmare.
38`THE STORYAll Black Cats Are Not Alike is the first book-length collaboration from Studio Goldsparkle and, we think, the first lovingly hand-drawn, hand-lettered celebration of the wild range of personality, originality, charisma and character of 50 highly individual all-black cats. It will be beautiful, square and hardcover. ABC mockup (book will be hardcover) THE AUTHORSStudio Goldsparkle is the New York-based office of Peter Arkle and Amy Goldwasser. Peter is an illustrator and Scottish; Amy is an editor and writer from Detroit. They share a studio, a home and two cats (Mimi=black; May=other) in the East Village. Yes, still in Manhattan. If you're someone who responds to a love story with dodgy seafood then this project has that, too! Scroll down for the romantic tale of mistaken identity and distracted guy at bar 1999 naming origins of Mimi the cat.Peter and Amy met 15.5 years ago. They have been trying to find the right book to make together nearly since then. (Plus, Peter has a tendency to get all Miranda Priestly at moments when they collaborate.) At last, they found it, it found them in ALL BLACK CATS ARE NOT ALIKE.THE NEW YEAR'S REVELATIONPeter and Amy try to send out a New Year's card every year, featuring them and their cats (usually two) as characters. Here's one, for example, wishing everyone peace for 2013, when May was new and performing outsize acts of destruction to sleep and objects and tree ornaments, as well as to Peter, Amy (experimenting with hair growth) and Mimi: Goldsparkles 2013 But it was this year's card that led them to the book idea. This is starting to feel ridiculous talking about us in the third-person, so it was OUR 2015 card that led to the book idea: Only Peter Normally Wears Glasses. Peter, May, Amy, Mimi (clockwise from top left) THE COCO EFFECT/ALL BLACK CAT CALLWe started getting responses, including, most entertaining, from those with all-black cats in their homes and their holidays...accusing us of putting their all-black cats in our specs on our card! ALL BLACK CATS ARE NOT ALIKE, people.To illustrate this for one household, Peter assembled a quick identification guide: Coco Is Not Mimi Striking difference, right? Seeing them gato a gato, friends noted that Coco looks like a Parisian librarian, while roundfaced gallerina Mimi will steal your SoulCycle and only pretends to like books. This made us smile, which is really what we all want from a collaboration, from cats, from media about cats. So we took away Coco and Mimi's Daily Planet disguises and decided to turn them and your favorite all-black cats into a book. THE BOOKAll Black Cats Are Not Alike features 50 cats, much like Mimi and Coco here, each one hand-drawn and full of character, in a four-color, first-edition hardcover book. This is a collection of cute black cats and original artwork that we hope anyone can appreciate. The book is mostly for adults but suitable for kids you'll see we made a conscious creative decision to keep Mimi's cutting* out of it, no hard questions at bedtime. ABC mockup (book will be hardcover) ABC mockup (book will be hardcover) Mimi page Coco page We're big believers in user-generated cat content, so please note that we have claimed only two spaces of the 50 All Black Cats in the book: One is for Mimi, who's still with us and dedicating her life to licking her own fur away (we hope the little bit of stardom she's always felt she merits will stop the self-mutilation). More on her below. Always more on her. The other is reserved for Sonny, the big dopey loverboy who aptly curled up purring and died ten years ago on Valentine's Day (and who Peter is to this day convinced said "allllllright" to him early one morning). This means YOU get to lead the All Black Cat Casting Call to select the 48 other beloved all-black cats in the book. We've set up a full range of ways for you to do so, make it easy from $24 to nominate a real-life cat to $250 to sponsor one who we connect you with and might not be able to swing the cash on his/her own to $500 to secure your cat a place.Thank them, thank YOU. It's a wondrous thing that none of us, none of them, none of you are anything alike. The more you get to know anyone, the weirder, funnier, more interesting and exceptional and perhaps furry they turn out to be. Here's to that, true originals, and your support in making this project possible.- Amy and Peter THAT LOVE STORY (with ugly big clam) Studio Goldsparkle of the Future MORE MIMI (aka Me! Me!)If you've read this far, we're sure you will respect both Mimi's decision and her cover story to remove herself from the public eye for a while due to "exhaustion." She would like you to know though that she's no stranger to the spotlight and is not to be mistaken for any other all-black cat. Here, some previous Mimi media appearances:As the pop princess, representing for ModKat: Video by Gregory Kennedy/gregorykennedydirector.com In her big-in-Japan period, from a sold-out show in Tokyo: Mimi merch, Tokyo [design by Keiko Sugiyama] Mimi glum [design by Keiko Sugiyama] THE THANK YOU (many times over)!

39`Our Kickstarter campaign has ended but you can still get your own Sansaire at Sansaire.com. Serious Eats: The Sansaire Sous-Vide Circulator is the Solution We've Been Waiting For Mashable: Sansaire Sous Vide Circulator Brings Pro Technique to Your Kitchen Cnet: Sous Vide is Coming Home with Sansaire Tested: Will drops by the home of Seattle Food Geek Scott Heimendinger to check out the Sansaire, a new immersion circulator for sous vide cooking We are humbled by the tremendous support we ve received from our Kickstarter backers! The next couple months are going to be a whirlwind of activity, but we ll be posting regular updates on Sansaire.com. We can t wait to deliver the Sansaire to our wonderful Kickstarter backers. We think you re going to love it! What is it? The Sansaire immersion circulator is the only tool you need to cook sous vide, and it only costs $199. Just place the Sansaire in a pot or basin, add water, and set your cooking temperature. The Sansaire maintains the water temperature, ensuring that your foods will cook perfectly every time. In the last few years, a few companies have marketed devices for sous vide cooking. Unfortunately, those devices are still too expensive for home use, in our opinion. We believe the Sansaire can change that. What is sous vide cooking? Sous vide is a cooking method that uses precise temperature control to achieve perfect results, every time. On a stovetop, in an oven, or on a grill, you re cooking with temperatures that are much higher than you ever want your food to reach. As a result, if you turn your back for a moment too long, your steak can overshoot perfection and end up as a tough, gray mess. And, even if you do achieve a medium-rare interior, the high heat environment of traditional cooking creates bands of overcooked areas around the outside of your food. By contrast, sous vide uses relatively low temperatures to achieve perfect, repeatable results that you just can t replicate through any other method. Foods are cooked evenly from edge to edge, to exactly the doneness you want. And, because foods won t overcook while they hang out in the water bath, dinner is ready when you are. These identical steaks were both cooked to an internal temperature of 52 C / 125.6 F. The steak on the left was cooked sous vide, as evidenced by its edge-to-edge even doneness. The steak on the right was cooked on a cast-iron skillet. How does it work? The Sansaire is an immersion circulator: it houses the heating coils, thermometer, microcontroller and water-circulating motor that work together to maintain a precise temperature in your water bath. Unlike some other sous vide machines, which have a fixed-size water bath, or require you to use your own rice cooker or crock pot, the Sansaire circulator works with any container. Just making a few eggs for breakfast? Attach the Sansaire to a small saucepan, and you re ready to cook! Cooking racks of ribs for a crowd? No problem the Sansaire will heat and circulate up to 6 gallons of water in a large basin! Clip the unit to the side of any basin, such as a stock pot or food storage container, like a Cambro. The clamp on the back of the unit is adjustable to fit most containers. Plug in the Sansaire using the included power cord. Stretch Goal: if we hit $250,000 in funding, we will also produce a 220V version of the Sansaire for users outside of North America! To change the cooking temperature, just turn the silver temperature ring. After a moment, the display switches back to showing you the current temperature of the water bath. You can set any cooking temperature between 0C (32F) and 100C (212F) in increments of 0.1 degrees. You can switch the Sansaire between Celsius and Fahrenheit at any time by pressing the temperature mode button on the top of the unit. Our Progress It has been our mission to create a low-cost, reliable sous vide machine for nearly three years. Beginning with the $75 DIY Sous Vide Machine that Scott developed, we ve known that a great sous vide machine doesn t have to be expensive. But, graduating from off-the-shelf parts to a commercially-viable design is not a quick process. We ve been working closely with a factory in China to produce the prototypes that we have today. We ve visited the factory, and have been meticulously testing and critiquing every element of the device. We re very proud of the Sansaire prototypes that we have today, but we need Kickstarter s help to proceed with final tooling, certification, and initial order fulfillment.Stretch Goals: 250K (unlocked)- A version of the Sansaire with 240V 50Hz compatibility for all our international backers. This covers all of Europe and most all other countries. The pledge category and the deliver date are the same as the US/Canada versions. 350k (unlocked)- We're including a reference towel with every Sansaire. Do you need to remember what temperature the Sansaire should be set to to make super juicy chicken breasts? Not when you can sneak a peak at your cheat-sheet towel. 600k (unlocked)- Choice between blue display and Kickstarter-green display. What s Next Our next step is to finalize the tooling for our molds, and lock in all of the exact components that we ll use for the production machines. These components include everything from the circulating motor and LED display, to the type of rotary encoder we use for the temperature ring. Once we re happy with a final prototype, we ll start our first production run and begin shipping Sansaire circulators to our backers! July: Testing pre-production prototypes. We re confident that the units function well, and hold up to the abuse they might encounter in the most chaotic kitchens. We ve sent these units out for user testing to gather valuable feedback from folks we trust, and we're incorporating their feedback into the final design iteration. August: Next-round prototypes. We ll keep making tweaks until we get everything just right. Meanwhile, we ll be spreading the word about the Sansaire Kickstarter, so you ll have the chance to be one of the first owners! September: Final tooling, packaging and certification. Once our tooling is complete, we ll send off a few units for certification. This process will uncover any fault-prone components, and help us sleep better at night, knowing the Sansaire circulators won t achieve consciousness and turn against their human overlords. October: Production. Our manufacturer has extensive experience in high-volume production, and we feel confident that we can meet the demand for our initial production run. October/November: Shipping! Each Sansaire circulator will be boxed up for the greatest journey of its lifetime: across the Pacific Ocean and headed toward your doorstep! Our TeamScott Heimendinger has been a sous vide devotee since his first bite of a 65 C egg back in 2009. Shortly thereafter, Scott reverse-engineered his own immersion circulator and posted the instructions for a $75 DIY Sous Vide Machine on his blog, Seattle Food Geek. The article was later republished in MAKE magazine, and has inspired over 1,000 do-it-yourselfers to build their own device. In 2012, Scott left his career in the software industry (Microsoft, IBM) to become the Director of Applied Research for Modernist Cuisine. Through his work there, Scott has earned a Webby award for his video series with CHOW.com, and was named one of Forbes Magazine s 30 Under 30.Lukas Svec is the Technical Genius for Sansaire. He became fascinated by sous vide when he listened to Nathan Myhrvold speak of his Modernist Cuisine cookbook in 2009. After building Scott's DIY sous vide machine, he realized sous vide can revolutionize the home kitchen if evangelism is paired with a killer circulator. He has worked with synchrotron radiation, cloud computing, and various mathematical models and is now getting his PhD in Physics for quantum computing. In his spare time, you can find him in his lab programming micro controllers to do his fuzzy logic bidding or in the kitchen baking delicious pies and searing juicy duck breasts.

41`Doggie doorbell, speakers can improve your home Skip ahead to the 2:50 point for the Outdoor Tech coverage! The same outdoor designer brand that delivered the Turtle Shell in its first Kickstarter project has since grown to have the biggest and best line of Bluetooth audio products on the market, and is now asking for your help to launch the Big Turtle Shell - the pinnacle of big Hi-Fi sound in an extreme package. Please help support our brand to launch our latest and greatest speaker and to keep working hard to create Stuff You Probably Want.Your boombox just got re-invented. We've created a rugged, shock proof, water resistant bluetooth speaker with a huge battery that doubles as a PowerBank. The Big Turtle Shell Bluetooth speaker will give you the best wireless audio experience in any setting; from the beach to the pool party, the campfire to the backyard BBQ, The Big Turtle Shell can handle it all with style and ease (otherwise known as Steez, according to Urban Dictionary). OUR STORYThe evolution of Outdoor Tech has been shaped by this constant push and pull, to stay connected but not tethered.Our blood boils with design, style and creation. From our magical home in Southern California we aim to create products that serve real needs, for real people that do real things. We don't define ourselves by the space that confines us, but we do draw from it. Our mission is to bridge the gap between great design and accessories for an active lifestyle by creating Stuff You Probably Want. PRODUCT FEATURES The Big Turtle Shell provides a full wireless audio experience. Using Bluetooth 4.0 technology, the Big Turtle Shell wirelessly connects with your smartphone, tablet, laptop, or any other Bluetooth-enabled device to bring you 110 decibels of auditory bliss. It streams crystal clear audio from a range of over 30 feet and will play for 16 hours on a single battery charge. The Big Turtle Shell is capable of 360 omnidirectional sound when laying down. You can also place the Big Turtle Shell on its side for directional sound not unlike other traditional brick shaped speakers. It's your choice, not ours. Your Big Turtle Shell is built with a powerful and rugged housing so you no longer have to be afraid of taking your speaker off of your coffee table and into the wild. The Big Turtle Shell was built for the wild, it's begging you to take it to the extreme corners of the world, but it will settle for your bi-weekly shower jam session if that's the best you can throw at it. The same great water and dust resistance as the original Turtle Shell - IPX6 - means that you can take the Big Turtle Shell everywhere without having to worry about it getting ruined by the elements. Made for a life on the go - the Big Turtle Shell is easy to handle, mount, pack, and take with you. 7800 milliamps of battery power (more than 3x that of the Big Jambox) gives the Big Turtle Shell the capability to charge external devices through it's power bank via the USB port. It will charge your iPhone 4 times, your Samsung Galaxy 3 times and your power thirsty GoPro 6 times! OUTDOOR TECH 2014: PASSING THE MOONSHINE TEST*: *Disclaimer: this is a video showing adult actions of irresponsible adults doing irresponsible things with the Big Turtle Shell.

The form factor was by in large in tact from the original Turtle Shell, it needed to be enlarged and done in a way that would maintain the design aesthetic and not make it looks oblong while allowing for the massive passive radiator and the two oversized drivers. Caro Krissman was the lead creator of the Big Turtle Shell and developed the dual orientation sound feature that sets it apart from any other speaker. The ID, sketches and early development was done in house by the same designer as the original Turtle Shell. This team has successfully designed and brought to market more high quality Bluetooth audio in the last 18 months than teams 10x their size and with 10x the budget.We are a scrappy group of expert product developers determined to bring you Stuff You Probably Want.

42`[Check our update 6 about the final flash sale]As the number of smart devices in your daily life is increasing, organizing things has become time-consuming. We created MYNT to be the simple device that makes organizing personal items easy. Meet MYNT: the one button remote. The smart button will perform three preset and customizable actions distinguished by single click, double click, and triple click. The smartphone app allows user customization for each type of click. Featured on: At first glance, MYNT is similar to an oval shaped decoration. The simplistic look hides the advanced functionalities inside. At 1/8th of an inch thin, with a size of about 1.5 of an SD memory card, MYNT is able to control music players, alarm devices, computers, smartphones, and so much more. MYNT is versatile and nimble. The smart companion can inconspicuously be placed in wallets, attached to key chains, and anywhere that fits. All the functionalities will not be useful if the remote cannot be located easily. So we added the tracking function. MYNT is a smart tracker. The app interface provides intuitive control. The app's GPS map and close distance map accurately indicate the item location. MYNT also has an alarm speaker on board. The flat surface and small size allows MYNT to be easily attached to a wide range of items. MYNT s metal body is resistant to physical impacts and wear-tears. The replaceable battery has a lifespan of up to one year. It's the perfect companion gadget. With MYNT: Functions MYNT has perfected:Out-of-range alarm: notify through a smartphone or onboard beep if MYNT is out of range. To find the smartphone, press and hold the button, which signals the phone to generate an alarm. Distance will be indicated in the proximity map. The last location recorded: the app records the last location of MYNT. Present the location on the GPS map. Selfie Shutter: single click for taking picture. Multi-device music control: single click for play, double for skipping to the next song, triple for previous song. Presentation remote: play, backward, skip. Weather alarm: app sends beep alarm about weather. These are pre-setting. Users can customize their own functions for each type of click. Functions we are fine-tuning for MYNT:Control smart TV (on/off, next channel, and more), smart air conditioner (on/off, increase temperature, decrease temperature, and more), game devices, smart home appliances and many other devices that may need a remote control. Simply set the three types of actions through the app, MYNT will take care of the rest. Activity and fitness tracking. Design: We thought about the different scenarios: we want you to put MYNT in your wallet without noticing it, so we made it extremely thin. Now, MYNT is 1/8 inch thin, just the thickness of two coins. We want you to use MYNT as a keychain tag, so we created a hole and included a string in the package. We want you to attach it to your laptop or tablet, so we made the surface flat and included two double-sided stickers. Super Strong Material We want MYNT to be durable and also fashionable, so we used stainless steel and processed it with different process techniques: original stainless steel silver with metal wire drawing, sand blast black, gold and sky blue mirror surface. As thin as a sheet of bubble gum Small details: Replaceable battery + long battery + smart battery reminder MYNT currently supports iOS, Android, and Mac OS X. CrowdGPS: our global support community (compatible with communities of other tracker brands) Open building kit: everybody is welcome to contact us and use our free kit to build more applications based on the MYNT platform. Where we are now: The production type for MYNT is ready to be delivered this November. The app and MYNT currently work on most smartphones. We are testing the customization and compatibility of MYNT, and also fine-tuning the manufacturing process. Where we are headed:We are working on adding more connectivity as a smart remote, connecting to a wide range of devices such as automated home appliance, robot playmate, and new smart devices. We are also working on adding fitness and activity tracking.

43`Did you miss out on this Kickstarter campaign? Pre-order Roadie on our website roadietuner.com As seen on Roadie tunes your guitar quickly and accurately. It informs you of the quality of your strings and recommends restringing as soon as the tone quality deteriorates. While beginner guitarists need a simple way to overcome the frustration of making their instrument sound good, more advanced players value the precision, speed, and ability to quickly switch between customizable alternate tunings.We incorporated all these features and many more into Roadie. Your guitar will now have a fuller sound than ever before and you can spend more time learning, playing, and composing your own music. How does Roadie work?Roadie Tuner pairs with a FREE app on your smartphone, iPod or tablet through Bluetooth 4.0 smart (check FAQ section below for a list of supported devices). All the audio processing happens on the smartphone which sends tuning commands to Roadie. With Roadie, tuning your instrument becomes easier than ever, less error prone, and far more accurate than manual tuning. Roadie can fine tune your guitar in a few seconds or completely change tunings in less than a minute. The tuning process on Roadie Tuner is three times more accurate than the average human ear. Musical instruments are living things that change with age, moisture, temperature, rust, etc. Roadie adapts to all these changes to make your instrument deliver its best musical experience.Roadie Features You don't need to bring multiple guitars with different tunings to your jam sessions anymore. Just use Roadie Tuner and enjoy switching seamlessly between alternate tunings with the same guitar. The more you tune using Roadie Tuner, the more it learns about your instrument and the more accurate the predictions. This will keep you better informed about the health of your strings. Roadie specs Electric Guitar players can directly plug in their guitar to the mobile device using our Electric Guitar Adapter. This eliminates all external noise.Roadie is a tool for the musician's journey.While designing and building Roadie, we put it in countless musicians' hands and received feedback from teachers, professionals and amateur players. This feedback greatly impacted the tuner's shape, ergonomics, responsiveness, interface, usability and the overall feature set.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ANNOUNCEMENT: Roadie stretch goalsIf we reach $120K - we will add wind / unwind buttons on Roadie hence allowing users to restring with a press of a button. If we reach $180K - Each Roadie will ship with a nice leather bag to keep it safe from scratches, dust and moisture. This will add elegance to your favorite gear. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Kickstarter rewards What is the technology behind Roadie?Roadie is the culmination of two years of research and development, the result of many iterations, trials, prototypes and lots of 3D printed models. coming up with different pre-concept designs for Roadie We have tested Roadie with musicians of all ages, music teachers, artists, and experts in producing quality products. We have thought of every single detail and consulted with experts in order to deliver great value to our backers in return for their trust and support.Here is an overview of how the Roadie system works: While tuning an instrument, the mobile app listens to your guitar, cancels out any noises from the surrounding environment, and sends commands to Roadie. Noises like people chatting around or any other ambient noises are suppressed using state of the art algorithms. Furthermore pitch detection is so accurate that it surpasses the human ear perception limits between any two sounds (called JND or just noticeable difference), by 300%. Based on the detected pitch, the mobile app sends commands to Roadie to turn the pegs and tune the string to the right tension. Roadie is designed in a way to learn about your instrument and adapt to it in order to make the tuning process quicker and more precise with time. After 3-5 uses, you will see a clear improvement in performance thanks to Roadie's learning capabilities. Every time you tune a string, the mobile app records and keeps track of its elasticity, which is internally measured using a frequency to elongation ratio. The more the string wears out, the less elastic it gets and becomes more prone to snapping. By tracking this elasticity, Roadie's Instrument Doctor feature shows you the quality of each string so you get insight on when to restring. Finally, Roadie protects your strings: even if rotated your hand or plucked the wrong string while tuning, the system is smart enough to detect such anomalies, work around them when possible and warn you whenever a specific action is to be taken. The electronics under the hood consume very low energy, allowing the rechargeable battery to last up to 6000 string tunings on a single charge. For iOS users you can already download our free chromatic tuner. Where is Roadie now? We have spent over two years in R&D developing the best tuner that works on any guitar. We developed a sophisticated audio processing algorithm with built-in noise cancellation, and used advanced adaptive control to robustly tune any instrument quickly and accurately. We have spent the last four months in Shenzhen, China, sourcing factories and prototyping as part of HAXLR8R, a hardware startup accelerator. Our prototype has gone through tons of iterations in order to ensure that we deliver the best quality product. It has been quite an adventure! We are working with an amazing manufacturing team in Shenzhen who helped us take Roadie Tuner from a prototype to a finished product. All the Roadies you see in the photos and video are fully functional models.What is the plan? We need you to get Roadie on the RoadWe have figured out our manufacturing and supply chain, we now need your help to add fuel to our rocket. The funds will go into: Setting up tooling for production Ordering components while meeting minimum order quantities Building testing jigs First production run costs CE and FCC certification costs Android app development and testing We are committed to providing the best tool for musicians, and we are already looking ahead into ways to improve the music experience. By backing us, you give us the push to make Roadie happen and receive the first Roadie Tuner on the market, months before anyone else.What is the story behind Roadie Tuner?Bassam Jalgha and Hassane Slaibi met through a music band in college and little did they know that they would eventually team up in building Roadie Tuner.Bassam learned to play the Oud, a 12 string instrument, ever since he was a kid, but struggled to tune it at first and found himself practicing on an un-tuned instrument! Being the geek he is, Bassam decided to invent a technological solution to this problem.In 2009, Bassam participated in Stars of Science Season 1, a Pan-Arab reality show innovation contest. His project Dozan , was a precursor of Roadie. During the three-month long competition, he was able to build the device and pass all the stages from engineering to product design, business and marketing. Finally, Bassam won first prize and this seeded Roadie's development.In 2012, Hassane and Bassam decided to start Band Industries and develop Roadie Tuner.Meet the Band The core team is composed of: Hassane Slaibi (in black): Software engineer and signal processing expert, Hassane is a flutist and has an innate absolute pitch talent - make any sound and he will tell you the note without any reference. He designed Roadie's audio processing to mimic and surpass his talent! Bassam Jalgha (in red): Hardware guru and designer of Roadie's control system. Bassam is into music, electronics and robotics. He is handling manufacturing of Roadie.And a long list of talented international collaborators including: Marco Nenzi mobile app UI/UX, Raafat Hamze design consultant, Pacifica branding, Bluelarix industrial design and William Farah adviser.

Backers $101 and above get a 10" of the bsides and demos- only available from this kickstarter! PLUS... we will release all the Kickstarter covers on a vinyl record set that backers will get 25% off the future price.WHY ARE WE DOING A KICKSTARTER? By overwhelming demand, you guys convinced us this is a much more interesting and effective way to pre-sell an album. We brought back a few things from the last Kickstarter & also created a bunch of new stuff we thought you'd like. There were moments of beauty that happened with the release of our last record- generous backers- friends making extraordinary gestures, and overwhelmingly positive reactions from everyone involved. Let's see what happens this time! NEWWWWWWW RECORDDDDDD WHAT ARE THE MAIN THINGS WE ARE SELLING? This Kickstarter will focus on the production and release of our 7th full length album "Big Dark Love" as well as "Framed: The Poster Art of Murder By Death" - an art book that chronicles the history of our tours through the posters we have collected in almost 15 years of MBD shows. The artists are being paid for the use of their art and this will be a limited printing for Kickstarter that will not be available in stores. Adam has saved one of every poster he could get his hands on, and "Framed: The Poster Art of MBD" is a collection of our favorites. The book represents 15 years of everything from photocopied handbills for house shows to beautiful glow-in-the-dark prints used to promote theater gigs. It also has essays by the band and several screenprinters/artists. ART! BOOK! ART BOOK! By being a backer you also support reprinting our older albums on vinyl. We release all our vinyl, and maintaining the space and organizing deliveries is expensive. The last Kickstarter helped us reprint those albums, and we're running out of stock again! We want to continue to create beautiful vinyl records, so we thank you for facilitating their production and hope you continue to enjoy them. Art book proofs! Kickstarter only T-shirt designed by comic artists Ryan Browne & Thomas Quinn I BACKED THE 2012 KICKSTARTER. ANYTHING SPECIAL FOR ME? We want to acknowledge the people who supported our last Kickstarter. ANY 2012 MBD KS BACKERS WHO SUPPORT THIS PRE-SALE WILL GET 3 BONUS TRACKS VIA DIGITAL DL OF B-SIDES/ ACOUSTIC DEMOS OF SONGS FROM THE NEW RECORD. THANK YOU.TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE ALBUM... With Kevin Ratterman engineering and John Congleton mixing, we made the biggest sounding record of our career and we are extremely proud of it. It's called Big Dark Love because it is a collection of non-traditional love songs. Some are dark- too dark. There's one about the love a parent feels for a child, one about love of humanity- it's all over the place. This is a really strong record for us and we hope you enjoy it as much as we do. It will come out February 3rd, 2015 on Bloodshot Records. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THE ART BOOK... It is a beautiful full color hardcover 12 1/4" x 12 1/4" book (same size as a vinyl record) with over 100 MBD posters from the last 15 years. It has essays by the band and screen printers and artists. It is gorgeous and celebrates the art of the show flyer. Personally assembled by Adam Turla with graphic design by our friend Birch Miller. We have made every effort to track down each artist and it has been a task. Some of these posters are very old and have no signature. But we have found almost all of them and have their permission and addresses so we can compensate them for the use of their posters and get them a copy of the book! Every single response has been positive. Us. And some of you! FAQWHEN DO ORDERS SHIP? The band will be spending most of the winter packaging and shipping your orders. Orders go out January 21st! You will get it a few days before it comes out in the store, same goes for digital downloads.I'M ORDERING AS A GIFT FOR XMAS- WILL I GET THE ALBUM IN TIME? No, the record doesn't come out 'til Feb. 3rd. But we are sending holiday cards to each supporter so you can give one to the recipient to whet their appetite for the upcoming gift. Something to put under the tree. As many of you know, we usually do a holiday promotion, so this is kind of like a big version of that! DOES THE NEW RECORD COME WITH DIGITAL DOWNLOADS?

Party gang! WHAT DOES THE 7" SPLIT WITH SAMANTHA CRAIN LOOK LIKE? SEVVVEEEEENNNN INCCCCHHHHHH WILL YOU REALLY RECORD A COVER OF ANY SONG I WANT? EVEN STUFF YOU HATE? Yes. And we hate a lot of stuff. But that could be interesting and cool. Sometimes the songs you don't expect to work turn out even better. OK ONE ADDENDUM- IT SHOULD BE A SONG THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY RELEASED, PLEASE DON"T ASK US TO RECORD YOUR SONG, AS THAT KIND OF GOES AGAINST THE IDEA WE ARE TRYING TO GET ACROSS HERE. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THESE HOUSE SHOWS YOU WILL PLAY...Ok. This is gonna rule. Some basic answers. WHAT AM I BUYING WITH ALL THIS BIG MONIES? Adam and Sarah will come and do a show just the two of them. We play for an hour or so, a set list you choose in advance (you pick 10 songs, and we will pick the rest). We will hang out and party, but obviously, depending on the day, we eventually gotta take off at some point to get to the next show etc etc etc. It's probably regular show length. Like 3 hours. WE WOULD PREFER TO NOT DO WEDDINGS. We did that with the last Kickstarter and it was lovely, but scheduling was difficult and the chance of missing the events stressed us out. YES YOU CAN POOL YOUR MONEY TOGETHER WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS/ FAMILY. But please don't charge for the show. Ok, maybe you can pass around the hat or take donations or whatever. WHY SO EXPENSIVE? First of all, lets not forget kickstarter fees, transportation, accommodations, travel costs, crew, etc etc etc. We know a lot of you have asked us to play your events, and ask how much. We also know this is a lot of money, but this is what it will take to make a general price that includes anywhere in North America. If you are from somewhere other than North America, feel free to contact us, as we are totally open to playing your fine city in a far off land. YOU DON'T AUTOMATICALLY HAVE TO PAY MORE IF YOU ARE FROM FAR AWAY. IN FACT, WE LOVE TRAVELLING TO DISTANT LANDS. It just might take a moment to get us all there. Maybe you wanna do a destination show. That could be awesome. Email us at mbdband@gmail.com to discuss any serious inquiries. I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE CEDAR POINT TRIP... We will arrange a time that works for both you and us. It will happen this year depending on what we can work out together. We book you and a friend flights/transportation to arrive in Cleveland/Sandusky, Ohio. The band picks you up in our tour van "The Pork Chop Express 5". We check you into your hotel in Cleveland. Then we sally forth to Cedar Point. Don't bother bringing cash- that's what your donation covers. We take you around the best roller coaster park in the world http://www.cedarpoint.com/ like kids in a candy shop. Play your heart out at silly games, ski ball, ring toss, video games, whatever! We dish out the cash and tokens. Ride 20 roller coasters. Eat junk food 'till you get sick, then ride 20 more roller coasters and get sick again. Gonna rule. Contact mbdband@gmail.com if you have any concerns/serious inquiries. Here's some photos from last time! NO FUN ALLOWED. NO SILLY COSTUMES EITHER. I WAS AN ARTIST WHOSE IMAGE YOU REPRODUCED FOR THE ART BOOK. WHEN WILL I GET MY $$$ AND BOOK? They'll ship when everything else does on January 21st, 2015. If you are one of the very few artists who we could not track down, or one of the "unknown artists" please contact us immediately at mbdband@gmail.com so we can properly compensate you!

45`Introducing The reCAP Fermenter: the EASIEST waterless airlock set that ferments and stores culinary creations that are delicious and good for your health. For both regular mouth and wide mouth Mason jars. This tried and tested solution is simple to use, with less pieces and steps, and better results than traditional methods and current Mason jar fermenting tools that we ve tested. Ferment, Eat, Store! reCAP Fermentation is different. We wanted a low-profile, waterless airlock that had an authentic one-way valve to let gases escape and absolutely not let air in. Something that eliminated the need to monitor the jars every day, but made it easy to peek in and taste when desired. We wanted something that could easily convert to plain storage to put in the refrigerator when complete. The reCAP Fermenter makes fermentation AND storage easier and more fun. From sauerkraut to kimchi, kefir to kombucha, we encourage you to Make It Yours and we think you ll love it!What is Fermentation and How Does it Work?Lacto -fermentation is a method of preserving food, but in addition creates a super-food because it encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria known as probiotics. It is how yogurt, giardiniera, sauerkraut and kimchi are made. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Nom Nom The process is anaerobic (ie, absence of oxygen). Vegetables exposed to oxygen encourages the growth of mold and can lead to nutrient-poor, soggy food. Once proper fermentation begins, the sugars convert to lactic acids and it creates carbon dioxide (the bubbles!). So it's important to allow gases to escape but keep the oxygen from entering. The reCAP SolutionMason jars are considered the perfect vessel for fermentation. reCAP Mason Jars converts the already popular POUR cap into a fermenting tool with our reCAP Fermenter. It is a simple waterless airlock that fits into a stopper. Once the ferment is complete simply remove the stopper, press down the POUR lid and it's ready for storage! The reCAP Fermenter can then be used in another batch. No need to scramble for lids and rings.EASY - Low profile, Waterless Airlock (no maintenance) & interchangeable between regular and wide mouth Mason jars. Quick Clean Up & Dishwasher safe. SAFE - Rust-free, BPA-free, Food Safe Plastic. True One-way Valve (allow gases to escape and will not let air in)DURABLE - An Economical, Multipurpose Solution that will last for many years. NO maintenance or monitoring required. reCAP Fermentation How Does reCAP Fermentation Work?The reCAP Fermenter uses a legit one-way valve system. Just as it sounds, a one-way valve allows the flow of a gas or liquid in only one direction. This is the purpose of an airlock: to allow carbon dioxide gas to flow out of the jar, and prevent oxygen (or anything else) from flowing into the jar. One-way valve Utilizing the original reCAP POUR, the Fermenter creates an air-tight seal with the one-way valve and stopper. No screw bands needed! During the ferment, the carbon dioxide releases through the valve as pressure builds up within the jar. When done, simply remove the Fermenter and the reCAP POUR turns into a storage cap. It is the most multi-functional fermenter available!TestimonialsWei-Shin: "The food was so yummy! So much better than other fermented foods I've had previously." Steve C: "We do the usual canning from the garden, but for me, reCAP is definitely about the fermenting. Jalape os, sauerkraut, okra, onions and more. When I started making sauerkraut a few years ago, I didn't have the right tools at hand for keeping the ferment environment on track. I knew it was an anaerobic process, but getting a good seal around the top of an old German crock (that we didn't have the original lid for) was problematic. At that time, I made sauerkraut slightly more than 50% of the time; the rest were compost-ready disappointments. Soon thereafter I found reCAP. I haven't lost a single ferment since."Mary: "I'm using these for beverage fermentations. I'm currently conducting a short mead & cider yeast trial - each half gallon mason jar is topped with a wide-mouth reCAP, a #5.5 stopper & an air lock. I capped 14 different mason jars full of honey/water mixture or apple juice & shook to combine with yeast nutrient - not a single one leaked. They are bubbling away currently. I'm elated with these for use in fermenting beverages and look forward to using them for pickles & other veggies in the future!"Share Your Ferment with an Aperitivo Experience!

46`Introducing 3Doodler 2.0When we first launched 3Doodler we asked the world to imagine a pen that you could literally lift off the page to create real three dimensional objects; a pen that put the power of a 3D printer in the palm of your hand. Two years later, we ve made the world s best 3D printing pen even better, with a new version that's slimmer, lighter, quieter and even easier to use. Oh, and just like the original 3Doodler, it's still by far and away the most affordable way to 3D print. With 3Doodler 2.0 we re continuing to make 3D creation and 3D design accessible to everyone! How does it work? Compact and easy to use, the 3Doodler extrudes heated plastic that cools almost instantly into a solid, stable structure; and with no computers or software needed, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination. Simply plug your 3Doodler into a power socket and start drawing anything within minutes. If you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler. But you don't need to take our word for it...Since we first showed the world that drawing in 3D was possible, we have sold over 130,000 3Doodlers. Our community has been using their 3Doodlers to create amazing things, going far beyond even our wildest expectations: from jewellery, to fully 3Doodled remote control planes, 3Doodled dresses, architectural models, and even writing braille! The creative possibilities are endless (and at times a tad unusual too!). So just like the Backstreet Boys, 3Doodler's back, alright!It was thanks to the support of the Kickstarter community that we were able to make the 3Doodler dream a reality. It was also here on Kickstarter that we began the process of building a vibrant community of artists, makers, designers, educators, as well as others eager to lift their imaginations off the page. Doodle by Doodle you have pushed the boundaries of 3D art and creation and inspired us further! To say a big thank you for all of your help and inspiration, we decided to come back to the place where it all began, and bring 3Doodler 2.0 to you first! We are eternally grateful for all the support you gave us the first time around, and want to give you first dibs at creating with the new 3Doodler. It's your funding that will help make this a reality! What s new with 3Doodler 2.0?Completely redesigned from top to bottom, 3Doodler 2.0 is the result of over two years of research and development, and feedback from thousands of users. Our aim? To give you the best 3Doodling experience ever! The result? A smaller, more ergonomic, and even more kick-ass 3D pen. We've also housed the new 3Doodler in a sleek metallic casing, so that it's jaw-droppingly beautiful and feels great in your hands. And there's lots more...As well as being the world's smallest 3D printing pen, we've packed the new 3Doodler with loads of other enhancements for smoother doodling in every dimension: a fully re-engineered drive system (the part that feeds the plastic through the pen), for even smoother 3Doodling an entirely new nozzle design, for better performance and crisper Doodles. As well as being technologically better it also looks way cooler enhanced and quieter airflow, to cool your plastic more efficiently and make it even easier to Doodle in the air from the get-go dual speed control, for a more customized Doodling experience (and specially for those of you who just can't get enough speed!) a new double-click function for continuous flow, so that you can Doodle non-stop without having to hold down any buttons manual temperature optimization, for minor flow adjustments and expertly consistent 3D Doodles more efficient and stable heating (or in other words, no stopping and starting while doodling!) and drastically reduced power consumption, under half the voltage of the original 3Doodler It's also easier to use than ever before thanks to a whole host of other design adjustments. These touch on everything from the shape of the pen, which allows you to Doodle into really tight corners, the more intuitive button design, as well as the positioning of the LED indicator light and cooling fan. Accessories & PlasticsWith the launch of the new 3Doodler on Kickstarter, we are also releasing a series of exciting new accessories to supercharge (and beautify) your 3Doodling. These include: a DoodleStand for your pen and plastic a JetPack, a portable power pack that gives you the freedom to Doodle on the go (2 hours of non-stop portable Doodling with ABS and 3 hours with PLA!) a Nozzle Set equipped six changeable nozzles + a smoothing tool a foot Pedal, for more versatile 3Doodling. With the new JetPack we're certain you'll be putting Banksy to shame in no time - bring on that 3Doodled street art! So which pledge level is right for you?We ve tried to create pledge levels to suit everyone, from the novice Doodler to the seasoned designer or engineer, and for those of you looking for a bit of 3Doodling fun. Simply scroll down the right-hand side of the page and pick the combination of plastics and accessories that fits you best. Every pledge level comes bundled with a mix of 3Doodler PLA and ABS plastic strands so that you can start 3D drawing right away! Each pledge level is limited to one pledge per backer. However we have also created special double pledge levels for the 3Doodler 2.0, Accessorize, JetSetter and PowerDoodler rewards, as well as a special Family Pack with four pens and a bunch of accessories + plastic strands.And if you're having trouble deciding which pledge level to go for, please don t hesitate to get in touch to ask us any questions that may help! EducationThe teaching potential that comes with being able to draw in a new dimension has been truly inspiring, and something the whole 3Doodler team has been eager to get behind. Together with teachers and educators, we're working to make the 3Doodler a standard classroom tool, used for everything from teaching geometry, to making award-winning art, or producing learning aids for the visually impaired. To support the use of the 3Doodler in education, we have created a special EDU pledge level for only US$1,000 (worth almost US$2,000), that allows you to send a full class set, loaded with x12 3Doodler 2.0 pens, a ton of plastic and accessories, as well as curricular materials to any school, university, library or non-profit makerspace of your choosing. You ll also get a 3Doodler 2.0 and full set of accessories for yourself!Note: We will require you to designate a recognized educational institutional or non-profit makerspace (as well as a contact there) in order to claim this pledge level. Full instructions will follow in an Update, and further details can be found in the FAQs below. What if "I'm not artistic"?If you can dream it, you can 3Doodle it! (Or so the saying goes.) The more artistically inclined of you will be sketching castles in the air in no time, but even those of us without that kind of talent can use the 3Doodler to draw on flat surfaces, peel off the Doodled pieces and join them together to make awesome 3D designs and creations. And based on what we've seen so far, previous artistic ability is not a prerequisite for 3Doodling greatness. Even those who considered themselves to be "not artistic" have gone on to Doodle breathtakingly impressive pieces! There are a ton of places to find 3Doodling inspiration, including our Community Site, which has hundreds of freely downloadable projects and stencils, how-to videos, and images. Our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages are also frequently updated with Doodles of the Week, Community Doodle-Offs , and cool creations from around the world. When will you get your 3Doodler?We have been working on 3Doodler 2.0 for over 12 months and are inches away from pressing "go" on full production. That means we ll go straight from this Kickstarter campaign to making your pens. Our first backers will get their new 3Doodlers within a few weeks of this campaign closing, and the majority of you will have your pens by April.For those of you curious about the exact stage we're at: All R&D and prototypes (along with compliance testing) were completed in December, all components and suppliers have been locked down, we have finished our final pilot runs (those are the pens you see in the video and images), and the assembly process is being fine-tuned so that we can run as smoothly as possible when full production begins! All that's left to do is put the final touches to tooling and place our first large orders with our suppliers. Then we'll be moving like lightening and hassling our shipping partners day and night to get your pens to you ASAP. We shipped our original Kickstarter 3Doodlers on time and we're determined to do the same, if not better, for 3Doodler 2.0! No waiting six months (or even a year) for this one ;) Thank you!We can t thank the Kickstarter community enough for being part of this amazing journey, and we re super excited to give you a first shot at the new 3Doodler. We know that you'll make the most of this incredible tool and use it to create Doodles that will blow us away.For anyone who has not experienced the 3Doodler yet, now is a great time to start! And for those of you backing us for the second time, thank you again! Thank you from the 3Doodler Team! Is there anything else you need to know?Yes! To help with this we ve compiled an extensive FAQ section below, covering everything from the plastics that will ship with your 3D pen, to the shipping methods we ll be using, details relating to taxes & duties (*sigh*), product safety, as well as the procedures for claiming the School Set pledge level, and much more. We ll be adding new FAQs as we go along, and we ll be keeping you up to date with Kickstarter Updates, messages, and via the Comment wall.Anyone who backed the original 3Doodler will tell you that we d much rather reply to your messages than sleep, so please feel free to reach out to us!

PICTURES & DETAILS BELOW! AND YES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET BOTH T-SHIRT DESIGNS - SEE THE FAQ FOR MORE INFO!Final Update!!!WE DID IT, MARSHMALLOWS! With six hours to spare, we shattered the last record we were aiming for, passing 87,143 to become the Kickstarter with the all-time highest number of backers. Let's review our accomplishments for a moment, shall we? Fastest project to reach $1 million. Fastest project to reach $2 million. All-time highest-funded project in FILM category. Third highest-funded project in Kickstarter history. Most project backers of any project in Kickstarter history. And we suspect there might be others. You're simply amazing.As a token of our appreciation to the 90,000+ backers who have helped us raise more than $5.6 million to support the film, we're excited to announce that all backers pledging $10 or more will get an additional reward: a sheet of exclusive Veronica Mars stickers designed just for our backers. We're finalizing the designs, but we expect them to look a lot like this: Check back here every day for more announcements and new rewards, and help us make the Veronica Mars movie we (and you) have been waiting for. LoVe and Gratitude - Rob, Kristen & The TeamStay Involved!We need your help to spread the word! Please LIKE us at http://www.facebook.com/TheVeronicaMarsMovie and youtube.com/veronicamarsmovie and FOLLOW us on Twitter via @VeronicaMars, @RobThomas and @IMKristenBell to stay involved. Tell other fans! Tell co-workers and classmates! And of course, keep checking here for more updates!NEW!!! Official T-Shirt Designs!Great news! We've got official t-shirt designs to share, and we couldn't be more excited about them. Backers at $25 and above will get to choose from two options.The first is California Noir, featuring the world's sassiest detective back in action. The second is called Mini-Blinds, and takes a more subtle approach. Both t-shirt designs are black, and printed on unbelievably soft, beautiful materials. These are not never-to-be-worn t-shirts, we guarantee. These are the real deal. When the Kickstarter campaign ends, after we've had a little time to organize the results, we'll get in touch backers so you can tell us your preferred design, size, etc. Updates from Rob & Kristen!April 11 April 2We are in the home stretch now, Marshmallows! And here's the new situation: our not-so-secret ambition is to have more backers than any Kickstarter drive in history. To do that we just need to get past Double Fine Adventure's 87,142 backers. We just need 23,000 more backers.So, starting right now, we're adding an official $1 donor level. Get your friends to climb aboard, and help us make history! Also, starting today, Kickstarter backers are going to begin receiving exclusive for-your-eyes only content. You can get in on that with a simple $1 pledge! (And of course, if you've already donated, you're already on the exclusive update gravy wagon.) Plus, there'll be a backers-only treat tomorrow. I promise. You guys are the best. Keep it up. Our love is epic. - RobMarch 13Well, there's no other way to say it: wow. We asked for help, and you came through in the biggest way. It's hard to believe how fast we shattered some of Kickstarter's biggest records, but that's what you guys do. Us? We're just excited and grateful, and thrilled that so many of you want to go back to Neptune with us. But you know what? Now that we know what's possible, there's more work to do. $2,000,000 is just the beginning! We've got 30 days, and the more we raise, the bigger and better this movie will be. So, let's not pop the cork on this champagne yet. We still need you! Please keep it up, and we'll keep working to deserve your support.- Rob11 hours, you guys? Seriously? It only took you 11 HOURS to cross 2 million dollars? You speedy little marshmallows :) Words can't even express how excited we are. You came through, and I'll keep my promise too. We're going to make the best Veronica Mars movie anyone ever made, and the movie YOU deserve. Because YOU made this happen. But there's still time, and the more we raise, the better we can make it. All of the money you pledge this month goes right back into making this movie the one you've been waiting for, and the movie we've been waiting to make. So call your friends. Rally the troops. Lets break another record. LoVe always, kristen bellDay 1: Messages from Rob & KristenAlmost since Veronica Mars went off the air, there's been talk of making a movie. In that span, I've taken different tactics in dealing with the question of whether it might happen. To be clear, I've always wanted to make a Veronica Mars movie. I love writing these characters and working with these actors. Kristen Bell has always wanted to make the movie.There was a moment, a few years ago, when we thought we had a real shot at making it happen. I developed a pitch that revolved around graduation day at Hearst college -- Wallace and Mac were graduating at least, Veronica had been sidetracked by freeing Keith from prison. Plus, there was a murder in Neptune that was affecting the beach city's spring break business in much the same way a great white shark affected the beach community of Amity. I probably stoked fan fervor in my optimistic comments about the prospects. Warner Bros. wasn t convinced there was enough interest to warrant a major studio-sized movie about Veronica and the project never got off the ground.After that, I tried to tamp down expectations. I didn't want to be guilty at least not twice of building up hope when the odds seemed so long. Still, without fail, in every interview I do or every place I speak, I get the "will there be a Veronica Mars movie?" question. Even after a couple of years of downplaying the chances, I'd still run across blog postings headlined, "will Rob Thomas shut up about the Veronica Mars movie, already!" I was trying to. I promise. I first found out about Kickstarter a couple of years ago from an Austin musician friend of mine Robert Harrison, lead singer of Cotton Mather, the band that gave us "Lily Dreams On," our closing song of season 1. He financed a rerelease of the band's fantastic Kontiki album. Later, I was marveling about Kickstarter with another buddy of mine who said off-handedly, "You should use Kickstarter to raise the money to make the Veronica Mars movie." I chuckled. That seemed like a silly idea in the moment. We'd need millions. But for the next few weeks, the notion was never far from my mind. I started doing the proverbial back-of-a-cocktail-napkin math. The average pledge on Kickstarter is $71. Hell, if we could get 30,000 people to give the average donation, we could finance the movie, particularly if the cast and I were willing to work cheap. The most common donation amount on Kickstarter is $25. Surely, 80,000 of our three million viewers would find that price-point viable! Of course, Warner Bros. still owns Veronica Mars and we would need their blessing and cooperation to pull this off. Kristen and I met with the Warner Bros. brass, and they agreed to allow us to take this shot. They were extremely cool about it, as a matter of fact. Their reaction was, if you can show there s enough fan interest to warrant a movie, we re on board. So this is it. This is our shot. I believe it's the only one we've got. It's nerve-wracking. I suppose we could fail in spectacular fashion, but there's also the chance that we completely revolutionize how projects like ours can get made. No Kickstarter project ever has set a goal this high. It's up to you, the fans, now. If the project is successful, our plan is to go into production this summer and the movie will be released in early 2014. Life has taken Veronica away from Neptune. In the years since spoiling Keith's chances to be reelected sheriff, Veronica hasn't taken a case. But something big is about to bring her back home and back to her calling. My goal is to include as many of your favorite characters as possible. It is, after all, time for Veronica s 10-year high school reunion. Keep in mind that the more money we raise, the cooler movie we can make. A two million dollar fundraising total probably means cross words are exchanged at the class reunion. Three million? We can afford a full-on brawl. Ten million? Who knows... For some reason the Neptune High class reunion takes place on a nuclear submarine! A Hobbit shows up! There s a Bollywood end-credit dance number! I ve always wanted to direct Bill Murray. We ll figure out something cool. Hey, if that total goes high enough, I ll bet the good folks at Warner Bros. will agree a sequel is a good idea. Thanks to everyone who hasn't lost faith. Rob Day 1: A Message from Kristendearest marshmallows... I am currently the happiest blonde in a hamster ball the world has ever seen. We have been waiting so long to make this movie dream a movie reality, and it s because of YOUR commitment, YOUR persistence, that we finally have a chance. We just have one more step to go. You have banded together like the sassy little honey badgers you are and made this possibility happen. i promise if we hit our goal, we will make the sleuthiest, snarkiest, it s-all-fun-and-games- til-one-of-you-gets-my-foot-up-your-ass movie we possibly can. I promise to give it my all. i promise to work my hardest to give everyone a little bit more Veronica, and i will be oh so honored to do so. I only ask for one thing in return. If I ever die, do me a favor. Go on Oprah and tell the world that I loved kittens. LoVe to you ALL, kristen bell More Countries!

49`Welcome to the CLEVERFIT Kickstarter Campaign! PLEASE WATCH OUR AMAZING VIDEO Copyright 2013 BrightMind LLC. All Rights Reserved, Worldwide. Recently Reviewed By: The Inspiration After years of wearing dress shirts, I had accumulated a large pile of flimsy mismatched plastic collar stays. They are all different shapes and sizes, weak and easily warped. Getting a proper fitting pair of stays was always a challenge. And on many occasions my shirt collars looked imbalanced or just plain sloppy. But the biggest problem of all was the time and effort wasted, searching thru them each day. Spending just one minute a day; 5 days a week searching is 4 hours a year wasted, sorting thru collar stays. The Innovation As an engineer, I wanted to develop a high quality product that would represent a superior option for dress shirt wears around the globe. So I dedicated myself over the last several years to making the world s best collar stay. It had to solve the sizing problem, save valuable time, enhance a shirt s appearance and help stabilize the collar during windy and active days. The path was extremely difficult but thru passion and perseverance, CLEVERFIT became a reality. CLEVERFIT Saves You Time and Effort Engineered to be the instant and permanent upgrade to the older restrictive fixed stays, CLEVERFIT s precision interlocking geometry gives you one powerful solution for all of your sizing needs. No more time consuming searches, CLEVERFIT s quick-click fingertip adjustment gets you ready in seconds! It's Simple and Fast! Adjust Insert And Go! Watch This Video and See How Easy it is to Use CLEVERFIT CLEVERFIT: How To Video CLEVERFIT Unlocks the Secrets to Better Looking Shirts Secret #1: A More Structured CollarCLEVERFIT can be adjusted to provide tip-to-neckline support for all traditional collar sizes.This unique ability eliminates weak zones and balances the correct amount of length and strength for every fabric type. Secret #2: A More Stable CollarBy using the science of leverage; CLEVERFIT can become a collar stabilizer in the extended position. It s simple really, when adjusted to fit snugly between your tie and the underside of your shirt collar; CLEVERFIT acts like a counterbalance, limiting wiggle and maintaining your collar s natural position. Engineered to be the longest collar stay in the world at full extension, CLEVERFIT allows the stability feature to be used with all dress shirts, regardless of size. CLEVERFIT Solves Common Collar Problems Most collar irregularities can be tied to flimsy or poorly sized stays. CLEVERFIT s patent pending design eliminates these problems and enhances your collar s appearance. A Perfect Case Keeping track of collar stays can also be a challenge. So I designed the CLEVERFIT custom travel case to be the perfect time-saving organizer. Fingertip grooves make it easy to snap them in and out and the ergonomic design keeps them safe and secure and ready when you need them. On Your Dresser On Your Travels Or in Your Pocket CLEVERFIT is the ultimate collar stay, saving you valuable time and keeping your shirts looking great! It's truly the only collar stay solution you will ever need. Rewards I love t-shirts, hats and stuff. But to me, nothing could be sweeter than being one of the first people in the world to get the amazing CLEVERFIT Ambassador Set. This is why I am excited to offer my premier innovation at an attractive Kickstarter value to every level of campaign support. CLEVERFIT Ambassador Set: Includes Custom Travel Case and Four Adjustable Collar Stays. Projected Retail Price $59.50 A Helpful Note for Backers: Getting your CLEVERFIT reward will be very simple. At the end of the Kickstarter campaign a survey will be sent out to you, requesting your preferred mailing address. You can rest easy knowing your CLEVERFITs will ship as soon as they are ready! The Journey To Kickstarter I've had many extraordinary challenges to overcome in the past few years. Multiple prototypes have been designed, tested and then re-engineered, again and again. Patents, trademarks and copyrights have been filed. Numerous manufacturing methods have been evaluated. Logistical channels have been established. And a solid plan has been developed with the help of a network of hard working, very talented people to build a foundation for launching CLEVERFIT. But the most important element in this fantastic journey is that I can proudly say, "CLEVERFIT is absolutely the best collar stay in the world". Kickstarter Capital Plan CLEVERFIT is ready to be manufactured. All of the design specifications have been approved. Final prototype samples have been received and evaluated. And a detailed quality control program has been implemented. CLEVERFIT has met and exceeded all of my expectations and I can't wait to send you your very own set!

And if you have a special event or wedding planned, don't forget to honor your groomsmen with their very own CLEVERFIT Ambassador Set.
50`_________________________________________________Primo will have a new name and (hopefully) continued life after the campaign. To see updates and learn how to get the game, go to Math for Love. Thanks to all the backers who made our project a success! _________________________________________________What is Primo?Primo is a new board game that uses arithmetic to open a beautiful world of possibility. Players race to be the first to get to the center of the board while avoiding getting knocked back to the start by other players. Highlighting the power of the prime numbers, Primo is mathematical, deep, creative, and fun. The Primo game board Who is Primo For?Primo is for 2-4 players ages 10 and up. We designed Primo to inspire kids to develop a deeper mathematical understanding while mastering arithmetic. As we worked on the game, we found to our great delight that adults loved it as much kids! The basic mechanics of Primo are simple enough that kids can play and enjoy the game, but the possible strategies are complex enough that even mathematically-trained adults need to stop and think about their best move. Kids love it, adults love it, teachers love it, parents and families love it, college and graduate students love it. Even professional mathematicians love it!Why do we need your help?Initial print runs of new board games are more expensive than you might expect. We've been able to make a few prototypes, but that's all. If we get your help making our first 1000 game minimum order, we'll launch this project and get Primo out into the world. The game has been designed and play-tested; our manufacturer in Michigan is standing by. We just need your support to get the game into production. In return for your pledge, you ll get Primo or one of our other rewards heading your way as soon as the first print run is complete!How does Primo work? Primo is simple to learn! Each player controls two pawns that start at the 0 circle. Players take turns rolling two 10-sided dice and applying the values to their two pawns using any of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The first to get both pawns into the 101 circle exactly wins the game! Be careful: if another player lands on you, you get sent back to the start. Along the way, players who land on the red circles collect Primo cards some are helpful now, some are helpful later, and a few are trouble!One of the great innovations of Primo is the coloring scheme. Each of the prime numbers less than 10 has its own color: 2 is orange, 3 is green, 5 is blue, and 7 is purple. After 10, each prime number is red. Any number that is not a prime is a mix of colors that corresponds to its prime factors. For example, 14 = 2 x 7, so the 14 circle is half orange and half purple. To find 3 x 14, we just need to find the number that is made of three segments, one green, one orange, and one purple. And that's 42. (Hey, the prime factorization of 42 is 2 x 3 x 7. The colors describe the prime factors!) Combine the colors to multiply! The color coding allows players a way to quickly analyze the factors and multiples of the numbers on the board. This helps players check their multiplication and division, and even allows kids who haven't yet learned multiplication to play the game.The prime numbers above 10 play a very important role in Primo. Every time you finish a turn by landing a pawn on a prime number, you draw from a deck of 24 Primo cards. The Primo cards have various functions, with cards like: Example Primo Cards The deck also contains Keeper Cards, labeled with a digit between 1 and 9. As the name suggests, players retain Keeper cards until they decide to use them on a turn, for the purposes of adding and subtracting only. They are incredibly useful for getting pawns into the 101 circle at the end of the game, since pawns must land on 101 exactly. Primo takes roughly 10 minutes per player to play. Example Keeper Cards What do people think of the game? Read the review from Engaged Family Gaming: "Primo is a fantastic family game for the mathematically inclined and for those who like fun."Who are we?We are Math For Love, a Seattle-based math education enterprise that seeks to connect real people with real mathematics. We run classes for kids, professional development for teachers, workshops for parents, support for schools, and festivals for all, with a goal of providing meaningful, rich, and beautiful mathematical experiences.We have had enough experience in and out of the classroom to know that work needs be done in how we as a society teach and learn mathematics. We wanted to help students develop the mathematical fluency they need while giving them a chance to appreciate the beauty and power of deeper mathematics. That's why we created Primo! Why Primo?We wanted to create a game that Taught math facts Highlighted the deeper mathematics behind the facts Was so fun, it would not feel like an educational game. A lot of time in school is given to mastering multiplication and division facts, but much of that time is spent on frustrating, boring worksheets or flashcards without any deeper mathematical emphasis, and kids end up missing the beauty, the facts, and the pleasure. We created Primo to give kids a chance to develop computational mastery while embarking on a rich exploration of the underlying mathematics.Wow, this game is beautiful. What's up with the game design?We worked closely with our graphic designer, Shawn Kemna, to create an aesthetic that would be both beautiful and practical. A minimalist approach allows the mathematics to take center stage. Shawn emphasized the colors and numbers to create the final design, an elegant spiral that reinforces game play and looks great on your kitchen table. What's in the box?Your Primo game comes with the following components, manufactured to a high standard in the USA by Michigan-based DeLano Services: A quarter-fold game board of the Primo spiral Eight player pawns, in four distinct sets of two Two 10-sided dice A full set of Primo cards An instruction booklet Stretch Goals!When we reach these backer levels, everyone benefits!$25K: PDF of Multiplication Table and Hundreds Chart! We'll include these beautiful images for every backer level of five dollars or higher. $35K: Variations! We will design and test five variations of Primo that you can play on the same board. These variants will allow for easier or more challenging play, plus possibilities for cooperative games or solitaire. $75K: Reference Cards! Need to glance at a multiplication table during the game? We'll include multiplication table reference cards to make play that much easier.What is there to learn by playing Primo?We think teachers and parents will love playing Primo with kids. Without feeling "educational" the game does some heavy lifting in the classroom or around the dinner table. Here are some of the education tie-ins. Math fact practiceMany kids develop a distaste for math around the time they start memorizing multiplication tables. Primo is an inspiring way to practice math facts embedded in a rich and motivated context. The nature of numbersPrime numbers make multiplication easy. (Why does no one learn this in school?) The color-coding makes the nature of multiplication and division intuitive. You are in controlIs it better to add 8 and multiply by 3, or add 3 and multiply by 8? Analyzing an array of choices develops mathematical instincts that atrophy without the sense of ownership that comes with play. EstimationQuick estimations are required to to decide how to narrow down the options presented in a single turn. If you had to check every option, you'd be there a long time! PerseveranceWith two pawns at two different values on the board, two dice rolls, and four operations, it takes a mix of cunning and perseverance to figure out the best move. Math is creativeKids learn in school that they'll do okay in math if they follow instructions. Primo gives them a chance to play and find surprises in the numbers.

52`We re Nextbit. We made a smartphone that brings the power of the cloud to everyone with an integrated cloud OS. We made it because we re tired of waiting on others. Because we believe in a cloud-first future. And because no one else was making the phone we wanted. This is the phone we want, and we think you ll want it too. Smarter. Powerful. Bold. And, direct to you. Now we need your help. Back us to help make next a reality now. What people are saying This sleek but unassuming smartphone isn t an iPhone killer or a Galaxy killer, and it won t kill any other smartphones on the market. Instead, it s a problem killer BGR Nextbit is building a bridge between the mobile world and the one that comes next, the ambient one where everything is technology. Wired It s your phone and they re letting you do what you want with it... PhandroidIt s a new kind of smartUnlike anything before it Robin has the cloud integrated right into Android OS, and it s perfectly tuned hardware is optimized to take every advantage of it.It's supercharged with the cloudIt can do what others can t seamlessly expanding its storage online so you always have the space you need for what you want most. By tapping the unlimited potential of the cloud, Robin delivers beyond its specs. Its storage grows with youRobin intelligently adapts to your storage needs, and automatically optimizes the space on your phone when it sees you need it. By learning the apps you use and the space you need, Robin offloads the stuff you don t use to the cloud. So you can have everything you want (in the cloud), and just what you need (on your phone).Robin backs up your apps and photos whenever you re connected to power and Wi-Fi. (These are the default setting to conserve power and data, but you can change them to fit your needs.) After you ve been using it for a while and start running out of space, Robin intelligently removes apps and photos you haven t used in a while - even if you re offline. Robin knows they re already backed up safely. If you ever want an offloaded app or photo back, no problem. Just tap on it and we restore the full version right away. It s hassle free, the way everything should be. It s the future of Android Built on the newest Android, Robin will be familiar right out of the box, but you ll quickly realize it s a better experience. We like to keep things simple, and we ve taken a light touch with the look and feel, streamlining everything so it s intuitive in all the ways you want it to be, and organized so that what you want is where you need it. Because everything we do with Robin is based on up to the minute innovations on Android, it will always be running on the newest possible version. We ll do our damnedest to ship it to you running Marshmallow, unless that drops after Robin ships. Then we ll do an OTA update as soon as possible.And storage is just the beginningWith Robin you ll be on the frontier of a much bigger movement. We have big plans for future cloud-first features that will continue to intelligently enhance your experience by seamlessly adapting to how you live and work. Robin doesn t look like every other Android phone It doesn t try to fit in (except in your hand, where it fits very nicely, in fact). Robin is for people who are tired of the status quo and crave something with more personality. It s designed to feel effortless reducing clutter and increasing usability. The placement of everything is arranged so every port, button and sensor feels harmonious, symmetrical, and makes sense. It lets you know what's upFour tiny lights on the back give you subtle confirmation that Robin is connected to the cloud and working, without interrupting. Another LED on the bottom tells you when have important notifications, even if your phone is on silent and face down on a table. With a glance, you re in sync with what matters most. It's made by prosBetween us, we ve got a fair bit of experience making phones (like the G1, Nexus, Evo, HTC M7 and M8). And we ve partnered with Foxconn (the guys who build some of the most well known phones in the world) for hardware engineering and manufacturing so Robin's standout design is backed with proven quality. Put simply, Robin kicks ass. It s got a suite of technologies that work together to get more from each other, and push its performance to incredible levels. It's fast, it's powerfulRunning a premium Snapdragon processor by Qualcomm means you can trust Robin to get the job done. It only uses what you need for what you re asking it to do, so it s always running optimally (Qualcomm powers a majority of the smartphones you know and have owned, after all). It's ultra efficientRobin is engineered for long battery life, and it s designed to get you through a full day on a single charge. Our CTO, Mike (the guy who lead the power management team at Android from the start) wouldn t have it any other way. Robin manages your power based on what you use and supports quick charging. Even when it s connected to the cloud, Robin won t drain your battery. It only backs up when you re plugged in and on Wi-Fi unless you say otherwise. And it doesn t use any extra power to make more space when you need it.Robin only needs a data connection to upload (back up) your data. By default we do this when it is charging and connected to wifi, however if you are never in that situation, you can change the defaults so it backs up in less strict conditions. After Robin is backed up, it can clear space on your device with no connection at all. It s secureSecurity is super important to us, and we know it s super important to you to. Personal data is transmitted encrypted and stored encrypted on our servers. In addition, local Storage is encrypted if you choose that. We support the native disk encryption in Android. And because we re using Google s Authenticator for login to our server, you can always use 2-factor authentication. The camera is awesome too Our optical partners have world-class expertise tuning smartphone cameras, and they re bringing it to Robin to produce the best possible images from our hardware. Robin also has leading-edge phase detection autofocus. It s the newest autofocus tech you can find, that assures you ll actually get the shot you re trying to take, even when things are moving fast. Best of all, because Robin runs on the cloud, you ll be able to shoot like a pro in RAW if you want, and keep all your pro-grade assets without ever running out of space. The specs, straight up: Yes, we believe specs are more than just numbers. But we know you want those too, so here you are: Processor: Snapdragon 808 Memory: 3GB RAM / 32 GB onboard / 100 GB online Screen: 5.2 IPS LCD 1080p, Gorilla Glass 4 Rear Camera: 13MP with phase detection autofocus, dual tone flash Front camera: 5MP Battery: 2680 mAh Dual front facing stereo speakers Fingerprint sensor NFC Quick charging Bluetooth 4.0 LE WiFi A/B/G/N/AC Dimensions: 149mm x 72mm x 7mm Weight: Approx. 150g GPS enabled GSM Version (for AT&T and TMobile networks in the US; best choice for all international backers including Canada) GSM 850/900/1800/1900 HSPA 850/900/1700/1800/1900/2100 LTE Bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/8/12/17/20/28 CDMA Version (for Sprint and Verizon networks in the US) CDMA 800/1900 GSM 850/900/1800/1900 HSPA 1700/1800/1900/2100 LTE Bands 1/2/3/4/7/13/20/25/26/41 It s a superphone without the super price tag We re cutting out the middleman so you can get a super high spec phone at a great price. Every Kickstarter backer will get Robin for $50 off the retail price. And the first 1000 backers will be the lucky ones to get $100 off the retail price. No matter how you choose to get Robin, we ve got you covered under a one-year warranty that includes everything except physical damage. It s bloat free Because we re going direct to you, Robin has zero bloatware. You won t find a single 3rd party app. Just the essentials. Because what s on your phone should always be up to you, not up to us. It s available outside the US Where you live is where we want Robin to be, and we re making every effort to make Robin widely available globally (see our FAQs for a complete list of where we ship). In response to popular demand we re excited to add Australia to the list of where we ship. We hope to keep adding more countries throughout the campaign. Stay tuned! (Please keep in mind shipping costs include freight, sales tax and import duties.) And it plays nicely with others Robin comes with an unlocked bootloader and open source drivers. You can load CyanogenMod or any other ROM you want, and Robin is still under warranty - even if you brick it. We think what you run should be up to you, so we ve made it as easy as possible for you to customize Robin. And since we re not selling it to you through a carrier, you get Robin SIM unlocked too. Though our focus right now is on making sure Robin launches with the best possible software, we re super excited about the first updates you ll get when you have Robin that will give you even more ways to leverage the cloud. Once you have Robin in your hands, we ll look to you to help us decide what to work on next. We can t wait to hear what you love, what you want next and what you need most. We know Android We ve launched phones before. Lots of them, actually. Tom Moss our CEO, and Mike Chan our CTO, have been a part of Android since the beginning. Tom was Worldwide Head of Business Development and Partnerships for Android at Google until 2010. He then went on to found 2 other companies, both of which took advantage of Android technology. He bleeds green. He s got an Android superhero costume for Pete s sake. Mike led power management on Android from the start through version 3.0 (Honeycomb). He knows the system better than he knows Zoolander he does a *mean* blue steel. Mike and Tom have been bringing new features to Android together for years now. But no one compliments you on your OS, it s always the phone that matters. So Mike and Tom called Scott. He s designed some pretty well known phones so they knew he d do them right. Scott led the team at HTC that launched several acclaimed phones including the Evo, Incredible and HTC One M7 and M8. And we ve got a badass crew of fearless hackers, with real tech experience at companies you know and trust. We ve got talent. Lots of talent. And we re putting it to work for you. Timeline Smart storage at work You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Why us, why now? Because we were with Android from the start, and we know how great it can be. Because we want a phone that lives up to that potential. And because it s about damn time for a cloud-first phone. Really, we just couldn t wait any longer. So we invested our own money and time to prototype, tool and engineer Robin, to cut your wait time in half because we know you couldn t wait any longer either. We ve taken Robin as far as we can on our own, but now we need your help. We re confident in the technology we ve built into Robin, but we need to hear from you that you believe in the same future that we do and you want Robin now. Your support is proof that the world is ready for a cloud-first phone. When you back us, you ll have the first generation of cloud phones in your hand in just a few months, and you ll be integral in making next happen now. It can t happen without you. Stretch! If we can hit $1 million, we will include a quick charger with every Robin. We ve already had a ton of great feedback and questions about charging. And as our community grows, together we can make sure everyone gets the best, fastest recharge Robin can offer. Rewards
53`2014 started with a gut-wrenching break up. It was awful but so important. I made the decision to live my life a little better, prioritize myself, and music, and honesty. I did a whole bunch of changing, moved to LA, started getting healthy, got a lot happier, and wrote songs through out the whole year. Everything from when I was working up the nerve to leave, to the feeling of falling in love again, I've done my best to encapsulate in song. Hopefully you'll cry to the former and dance to the latter.This year was bananas but I have an album that I'm incredibly proud of to show for it. Help me raise the funds to put it out FOR REALWhat the money is going toward/what you'll be watching me do over the course of this kickstarter:-Mix-Master-Create Album Art-Hopefully snag an awesome PR companyThank you x 1,000,000 for your support. It's so so nuts that I am a musician for a living. Music is my favorite thing in the whole world and the only reason I'm able to make/share it is because of you incredible human beings. I am so lucky. Thank you. I already love the sloppy pre-mixes of this album, I can't wait for you to hear it, and then to meet you all when I go on tour after this CD is released!all my love-Julia
54`BoingBoing - BackerKit Staff Favorite - GIZMODO - ArtistsNetwork The LUCY is a much improved version of the classic camera lucida drawing tool, which has been used by artists and old Masters for centuries. (see the history section below). The LUCY retains all the magic of this classic device, while offering all the solutions with a larger, more stable and brighter image. You can even adjust the brightness of the image as needed. This transforms the camera Lucida from a neat device of the past into an indispensable art tool for today. When you look through the LUCY s view hole, optical mirrors create a transparent ghost image of the scene in front of you reflected down onto your canvas or paper. Just draw or paint over the reflected image to get the correct perspective, foreshortening, proportion, position, overlap, shape. Thus, leaving you more time to develop your art the way you want it without being frustrated by the technical elements. The LUCY head is injection molded in the USA with fiberglass-infused polycarbonate. All optics (mirrors and filters) are shatter resistant acrylic glass. The flex neck arm is 2 feet long by 10mm thick and made from strong lightweight steel with a black skin-like rubbery coating. The clamp is made from extruded aluminum with free-spinning rubber covered grip to keep your table protected. Large image: 19 x 27 inches (48 x 58 cm) Adjustable image brightness Adjustable height Use it while standing, sitting or at an easel Contact me if you would like a reward in another quantity or combination. If you have any questions or difficulty pledging, please send a message with the link above or call Les at 916-412-1766.Photo Projector The Photo Projector is an accessory for the LUCY that come with the $109 and higher reward tiers. The Photo Projector allows you to enlarge photos, pictures or small objects using your LUCY up to a 3x magnification. That s blowing up a 4in x 6in photo to 12in x 18in (10.2cm x 15.2cm to 30.5cm x 45.7cm). Simple and easy. The image is better than what you can get with an ordinary art projector: you don t have to work in the dark, no annoying shadow, no electricity, no risk of damaging your photo with a hot bulb. It comes with the small stand that attaches to your LUCY and a custom acrylic Fresnel lens that both enlarges and focuses the image down on your paper or canvas. Carrying Bag The handy carrying bag also comes with the $109 and higher reward tiers. It has plenty of room in the main pouch to fit your LUCY, and two outer zipper pockets perfect for storing the filters and Photo Projector. Bag measures 13.75" W x 16.25" H Below are some testimonials and examples of art made by artists using my other camera lucidas over the years. Lynne Hurd Bryant I LOVE THIS THING! I am so pleased and so excited and it is like MAGIC. It has added to my art degree training and expand what I can do. You can also sit in front of a computer screen with a digital image and use the lucida to draw it. I tried looking at some digital images through the lucida and view is 100% better than with an opaque projector. -Lynne Hurd Bryant www.lynnehurdbryant.com Darice Machel As an art teacher and owner of my own art school in Maui, I was very excited about the new LUCID-Art Camera Lucida. My first project using the Camera Lucida was an 11x14 acrylic painting of a sail boat in the Lahaina harbor. I worked from one of my photographs once I had it all alined to my satisfaction I was able to draw the image with ease. As soon as I master the use of this wonderful tool, I plan on teaching my students how to use it. They are as excited as I am and can't wait to get their hands on it. - Darice Machel www.daricemachel.com Eugene Conway "The camera lucida opens up a whole new world of possibilities. This instrument, requires a degree of patience and skill which rewards with truly amazing results which are genuinely astounding. The camera lucida reduces the time it takes to measure a subject thus enabling rapid progress for the artist." -Eugene Conway Stu Dunkel Balance of Good, 12x16 oil on masonite. Les Bruder "You feel like part of the camera, in fact you are a part of the camera; the mirror reflects the image onto a surface, the artist plays the part of the developing chemicals which fix the image on the paper. Another and perhaps greater instruction one gets from using the Lucida is practice in seeing and manipulating proportion, which, as Leonardo Di Vinci said, is divine." -Les Bruder Jim McLeod Watercolor and watercolor pencils Terry Elrod "I like to draw and paint en plein air. It's great for drawings of cityscapes to get the perspective right (even while sitting in a car), but it also works well for painting. ... In just a few minutes I'm started on a well-composed painting while my attraction to the scene is still fresh. Often I let drawn lines show through for an interesting effect." -Terry Elrod Samuel Paris "I bought the camera Lucida in the hope it would help my students learn to draw. Some students that had trouble concentrating with normal drawing instruction showed a renewed focus and showed considerable renewed effort in learning to draw. It is easy and fun to use and I would recommend you give it try. Here are some samples of portraits that I have done. The camera is a big time-saver and makes getting a likeness much easier." -Mr. Samuel Paris The Lost Secrets of the Old Masters: This is a very interesting interview with David Hockney, where he explains and demonstrates the use of camera obscuras and camera lucidas in the artwork of the Old Masters chronicled in his book Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters . Here is David Hockney's Secret Knowledge Documentary: Here is some of the scientific evidence for Hockney's theory: Some of My Camera Lucida Designs Over the Years. Other Products I've Created (click images to find out more): The LUCID-Art Camera Obscura The ZOEFLIX The sourcing, manufacturing, assembly, and fulfillment for all the rewards will be done by my manufacturing partner, Practical Industries Inc., under my close supervision in their 35,000sq ft facility in Stockton California (less then 2 hour outside San Francisco). Part of Practical Industries' Shop Over the years, Practical Industries and I have built thousands of my camera lucidas in smaller runs and fulfilled my 2014 ProjectorARM Kickstarter project, so the relationship is set up and ready to build as many LUCYs as we need. For the LUCY head (the main part with all the optics) we have the mirror and half-silvered mirror that go inside sourced from US companies: ready to order as soon as we need them. The LUCY head is injection molded with fiber-reinforced polycarbonate in Sacramento, CA. The mold has already been built, so we know the parts will come out perfect because we have been using this mold to make the older style LUCYs with the steal rod for a couple years now. The process to make the LUCY head will, for the most part, be just a matter of running the same tested a proven process we have been using. We will be making a couple small tweaks though. One is that the placement of a hole will be moved slightly to make the LUCY head fit with the new flex neck arm. And we are equipping all the screws in the LUCY head with built-in internal tooth lock washers to help them grab tighter and hold together better. For the new flex neck arm and aluminum clamp, we are going to leverage the mass produced flex neck arm products made overseas to keep the costs down as much as we can. I have been working with one of Practical Industries long time business contacts in China to get this new arm produced. They have most of the components they need to produce the arm from other products they are currently building. It is just a matter of putting them together according to my specifications, and fabricating one new piece that will go on the end of the flex neck arm, which attaches to the LUCY head.They have already provided a prototype (pictured in the video and campaign page), and now we just need an order large enough to get it produced. And that is why we are on Kickstarter to get the funding it will take to order a large shipment of the new flex arms with clamps and to product an equal number of LUCY heads to go with them.Also as part of this project, Practical Industries will be doing a run of my Photo Projectors to go with the LUCY rewards that include them. The Photo Projector is made all in house. Practical Industries punches, forms and powder-coats the parts, then assembles and boxes the finished product. So once we get the funding, we will place the orders for the mirrors, half-silvered mirrors, laser cut neutral density optical filters, and injection molded LUCY heads from our US based suppliers. And we will place the order for the flex neck arm with clamp from our supplier in China. All the components should be delivered to Practical Industries' Stockton facility with in 7 to 10 weeks. Then the LUCYs will be assembled and professionally packaged within 4 to 6 weeks before being shipped to you by June or July of 2016. Check us out on Kicktraq
55`Although our Kickstarter campaign is over, you can still order emberlight at emberlight.co! Emberlight wants to make it easier and more affordable for you to enjoy the benefits of a connected bulb by offering a product that works with your existing lightbulbs. "One obvious benefit is that by keeping the bulb separate from the smarts, you won't need to throw out (and replace) that smart hardware just because the bulb breaks or burns out." Adding smart lights to your home doesn t have to mean buying expensive new bulbs Wouldn't it be great if you could take any dimmable light bulb and make it "smart"? That's the idea behind emberlight If you think it would be handy to control your home's lighting through your mobile device but you've still got a box full of ordinary light bulbs in the closet, emberlight bids itself as the solution A San Francisco-based startup with a simple idea; create an attachment that can turn any lightbulb into a smart bulb. emberlight fits to you and your life Easy to setup. No wiring required. No hub required. Simply add emberlight to any light bulb and it's installed. Our mobile app steps you through the simple WiFi connection. Easy to use. Once installed,our free app gives you on, off, and dim control of your lights through your smartphone. Easy to understand. emberlight uses the light bulbs and sockets you already own. emberlight is flexible and smart Understands proximity. emberlight can turn your lights on and off automatically without taking your phone out of your pocket. Understands scale. Add emberlight to your home at your own pace. Since there is no hub or pro installation required, you can start small without worry and add additional units later. Understands mobility. emberlight can move with you when you go to a new apartment or home. emberlight also decouples the evolving technology of light bulbs from the ability to control your lights giving you the ability to use any bulb. emberlight works for you Values safety. Whether you re away on vacation or you return home by yourself, emberlight understands safety. We can turn your lights on remotely or respond to your location as it relates to your house so that you return to a warmly lit home. Values automation. Set up presets with emberlight and enhance the time you spend at home. Quickly enjoy presets like dinner party or movie night. Values saving. Emberlight can slightly dim your lights so that you don t notice a difference but the power grid does. We ve been prototyping for almost a year now, and we are close to being able to do our first production run. We ve built a team based on diverse expertise, experience, and passion. We want you to share in emberlight's vision to bring simple and versatile smart lighting to every home. We know competitors exist in the lighting space. Big guys. Ok, let s rephrase that... REALLY big guys. But thats OK, because we re taking a different approach. As a startup, we have the ability to build a product from the ground up without legacy bias. We decided that we don t need to push the mainstream connected LED product like everyone else and can build something more flexible that works for everyone. People say "hardware is hard," and it should be left to the big boys.

56`Please Note: The Anova Precision Cooker will have support for Android, iOS, AND Windows mobile devices. To use the Anova Precision Cooker, you simply attach it to a pot, put your food in a ziplock bag and set the time and temperature. The Precision Cooker circulates water around the pot, ensuring a consistent temperature throughout. AND, the Precision Cooker Connects to your phone, allowing you to cook amazing meals by simply touching a button. The food is amazing, tender, and moist, every time.Watch Chef Ming Tsai talk about the Anova Precision Cooker and precision cooking / sous vide: Background on Precision Temperature Cooking (Sous Vide)Once limited to the world's best restaurants, precision temperature cooking (sous vide) is now the fastest growing kitchen appliance category. Last year was a huge year for precision temperature cooking, as it was the first year that precision temperature cooking devices became very affordable for home chefs. The Anova Precision Cooker represents the next evolution of precision temperature cooking technology, making it easy and affordable for anyone to reap the benefits of this type of cooking. Did you know that precision cooking (sous vide) is used in the majority of high-end restaurants?Most people don't know how pervasive precision cooking is, but it's now used by a majority of high-end restaurants. It's also used at chain establishments, such as Chipotle.While high-end restaurants have been using precision cooking for years, the technique has only become popular with home chefs in the past four to five years with the advent of reality cooking shows. Despite the publicity from these cooking shows, until last year, most sous vide devices were still too expensive for home chefs, as models cost between $500 and $1,000. Anova was the first company to begin selling an affordable device for the home chef, with a price of only $199. Now, precision cookers / sous vide devices are the fastest growing kitchen appliance category.What does sous vide mean?For years people have called this type of cooking sous vide, which is French for "under vacuum." This refers to the process of vacuum sealing food and putting it in a water-bath. However, that's a bit of a misnomer. You don't need to vacuum seal your food to cook sous vide. Instead, this technique is really about bringing food to a very precise temperature and holding it there for a period of time. A better name for this technique, then, is "precision temperature cooking" or "precision cooking" for short. That's why we've named our system the Anova Precision Cooker. How it WorksPrecision cooking is extremely easy. It usually involves these three simple steps:1. Attach the Precision Cooker to a pot and set time and temp. Use the simple interface to set the time and temperature. Or, you can use the app to find what you're cooking and just hit "start."2. Put food in a ziplock bag and then you clip it to the side of the pot. Simply put your food in a sealable bag. The circulator moves water around the pot, ensuring a consistent temperature throughout3. Finish by sear, grilling or broiling. Some people like to finish their cook by searing their food, throwing it on the grill, or by broiling it. This gives the food a nice look.The Advantages of Precision Temperature CookingPrecision cooking produces results that are impossible through any other technique. Precision cooking gives important advantages over traditional methods, including the following benefits: Consistency. Because you cook your food to a precise temperature for a precise amount of time, you can expect very consistent results. Taste. Food cooks in its juices. This ensures that the food is moist, juicy and tender. Waste reduction. Traditionally prepared food dries out and results in waste. For example, on average, traditionally cooked steak loses up to 40% of its volume due to drying out. Steak cooked via precision cooking, loses none of its volume. Don't worry about overcooking. Traditional cooking can require your constant attention. Precision cooking brings food to an exact temperature and holds it. There is no worry about overcooking. Precision cooked steak vs. traditional steakSteak cooked via precision cooking is done perfectly edge to edge. In the image below, you can see that the steak on the right appears smaller. That steak was pan-cooked. In comparison, the steak on the left was cooked by the Anova Precision Cooker and it is consistent from edge-to-edge. Precision cooked eggs vs. eggs cooked traditionallyPrecision cooking eggs allows you to control how eggs turn out. Traditionally cooked eggs are a bit of a crap shoot. It's very difficult to time them perfectly to get the desired result. Salmon cooked traditionally vs. precision cooked salmonMuch like steak, fish cooked by the Anova Precision Cooker is done perfectly, edge-to-edge. When pan cooked, the surface temperature of the pan is higher than the ideal cooking temperature, resulting in the edges being overcooked. Everything Tastes Better When Cooked PerfectlyIt's not just steak, fish, and eggs that come out better when cooked with the Anova Precision Cooker. Chicken comes out moist and tender. Vegetables are bright and flavorful. Pork is tender and juicy. The Anova Precision Cooker can be used on a wide variety of foods and the results are delicious and healthy. Our StoryJeff Wu has been using immersion circulation technology since the age of 13. While still in college, Jeff became an engineer for a scientific equipment manufacturer and started working with classmate, Natalie Vaughn on designing and selling scientific equipment. Jeff has always been obsessed with two things: (1) designing and building laboratory equipment and (2) cooking. He had no idea that two could go together until on a visit to Harvard in 2007, he saw two grad students using laboratory-grade circulators to cook. Not long after that visit, Jeff tried to build his own device to cook sous vide-style meals. He also began using lab equipment to cook sous vide. Jeff became determined to build a sous vide device for the home chef. In 2010, he did just that and created an early proof-of-concept of an affordable home sous vide.The Proof-of-Concept Anova IIn 2013, Jeff teamed up with Natalie to launch Anova Culinary, LLC. The first product, was the Anova 1. At $199, the Anova 1 became the first affordable immersion circulator for the home chef. The reception for the first commercial unit was overwhelming. . . ."So is it amazing? Yes. I m kind of hooked." - TechCrunch"If you're looking to get into sous vide, the way to go is the Anova sous vide circulator." The Sweethome"[Anova] is the one to beat" - WIRED"The Anova Sous Vide Immersion Circulator is an easy to use device that both beginners and pros will enjoy." - CNET We Can Do BetterDespite the popularity of the Anova 1, we wanted to do better. We felt we could improve upon the following three major areas:(1) The price. We think this type of technology should be affordable to everyone. We want to work to produce a unit that is extremely affordable.(2) The unit must be more flexible. One of the limitations to current systems is that they require tall pots, which limits the type of equipment you can use with the device and makes its use somewhat cumbersome.(3) The Precision Cooker should be a connected device. The interface should move to the iPhone, making the device even easier to use. People shouldn't have to search for hours for time and temperature settings. They should be able to hit a button and start cooking. The Redesign In addition to our three chief goals (low-price, flexibility, and connectivity), we also wanted to incorporate many suggestions from our users. The result is a redesigned system, specifically tailored to meet the unique needs of the home chef. It s simple, yet powerful, flexible and accurate. It s incredibly light, weighing only 2.5 lbs. Its small, and easy to store. It truly represents a breakthrough in precision temperature cooking devices.The ClipWe ve redesigned the clip, so that it s detachable from the system. It s secure, but flexible. You can use the device with virtually any pot or container. Vectoring / 360 Degree PumpThe clip allows the unit to turn, which means you can point the pump flow to any direction This gets water to flow around the pot, ensuring a consistent temperature throughoutInterfaceThe interface is completely new and incredibly easy to use. You slide the wheel up and down to change the temperature. Then you press start. Bluetooth ConnectedThe unit is Bluetooth enabled, which for the first time ever allows you to cook perfect meals with your smartphone. Removable SkirtAnova has a removable skirt, which allows you to take off the bottom and clean it in the dishwasher. MaterialsThe unit is made of polycarbonate and stainless steel. Stainless steel parts prevent rust and corrosion and last for ages.Connectivity and AppsThe iPhone App makes it incredibly easy to cook with Anova. You simply find the food you re cooking, adjust the settings if you d like, and hit start. There s no need to search for time and temperature settings. It will all be programmed into your phone. We re going to release an SDK, so that people can develop their own apps to work with Anova. We anticipate people will make nutritional apps, apps that make it easy to share what you re cooking with others, recipe apps, and time and temperature apps. We want you to be able to input what you ve got in the fridge and simply touch a button to begin cooking the perfect meal.Watch Kenji Lopez from Serious Eats interview Jeff about the Anova Precision Cooker: What Others Kindly Say Pricing, Availability, and Specifications Pricing & Availability: Product Price: $169 Estimated Availability: October 2014 Finish: Black (Brushed / Machined) White (Brushed / Machined) Performance: Temperature Range: 77 F to 210 F 0.01 F / 25 C to 99 C 0.01 C Pump Speed: 1 - 1.2 GPM 7-8 LPM (still optimizing) Directional Pump: 360 degree directional pump Tank Capacity: 4-5 Gallon 15-19 Liters Timer: 99 hours Max Safety: Bi-Metal Fuse Power Input: 110-120VAC (220-240V EU) Heating Power: 800W Bluetooth wireless Estimated Weight and Dimensions: Length: 2.75 in / 6.98 cm Width: 2.75 in / 6.98 cm Height: 14.75 in / 36.8 cm Immersion Depth: 7.25 in / 18.415 cm Max Clamp Opening: 1.25 in / 3.175 cm Minimum Immersion Depth: 2.5 Inches / 6.35 cm Weight: 2.5 lbs / 1.1 kg Sensors: Wet Sensor Auto-shut off Temp sensor Display and Controls: LED Display Temperature Display C & F readout Timer HH:MM Scroll wheel Increment/Decrement 24/7 display Materials: Body: Polycarbonate Skirt: Polycarbonate/Stainless in Late Q4 Transparent bottom piece: Polycarbonate Cleaning: Removable skirt Dishwasher safe skirt Easy twist disassemble In the Box: Precision Cooker Cord Manual Our MissionEverything we do is to make this type of technology and this cooking technique accessible. In turn, we hope to give people incredible culinary experiences. To achieve our mission, our systems need to be very affordable and dead simple to use. Status Progress The redesign of Anova began in September 2013. Since that time, we've gone through several product iterations to get to the design that we feel is ideal for the home chef. We've completed the design and engineering and created a prototype, using our own 3D printing machines. What's leftTo complete this project we need to finish our injection molding and begin final production of the units. We need to finish development of the connected device which will allow for the machine to communicate with smartphones via Bluetooth. We need a Community to Realize Our GoalsWe're extremely thankful for the support we've received from customers. But we need even more support to make sure that we can continue to provide a product that is an amazing value.

57`CURRENT BACKERS: Do not use the pre-order link on our website. In a few weeks, you will get further instructions via email from us where you can enter your delivery address and order more Odins if you'd like. Our timeline below is still accurate and we will send updates as we head towards production. The above link is for people who did not back our Kickstarter only. We're funded! Thank you, Kickstarter! Please follow us on Facebook, Twitter or by email:Website http://www.updogtoys.comFacebook http://facebook.com/UpDogToysTwitter http://twitter.com/UpDogToysEmail Newsletter http://eepurl.com/ZVnBH Dogs don't care how their toys look, they just want to play. So why not make a beautiful dog toy, something that complements your home? With this in mind and other ideas on improving our dog's favorite toys, we created The Odin, a puzzle treat toy that is beautiful for your home and fun for your dog.The Odin is the first in a series of toys we hope to make to keep your dog happy and your home looking great. The Odin engages dogs on multiple levels, giving them mental stimulation and physical activity. It's a type of toy that dogs are always interested in. If your dog enjoys food, they will enjoy The Odin. Simply place treats inside The Odin and, as your dog plays, treats will fall out. Dogs of all shapes and sizes can play with The Odin. We've seen dogs pick it up and drop it, use their nose to push it around and knock it around with their paws. Whether they are tall or short, have a big nose or small nose, all dogs have found a way to get the treats out.Watch the famous French Bulldog, Sir Charles Barkley, play with the Odin for the first time: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Minimal, modern design inspired by geometric shapes and art combining aesthetics and functionality. After many drawings, CADs, paper and 3D printed prototypes we created a durable and beautiful shape, exceeding even our expectations of not compromising on any aspect of the toy. Connect multiple toys to add variation and increase difficulty to make play time longer. With two or more connected, the toy will not roll as easily, there are less holes for treats to come out of and the treats are in different compartments. Also, more treats in total can be put into multiple balls versus just one so you don't need to refill as often. Connect more toys or change treats to make the toy new again for your dog. Flaps allow treats to easily be placed in but not fall out and four differently sized holes allow treats to spill out at varying rates. This gives your dog the option to lick the treats through the flaps or roll it. Change the size of the dog treats you place inside to make it easier or harder on your dog based on their personality and ability. All dog toys spend a lot of time in their mouths and so we took great care in choosing a material that is tough, food safe, latex free and phthalates free. We chose a more expensive material to give you a better quality product that will last longer and is even dishwasher safe. You should always supervise your dog when playing with any toy though. They like the attention! Safe for dogs big and small. We made sure it wasn't too small or weak to be easily broken by a big dog but not too heavy for small dogs either. Dimensions: 3.6in x 3.3in x 3.8in. Holds 1 cup of food. Since we're a dog toy company we are focusing on primarily offering our toy with discounts in lieu of stickers and t-shirts. We do have some special awards for higher level backers but our focus is on giving you the best deal possible, especially on 2+ toys since we designed The Odin to be used in groups of 2 and 3 and plan to have our next toy connect to The Odin as well.We are prioritizing delivery of orders $35 or more, so if you want your toy faster then please consider a higher tier/getting more toys. The dynamics of the toy truly change when going from 1 Odin to 2+ Odin's. We've seen dogs play with the toy differently based on how many Odin's are connected. Otherwise, an extra Odin will be a great gift to other dogs in your life.All Backer amounts include shipping inside the U.S. For international shipping, select the reward and your location to get the shipping cost. Your pledges go towards our goal of $25,000. This is the bare minimum to cover $9000 in tooling costs, $10,000 in manufacturing and freight and the other $6,000 covers packing supplies, storage, shipping the product to you and Kickstarter and credit card fees. We are only offering one color but would like to produce multiple colors of The Odin. Right now we are only offering slate but we'd also like to produce coral and black. If we reach $35,000 we will offer another color. Unless stated otherwise, you will receive a slate color toy. All photos and videos shown are the final prototype. We will be making the actual product through a process called injection molding. While we may make small adjustments for manufacturing, we do not plan on making any major changes to the aesthetics of the toy.

Here you go! Our Vision The classic turn-based strategy exciting, involved gaming that calls for long-term planning, clever tactics, transparent rules and tough decisions is making a comeback. Many gamers may have seen and enjoyed recent examples of great turn-based gaming, but might not be aware of classics like Battle Isle or Advance Wars. Have you ever wondered what games of that calibre would look like today?Well, we did. And as a result, we decided to bring back this great genre with its unique gameplay experience. For ourselves, for you and for all other gamers out there interested in turn-based strategy. Pre-Alpha Screenshot (February 2013) So, let's do this. Let us develop something we are all passionate about: turn-based gameplay, pure and simple; a strategy game for experienced gamers. A stand-alone game for PC, Mac and Linux, that can also be played in all relevant browsers via plug-in. With Battle Worlds: Kronos you'll get: True, challenging turn-based strategy gameplay. Get the FULL game in a box or as a download, nothing less. No DLC scheme, no micro-transactions. No DRM. No always-on necessity. Pinkie swear. Pre-Alpha Screenshot (February 2013) What s In The Game?Here are some of the key features that will be in the game: Single Player Campaigns - Fight for the "Yerla" faction, a highly technologized army. For the Rebels, make do with what you ve got and fight a guerilla war. Together both campaigns will allow for more than 30 hours of gameplay. Single Player Challenge Maps - Test your skills in different combat scenarios and keep track of your progress.Live Multiplayer - Battle your friends live on the interent or via hot-seat.Asynchronous Multiplayer - Take all the time you need and consider your moves . Similar to play-by-mail , your round is stored on our server and turned over to your opponent. The system allows you to continue the match anytime and anywhere you want.Strong AI - A clever AI that considers gameplay on various tactical and strategic levels as well as individual enemy characteristics will challenge even experienced commanders. Map Editor - A powerful editor to create your own maps and missions (Windows only). There will be around 40 different units and buildings in the game, many of which can be upgraded to obtain new capabilities What Are The Core Gameplay Mechanics?Staying true to turn-based strategy, Battle Worlds: Kronos is all about using your units and resources to the greatest possible effect. In order to win, you will need to consider factors like the positioning of units, attack range, armament and equipped upgrades.Victory or defeat - your tactics will decide. We are using in-game cutscenes to tell the story of the campaings. All units in the game have a unique character, setting them apart from all other units and giving them well-defined strengths and weaknesses. You can further individualize them by assigning specific upgrades. Most units allow for two leveled upgrades, each with two options to choose from. The campaign sometimes allows you to take some of your victorious units with you and improve them over the course of several missions. Upgrade units according to your personal needs and style of play! Multiplayer, Community & TournamentsMultiplayer: While you will be able to battle your friends (and foes) in realtime, just like you are used to in other games, it's the asynchronous multiplayer mode that really gets us going. Playing Battle Worlds: Kronos across platforms and in asynchronous mode means that the game is with you anywhere, anytime. You can spend days and weeks fighting epic battles against opponents all over the world. Play a turn, transfer it to the server and let your enemy make his move. Take your time while taking turns and fighting for victory! For us, this is the coolest aspect of the game. Community: We will gather a community of turn-based strategists around the game, supporting it with a forum, a match-making system and a game ladder system. Additionally, we will provide a game editor, which will enable the community to create their own maps for single or multiplayer battles. Tournaments: As a recurring highlight for the community we are planning tournaments of different sizes, where players can compete beyond the game ladder. What is the schedule? As early as one month after the successful close of the Kickstarter campaign you can play your first alpha version of the game - if you backed the project with $75 or more. Other backers will be able to join the closed beta version before open beta starts. We are planning to release the game end of 2013. Our Stretch-GoalsThanks to the community for providing ideas for our stretch goals! Who Is KING Art And Can You Guys Really Do It?KING Art is an independent game developer from Bremen, Germany. KING Art was founded 12 years ago and we have worked on over 40 games projects, around 10 of them the same size or bigger than Battle Worlds: Kronos . So yes, we can do it. We have extensive experience with projects of this kind. Most of our projects had been contract work for publishers. But as often as possible we do projects close to our heart like the adventure game The Book of Unwritten Tales and now Battle Worlds: Kronos . Most of us have worked together for years - oddly enough we still like each other. Why Kickstarter?Once upon a time we created an alpha stage version of the game and tried to find a publisher to finance the project. Unfortunately, most of the industry did not see the potential, or if they did, they offered us a budget that would have been too low and meant cut-backs on our vision of what the game could be. Kickstarter offers us the opportunity to make the game we have envisioned - all options included. And not by order of a publisher, but backed by you, the players! If we can realize this, it was well worth the wait. Above: Artworks of units from the first Battle Worlds: Kronos prototype Is The Budget Big Enough To Make A Great Game?Nope ;-) Sorry, it just isn't. The full game with all the features we want will cost more than the sum we want to raise through Kickstarter. The Kickstarter share is only about 1/3 of the whole thing. We've spend as much of our own money on the game as possible and we'll work long evenings and on the weekends for this project. But for outsourcing costs (music, effects, some of the arts, voice acting) we need cash. And that's where we need your help. Your contribution will make this project possible, it will ensure our vision of a great game. I Want To Help! What Can I Do?First of all we have to mount the financing of the game. So: Please back the project generously, and spread the word about it! As a backer you have the opportunity to actively participate in the development of the game and collaborate with others on our homepage www.battle-worlds.com. Starting... now!

Over the past 5 years, WiFi data usage has increased 100x, and the technology behind it is struggling to keep up. While router manufacturers have increased their maximum speed limits, they have not addressed the primary cause of poor performance: traffic and congestion.Billions of WiFi devices now compete for the limited radio airwaves we all share, causing invisible traffic jams and congestion, making WiFi slower and more unreliable than ever. Portal is the first and only router specifically engineered to cut through and avoid congestion, delivering consistent, high-performance WiFi with greater coverage throughout your home. Its proprietary spectrum turbocharger technology provides access to 300% more of the radio airwaves than any other router, improving performance by as much as 300x, and range and coverage by as much as 2x in crowded settings, such as city homes and multi-unit apartments. Spectrum is a beautiful thing. Spectrum is at the heart of how wireless works. The more of it you have, the faster and more reliable your Internet experience. Why your WiFi sucks... the problem of crowds. Think of spectrum like the lanes of highway. Most home WiFi routers today operate on just one shared WiFi lane; maybe two if you're lucky. If you live in a city or apartment, your WiFi network could be competing with 35 or more neighboring WiFi networks. And the problem isn t just the number of neighboring WiFi networks, it's also what they re doing. A single neighbor running a bit torrent, or simply folks all streaming HD video at 8pm every night can consume most of the spectrum you all share. This is called congestion, and it's like being stuck in rush hour traffic all the time. Spectrum Turbocharger. Portal s unique FCC-certified technology (FastLanes ) enables your WiFi network to operate in a special protected portion of the 5GHz radio spectrum that was originally reserved for weather radar systems. This is a huge swathe of spectrum, about 3x wider than the spectrum conventional WiFi uses today, and it's relatively uncrowded which enables your WiFi data to speed past your neighbor's WiFi data that is stuck in congested traffic. FastLanes is like having your own private highway to the internet! And Portal has other unique and super-cool technologies, like SmartLanes which actively monitors for congestion and intelligently changes WiFi lanes steer around network congestion to give you a reliable, uninterrupted and hassle-free Internet experience. SmartLanes is like driving that private highway in a super agile sports car.And best of all, Portal works seamlessly with all the WiFi connected devices you already have. Did you know that congestion also saps your coverage? Ever wonder why Netflix and Youtube work great from your bedroom in the afternoon, but at 8pm it slows to a crawl everywhere except in the same room as your router? Don't blame your internet, it's probably your WiFi. Rate versus Range. WiFi coverage is like a waterfall, the taller the waterfall the stronger the flow of water further away, meaning that a strong router will allow you to enjoy your streaming video or gaming experience at the furthest corners of your house. This is called rate versus range, and yes the actual measurements do look like a waterfall. Bigger and more antennas certainly help, but in congested environments like city homes and multi-unit apartments, even big antennas can't cope with effects of congestion. Think of congestion like a big wall that blocks your data flow, leaving you only a trickle of internet goodness that now reaches only half the distance it did before your neighbors all came home and started watching "Game of Thrones". More Speed and More Range! Portal's ability to operate in uncrowded spectrum that is virtually empty of congestion, together with nine (9) powerful antennas, enables your network to reach every corner of your home with no dead zones consistently any time of day or night, even in the most crowded environments. Enjoy greater speed, greater coverage, and lower latency than your neighbors. Stop waiting and start enjoying your media or gaming the way it was meant to be experienced. Say goodbye to unsightly antennas. Can a powerful router be sexy? Absolutely. You don t need ugly dead bug antennas to achieve range and coverage. Portal cleverly folds nine (9) powerful and very specialized antennas into a smooth aerodynamic body for a clean elegant design. Together with ten (10) state-of-the-art radios and advanced technologies like MU-MIMO Beamforming, Portal achieves amazing range and coverage rivaling any "dead bug" external antenna router today. A single Portal can offer complete coverage for a home of approximately 2500 sq. ft. And two Portals can be daisy-chained together using our proprietary enterprise-grade mesh technology to extend your network range up to 200 ft or more; more than enough to cover large or multi-story homes up to 5000 sq.ft.Power and Beauty with no compromises. You'll never have to hide your router again. Simple one-touch smartphone setup, secure dynamic guest networks, real-time notifications and remote management enable frustration-free setup and effortless management of your network, because we believe that your router shouldn t get in the way of an awesome Internet experience. Enterprise-grade Security. We made Portal secure with enterprise-grade security technologies to protect your network and your family s Internet experience 24/7. Proprietary Rolling Code dynamic secure Guest Networks, easy smartphone setup Continuous Intrusion Monitoring and remote alerts to smartphone Ultra-secure Web GUI interface with proprietary 2-factor authentication for (optional) 'old school' control by super users. Other Functions VPN for secure remote access WiFi Protected Access (WPA/WPA2 PSK) Parental Controls to manage web filtering and accessibility Double firewall protection (SPI and NAT) Don't just take our word for it, let us show you Portal in action. Head-to-head versus the best router's available today, Portal consistently performs above and beyond in speed, simplicity, and latency with virtually no buffering or lag. (The details: Portal versus Netgear R7800, two Apple iPad Air 2, measured at distance of 33 feet plus 2 walls, Ookla Speed Test, Netflix HD ("Marseille") and ultraHD-4K ("Moving Art: Forests") video streaming, two Xbox One (PC Streaming) + Gears of War) We've worked hard to produce the highest quality WiFi experience that technology can offer.

Our team is made up of people, like you, who know how frustrating WiFi has become. That's why we decided it was time to make it better. As engineers, we're passionate about technology and beautiful design. We ve been together for nearly a decade building WiFi and Bluetooth solutions for some of the most iconic names in consumer electronics.We became frustrated that the industry wasn't solving the real problems that were making WiFi networks slower, less reliable and overly complicated. With billions of WiFi devices competing for bandwidth, WiFi has slowed to a crawl. So we started our own company to fix this problem and Portal is our solution. With your help, Portal will begin its journey from our team to your home, where it can dramatically improve your WiFi and your life. Here are some of the key events that will happen once we've reached our Kickstarter goal.
60`What's the story? Traveler (left) & Origin (right) Code and Quill was started with a single goal: make beautiful notebooks for creatives. We believe that there are brilliant people of all kinds out there: developers, designers, artists, engineers, creators, and thinkers. As creatives, we know that there are a lot of fantastic digital tools out there to help bring our ideas to life. But what about those tools that we use off the screen? There's a certain freedom in taking pen to paper in order to express the thoughts that we have, as we have them. We found that, while there are many notebooks of all shapes and sizes out there, none truly embodied the characteristics we found important for our work. And so we decided that we'd make them. Let's talk about our notebooks. Our work is a reflection of who we are, and it was important that we made these notebooks to be the perfect companion for creatives who not only need something functional, but also attractive. It's not enough just to throw some shoddy paper into some pieces of cardboard and call it a notebook (though that does seem to be the "industry standard"). Our two notebooks, the Origin and the Traveler, were designed to offer a great set of useful features without going overboard. The paper is thick and durable, ready for your ideas no matter where you may have them. The binding is sewn with quality thread, and constructed in a way to allow the notebooks to lie flat, no matter what page you're on. Of course, it was important that the pages themselves provided a unique way to categorize your thoughts. The left-side pages of our notebooks all have a dot grid to allow for sketches, drawings, and wireframes. The right-side pages all contain our special Indentation Rule, which provides a narrow ruling with vertical dash-marks every 5 millimeters to allow notes, lists, paragraphs, and code to be properly indented and neatly kept. We could go on and on, but as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words: Lays flat! Show me what I can get!It doesn't matter how much you pledge; we appreciate every little bit of support we get! The more people that show interest, the more great stuff we can bring to you. Without further adieu, here are the rewards!Note: We'll collect all the color choices of our backers at the end of the campaign. Stretch Goals!

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Meet the Guitar Triller, a new hand-held accessory for guitar and bass players, carefully designed for striking strings in a powerful and expressive way. With three different playing positions and dozens of useful techniques, the Guitar Triller goes beyond picks and fingers to introduce entirely new sounds to your music. The Guitar Triller is built on the foundation of control, comfort, and functionality to give you a world of new creative possibilities. If you re like us, you ve probably tried to get new sounds out of your guitar by hitting your strings with whatever was lying around -- a screwdriver, a pen, maybe a drumstick. Most likely the things you ve tried haven t worked well!We made the Guitar Triller to show you how awesome string striking can be when you use something that s perfectly designed for the job. We considered everything from ergonomics to string tension and guitar mechanics to put these amazing sounds at your fingertips with one innovative accessory. Add a Guitar Triller to your creative toolbox and discover a brand new set of sounds. We didn t invent string striking: in fact, it s played a huge part in the history of stringed instruments for hundreds of years. Many early harps, zithers, and dulcimers could be played with any combination of fingers, picks or striking hammers. Somewhere along the way, guitars lost this important way of playing, leaving us with just picks and fingers and leaving out a whole category of amazing sounds! To introduce striking back into the mix, we ve completely reimagined traditional striking hammers in every aspect of the design to make them perfect for playing modern guitar or bass. See some first time reactions You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Most guitarists find it easy to produce basic trills, tremolos, and harmonic effects with the Guitar Triller after just a few minutes. However, really mastering the techniques -- and letting the new textures permeate your creative process -- will take some time. Just like when you were learning to play with fingers or a pick, practice makes perfect! We ve identified tons of distinct effects and sounds that can be created using the Guitar Triller, and we re sure that you ll discover even more. The most exciting part of introducing a new accessory to the guitar and bass community is hearing the exciting new music that that you will create with it! Be a part of the movement!

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 This is a movement towards a third way to interact with your strings, to play in a different method, and get different sounds than fingers and picks. The reactions from our first round of testers have reaffirmed the need and excitement for this product. By backing our campaign, you ll become part of our story in helping us manufacture our very first production run. With your help, we will cut a P20 steel mold for injection molding, use high grade durable ABS with added filler material, and most importantly unleash a new sound to the guitar and bass community. Join us on this epic creative journey! Together, we can make a great product and forever change the way the guitar is played.
62`Thank you all for your support! If you missed us during the campaign, click on the link below to go to XYFindIt.com to order XY for yourself. XYFindIt.com XY is the stylish, affordable, and secure iBeacon compatible Tag for iPhone and Android that makes finding things easy. 10 minutes a day.The average person spends 10 minutes a day trying to find lost things. That means that on average, you spend over 4 hours a month, 2 days each year, and 6 months of your life trying to find things you own. With XY, you can keep of track everything important to you, and take back that time.What is XY?XY is a Bluetooth LE powered tracking tag that you can put on anything important to you. The tag syncs with your smartphone to help you keep track of all the things that matter to you. You can attach as many XY tags to your phone as you like, and can easily find your nearby tags. XY is perfect for putting on your keys, purse, tablet, and luggage. The small stylish design lets you keep track of all your things, and the secure server ensures that you control who is able to see your items. XY is also the best way to keep track of your pets. You can easily attach an XY tag to your pet's collar, and know if they leave the house and feel secure in knowing that if they wander off, XY will let you know. How it WorksThe XY app listens to nearby Bluetooth LE signals. When the app finds a new tag, it checks our servers see what information about the tag is available to you. If you are not permitted to see the tag, it will not show up on your list. 1) Find-It: By activating Find-It mode, you can track any tag that is within range of your phone. The on-screen indicator will show you as you get closer to the tag, and will help you find your misplaced item. If the item is not within range, the app will show you where it was seen last. 2) Keep-It: For anything you want to ensure is always by your side, you can activate Keep-It mode, and your phone will alert you if you move out of range of the tag. In Keep-It mode, you will never leave something important behind again. 3) Lost-It: You can mark any tag as lost right from the app. Once it has been set as lost, XY will alert other users if they come across the item, or can just tell you where the item was just seen. Affordable enough for your keys. Secure enough for everything that mattersThe two most important things we have been working on during the development of XY are Security and Affordability. We believe that it is of the utmost importance that any item you use to keep track of your things is secure. To keep your items safe, we utilize a rotating cipher to keep the information about your tag secure. The only people who will be able see your tags are the ones that you have given permission. We also believe that it is very important to keep the price of each unit as low as possible, so you can afford to keep track of all the things that matter. We have been talking to many different manufacturers, and can effectively keep the price of the units down by purchasing a large volume of components. This inventory requirement is the single biggest reason we need your help. CompatibilityXY uses Bluetooth LE technology, and is compatible with iOS7 devices, as well as Android devices that are equipped with Android version 4.3 and above. ColorsWhen we ship, XY will be available in the following colors: Development TimelineWe have been hard at work on this for the last 18 months, and we are nearing completion. Proof of Concept: We started this project by setting up 2 phones to send/receive Bluetooth signals. From this, we were able to show that we could set a device to alert when another was out of range. Initial Prototypes: We bought every different Bluetooth LE chip we could find. We compared battery life, signal strength, signal consistency, and more. In the end, we determined that the CC2541SOC chip had the best performance. Product Design: We started off knowing that we wanted to design a distinctive, stylish shape for our product. We started drawing and carving shapes from wood to test our different styles. Pretty quickly, we decided that we needed to get a 3D printer to start rapid prototyping. After testing different widths, diameters, and faceted shapes before we finally settled on the final XY tag design. App Development: While all this was going on, Daniel was hard at work on our iPhone App. Today, we have the app nearly completed. We have made it easy to sync a new tag to your phone.

Our manufacturing timeline looks like this: Help Us Share it Rewards The Team While we have a dedicated team of developers, designers, and engineers at XY, the team is led by these two members:Daniel Wang (President):Daniel began his long career in technology at the tender age of 12 developing turbo loaders for the Commodore 64 (basically it just turned off the display so the 1mhz MOS 6510 could actually do some work). After getting his CS degree from UCSD, he worked on various projects for Viewpoint (3D rendering), Disney (software for kids) and was the CTO of Xdrive, a cloud storage pioneer acquired by AOL. In the early 2000 s, he joined a few friends to develop an industry-leading fraud detection system based entirely on numerical analysis of large amounts of financial data a system that is still used today by top accounting firms and hedge funds. Turning his interests to mobile in 2012, he developed two highly-rated collaborative consumption apps Nifty & Nifty Deals, both available in the AppStore.Nicholas Trouw (Lead Product Designer):An Ohio native, Nick Trouw got his career off the ground beginning in college, where he founded, owned and managed several arts and performance organizations and business ventures. As one of his first, Urban Renaissance Outreach Group worked to increase English fluency scores in underfunded schools across the country. After two years of traveling the U.S. for arts and education, Nick united this experience with his interest in software engineering and became president of a start-up business that worked to create free, online educational resources for teachers and students nationwide. Shortly after, he began contracting for different corporations as a software developer, which led him to do the same at Webble, an indoor event navigation and mapping solution technology. Now, as the lead product designer and software developer for XY, Nick engaged his creativity and arts background to perfect the XY prototype and currently heads the team of developers and engineers to manufacture the tag and app for consumer use. So, please help us make the world better with XY.
63`Hey, everybody: We are De La Soul: Posdnous, Dave, and Maseo. We re best known for our albums 3 Feet High and Rising, De La Soul Is Dead, Stakes Is High and many others. Some of our hit singles include "Me Myself and I," "Saturdays" and "Feel Good Inc." a collaboration with Gorillaz.We ve collaborated with everyone from Chaka Khan to Common to even NASA: In 2004, our song "Potholes in My Lawn," became one of the first rap records to be beamed from another planet by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity. Now we are here to collaborate with YOU, humanoid, on the most exciting project we ve ever done. For the last decade, we've been independent artists, free of a record label interfering in our creative process. This will be our first De La Soul studio album in eleven years. We re excited and ready to create. It's been essential that we find ways to fund, record and release new music. Typically the fans have been the ones who support and appreciate our vision, so using Kickstarter and giving our fans the opportunity to be a part of the process just feels right. We see Kickstarter as a home for creative minds and a wonderful platform; where people who believe, respect and see the vision, can support an idea and make it a reality.True to our Hip-Hop roots, we make music without limits. This new album will incorporate elements of Jazz, Funk, Rock, Country Western and anything else we're feeling in the moment. To us, music is the influence of sounds, sounds in all vibrations and sizes, telling a story or pointing a direction. Some of these sounds we call samples, samples we use to make songs. S-950 & SP 1200 Samplers Sampling is basically copying a piece of sound, from one recording, and reusing it to create a new recording. It is how De La has always made music. The sampler is our instrument, but people who copy, and in this case "sample," have also been considered thieves and unoriginal. So, unfortunately a huge part of our career has also been spent fighting off the sample police. Enough of those battles! For the new album, we needed a completely new approach, something Hip-Hop hasn t done before. So, here it is: For the first time, we're going to sample ourselves. Vox Studios, Los Angeles, CA Over the last three years, we've collaborated with some of LA's finest studio musicians and recorded them in free-styled, unrehearsed, jam sessions. They played everything from banjo to upright bass, sometimes up to a dozen musicians at once; simply allowing sounds to integrate. We did 90% of these recordings in one of LA's most classic studios, Vox. We chose Vox because we wanted our recordings to have that creamy analog warm mixing board sound that the old records our parent s once played had. With over 200 hours of sounds, and vibes, equal to about 250 to 300 full-length vinyl LPs, it's time that we get to the work. Here s the interesting part. We are now in the process of going back to that 200+ hours of music, listening, enjoying and discovering those special moments where, musically, something magical happens, where interesting sounds and layers were forgotten, where new sounds can be sampled, looped, chopped, filtered and arranged, freely, without the intrusive presence of publishing politics and the infamous sample police. What we've done is created our own crates of records; album upon albums to mine and sample from. In our world, what we ve created is freedom, freedom to make the art you believe in without having to compromise your vision. That s what we ve always wanted most, that s what we ve always believed in, that s what we ve fought for, and that s why we re doing this Kickstarter with you. We have a fantastic cast of artist we're collaborating with. So far Damon Albarn (of Blur/Gorillaz), 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, and David Byrne (of Talking Heads) have blessed us with their talents; and we ll have more announcements of collabs to come, right here on Kickstarter. Clockwise: Damon Albarn, 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, David Bryne We re crowdfunding it to help pay for recording, mixing, marketing, and everything else. Your support will keep us in the studio, help us continue to sample and manipulate the music we ve recorded, will help us get additional production work done; and will help us design, package, market, and distribute the album. The whole thing. We literally cannot do it without you. So now, for the goodies For your support we d like to offer you some cool rewards. Let s start with our Kickstarter only, 1GB De La Soul thumb drives uploaded with the new album. We have a limited amount of our 2015, out of stock De La Dunks by NIKE, autographed by us, for you.

Pledge often! We Are De La Soul.... Kelvin Mercer was born in the Bronx, New York and grew up in East Massapequa, Long Island. He and David Jude Jolicoeur were childhood friends and met Vincent Mason as students at Amityville High School. His double entendre-laden rhymes draw from his life experiences and have won him acclaim as one of the rap game s most underrated MC s. His full stage name Posdnuos is pronounced pas-de-noose . David Jude Jolicoeur was born in Brooklyn, New York and befriended Kelvin Mercer at a young age. After connecting with Vincent Mason in high school, the trio wasted little time writing their essential chapter in hip-hop history. Dave often found himself the center of attention due to his smooth lyrical flow and his distinctive sense of style, featuring African medallions, peace signs, and uneven dreadlocks (unofficially known as the De La Do ). His early stage name Trugoy is an inversion of his favorite food, yogurt. Vincent Mason was born in Brooklyn, New York. In the early days of De La Soul his role was almost exclusively that of a DJ. But as the group s creative vision matured, he stepped out from behind the tables to contribute rhymes of his own to a handful of key tracks.
64`A PERFECT GIFT ITEM FOR SOMEONE!!Whether you are cooking with skewers with outdoor grills or indoor ovens, there are a lot of tedious and time consuming steps involved in turning each skewer separately. There are also quite a few chances where you may burn yourself. Therefore, to make cooking with skewers safer, quicker, and efficient, we are introducing a patent pending skewer-rack system called 'SkeweRack'. As evident from the above video, SkeweRack can minimize the steps involved in flipping the skewers and make cooking enjoyable. SkeweRack is not only for those who love to cook, but also for those who want their family/friends to be safe during cooking. SkeweRack is made with sturdy stainless steel and fits on most of the grills and ovens. This is our first Kickstarter campaign and we hope you will support us in getting this off the ground successfully . Prototype Design Production Design NOTE: PRODUCT SHOWN IN ALL THE VIDEOS IS A PROTOTYPE. THE FINAL PRODUCT IS SHOWN UNDER SKEWER SECTION BELOW. IT HAS MINOR BUT IMPORTANT DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS. How it Works: On Outdoor Grills: Mostly, the grilling is done outdoors during summer exposing yourself to high heat that could damage your delicate skin in the long term. Instead of attending the hot grill, trying to turn each skewer separately, now with SkeweRack, you can turn all the skewers simultaneously and quickly (as shown in the top picture). Not only do you save time, but also you make cooking safe in the near term as well as the long term. Another advantage is that the tall skewer placement keeps the meat from sticking to the grate. In Indoor Ovens: Indoor ovens are even more cumbersome compared to outdoor grills especially when you are cooking with skewers. Some may argue that you do not need to turn the skewers in indoor ovens, but an experienced cook can tell you that if not turned, the bottom side of the meat remains soggy while the top comes out dry.Old Traditional Method: Traditionally, you have to go through several steps in order to turn all the skewers while the oven is blazing hot. Here are the steps involved (for those who like to see to believe, this comparison is also shown in the above video): 1. Fully open the blazing hot oven carefully. This causes the oven to loose heat and energy.2. Carefully, without burning yourself try to turn each skewer separately while wearing a thick oven mitt or with a pair of tongs. Usually this doesn't go well.3. Probably frustrated by now, you will take the hot rack and skewers out of the oven. 4. Again, attempt to turn each skewer one at a time with the thick oven mitt or a pair of tongs.5. Once done, put the hot rack and skewers back inside the oven. All while you are being careful not to burn yourself.6. Close the oven.7. Wait for the oven to heat up again to a preset temperature.From the video above you will realize that this is very unsafe, time consuming, and energy inefficient.SkeweRack Method:But with SkeweRack, you not only keep yourself safe, it is more quick, and energy efficient. Here are the steps involved (also shown in the above video):1. Carefully, open the hot oven door halfway.2. Use an oven mitt or a pair of tongs or anything with long handle and heat resistant to simply turn over the side most skewer handle. This will cause the rest of the skewers to turns like a deck of cards. 3. Close the oven door.Extremely easy and safe way to uniform cooking. SkeweRack Advantages:This SkeweRack system is packed with multiple amazing advantageous features: Turn all 6 skewers simultaneously resulting in safer and uniform cooking on all skewers. Taller skewer-rack system keeps food suspended above grill and keeps it from sticking to grate. Wider gap between adjacent skewers allows for bigger size food chunks. Flat skewer design keeps food from spinning/rolling. Made with sturdy stainless steel rack and six 11.5-inch long stainless steel skewers. Product Details:Components included in one set of SkeweRack are: Rack: Made with sturdy stainless steel Easy to assemble Size: 13.5" X 10.5", easily fits most grills and ovens. Skewers: Below is the actual skewer design that will be shipped. Other pictures with a different skewer design is only a prototype. Made with sturdy stainless steel Six skewers in a set NOTE: PRODUCT SHOWN IN ALL THE VIDEOS IS A PROTOTYPE. THE FINAL PRODUCT IS SHOWN UNDER SKEWER SECTION ABOVE. IT HAS MINOR BUT IMPORTANT DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS. Features:Skewers Do Not Fall Off of the Inclined Rack: Skewers lock in place on the rack. So when the rack is inclined almost vertical, the skewers do not fall off of the rack. This is especially useful while transporting skewers between kitchen and grill/oven. This is a big advantage over the skewer rack system currently available in the market. We would encourage you to compare this feature with our competitors' products in the market.Chicken/Turkey Roasting for Thanks Giving: The SkewerRack forms a wonderful platform for roasting turkey for Thanks Giving. Just lock in all the skewers in place on the rack and put your whole turkey (also works with chicken/beef) on it. In case using in indoor oven, just use a container below to collect the fat coming out your lovely meat. The skewers will not fall off of the rack during transportation.Roast Shrimp and Lobster: The SkeweRack is best when you want to roast shrimp or lobster without touching the grate. You can roast the seafood from both sides. Development: We've spent the last several months perfecting the design of the SkeweRack. There were several considerations we needed to account for. We wanted it to be sturdy unlike the flimsy racks you get in the market today. We wanted it to be easy to transport the food loaded skewers without dropping on the floor, so we locked them in place. We wanted it to be versatile than just a skewer-rack system, so it can also be used to roast whole the turkey or chicken or even beef. After the first prototype was made, we tested it extensively and made improvements by listening to our test sample customers. The new design will be more elegant and stylish. The new design also fits in a compact package to minimize the space and shipping cost. This further helps the after sales transportation, i.e. for customers who like to carry SkeweRack to a picnic or a beach. Project Schedule: Rewards:After Kickstarter campaign, SkeweRack will retail for $50 + Tax (8%) + Shipping (except free ground shipping). As an appreciation for your support, for all kickstarters, the discounts on retail price are from 20% to up to 34.7% (see above table). Stretch Goals: We are glad to announce great options for extra skewers to cook more food at a time. Please check these stretch goals and follow these steps: Find the number of skewer sets (6 skewers in each set) you need. Add the equivalent amount to your original pledge. We will make a note of all your extra pledge. You can also write to us about your extra pledge in comment section and we will confirm it. International backers, please also add the corresponding shipping to the pledge. NOTE: PRODUCT SHOWN IN ALL THE VIDEOS IS A PROTOTYPE. THE FINAL PRODUCT IS SHOWN UNDER SKEWER SECTION ABOVE. IT HAS MINOR BUT IMPORTANT DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS.
65`The world's first 3D sensor for mobile devices. The Structure Sensor gives mobile devices the ability to capture and understand the world in three dimensions. With the Structure Sensor attached to your mobile device, you can walk around the world and instantly capture it in a digital form. This means you can capture 3D maps of indoor spaces and have every measurement in your pocket. You can instantly capture 3D models of objects and people for import into CAD and for 3D printing. You can play mind blowing augmented reality games where the real world is your game world. If you re a developer, Structure gives you the ability to build mobile applications that interact with the three dimensional geometry of the real world for the very first time. You can even launch your app on the App Store! The Structure Sensor is available in your choice of two anodized aluminum colors: Ice Blue and Silver. Early reactions. "It's like giving some sort of a superpower to average-joe devices."Daniel Suarez, Author of Daemon & Freedom "New senses are going to make possible new applications."Tim O'Reilly, Founder & CEO of O'Reilly Media "We can't wait to play with one of these around the Makerbot office. Bre Pettis, CEO of MakerBot For me the challenge has been in creating 3D objects. This completely obliterates that challenge."Josh Levine, VP of Engineering at Shapeways.com I really like how this device was designed from the beginning to be open and hackable because we don't know which way it's going to go."Dr. Gary Bradski, President & CEO of OpenCV A very important aspect of this device is that you don t need a Ph.D. in computer vision to develop an application."Dr. Gerard Medioni, Professor of Computer Vision at USC Smart design, exciting features. Structure Sensor by Occipital on Sketchfab The Structure Sensor has been designed from the ground up to be mobile. We put a lot of thought into making the Structure Sensor work perfectly with the iPad and other mobile devices. The goal was to make a device that enabled incredible 3D sensing applications, was easy to use, had great battery life, was compact, and looked like beautiful, precision hardware. Range The Structure Sensor has a mobile-optimized range that begins at 40 centimeters and stretches to over 3.5 meters. This means it can easily capture anything from a teddy bear to an entire room. Battery-powered The Structure Sensor has its own onboard power supply that provides up to 4 hours of active use, and 1000+ hours of standby. That means you don t have to limit where you go or what you do because of a cord tethering you to one place and it also won t drain the battery in your iPad. Anodized aluminum chassis The Structure Sensor chassis is machined out of a single piece of high-grade aluminum that serves as both a beautiful exterior and as a thermal core that keeps the precision optics inside at an optimal temperature. It s also anodized for a high-end finish. At its top, the Structure Sensor has a chemically hardened glass surface that optimizes the depth image quality, while also protecting the infrared emitter and camera inside. Dual infrared LEDs Unlike the IR structured light projector, the IR LEDs emit a uniform light that allows you to capture the world in infrared. What does this mean in plain terms? With Structure Sensor, your iPad has night vision. iPad camera on left. On the right, Structure IR vision + IR LEDs = night vision! And you'll also notice that in infrared, the world looks a little different than you expect. Some materials reflect infrared light in unexpected ways. Look at the brown chair! You'll have full control over the IR LEDs from the SDK. Maybe you want to have two Structure Sensors invisibly signal each other. Or perhaps you want to create an augmented reality haunted house app where infrared ghosts scare the beejezus out of people as they walk around in pitch darkness. It s up to you! Is my iPad supported? The Structure Sensor was designed to work with the Apple Lightning connector. As a backer, you will get to choose which model of iPad you would like a bracket for when we ship your Structure Sensor. If you get a new iPad, you can update your selection at any time (until a few weeks before shipment). Don t worry, you can decide later! The iPad (4th generation) is officially supported, and will have a corresponding bracket for Structure that quickly and securely connects it with a precision aluminum latch. We have just announced support for the new Apple iPad Air and Apple iPad mini with Retina display that were launched on October 22nd, 2013. While not officially supported, the Structure Sensor can stream data to any iOS device that uses the Lightning connector such as iPad mini, iPhone 5, iPhone 5c, iPhone 5s, etc. Any of these devices can be used to develop applications for the Structure Sensor. Attach your bracket to your Structure Sensor with 4 screws (included). Included demo applications. Note: Demo apps are iOS only. Our team has been hard at work creating fun, functional demo applications for iOS that will let you experience the Structure Sensor s capabilities right out of the box. 1. Room Capture: Easily capture a 3D model of a room by simply spinning around with your Structure Sensor and iPad. Then, tap any two points to retrieve distances. 2. Fetch: A virtual pet to play fetch with in the physical world around you. 3. Ball Physics: An augmented reality demo where virtual balls interact with the dense geometry of the world. 4. Object Scanner: Capture models of objects and export them to CAD software or for 3D printing. You can also upload models directly to Shapeways.com for 3D printing. Scanned using the Object Scanner demo app v0.4 (October 4th) Click here to see the original objects. Here's an interview we did with TechCrunch that shows our Object Scanner, Room Capture, and Fetch demos: Here we have a demo of an augmented reality pet playing fetch - note how virtual elements are occluded by real world elements! In this augmented reality + physics demo, notice how the balls bounce off each other AND the geometry of the bench. All of these demos are built on top of the tracking and mapping features in the SDK. If you're a developer, you'll get access to the source code for these demos so you can start hacking right away. But these demos are really just the beginning. As backers, you ll get to play with and give us feedback on a steady stream of improvements to our core algorithms, new SDK features, and new demo applications. Develop with depth. We know we aren't the only ones who have thought about developing mobile apps using a 3D sensor. We were inspired by seeing the innovative apps and hacks the community has done using other 3D sensors. iOS Developers Tap into a 3D sensor on an iOS device for the first time ever. With the Structure SDK, just write your app in Xcode and hit deploy. You can even launch your app on the App Store to quickly reach a wide audience for your app. Depth image from Structure registered with the RGB image from the iPad. Hackers & Hobbyists The Structure Sensor has hackability in its DNA. Four screw holes on the bottom let you mount to almost anything - and we'll provide open CAD models for creating custom brackets. With the USB Hacker Cable, you can connect to almost any platform that supports USB. We'll also provide open source drivers for multiple platforms including Windows, Android, OS X, and Linux. How does the Structure Sensor work with Android? We re excited that you re interested in developing on the Android platform! The Structure Sensor will work with many Android devices, but at first, it s geared toward intrepid developers who want to be among the first to build 3D sensing applications on Android. There are three important things you need to keep in mind when using Structure with Android: We are not making attachment brackets for Android devices (there are too many different models!). However, we are providing an open 3D CAD model of a starter bracket that you can customize to your device and then 3D print (CAD experience required). At this time, we don t plan to offer the demos or other fully featured apps for Android devices. However, we will provide open source drivers for Android to make it easy for Android developers to create their own apps. Your Android device must have support for USB Host Mode accessories. For many of our backers, this will be the first USB accessory they ve used with their devices. So, we ve created a page at http://structure.io/android where you can find more information on USB Host Mode, and about using the Structure Sensor on Android. Please check it out. The details. Why Kickstarter? Our goal on Kickstarter is to get sensors into the hands of early adopters and developers like you as soon as possible. We want you to be involved, whether to provide feedback on the experience, or to develop new apps that will blow the platform open to wider audiences. And we ll be hard at work too, delivering updates and new functionality on a regular basis to add more performance and capabilities to your Structure Sensor. High level overview of our production plan. What does the T-shirt look like? This limited, Kickstarter-only edition T-shirt shows an exploded view of the Structure Sensor. The Occipital team. The Structure Sensor is the result of over 1.5 years of intense dedication by our team. Occipital is a 13-person startup based in Boulder, CO and San Francisco, CA. We were one of the first ever TechStars companies (Boulder, 2008), and previously launched the successful RedLaser and 360 Panorama mobile applications. In November 2011, we conceived of the idea for the Structure Sensor after playing with a Microsoft Kinect 3D sensor plugged into a high-end desktop CPU. We mapped a small indoor environment using the sensor and some prototype software. After tripping over the Kinect s cord a few times, we realized that needing a high-end desktop CPU meant that this amazing technology was never going to make its way to everyday life. So we set out to create the Structure Sensor, and with it, a new chapter for mobile computer vision. We hope you are as excited about the Structure Sensor as we are, and we look forward to having you join us as we introduce the first 3D sensor for mobile devices to the world. A special thank you. We'd like to thank everyone who took time out of their busy schedules to help support our Kickstarter effort: The Orbotix Team, creators of Sphero. The Nekuda team.

66`Blood Rage is a Viking board game created by acclaimed game designer Eric M. Lang. In this fast-paced yet highly strategic game, 2 to 4 players take control of Viking clans, invading, pillaging and battling in a quest to gain as much glory as possible before Ragnar k finally consumes the land!Here's a look at everything we've unlocked! From Guillotine Games, the studio that brought you Zombicide, comes the ultimate Viking saga. The game's striking visuals are a combination of Adrian Smith s highly evocative artwork, and Mike McVey s amazingly detailed miniatures. Blood Rage comes with 46 pre-assembled miniatures, including some huge and impressive legendary monsters. Viking warriors and leaders of the Bear and Raven clans. Viking warriors and leaders of the Serpent and Wolf clans. The dragon ships of all clans. V lur Witch and Fire Giant Sea Serpent and Troll Frost Giant and ValkyrieVisit the Blood Rage Facebook page for more pictures, insight, and news on the game! In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan s warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnar k has come, and it s the end of the world! It s the Vikings last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar k, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These Gods Gifts grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!Game Components 46 highly detailed miniatures 52 colored plastic bases 99 cards 4 clan sheets 36 cardboard tokens 4 plastic glory markers 1 game board 2 support sheets 1 rulebook Pledge Level Your Ragnarok-level pledge gets you the Blood Rage core game as well as the Kickstarter exclusive Wolfman monster, and any stretch goals we manage to unlock! The Wolfman comes with his figure and a card to add him to your Age II deck. Note that anything marked with this: is an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions only.Full Gameplay VideoOur bloodthirsty friends at Jogando Offline gathered together for a game of Blood Rage. Check out the video below to see how it went. Rulebook http://cmon.co/BR_Rules_PreviewPlease be aware that this is an Alpha Rulebook. It is not final. Rules may still be tweaked and changed, layout and graphics may still be altered. So, if you see anything in here that isn't the same later, understand that during the Kickstarter the project is still in development and all aspects are subject to improvements. Stretch Goals Optional Buys Explore the 5th Player Expansion HERE! Explore the Art Book HERE! Shipping information - Please take noteBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). As a rough estimate, the game will cost about $10 to ship in the USA and to Hong Kong, about $15 to Australia, about $15-$25 in the EU and Canada, all the way up to $50 to Singapore and South America, but this may increase or decrease based on the quantity of stretch goals we might unlock and your carrier choices.Please note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.

Garbage Can Fly Trap takes no responsibility for damage to persons, garbage receptacles or any other property due to the use of a hole saw. Kitchen Garbage Can Application The Trap & CartridgeThe Garbage Can Fly Trap allows users to discretely catch and eliminate flies from kitchens, homes and outdoor areas. Flies, already attracted to food waste in your garbage, walk into the trap (installed in the lid of your garbage can) and are caught in the disposable paper cartridge (under the garbage can lid). The disposable cartridge is lined with fly paper which prevents the fly's escape. The trap doesn t require chemical attractants, the use of unsightly fly paper strips, or chasing flies with a swatter. The disposable cartridge can then be released directly into your garbage bag via a quick release button on top of the trap allowing for hands-free disposal. The Garbage Can Fly Trap captures fruit flies too! Patent Pending Flies Enter Here How It WorksFlies are naturally attracted to the smell of garbage in your garbage can. Flies, being attracted to the scent, seek the easiest route to gain access. We have designed the Garbage Can Fly Trap to let them think they have found it. They enter on the exterior of the trap under the quick release button and follow their "nose" to the disposable cartridge below. The cartridge contains fly paper which prevents their escape. When you are ready to throw away the trap, simply push the quick release button to release the disposable cartridge directly in to the trash. Then snap on a new cartridge and you are ready to go! Quick Release Demonstation On the Lid of a Garbage Can WARNING - Flies Were Harmed In The Making of This GadgetPROTOTYPINGEarly Prototype: Caught flies but they were loud when lid was opened Left: Fly On Garbage Can Lid / Right: Trapped Flies Next Prototype: Flypaper = quiet flies but cage removal required touching it.

Fruit Fly Abatement If you know what a drill is used for, you can install the Garbage Can Fly Trap. Simply drill a 1.5" hole in the lid of your collection device of choice and attach the Garbage Can Fly Trap. Then snap on a cartridge and you are all set. Quick and Easy Installation! FAQ Meredith from Australia asks:"How often would the cartridge need changing?"GCFT Answers:"Replacement of the cartridges really depends on how many flies are caught in the trap. We have kept cartridges for as long as two weeks early in the season when there were only a couple flies in them. The shortest duration was one day when we caught 68 flies (yes, we counted them) in our outdoor garbage can at the height of the season." Ken from the UK asks:"Why would I need to capture flies outside?"GCFT Answers:"Generally, you wouldn't, unless you spend much time entertaining in your backyard. We don't like it when flies are "bugging" our friends when we have them over for a BBQ. The Garbage Can Fly Trap can help you with that."Scott from California asks:"How much will additional cartridges cost down the road? Say for a 20 or 25 pack of them. It seems like a 3 pack won't last long in an outdoor trash can during the summer."GCFT Answers:"A higher volume of cartridge sales will allow us to substantially lower the price point of the cartridge which is our goal. We are considering a "stretch goal" as it relates to cartridges which will cut the price dramatically but this requires that we prove market viability with this campaign."Jonathan from South Texas asks: "I am interested in this product but only if you come up with a reasonable cost effective way for me to get the cartridges or I view this as a throw away product since it will only last a couple of days/weeks and I have to throw it away since I have no replacements. Hopefully you will get something figured out soon as this really looks like a good product to have during the summers here in South Texas."GCFT Answers:"You make a great point! The more cartridges that are purchased the cheaper they are to order (basic economies of scale). Just to give you an idea, we had 100 manufactured and they cost us $2.63 per piece not including screen and fly stickum or labor costs to assemble them. That is unsustainable and without economies of scale, you are right, this would be a throw away product. We are working hard to take advantage of economies of scale but we need your purchase to prove there is a market for the product which would then warrant further investment on our part to manufacture on a grand scale. So, please purchase more cartridges by adding a 10-pack to your pledge ($10 in the US).Matthew from the U.S. asks:"Is this design going to capture fruit flies and prohibit them from flying back out the entry hole?GCFT Answers:"Thanks for your question Matthew. We have seen fruit flies walk into the hole and then walk back out again because they didn't go all the way down into the trap but they, there were two of them in this case, went back into it after milling about for a bit on the exterior and were caught. We have seen the same for house flies."
69`Our Kickstarter Project has finished, but the story continues! We can't wait to see what everyone learns on the jamstik+ and creates with it! We are so excited to be able to donate over 175 original jamstiks to education, and know that plenty of awesome stories are going to come out of this project as well. To learn more and order a jamstik+, head over to jamstik.com The jamstik+ connects via Bluetooth LE to your iPad, iPhone, Mac so you can play guitar with any of the 100's of compatible MIDI apps available.

Here are a few pre-release interface examples. The original jamstik was well received in 2014, but we knew there were improvements we wanted to get into more users hands. We started by adding a hexaphonic magnetic pickup to give the jamstik+ a more realistic guitar feel with a higher resolution signal. Thanks to advancements with Bluetooth technology, we equipped the jamstik+ with wireless Bluetooth LE connectivity that works seamlessly with the latest BLE MIDI Protocol supported by Apple. The jamstik+ has real guitar strings and real frets just like the original, to best match the experience of putting your fingers on a guitar. And yes, the jamstik+ handles string bend and vibrato with improved dynamics. jamstk+ features We're reconnecting with you, our tribe of supporters, early adopters and music lovers because although we've accomplished a lot with the original jamstik over the past year, we're far from finished. Our mission is a big one and we have more work to do!We need not only your financial support, but also to help us get the word out about the jamstik+. We re coming to you because you are our tribe, our roots. You re the reason big ideas and big dreams like the original jamstik come true. Forward thinkers like you want to be a part of things that really matter. You like to see how you can personally impact this world for the better.

70`Whether your passion is surfing, stand-up paddleboarding, running, biking, fishing, snowboarding, hunting, skiing, kayaking, whitewater rafting, extreme pogoing, we all share two common threads. We will do anything to get one more wave, run one extra mile, take the last run down the mountain, or reel in that last trout of the afternoon and we need to stay hydrated to do it! Today, we would like to present you with DolfinPack... Our idea was simplicity. Cut out the fat of what was already on the market. The need is water not pockets, clips, or headphone jacks. That was the easy part! Secondly we had to design a strap system that allowed the bladder to stay tight to your back and prevent it from bouncing up and down. Also of utmost importance was comfort for both men and women participating in an array of activities. The DolfinPack can go anywhere! Any environment or condition on the planet. All materials are of the highest quality and durability. We have tested the DolfinPack in every situation imaginable and it continues to exceed expectations. We took over a month combing the internet through hundreds if not thousands of manufacturers. We requested samples, requested business licenses, referrals, everything we could possibly do to ensure we were getting the highest quality product from a reputable source. We were thrilled when we came to an agreement with two separate manufacturers. We have one manufacture for the neoprene packs, and a separate for the internal bladders. We went this route as each source specialized in that particular product and therefore had experience in mass production. Both manufacturers are well equipped to produce 20,000+ of these items per month making large quantities not an issue. We are planning to place our manufacturing order the day our Kickstarter is completed. We may even do it earlier once we confirm that our funding amount has been reached. From that point on, our manufacturers have estimated 60-65 days until we have them in hand, including production and shipping. As Kickstarter backers, your items will be the first to ship once our production order is received. Therefore we estimate your items shipping 65-70 days after our Kickstarter is funded. After talking to many people who regularly invest in Kickstarter projects, we understand communication is the key to delivering your products once our project is funded. Therefore, we guarantee you will receive an update from our team at least every two weeks from when the project is funded until you have the items in hand. We will update you when the manufacturing has been initiated, when it s complete, when the items have been shipped to us, when they arrive, and when they are shipped to you. We ll even throw in some random jokes and videos every now and then to make you laugh, that s just an added bonus!ALSO TO NOTE - This Kickstarter is not funding our entire initial order. We are only asking Kickstarter to fund less than 50% of our initial order. We have already secured $12,000+ in capital through our own money and investors (family & friends) to fund the other half of our initial manufacturing order & marketing. We are 100% committed to this project as not only do we have our own money invested but also the money from some of our closest family and friends. We won't let them, or YOU down! The hard part is over! Most Kickstarter projects are just an idea needing funding to get off the ground. We are already in the clouds! Our design is finished, we have already found our manufactures for both the bladder and the pack, dozens of samples have been created, tweaked, and tweaked again. We have our packaging supplier lined up, we know our market, and our business plan is set. We even have product reps already in line to take the DolfinPack to the entire United States.Now we call upon your help! We need funding to get our first run of packs and bladders made; and that's it! With our awesome reward system you won't be disappointed with your pledge!

Zombicide is a collaborative game for 1 to 6 players developed by Guillotine Games and published by CoolMiniOrNot. A game lasts for 20min (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board). Each player controls from one (for 6 players) to four (solo game) "survivors", human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, "survivors" hastily change to "hunters" to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide's going on, the "Danger level" is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster. Zombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between "beat'em up" and "survival horror" as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest. GAME CONTENTS 71 miniatures (28mm "Heroic" scale): 6 Survivors, 40 Walkers, 16 Runners, 8 Fatties and 1 Abomination 110 mini-cards (42 Zombie cards, 62 Equipment cards, 6 Wounded cards) 9 gaming tiles 6 dice 6 Survivor Identity Cards 24 advancement counters 4 Cars tokens (police car and pimp mobile) 18 Noise tokens 10 Objective tokens 12 Door tokens 6 Zombie spawn tokens 1 "First player" token 1 Exit point token 71 minis. A special effort has been given to detail and diversity: several models are available for most zombies of the same type (example: several models for "walker"-type zombies, including male and female versions). 9 double-sided gaming tiles. Scenarios take place on boards from two to nine tiles in a riot-devastated urban area. Characters move from zone to zone defined by walls and crosswalks. Designers were careful about the overall quality and playability of the tiles' illustrations. Double-sided tokens. Objective tokens. Door tokens. Car tokens. Noise tokens. Zombie spawn zone tokens. More tokens than required indeed. In fact, enough of them are planned to create your craziest scenarios. 110 cards. Including Equipment cards and Zombie cards. We're launching this Kickstarter to drive down production costs by making more copies. If Zombicide is the kind of game that tickles your fancy, then here are the various pledge levels. We appreciate any help we can get! Bitten - Cover lithograph signed by Edouard Guiton, the legendary French concept artist for Confrontation! Walker - Bitten + 1 promo Survivor miniature not available in the base game! Nick, Bad Cop I do things by the book, my book! Lieutenant Nicholas Walker has sometimes been bad, and always been lucky. Corrupt and cocksure, Nick gets his man, anyway he can, even if it means doing things a normal cop wouldn t do. Bluffing and bullying his way through the streets of New York, this highly decorated officer has put away hundreds of criminals and lined his pockets discreetly while he was at it. Now, with no more crime and money meaningless, he desperately searches for his wife, rescuing and helping other survivors in the vain hope that someone has seen her. Nick is available for all pledges $25 and over! Runner - Bitten + 2 promo Survivor miniatures not available in the base game! El Cholo, Zombie Hunter I m not angry, I ll show you angry Joder! No one seems to know this gruff latino s real name but everyone calls him El Cholo. Whether he minds, or even cares is unknown, El Cholo rarely speaks, preferring to let his twin machetes do the talking. A hardened farmhand or possibly an ex-cartel enforcer, putting Zombies down at close quarters is El Cholo's specialty, and damn! he's good at it. The survivors whisper stories of hopeless last stands and daring raids, and El Cholo walking out covered in (someone else's) blood. Fatty - Runner + copy of Zombicide ($89 retail value). That's a 15% discount plus 2 exclusive miniatures and a signed lithograph! Abomination - Fatty + 3rd special promo Survivor miniature - Dave the Geek and Zombicide dice! You get a copy of Zombicide and 3 exclusive miniatures and a signed lithograph and 6 custom dice! Dave the Geek Yeah sure, take the shotgun if you want, I ll take the... AMMONIUM... NITRATE! As far as he remembers, Dave always found reality to be terribly boring. So he locked himself up in an imaginary world and learned piles of useless stuff... useless until now. Dave is a fount of knowledge. His chemistry mastery makes him look like a superhero amongst other survivors. At least until he opens this mouth, then everyone remembers he s a real geek. .. Survivor - 2 x Abomination Triplets - 3 x Abomination Get Me A 6-Pack - 6 x Abomination Paint The Town! - A hand painted copy of Zombicide, including 3 promo Survivor miniatures and a signed lithograph by Edouard Guiton.

Just increase your pledge the necessary amount, a survey will go out at the end of the Kickstarter asking you which options you want! Here's a set that isn't included in any level, in classic white with red engraving!

Hire her for $10! Marvin Redfield. Marvin is a bodyguard, shuttling the rich and famous around. Always a professional, he's used to gently deflecting the advances of neglected wives or wealthy widows.... until one of his clients got a little too aggressive and had to be put down! Now he's up to his eyeballs in mother-f***** Zombies! Get him for $10 added to any Abomination level or above pledge! Ships the same time as the Zombie Promo Survivors! Eva Duran - She's got a sword, and she knows how to use it! This kickass Survivor is something we'll start sculpting now and ship to you at the same time the Zombie Promo Survivors go out! Just add $10 to your Abomination and above pledge! Paint the Town includes these trays. Since we're doing them anyway, we thought some of you out in Kickstarter land might want some. So, if you want to paint your great Zombicide miniatures and still want to transport them around conveniently, this might fit your needs.These trays will be available for sale from Battlefoam later, just that shipping is free within the USA if shipped with your Abomination or above order. Outside the USA, please add $15 per set (sorry, these are bulky). $40 for a set of 2 trays.

Close ups of the female zombies included: Bios - who the heck are you guys? If you read this far, you're almost a true believer, so here's a little more about the designers of Zombicide! Nicolas Raoult Nico worked in Rackham from 1999 to 2008. While wearing the red dragon shirt, Nico accompanied Rackham in its ascension. He worked on Rag Narok, Confrontation 2nd to 4th edition, In 2008, Nico lent his hand to Kraken Editions for the background of Alkemy Genesis. The Jade Triad arbors his signature. In 2011, he worked with Studio Cyanide, developer of the Confrontation videogame, as a consultant, freelance author and playtester. Jean-Baptiste Lullien, a.k.a. Ogre-Mercenaire With a background in linguistics and information, J.-B worked for several years as a game designer for Rackham, on several projects including girls games with little horses and a fashion academy, numerous miniature games (even a kind of marbles monsters!), videogames and comics. Rapha l Guiton Raphael is one of the founders of Rackham, and together with another ex-Games Workshop employee Jean Bey, created the iconic game of Confrontation in 1996, and eventually leading its creative team. Now a co-founder of Guillotine Games, a studio of french designers, Zombicide, a cooperative boardgame of survivors VS zombies, is his first project to be published as a game designer. Percy de Montblanc Percy has never worked in Rackham. Co-founder of Guillotine Games, he is in charge of all the tasks the other associates hate and he prepares coffee. He is the executive producer of Zombicide and from time to time he has one or two good ideas that are systematically ignored. Thanks for the great support everyone!

We LOVE AND APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT <3ALSO - I just listened to the test pressing for the first time with Gabe Liberti (album producer), and I can confidently say that this is THE BEST way to listen to this album. I always saw vinyl as something that people like for the rarity or big art or something, but I think I finally get it now. (@___@)#3 SCHOOL OF CHIPTUNE: 2ND FUCKIN SUMESTAAAHHH AWW SHIT GIT RDY YALL. SCHOOL'S BACK IN SESSION. We are opening up 20 MORE SLOTS TO THE SCHOOL OF CHIPTUNE!!! This will take place during a different session to ensure that all students get THE ATTENTION THAT THEY DESERVE. You will get a report card and shit. We'll figure it out.UPDATE: SONGS FROM ENDLESS FANTASY! Hey everybody ( n_n)y chilling on a mystical beach hill We are Anamanaguchi! We make emotional punk, pop & dance music using hacked Nintendos, Game Boys, and 16-bit soundscapes along with a full band. You might know us from our tours across the US, maybe from PAX, or Lollapalooza, or maybe you heard our soundtrack to the Scott Pilgrim vs. the World video game, or you might know our music as the theme song to the Nerdist podcast-- or more likely you have no idea who we are! We're Anamanaguchi, sup :)*~*~*THE STORY OF THE ALBUM~*~*~ ENDLESS FANTASY (cover art by Andrew Strasser) Since the Scott Pilgrim soundtrack, we've been trying to figure out exactly what we wanted to do next. The next few years saw us going in 100 different directions of what we wanted our next album to sound like. Pete saw his influences jumping all over from j-pop producers like Yasutaka Nakata to 80's post-punk groups like Orange Juice. As months went by it shifted even more to a desire to romantically conjure settings from video game universes by sampling sounds from the Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask. Pete's capriciousness then sent him thinking back to the roots of the project, wanting to create an ode to the basement the band began in where he'd cover Weezer songs and played NES with his brother. Meanwhile Ary was off casually writing emotional songs about his cat, drum and bass tracks about Tokyo drifting, cute euro-beat fantasy snowboarding jams and a song about girls hiccuping. Ary & Wolfie For two years Pete lived in the same bedroom as the producer Gabe Liberti (two beds!) and would talk every night about what they loved about music - trying to help make sense of these various directions we felt the band being pulled towards. After many backyard discussions with Ary over Haribo gummies and Aranciata, gradually an idea began to form. All of these tangents we've been on for the past few years would fit perfectly together as one crystallized piece - each hyperbole balanced by an equal and opposite experiment. We couldn't sacrifice any of it or else that balance would be shattered, it had to be all 22 songs or nothing at all. Pete & Gabe (producer) being roommates Everyone working with us (and also some friends!) said this was a stupid idea, but we wanted to stand by it no matter how arduous the process might be. It also turns out that most record labels aren't interested in helping out four weird dudes put out 22 songs of mostly-instrumental music made using sound chips from old video game consoles without making any compromises. So we refused some deals, weren't offered others to begin with, and decided to release the album on our own label, dream.hax.So with passion as our driving force, we recorded, mixed, & mastered our new album Endless Fantasy over the course of 3 years without any help from a label. Trying to do this on our own and still holding it to a high standard is intimidating, but you can change that. We've gotten this far, but our ambitions for what this album needs to be don't end here. People keep on telling us our vision is wrong - we want to take the power out of their hands and put it in yours. This where we need your help!Now that the music is finished, we want to do everything we can to make this album as long lasting as possible. We want to tour this album everywhere we can, we want to create as much media around it as possible-- we want it to be more than just mp3s with cover art! teamwork (working 2gether) ~*~*~GOALS 4 THE MOTHA-EFFIN' FUTURE~*~*~ We want to make a stronger connection with Endless Fantasy than just the music alone. We want to make media to surround the album to give it the context we think it needs to make the strongest impact possible. Among this includes making new music videos - creating our own tour lighting rig - collaborating with singers for vocal editions of certain songs - making some specific interactive web projects - designing and manufacturing new & interesting merch (and then giving it to you here!) - essentially, we'd rather have our fans be our record label than record labels be our record label at this point.*~*~*~*~#1 MUSIC VIDZZZ~*~*~*~We were able to make one music video on our own means and we're pretty hyped with how it came out. We worked with Tim & Eric editors/ultra-buddies Daniel Gray Longino and Eric Notarnicola on a video for the song "MEOW" that managed to be as ridiculous as the track itself. We have ideas for MANY more videos for songs off this record and we want to make as many of them as we can!! In order to do that we need to reach out to talented animators & directors which can get pretty expensive! Pixel artists, Hollywood directors, you know wassup.GOAL AT 50K: Music videos for "Japan Air", "U n Me", "Akira", and improved budget for "Endless Fantasy".MEGALONG STRETCH GOAL: Music videos are our top priority here, if we raise more funding, we will make MANY more videos!! The album has 22 songs and we have limitless ambitions for this. We'd probably even release a DVD for all of 'em, though by the time we do this it'll probably be cooler to just give out downloads and stuff :) *~*~*~*~*#2 BORING SHIT~*~*~*~* We want Endless Fantasy to have the perks of being released on a big label - good distribution so that your friends can see it at stores, proper PR to let the videos we make be seen, and marketing to let people who've never heard of us know who we are :)We know how important it is for music to be out there - some of us were lucky to grow up in towns with amazing weird record stores and their very existence shaped who we are today. It's hard for a weird band to get in a normal record store, and that's exactly what we want to accomplish!GOAL AT 50K: Pay for base-level marketing, PR & distribution for Endless Fantasy.MEGALONG STRETCH GOAL: idk maybe we'd rent a video billboard in Times Square and just put a cute kitty cat on it with no words.~*~*~*~*#3 TOUR LIGHTING~*~*~*~* Made by James!! (not ours tho!) James is not only a mega-talented bass player, he's also a mega-talented electronics genius. He is the Donatello to our Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. He made the modifications to our tour Nintendos, and joined the band at the very beginning drawn by the idea of taking electronics apart and making them do what you want them to. James!!!!!!! #heartthrob James has since worked independently on many tour lighting setups for bands like RA RA RIOT and !!! (chk, chk, chk). Although we've been a band for nearly 8 years now, he's never had the opportunity to create anything just for ourselves. We've performed with Ra Ra Riot's tour poles on loan before, but we can't do that forever. James has budgeted out a specific tour lighting rig JUST FOR ANAMANAGUCHI! He'll be using principles of Pepper's Ghost (the effect used to make the 2Pac hologram) to project onto edgelit acrylic cubes reminiscent of our album cover.Here's James' basement lab. GOAL AT 50K: Cool light poles, projection cubes, LED displays, stuff like that!MEGALONG STRETCH GOAL: I asked James what he would do if the Kickstarter made double what we asked for, and he looked at his computer then back at me, made a wide-eyed face and then looked back at his computer again.~*~*~*#4 COLLABS~*~*~*Part of whats really cool about making art is about seeing what other artists do with the things you make! We want to reach out to producers for remixes, singers for collaborations on tracks, and all that kinda stuff. We have ideas for vocal versions of many of the songs on Endless Fantasy - we just need the resources to get the right singers.We want to make a vocal collab album of a few songs from Endless Fantasy, and we wanna to give it to you for helping make it.(this one time we did a das racist remix) GOAL AT 50K: Make an album of vocal collaborations from ENDLESS FANTASY, plus get a few remixes done!MEGALONG STRETCH GOAL: Make a vocal collab album, way more remixes.~*~*~*#5 MERCH STUFF~*~*~*We've always been into the idea of making merch specifically cooler than it has to be. When Paul Robertson made an animated gif for a single we made, we decided to print it as a lenticular to make it animate in real life. Paul Robertson gif Paul Robertson irl For Endless Fantasy we want to make radiant acrylic USB drives for the album to make it feel like the same material as the cube on the cover. like this but a flash drive Also we really wanna release our 2xLP on some translucent colored vinyl! boring GOAL AT 50K: Make USB flash drives, colored vinyl with hologram sticker, other exciting ideas that are in the works!MEGALONG STRETCH GOAL: Skies the limit on this one really!~*~*~*~#6 INTERACTIVE WEB PROJECTS~*~*~*~In the same way that we want to make music videos, we also want to experiment with the next level. We want to reach out to certain programmers and designers to develop some immersive projects - it's something we feel like an album made for the internet absolutely has to do nowadaysWe've tried in the past - but think with our experience since 2009 and your help, we can make something even better :) dawnmetropolis.com by Lolz LLC & Normative GOAL AT 50K: Develop a few sites/games/projects with talented programmers & artists.MEGALONG STRETCH GOAL: Doesn't really exist!#####OHHHHHHH MAN REWARDS#####WE GOT A LOTTA STUFF THAT WE WANT TO GIVE YOU FOR BACKING THIS PROJECT!!!()()()()() THE ALBUM ITSELF ()()()()()You can get the album as a reward for donating to this Kickstarter!

When a big spill ruined an important computer of ours, we set out to create a better, smarter mug - a mug that would stand up to accidental knocks and bumps. After years of development, we came up with Mighty Mug, the world's only mug powered by our patented Smartgrip Technology. When you knock into other mugs they fall over and spill on your computer, papers, phone, pants and basically ruin your day. Mighty Mug is different as it grips to your desk when knocked into, but lifts naturally like any other mug. The magic is in Mighty Mug's patented Smartgrip base. Mighty Mug creates a super powerful airlock once placed down, but automatically releases when you need a sip.There are no buttons to push or levers to pull to get Mighty Mug to work. Mighty Mug is not a suction cup nor is it a magnet, but rather something entirely new.Mighty Mug will grip to any smooth, flat, solid surface like most desks and tables. The most amazing part about Mighty Mug is that when you go in for a sip it lifts 100% naturally. Grips when hit but lifts when you need a sip. We are a team of mechanical engineers and industrial designers who have spent the last 3 years developing Mighty Mug and it's patented Smartgrip technology. We hope that you love Mighty Mug and it's innovative solution. Mighty Mug Prototype Grip Tricks We believe that once you try Mighty Mug you are going to be blown away. Thank you for take the time to check out Mighty Mug and please share with anyone that hates mugs that fall and spill. Be Mighty, Jayme-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Last year we launched our first Mighty Mug travel mug and are now seeking to expand with new models. The tooling for production on each of these items has recently been completed and backers will receive their Mighty Mug as soon as September/October of this year. With your help, we hope to offset some of these production costs and get the first run onto the desks of Kickstarter Backers. As a backer of Mighty Mug you can choose from any of the Mighty Mug family: Full Mighty Mug Line you can choose from left to right - Mighty Mug Solo Plastic, Mighty Mug Go Plastic, Mighty Mug Solo Stainless, Mighty Mug Go Stainless, Mighty Mug Ice About Each Mighty Mug: Mighty Mug Go Stainless Steel is a double walled vacuum insulated mug that keeps your beverage hot for 6+ hours cold for 14+.

So, depending on the shoes you choose, sometimes you might want to go with a smaller or larger size in the Shoe Bubble. ___________________________________________________________ This minimalist orthotic softly raises your arch up to proper alignment, while forming to your feet like a custom insole. Rather than spending hundreds of dollars on bulky orthotics that are made of hard plastic and cheap compressible foams, you can now enjoy increased support, balance, and comfort in the shoes you already own. Let us free ourselves of the foot ailments that affect millions of people each year and cause the kind of pain that can hold us back from doing our favorite activities. Foot pain can make for a dreadful day of work and affect the alignment of the ankles, knees, hips and spine. Prevent Your Kids From Suffering These Injuries/Ailments Too!Consistently wearing arch supports prevents many injuries and saves money and time in the long run. So, you ve got to be able to fit the support into the shoes that you need to wear. You Don't Need To Sacrifice Style For Comfort Sole Insole is all you need to keep your arches from dropping and over pronating. It s really comfortable and easy to use. The stickiness will renew! The Shoe Bubble is made of of a high quality and specialized material that's made to last! ___________________________________________________________What People are Saying About our Samples more reviews on yelp!WE NEED YOUR HELP!

75`Our Kickstarter campaign is over but you can still get WEDO Banana Flour Visit Our Website For More Informationwww.wedoglutenfree.com Recently seen on KSL TV WHAT IS BANANA FLOUR? Unique- Banana flour is a fresh, superior tasting, healthy alternative to wheat flour and other gluten free flours currently in the market today. The process- Making banana flour is simply gathering unripe green bananas before the sugar content has fully developed and peeling, slicing, drying, grinding and packaging. Taste- Green bananas are virtually flavorless. WEDO banana flour has an earthy wholesome natural taste. Color- Banana flour has an off white, beige color. HEALTH BENEFITS Resistant starch- WEDO banana flour is one of the very few foods containing RS2, an important form of resistant starch. Potassium- WEDO banana flour incorporates the health benefits of 330mg per serving (1/4 cup), 12 bananas worth of potassium in every 1 lb container. All Natural-WEDO banana flour is full of natural vitamins and minerals. Our banana flour is made from 100% all natural green bananas, no additives, preservatives, chemicals or dyes. HOW DOES BANANA FLOUR COOK?Direct Substitute- Banana flour reacts remarkably well in all cooking conditions. It can be used almost as a direct substitute for wheat flour both in taste and texture. Goes Further- The high starch content in banana flour calls for less measured usage, allowing you to use up to 30% less flour in every recipe. Why Banana Flour vs. Other Flours?Taste and Texture- Banana flour has little to no taste and the texture is light and fluffy, freeing you of gritty and grainy textures in your creations.Gluten Substitute- Banana flour mimics the results of wheat flour remarkably well, making for an easy transition to banana flour in your every day baking. However, some recipes do call for binding gums to obtain optimal consistency. Less is More- Because of the high starch content in banana flour it allows you to use less flour than required in your everyday recipes.Alternative Usage- Add a boost in nutrients to your morning smoothy, add some thickness to your soups or sauces, great additive to natural homemade baby foods. GREAT USER EXPERIENCEEasy to find packaging- Stands out more than any other product in its section on the grocery store shelves.No Mess- Say goodbye to clips, rubber bands, Ziplock's and broken flour bags. Our resealable container is mess free and easily stores in your kitchen.Easy Use- You can scoop your measuring cup right in the container or easily pour out the required amount of banana flour for every recipe. OUR JOURNEY The Beginning- WEDO ( We Do ) Gluten Free began in the heart of Kenya when Co-creator David Wintzer was assisting a group of 25 women, Women Entrepreneurs Development Organization (WEDO.) The women were granted micro-loans to start up small business, one of which a banana flour factory which was proudly WEDO Gluten Free s original and first supplier. After working with group for almost two years, WEDO Gluten Free knew it had to expand to other parts of the world if it wanted to meet the demand for a potential US market. The Now- We have spent the last six months shaking hands and testing samples from suppliers all across the world. WEDO has developed relationships with suppliers in India, Philippines, Ecuador and Peru providing economic opportunity to small scale farmers and manufacturers across the board. For the majority of these countries bananas are a staple food crop and with an excess amount of bananas going to waste each year, WEDO is able to partner with manufactures giving an alternate use to the banana overload, providing an additional revenue stream to manufacturers and farmers a like.WHY KICKSTARTER?For this Kickstarter campaign we have chosen a supplier in South America, who is a family operated and owned business. They put as much love and care into their products as WE DO. After placing and receiving our first order, we have the product packed into our WEDO containers for distribution to local grocery stores, restaurants and bakeries. We need your backing today to pay for production, shipping, packaging and delivery of our first large scale shipment to bring the product to you and to meet the demand of the growing gluten free market.
76`|Four Versions Now Available: Une Bobine - For iPhone (24 inches / 60 cm) Une Bobine - Micro||USB (24 inches / 60 cm) Petite Bobine - For iPhone (12 inches / 30 cm) Petite Bobine - Micro||USB (12 inches / 30 cm) All reward levels have the choice of version(s). After the project is complete, we will send a survey for you to make your choice and provide your shipping address. Please read Update #8 and #9 for some great announcements! We have announced Une Bobine - Micro||USB for Android devices and Petite Bobine, a 12 inch version to complement the 24 inch Une Bobine. Every pledge level will have complete choice of which versions you want. Because project funding has hit our stretch goal of $90,000, all Bobines will include a 3 foot USB Extension Cable at no charge! Also, be sure to check out the video of our 'Kickathon' (sort of a hackathon for our Kickstarter project) on Update #9! This gives you a little behind the scenes peak at what goes into making products like these.Android Guys "Make your Android happy..."TUAW "...a stylish and handy iPhone cable..."9to5 Mac "The benefits of the Une Bobine (which is French for "A Coil") are obvious"Mashable "...the coil created by [FUSE]Chicken is pretty clever." (video review embedded below)Technabob "There are a million docks, stands, and cables...Une Bobine can replace them all"Lazytechguys.com "The Coolest Way To Charge Your iPhone!" ,"This is innovation at its best."Geeky Gadgets "...a new innovative flexible cable"macgasm.net "...a perfect example of what we love to see on Kickstarter."Buzzraid "...this is something you should add to your arsenal." What is Une Bobine?Une Bobine is a patent pending flexible and eclectic stand, sync, and charging cable for iPhone... and Android. We have designed the cable with a very specific metal gooseneck material that provides a fully flexible cable with enough strength to hold the weight of your phone. The cable can be flexed in different positions, coiled, wrapped around objects.... the only limit is your imagination. I still don't know what "Une Bobine" is...We went through dozens of product name ideas before we settled on Une Bobine. It is French for 'A Coil' and also has Bob's name in it, which made Bob happy.Who is Bob?Bob is a stick figure and he had a problem. He didn't like setting his iPhone on a table to charge and sync. Too many scratches and spilled drinks. He also didn't want to buy docks for everywhere he wanted a stand. So he had an idea... what if he could make an iPhone (and Android) cable accesory to charge and sync that was also flexible and strong enough to be a stand for his phone? This is how Une Bobine was created.Who is [Fuse]Chicken and why are you here?[Fuse]Chicken is the off-shoot of our design and engineering studio. We have been developing award winning products for clients around the world for over 25 years. We have created everything from toys to vacuum cleaners and everything in between. You can check out some of our products at www.fawcett.com. Until now, there has not been an avenue to pursue our own product ideas that we regularly have. So that's why we're turning to you on Kickstarter. Creating a new product is easy, manufacturing it isn't. We have our own rapid prototyping and CNC machines, but these are limited to low quantities.We need your help with the funding to be able produce the Une Bobine cable affordably in larger quantities. What can Une Bobine do? Look very cool on your desk or table Charge your phone by connecting to USB or a wall charger Sync with a computer by connecting to USB Adjust based on your mood Hold your phone in your car Place iPhone at eye level for FaceTime Hold your phone steady for photography and videography Did we mention that it looks very cool? Why does Bob need my pledge?It is surprisingly expensive to produce a cable. Each end of the connector requires mulitple injection molds to create the custom fitting in the housings that we need to securely attach to the flexible cable. The connector housings are also sonically welded together, which requires additional tools to produce each end. Your pledges will directly pay for these startup costs required to produce the cable. What are the rewards? There are 4 versions available. All reward levels will have the choice of which version (or versions if you pledge for more than 1) you will receive. This selection will be made after the project is complete. Une Bobine - For iPhone (24 inches/60 cm) Une Bobine - Micro||USB (24 inches/60 cm) Petite Bobine - For iPhone (12 inches/30 cm) Petite Bobine - Micro||USB (12 inches/30 cm) All rewards include free shipping worldwide (except for shipping people)$1 - Thank you very much. Every dollar helps.$10 - An 8x10 glossy print of any frame from Bob's video, product photo, or rendering from the project.$25 - Your very own Bobine.$40 - Bob's Early Bird Special! 2 Bobines$50 - 2 Bobines shipped to your door.$75 - 4 Bobinesand a 5 pack of stickers with the [FUSE]chicken beak logo.$100 - 6 Bobines and a signed 8x10 print of any frame from the Bob video.$250 - 15 Bobines. And we'll call you to personally thank you while you are eating the chocolates that Bob sends you.$500 - 33 Bobines...gifts for all of your friends. And Bob (or a look-alike) will pick you up from Cleveland Hopkins or Akron-Canton Airport and take you to a celebration in your honor where you will be toasted with Great Lakes Brewery's finest while dining on Cleveland's famous Polish sausages. (Airfare and accommodations not provided).$750 - In addition to the $500 reward above, we will also produce a new 'Bob' video based on your life.$1000 - In addition to the $750 reward above, the soundtrack for your video will be a song written just for you.$1350 - Retail Pack of 100 Bobines.$2500 - The $500 reward level plus lunch for 4 with our staff in Cleveland. You pick the cuisine, we'll pick the restaurant... don't worry, we have good taste.$5000 - The $500 reward level plus a half-day design workship and lunch with our staff. Design, Engineering, Marketing, and more. And we'll throw in a brand new 16GB iPhone 4S along with your Une Bobine Cables! This will be an unlocked GSM iPhone. How long until I will receive my reward?Because we have already been through many prototype tests and have reached a final design, we have a manufacturing partner finalized and are prepared to approve them to begin tooling on the day that we reach the funding goal. This is the step to start building the injection molds for the custom connector housings. This process will take approximately 30 days to complete. All of the electrical wiring, connectors, and the flexible coil are already sourced and ready for purchase. When it's all said and done, we expect parts to ship from the manufacturer within approximately 45 days from the day we reach the funding goal. We have even calculated for air freight because the parts are lightweight. So there should only be a few day turn-around from the time they ship to us until they are shipping to you. Use your imagination! Une Bobine can be positioned nearly every conceivable way.These are functional prototypes being used for testing, so the connector ends are not the finished product. Part of the funding goal is needed to create the injection molds for the connectors. We hope you enjoy watching the trailers for Une Bobine as much as we enjoyed making them!

77`Our MissionWe feel every designer needs a design tool to help them choose the proper color mixture when dealing with CMYK colors within their design projects.ConceptWe wanted to offer all inspiring designers and even seasoned professionals access to an inexpensive tool offer printed colors and Shades of the default color swatches for print in CMYK process.The idea for Shades was born. Since we print projects every day, why not print something simple that everyone could have on hand to give them that quick reference for the colors they might often use. While there are other process guides on the market, they are hard to find the colors you use the most and are difficult for many designers to afford.While running a print company, we have found many customers still have little to no concept of RGB to CMYK conversion, and ink levels, and why they don't get when they see on their screen. This is why we though everyone needs a color guide to give them a tool to predict their color output on a design job. This Kickstarter campaign focuses on the collection of the 54 Default Swatches that many designers might use provided in many modern design tools (minus the blends, duplicate and non-printable). We also will include Kickstarter Green :) ProductionCards will be printed in CMYK offset on 14pt card stock. Each card will have shade levels of every default swatch color from 5%, then 10% increments. Each card will have one side with UV Gloss coating and the other side be left Uncoated.Each Shades card will have their CMYK mixture levels, as well as their RGB and Hexadecimal color value to use for web reference. Depending on the funding we may be able to offer stretch goals of packaging, and other swatches, thicker material, and perhaps rounded corners... We hope you help us on this journey to offer many a simple tool to reference these often used colors. We hope to offer more campaigns in the future...Thank you for your support.Rewards DeliveryWe plan to get these items quickly produced, and then prepared for shipping shortly after. We are providing FREE shipping to US & Canada. We will ship via USPS for quick delivery. We have also added other rewards with minimal shipping costs for those outside of US/Canada.

80`Ladies and Gentlemen, be prepared to jump for joy... My PickUp Artist is HERE! "The idea for My Pickup Artist came to me 20 years ago. Call it efficiency or just being lazy, but I got tired of constantly digging around in my vanity drawer for all of my makeup. I use the same makeup in the same order every day (except for dramatic eye day), so why not organize it like that? I found an artists palette at a hardware store, covered it in heavy duty Velcro, then started sticking my makeup to it. It wasn t long before I figured out that it was great for traveling and I could stash it anywhere. This was the awesome space and time saver I was missing in my life!! It may have taken me 15 years to come to the realization, but a friend gawking over my idea was all it took- I knew other women could benefit from my idea. After several prototypes, countless focus groups, trademark/patent attorneys, mentors, business plans, investors and wine... My PickUp Artist was born!" - Valerie Caro, Founder As make-up enthusiasts, we here at My PickUp Artist have struggled with finding a simple solution to our chaotic mess of makeup products (read Valerie's story above... IT TOOK 20 YEARS!). Makeup bags are hard to get into, and there is no way of knowing what s in there without dumping all the contents out, wasting time and creating quite the mess. Not to mention, these bags DO NOT protect against makeup breakage, which makes taking your favorite makeup anywhere pretty risky. While makeup counters and desks are good for organizing and seeing all of your products, everyone else can see them too. And I m sure you d much rather their eyes be drawn to that pretty picture you have hanging on the wall, rather than the massive amounts of makeup cluttering the countertops. The wait is over... we have come up with the perfect solution! Our patent-pending hardcover, lightweight, make-up carrying case not only protects your makeup, but also keeps it organized and makes traveling easy. This unique system provides you the perfect set-up for "Beauty Whenever, Beauty Wherever!" Who would have thought a makeup carrying case could provide such ease and simplicity, ultimately saving you valuable time and money? We sure are excited about it and you should be too! When space is tight, My PickUp Artist spans the distance of a bathroom sink, creating an instant counter, giving you the extra space you need to get ready. The best part? Your favorite makeup is always right at your fingertips, and you can tuck it away whenever it s not in use! Whether you lay it flat or stand it up, My PickUp Artists slim design allows you to take and store it anywhere. So unlike having your products sprawled out all over the counter, you can keep them out of sight and out of mind, without giving up the space and organization a counter provides. My PickUp Artist is a hard-shelled case available in two different sizes, and three different colors! Along with the case, you will receive a pack of 20 heavy-duty hook & loop fastening strips varying in shapes and sizes; allowing you to custom fit everything from small pencil sharpeners and skinny eye liner, to big bottles of foundation and oddly shaped eye lash curlers. The entire My PickUp Artist is lined with a hook & loop felt allowing you to organize your own, favorite make up in which ever way you like! My PickUp Artist also includes a clear center compartment allowing you easy access to all of its contents. In addition, the case includes a high quality mirror making it easy to get ready on the go! The case is effortlessly locked close with a slide clasp, and the built in handle allows you the convenience of taking the case with you whenever you go!

We launched a successful crowdfunding campaign in April 2015. We surpassed our goal by 180%, which helped us open our online store to reach the online market. It has been an amazing journey and we're committed to the evolution of this product! We received amazing feedback from our backers last year for our small and large Cloops. But we've heard your requests to develop an even larger Cloop for those even larger cables you have around the house. Cloop is Patent Pending and International PCT registered.
82`Miss AI WEIWEI: NEVER SORRY on The Colbert Report? See it here. We have just over a week to go and we've already doubled our initial ask! Do we still need funds? Definitely. Any additional contributions go towards finishing costs and important things like subtitling, which will only help Weiwei's story reach a wider, global audience. Forty-three days into Weiwei's detention by Chinese authorities, he was granted his first family visit. Yet this only raises more questions than it answers, as his location and the charges against him remain a mystery, and his access to legal counsel completely denied. It's important that we continue to tell people about Weiwei. Funding this film is a way to achieve this end. ________________________________On the morning of April 3rd Ai Weiwei was detained at Beijing Capital Airport by customs police while traveling to Hong Kong. His Beijing studio was raided. His wife, Lu Qing, and eight assistants were taken into the local police station for questioning. Five of Weiwei's associates remain missing. On May 15th, 43 days after Weiwei disappeared into police custody, Lu Qing was allowed to visit him at an undisclosed location in Beijing. There still are no formal charges against Weiwei, but he continues to be held by police. These above events have dramatically changed the context of my film's production and release, but here is my original Kickstarter pitch ::Two years, seven countries and eleven cities later, I know Ai Weiwei. He is the ultimate prankster: simultaneously an international art star and a dissident artist in the Western press, with tens of thousands of Chinese netizens following him online and the government keeping almost constant tabs on him. I have over 200 hours of footage (some of it viewable here) that includes never-before-seen interviews with Weiwei s family, friends and fellow artists, and chronicles his preparation for major museum shows at the Haus der Kunst and Tate Modern, and a public sculpture work for New York s Central Park. The two years I spent filming him really mark his rise to international renown, both for his art and his online activism. He is probably the fiercest and loudest internal critic of China, yet somehow he is not in jail. Weiwei s story is extraordinary, but I need your help bringing it to the world. To date I have invested my own money and earned critical support from Agnes Gund, the Henry Luce Foundation and Hazen-Polsky Foundation. But, making a feature-length documentary is no small task. I m working with a top-notch team including editor Jen Fineran, composer Ilan Isakov, Beijing-based graphics company 39 Degrees North, and a host of volunteers helping get the word out. I now need funding to meet post-production costs of editing, color-correcting, sound mix and music recording. In a more abstract sense, you are helping to bring the issues of human rights, Internet censorship and freedom of expression to the forefront of conversations at film festivals, theaters, museums, universities, broadcast television, government and diplomatic offices everywhere we plan to show the film. Thank you for your support!

83`People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! is saying, We re here. We have always been here. And we are very, very excited to show it. What does it mean, for you, yes, you the reader, the avid science fiction fan, purveyor of the imaginative even when faced by the banality of a day-to-day life to support a publication that is colored, and we mean, like really, really colored, by the nuances of culture, race, and history? For one, you get to read something that would dispel the notion of POC-penned science fiction as somewhat inferior science fiction. We will work very hard to come up with a lineup that will counter this assumption, and we will succeed in doing so.We believe in science fiction s transformative powers, its ability to remedy the dreariness of our lives. People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! will exist, with your kind help, of course, to relieve a brokenness we ve enabled time and time again by favoring certain voices and portrayals of particular characters. We won t harangue you with guilt trips involving the importance of openly listening to the assimilated, the colonized, the misappropriated. That s just not how we roll. What we aim to do, instead, is to challenge you: Join us because it is fun to do so. We don t mean fun as a vehicle for trivializing centuries of injustice that resulted in the lack of representation for certain groups of people because power structures were skewed heavily in favor of a chosen few. We mean fun as the satisfaction we get in those light-bulb-in-the-head moments of our lives, the satisfaction we get from meaningful conversations that lend clarity, the satisfaction we get when we move past those feel-good-driven acts of tokenism, the satisfaction we get when we read stories that have palpable artistic and intellectual values that speak of our present time and most of all, our future.As we said in our submission call, we will not be asking writers who submit stories to tell us what makes them people of colo(u)r. We leave that up to your world experience, your conscience, your sense of community, and your sense of fair play. And like the other hugely successful initiatives of Lightspeed s Destroy series, People of Colo(u)r Destroy Science Fiction! is saying, We re here. We have always been here. And we are very, very excited to show it. Join us by supporting our Kickstarter. P.S. If you're excited too, and not just in the I GOTTA HAVE THIS THING sort of way but in the I GOTTA BE PART OF THIS kind of way, good news! If you write fiction, we're currently open to submissions for the issue. If you don't write fiction, or even if you do, but you want to help out in some other way, the best thing you can do is help spread the word about this campaign. And if you have other ways you'd like to help, we're happy to listen! We ll publish the special issue whether the campaign is successful or not, but the campaign will determine how big and awesome we make the issue. If we raise just $5000, we ll be able to make the special issue a special double-sized issue,and if we raise even more than that, we have a few really excellent stretch goals lined up as well. In 2014, we conducted a successful campaign to fund our first special issue, Women Destroy Science Fiction!, which ended up raising more than 1000% of our original goal, and unlocked additional special issues Women Destroy Horror! and Women Destroy Fantasy!In 2015, we conducted another successful campaign to fund Queers Destroy Science Fiction!. It performed similarly to WDSF, raising more than 1000% of our goal, and unlocked additional special issues Queers Destroy Horror! and Queers Destroy Fantasy! A regular issue of LIGHTSPEED contains an equal mix of science fiction and fantasy short fiction, consisting of 4 original stories, 4 reprints, plus a novella reprint (exclusive to our ebook edition). Each issue also includes a feature interview, a book review column, a media review column, and spotlights on the authors who appear in the issue. The special issue will contain the following: All science fiction (no fantasy) 5 original, never-before-published short stories About 5,000 words of original flash fiction (about 5 flash stories) 2 previously-published short stories 1 previously-published novella Author Spotlights on our authors in this issue Assorted nonfiction features An original cover illustration If we successfully fund, the special DOUBLE issue will contain the following additional material: 5 additional original, never-before-published short stories (for a total of 10) About 5,000 additional words of original flash fiction (for a total of about 10 flash stories) 2 additional previously-published short stories (for a total of 4) Author Spotlights on the additional authors Even more assorted nonfiction features Plus, if we unlock one of our stretch goals, the issue will include additional material as well. And naturally, all of the above will all be authored entirely by POC creators. For this special issue, control of the magazine has been handed over to a talented team of POC creators:Nalo Hopkinson, Co-Editor-in-Chief/Original Fiction EditorNalo Hopkinson is a Jamaican-born Canadian whose taproots extend to Trinidad and Guyana.

LIGHTSPEED (lightspeedmagazine.com) is a digital science fiction and fantasy magazine. In its pages, you will find science fiction: from near-future, sociological soft SF, to far-future, star-spanning hard SF and fantasy: from epic fantasy, sword-and-sorcery, and contemporary urban tales, to magical realism, science-fantasy, and folktales. When you read LIGHTSPEED, it is our hope that you ll see where science fiction and fantasy comes from, where it is now, and where it s going.LIGHTSPEED is a two-time winner of the Hugo Award, and stories from LIGHTSPEED have been nominated for the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award, the Theodore Sturgeon Award, and the World Fantasy Award. Previously, we crowdfunded our two other "Destroy" special issues: In 2014, we published Women Destroy Science Fiction!, which was named one of NPR's best books of 2014 and won the British Fantasy Award; and in 2015, we published Queers Destroy Science Fiction!, which received similar acclaim. When not doing special issues devoted to destroying science fiction, LIGHTSPEED is usually edited by bestselling anthologist John Joseph Adams, editor of anthologies such as Wastelands, The Living Dead, and Brave New Worlds, and series editor of Best American Science Fiction & Fantasy. All of the money raised by this project will be used to fund the publication of the POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue and related stretch goals. Anything leftover after that will go toward the production of future issues of LIGHTSPEED. You'll find our various reward options in a column on the right side of this page (PC/Mac) or on a separate page (iOS/Android). Below are some explanations and clarifications of our various reward options. All backers who pledge at least $5 (the DESTROY SF! reward level) will receive an ebook copy of the LIGHTSPEED POC Destroy Science Fiction! special issue. The special issue will be available in June 2016. All ebook rewards, including ebook subscriptions, will be made available DRM-free in epub, mobi, and PDF format via our ebookstore. Mobi is primarily for Kindle/Kindle app users; Epub works on lots of things, such as Nook, Kobo, and iBooks. If you select one of the subscription rewards, your subscription will begin with the June 2016 issue. Since all of the subscription rewards include the DESTROY SF! reward, the POCDSF special issue won't count against your subscription; so if you buy a one-year subscription, you'll really be getting 13 issues, rather than 12, etc. If you are an EXISTING SUBSCRIBER: If you choose one of the subscription rewards, we'll just extend your current subscription by the specified term (i.e., by 1 year, 2 years, etc.). Note: We can only do this for subscribers who subscribe directly via the LIGHTSPEED store or via Weightless Books; unfortunately we can't offer to extend subscriptions for Kindle Periodicals subscribers. When we send out the Kickstarter survey after the campaign concludes, we'll ask you which store your subscription is currently with and renew it accordingly. If you want the DESTROY PRINT reward, but also want to back at a higher tier, we also have options for that. Just look for the rewards that have PRINT in the titles. To our international backers who want the DESTROY PRINT! reward we apologize for the stiff fee ($20) for international shipping, but that's what it costs, unfortunately! The print edition will likely be between 1-2 lbs., which means the shipping will be $18+, so we rounded that up to $20 for the "handling" part of "shipping and handling." PREMIUM REWARD - Video Chats: Chats can be about whatever you want (within reason!) in connection with the theme of the project. So that includes the business of writing and publishing, science fiction/fantasy in general, POC SF/F specifically, etc. But if you just want to squee about your mutual interests, that's okay too! In the event we massively exceed our goal, we'd like to thank our backers by offering the following stretch goals: (#1) $10,000 - Essays & Artwork Booster - UNLOCKED!The Personal Essays we're posting on Kickstarter throughout the campaign will also be included in the issue, and we'll double the number of stories illustrated in the issue from four to eight.(#2) $15,000 - Destroy/Subscriptions Booster - UNLOCKED!If you chose a LIGHTSPEED subscription reward, you'll get LIGHTSPEED issues #1-73 (including the POC Destroy Science Fiction! issue), and your subscription will begin with #74 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-73, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.If you chose a NIGHTMARE subscription reward, you'll get access to NIGHTMARE issues #1-45, and your subscription will begin with #46 (July 2016). If you already have issues #1-45, we will substitute FANTASY issues #1-59.All other reward tiers will get 3 additional back issues of LIGHTSPEED (for a total of 6), plus 3 back issues of NIGHTMARE and 3 back issues of FANTASY.(#3) $20,000 - JJA POC Sampler - UNLOCKED!LIGHTSPEED publisher John Joseph Adams will assemble an ebook sampler of POC-authored stories previously selected for publication in his many projects. Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be like a short anthology (about 50K words; about half the size of a normal anthology). All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016] (#4) $25,000 - Podcasts Booster - UNLOCKED!We normally podcast 4 (out of 8) stories we publish on our website each month. If we reach this stretch goal, we'll podcast all 7 short stories we publish on the website, plus one of the flash fiction pieces. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016] (#5) $30,000 - POC Destroy Horror! - UNLOCKED!We'll publish an additional special issue, POC Destroy Horror! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine, NIGHTMARE. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Oct. 2016](#6) $40,000 - POC Destroy Fantasy! - UNLOCKED!We'll publish an additional special issue, POC Destroy Fantasy! Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. It will be published as a special issue of our sister-magazine, FANTASY. FANTASY merged with LIGHTSPEED in 2012, but we'll revive it for this one special issue. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Dec. 2016](#7) $50,000 - JJA POC Anthology BoosterWe'll make the JJA POC Sampler (the $20K stretch goal) into a full-sized anthology (about 100K words, about 20-25 stories). Everyone who pledges at least $5 will receive an ebook of this additional reward. All backers who pledge at least $5 will receive this reward. [Estimated delivery: Jun. 2016] To add an add-on to your pledge, click the "Manage Your Pledge" button, then increase your pledge by the relevant amount. There s no way to tell us NOW which add-ons you want (an unfortunate limitation of Kickstarter), so we ll get that information from you during the Kickstarter survey process after the campaign is over. Basically we ll send out the surveys and ask if you added any add-ons to your pledge, and then we ll cross-reference everything with the pledge data.Sound complicated? It is! But it's the only way to offer the full array of options our backers have previously requested during our other campaigns.

84`A Big, Huge Thank You To Our Backers!We are ecstatic to say the leashes and toys are en-route and expected Mid-October. After all of our Backer s orders are filled in Mid-October, the We Leash and replacement We Toys can be ordered on Amazon, with Prime shipping as part of their Launchpad program, and on our website, wefordogs.com. For all your help, we promise to be a company that works tirelessly for dogs and the people who love them. A generous portion of our proceeds directly benefits Canine Assistants in their mission to provide service dogs to people in need, free of charge. For your contribution, we thank you.Now go out and enjoy your walks, together! Jennifer + Shannon The We LeashDon t you love the idea of going for a walk with your dog? You and your best friend strolling down the sidewalk, sharing the morning sun. It s a wonderful concept but it doesn t often work that way, does it? What should be fun can easily dissolve into a drag literally! Ugh! Not to mention those times your dog goes full Cujo at passers-by. You know, the kind of display that makes you want to insist to the world that he belongs to the neighbors.As a strong believer in the value of the human dog bond, I felt certain we could do better. After all, walks are meant to strengthen your body and your relationship rather than putting a strain on them. Walks should be interactive. And they should be joyful. One day, I realized that the happiest I d ever seen dogs on leash was when they were proudly holding a part of their leash or a favorite toy in their mouths. Their people looked happy, too. Best of all, they seemed engaged with one another. So with that in mind, I designed the We Leash a handle for people and a handle for dogs. No more pulling or dragging. And because the design helps prevent dogs from feeling restrained, they feel more secure and are less likely to react inappropriately on leash.Easy for those dogs that like to carry stuff, right? But, what if your dog isn t one to enjoy carrying things in his mouth? No problem! He can quickly learn the pleasure of being able to take his human for a nice stroll. Just by learning to hold his attached leash handle or toy, he can feel safe, secure, and connected to his favorite person. It's easy to teach and easy to learn! The We Leash allows your dog a feeling of secure attachment and a sense of control that will reap benefits far beyond your actual walks. Easy, well-behaved dogs are those who feel both secure in the love of their people and capable of exerting some measure of control in their own lives. You and your dog will love this leash and the connection it brings to your time together. Enjoy your walk! Jennifer Our Most Asked Questions What do I do with the toy if my dog does not want to carry his handle or toy on our walk?You'll love this part. If at times your dog chooses not to hold the toy, the two lines simply snap together creating a regular leash. You can unclip the toy and we have provided a carabiner for convenience near the human handle where the toy or handle can hang. I noticed the dogs you feature were retriever breeds, how difficult will it be to use with non-retriever breeds?You are right about the retrievers on video but I've had great success with other breeds-as have friends and our test team. Basically if your dog will hold anything in his or her mouth at all (including a rawhide) it should be easy to encourage him/her to hold the leash. Any necessary effort is well worth the advantages-for both of you.RewardsOrganic Plush Toys and Binkies with CrinkleThose pledging at the Supporter Level ($19) may choose one Organic Plush Toy or Binkie. These toys are just for fun and not equipped to be used with the We Leash. A survey will be sent following the end of the Kickstarter Campaign allowing you to choose which Toy or Binkie you would like.

Praise for the We Leash "The We Leash is the best new idea I've seen in my 25 years as a dog training professional" Judy L., Professional Dog Trainer"There's never been a leash like the We Leash providing two-way interaction, dogs feel less restrained, and less restraint means less problem behaviors."

85`"Special Thanks to Patrick Calderon and Johanna Calderon-Dakin for providng us with their invaluable PR and crowdfunding expertise" - Curt and Vincent, inventors of the Nomad"... perfect for a roadtrip ... it could quickly become a must-have for small kitchens and the like." - Matt Burns, Techcrunch"...this light-weight, hand crank-powered device means the best espresso is always right at your finger tips." - Beth Buczynski, EarthTechling, TreeHugger "The Nomad is the Greenest Espresso Machine Ever" - Dennis Burger, Technology Tell "... the Nomad should remove some guesswork from the complicated process of perfecting a shot of espresso." - Jason Evangelho, Forbes "... espresso making simplified ... perfect for on the road or back to Nature journeys ... True Crema Valve technology makes creamy flavor-intense espresso every time." - Debra Atlas, Red FerretThe Nomad is a revolutionary portable espresso machine. If you are a coffee lover you ll love having the Nomad with you wherever you go. It makes the highest quality espresso, and it does this anywhere you have coffee and hot water. The Nomad is clean and green. It needs no electricity, batteries, or high pressure gas cartridges. There are no expensive wasteful coffee pods or capsules to be discarded.The Nomad is perfect for everyday use at home in the kitchen or garden. It's the ideal espresso machine to use at work or in the field. The Nomad is a great companion for your RV, camping, and boating lifestyle. Whether you take it with you fishing, or hunting, or on a business trip the best espresso is right at your finger tips. The possibilities are endless. The Nomad was inspired by the classic hand operated lever machines which remain the benchmark of quality espresso machines. We simplified and miniaturized the large, complex lever machines and created a portable device that s very easy to use. The Nomad is the size of a 15 cm cube, weighs 1.1 kg, and requires no electricity. With very little effort the Nomad produces 9 bars of pressure and like the classic lever machines users have direct control over the water temperature, pressure, flow rate, and volume. Skilled coffee hobbyists and experts will enjoy playing with these variables. In addition, The Nomad is equipped with a proprietary True Crema Valve which compensates for coarser grounds and tamping variations. When used with the True Crema Valve anyone can make great espresso and coffee without having expensive grinding equipment and extensive training. Just pack ground coffee, add hot water, and actuate the pump lever. The following video shows that Nomad pulls great espresso when used without the True Crema Valve. In this way Nomad works like other high quality machines, requiring proper grinding and tamping to make perfect espresso. We use the Nomad prototype without the TCV on a daily basis, with well calibrated grounds out of a commercial Italian grinder or a hand-cranked German mill. The following video shows, with the True Crema Valve, Nomad makes great espresso even with coarser grounds and imperfect tamping technique. This means that, users can make quality espresso with little effort the very first time they use the Nomad and every time thereafter. The True Crema Valve system is a proprietary technology researched, developed, and perfected by UniTerra Inc. It is not seen in any other espresso machine.

86`Thanks a lot for stopping by !Have you ever wondered how strong the wind is, exactly at the spot where you are? If you are a kitesurfer or windsurfer like us, then the answer is probably yes. But perhaps as a sailor, paraglider, model aircraft pilot, etc. etc. you would also like to get a precise reading of the wind, right on the spot? Then the Vaavud wind meter is just what you need!The Vaavud wind meter enables you to take precise and reliable measurements of the wind anywhere, using your iOS or Android phone. And of course you can share your measurements online, and see live wind readings from other users on a map. So Vaavud can help you plan your trip, choose the right gear when you get to the spot, and alert others of the conditions before they go.The Vaavud wind meter contains no electronics, but still connects wirelessly to your phone... Wait, what ?? Yes, you read it correctly :-) The secret is two small magnets in the rotor. The magnetic field sensor in the phone can detect when they rotate, and by using algorithms normally used for sound processing, the rotations can be converted to wind speed. Complicated engineering, made user friendly and simple. In fact, nobody has utilized the smartphone magnetometer in this way before. The device has been very thoroughly tested and it has been calibrated in a wind tunnel at The Technical University of Denmark. It will be manufactured with keen attention to detail, so it will great looking, durable, and easy to use. To realize this project we need to make a significant investment in production tools, and meet minimum order requirements - so we need your help! Please back our project, and share it with your friends. Thanks a lot for your trust and support!//Andreas, Maria and Thomas A note about supported devices Because the Vaavud wind meter depends on a hardware component (the magnetometer) in the phone, we need to test and calibrate it with a wide range of devices. So far we have confirmed that it works with the following models iPhone 4, 4S and 5 iPad 2nd generation and 3rd generation Android: Samsung Galaxy SII and SIII Given that it works with the Galaxy phones, it will most likely work with pretty much any newer Android smartphone. But at his point we can not guarantee it, because we have not had the time and resources to conduct actual tests yet. Timeline Vaavud high level project plan

88`ATTENTION NEW BACKERS: Don't forget to visit the BACKERS ONLY UPDATES section for instructions on how to get your digital download! UPDATE FOR THE $250 LOS ANGELES ALBUM LAUNCH PARTY!ALL $250 packages include TWO tickets! Bring a friend to the launch party/show at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on August 23rd - 2013Project update 10.0Hello, Everyone.Less than a week to go for our Kickstarter campaign.So far we've raised over $200k from a little less than 5000 supporters. That's enough to manufacture and fulfill the orders, pay our wonderful team, cover recording costs, and we have a little left over for promotion and marketing. A few years ago it would have been so much more difficult to get a project like this off the ground, and there would have been a mountain of debt, but here we are - it's amazing to be able to start the release process free and clear. Thank you all so much.We are nearly done with the package design and will send out manufacturing orders as soon as the campaign closes. Vinyl will likely take a bit longer than CDs and posters, but we'll keep updating you with the progress until we can get your orders into your hands.We're so happy we were able to get the music out to you early. Kickstarter isn't actually built for early rewards, but they were generous in allowing us to go ahead and find a workaround to provide you with downloads before the campaign was over. Once we've finished the campaign, artwork will be reworked and we will provide updated download links for you.Perhaps we'll reach the stretch goal of $250k, perhaps we won't. It's been exciting to see the campaign become so active again in the last week (We're back on the front page of Kickstarter!). However it goes, it's been a great ride. It took a while for us to get this record made, and just seeing the early reaction to the music has already made it worth the time and effort.Once again - word of mouth is just about our only way of spreading the news. Thanks for all you've done, and we'd still appreciate it if you shouted out once more through Twitter or Facebook, or if you happen to run a giant media conglomerate and want to stick it on the evening news or a stadium jumbotron that's ok too.Thank you all.You rock-ToadP.S. We thought you might want a sneak peak of the New Constellation Album cover. We hope you like it!P.S.S. Annnnnd an acoustic version of "California Wasted" Project update 9.0Hello, there.This has been an exciting and busy couple of months. We ve been out on the road across the States, overjoyed to play the new material and see the Kickstarter supporters singing along from the audience. Thank you all!So...we are in the final days of the campaign. Artwork has had a few unavoidable scheduling setbacks but is now racing full-steam ahead. My good friend Ben Ciccati has been drawing up a storm - all the images you ve been seeing on the site are his. For graphic design we ve brought in Kii Arens, who will put together the LP and CD Kickstarter packages, as well as poster and shirt design. I love seeing what the two of them are coming up with, and we ll share it with you soon.A few days ago I bought a tin space man and shot a lyric video for New Constellation. It s fairly silly, but if anyone needs motion-tracked rockets added to their home videos I now know how. We might sign the spaceman and have him as a Kickstarter item if people are interested. Let us know.Anyway: Thank you again, and please keep spreading the word. If your friends (or Twitter followers, or Friends) like Toad let them know about the campaign, and if you like the record (and the extra tracks) tell them about that, too. Please. With sugar on top.Many more shows to come, an acoustic EP to record, people to see and places to go...Say hello if you re nearby.Be wellg Project update 8.0Thank you so much for your continued support, we're deeply grateful. We'd like to remind you that if we reach our new stretch goal of $250K before the end of the campaign on August 4th, all backers will get a LIVE EP from the August tour. With that end date on the horizon, we have reached the point where we would like to ask all of you - our core supporters - to help spread the word and enlist support from your extended networks on social media and beyond. Together, we have managed to achieve three times our initial goal with less than five thousand backers and word of mouth alone. With just a little more awareness we should be able to take this all the way to the finish line, so if you know a Toad fan, let them know there's only a couple more weeks to get the album now instead of waiting till September for the general release. From the bottom of our hearts thank you in advance, and hope to see you all on the road! - Glen, Todd, Randy & Dean Project update 7.0A huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to our Kickstarter campaign thus far. We are still completely overwhelmed by the response. We have a lot of updates this week! New backer rewards (based on your feedback) a special note from Todd and a new stretch goal! Since we have reached our first stretch goal of $150K - all backers will be receiving a new, in-studio acoustic recording - distributed as a digital download - and recorded at Revolver studios. For stretch goal #2 - if we reach $250K before the end of the campaign - all backers will get a Live EP from an upcoming tour date. More music!Thank you everyone for your continued support! See you on the road!Check out this personal note from Todd Project Update 6.0 Happy Independence Day, Everybody!Thanks to all of you who have already joined the Kickstarter campaign for our new Toad the Wet Sprocket album New Constellation. We are stunned and humbled by the outpouring of support and the encouraging first reactions to this--our first, new record in 16 years.Due to the overwhelming demand for more Kickstarter packages, we re giving you the chance to create your own custom package! We re calling it Kickstart Your Independence!Please give us your suggested packages below in the comments section of this post. We will pick two new packages to add to our campaign and announce them next week!And remember - In order to get your Kickstarter Early-Rewards Version of the full tracks from New Constellation - you must be a Project Backer. Read this backers only post for instructions on how to get your download! Thanks for hanging with us - and happy 4th of July! Project Update 5.0Thanks so much for hanging in there with us while we have been trying to figure out how to distribute the Kickstarter Early-Rewards Bonus Version of the full tracks from New Constellation. If you are a project backer - you can check out the Backers Only Updates section for instructions on how to get your download. And check out this personal note from Dean!Thank you again for your support and happy listening!- Glen, Randy, Todd and Dean Project Update 4.0Hi Again,We're in the home-stretch! Right now the new record is being mastered (a much more gentle process than the name suggests), whereby the final eq and volume tweaks are made. We're actually on the 2nd round of mastering--it's being "re-mastered", which, frankly, makes no sense. There really should be a different name to the whole process. In any event, that's what's happening. We're also having the final touches done on the artwork. We don't know what that process is called, but it must be a bit less diabolical sounding. What this all means is that you'll be able to download the whole album very soon, and as soon as the artwork is finished we'll get to work on printing up the CD, creating the actual physical evidence that we're a band! We're genuinely excited about this album, but more than anything we're sincerely grateful and humbled by the support you've given us-- now and for so many years. From the bottom of our very full hearts, Thank You!Oh, and one more thing - the single "New Constellation" is available for download right now if you have backed the project. Hope you like it. Again, a thousand thanks. Sincerely, Toad (Glen, Randy, Todd and Dean) Project Update 3.0We made it home from this leg of the tour and are grateful for all of your support - it's really quite overwhelming. Now our goal is to make sure to keep up our end of the bargain to you, so we're hard at work (ok scrambling really) to figure out a way to honor the Kickstarter Early-Rewards Bonus Version of the full tracks from New Constellation. We've been collaborating with the kind folks at Kickstarter to figure out a way to make it work, and ask for a little more time to sort this out. We definitely want to prevent any further SNAFUs with this part of the program.All Kickstarter backers will receive the single "New Constellation" this week in a "backer update". (Going forward new backers will be able to get the single in the same update).Thank you again for your incredible support (and patience)!- Glen, Randy, Todd & Dean ************PROJECT UPDATE! Hello again! This has been a humbling, wonderful few days. In addition to the Kickstarter launch, we are out in New York this week, playing a handful of shows as well as having the honor of playing at 80th birthday celebration for Willie Nelson. Our bucket lists are getting lots of checkmarks.We have set a new stretch goal of $150K for the Kickstarter campaign. Our initial goal was set around the minimum amount we needed to begin promoting the record, but going further will enable us to do so much more. Publicity, radio and retail promotion, music videos, online promotion and on and on...we're just getting started.Once we reach our stretch goal, we will add a new, in-studio acoustic recording to all contributors of the campaign, to be distributed as a digital download. The concert will be recorded at Revolver studios, where we recorded the New Constellation album. Sound like fun? We think so.Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts. This is such an exciting start to a new chapter. Please keep spreading the word, and we'll keep chugging ahead on our side.- Glen, Randy, Todd & Dean************Toad started when Glen was a freshman in high school and met seniors Todd, Randy and Dean through choir and theater. We practiced in our parents' garages, played at dive bars, and recorded two indie records which were inexplicably picked up by the Columbia label. We put out three more records, had some hit singles, toured our asses off and broke up for all the usual reasons in 1998.We've all been making music on our own for a while now, and from time to time would get together for short tours, after which we would quickly scatter again. A couple years ago, something changed. Instead of remembering why we'd broken up, we started remembering why we got together in the first place. We started having fun and feeling like a band again, and that energy on the road led us to want to record a new record. So...we did.We're very proud of what we've created. New Constellation was produced, engineered and mixed by our friend Mikal Blue, and we are releasing it independently. That means no label, so it's our job (and yours as well, if you're willing) to get the word out. We've already invested in the recording and mixing, but this campaign will enable us to finish the art, take a single to radio, shoot videos, manufacture and distribute the album, and hire a team to promote and market the record. It will also allow us to deliver the album early and directly to those who care the most, and provide them with extra songs, cooler artwork, and undying eternal gratitude.We're fortunate to be able to come together and feel like a band again, and we think we've created something worthy of our listeners' expectations. We're also deeply grateful to the people who've stuck with us through the years, letting us know that our music matters to them. So here we are. For those of you who asked for a new record, we've done it. Now we need your involvement. You can use this opportunity just get the record early, or you can go into full Patron Of The Arts mode. Either is a big help.Thanks again, and be well, - Glen, Randy, Todd & Deanwww.toadthewetsprocket.comhttps://twitter.com/ToadWetSprockethttps://www.facebook.com/toadthewetsprocketmusichttp://instagram.com/toadthewetsprocket
89`CAROLINA EP We've been busy! Thanks to early backers we've been able to spend time in the studio and the first single Carolina was just premiered on Stereogum! Listen here! Our Story...TEEN has been together for two years now. This fall, we went on our first major U.S. tour. We've put out a short EP (little doods) and a full-length record (IN LIMBO). TEEN signed with Carpark Records in 2011.Until now, we've recorded everything ourselves - in living rooms and at a barn in Connecticut. We've been really fortunate to work with amazing people to help us get these recordings produced and released, but now with your help we can take it to the next level.Strange Weather, a state of the art studio run by Daniel Schlett and Mark Goodwin, has been recording musicians since 2002. They recently relocated to a brand new space in Brooklyn, and presented us with the opportunity to record a live EP this winter. We've got the studio time booked, the demos are ready to go, now we just need the funds!Our goal is to raise $5000. This will cover the basic cost of recording the EP. If we don't meet our goal then we don't get to keep ANY of the money you pledge! So please give as generously as you can. We have some great gifts to offer - check out the rewards on the right of the page! Everyone who gives $25 or more will get a copy of the EP, Carolina, which YOU helped us create!For more on TEEN: FacebookTwitterSoundcloudBandcamp

You can also follow us on twitter for project updates and more Loog news. Cheers!"Already a proven success ( ) an incredibly slick kit that contains everything you need to start you (or your kiddo) on an epic musical journey." Gizmodo"A rad electric guitar (...) By building their own guitar, kids understand and engage with the instrument before they even set finger on a string ( ) the sequel to the now award-winning acoustic guitar." Fast Company "A new, easy-to-learn, child-centric guitar sound was born and grade school would never be the same." TechCrunch"Having been a backer of the original Loog guitar, I have no doubt on Rafael s ability to complete and ship the electric Loog." GeekDad"A couple of years ago Rafael Atijas designed a nice 3-string acoustic guitar (..) I have one at home. It's nicely made and sounds great. Rafael recently launched an electric Loog. It looks nice and is well on its way to reaching its funding goal. I want one!" BoingBoing----------------------Hi there! Thanks for checking out our project. With your help, we would like to launch the Electric Loog Guitar.What it isThe Electric Loog Guitar is a small, 3-string guitar designed to make it fun and easy to play music. It is the electric version of the original Loog Guitar, which we launched 2 years ago here on Kickstarter. It is a fun, little instrument with a big, serious sound. So, why 3 strings? We love 6-string guitars, but we believe that they can be overwhelming for little kids and beginners. With its 3 strings, the Loog Guitar makes it easier and faster to play music, offering a more stimulating experience that allows children to play music right from the start.I also think that the electric Loog could be a cool instrument for grownups and seasoned players. The constraint of less strings actually acts as a trigger for creativity and many professional players find themselves rediscovering ways to play when they grab a 3-string guitar. Like my friend Dinamita here: The Electric Loog Guitars come in a vintagey color palette and -as with the original Loog- all parts are interchangeable. The electric Loog will come in these 5 colors. In this way, you can get the blue guitar and if after a couple of months you feel like changing to the red guitar, you can just buy the body, easily attach it and have a brand new looking guitar without the cost of a whole new guitar. And this is not just about convenience. Pulling your guitar apart, assembling it again and customizing it as you want is actually a big part of what the Loog is all about: when you build your own guitar, you feel a deep connection to it. It is an experience that helps you understand and love the instrument and that is why we'll ship the electric Loog unassembled for you to put it together at home. (No special tools or expertise is required and in just 15 minutes you'll have your Electric Loog Guitar assembled and ready to play.) A little bit about usIt feels special being here again on Kickstarter, because this is where our little company was born: two years ago we launched a campaign for the original acoustic Loog Guitar, which I had developed as my Master's thesis at NYU. It basically changed my life: we reached the goal, started production and two years later here we are still making guitars. We even won a few awards too: at the last NAMM Show, at NY Toy Fair, at the Design Biennial in Madrid and from the Innovation Agency in Uruguay (my home-country). Design Process and Production Plan We've been working on the design for 10 months with a team of very talented folks: Joaqu n Uribe (musician and industrial designer) and Cedr s & Vargas, luthiers specialized in electric guitars who own the guitar workshop you can see in the project video. And then there's Edgard Barilas, who actually joined us two years ago to help us fulfill our first Kickstarter rewards. He's our logistics genius. We've been designing and prototyping like crazy. Because we already make the acoustic Loog, we have every element in place to begin production and we even have a smooth fulfillment process implemented (took as a while, but we now are able to ship our current Loog Guitars in one day).If we reach our funding goal, we will start production in December, as soon as we get the funds. The only parts that are different from the ones we already make for the original acoustic Loog are the guitar-body and the electronics. The guitar-body should be fairly easy to manufacture as it is basically one piece of wood going through a CNC mill: you enter the CAD file and it cuts the shape and its cavities with millimetric precision. As for the electronics, we already selected the supplier of the pickups (they already supplied the ones we used in the prototypes that you can see and hear in the videos) and the rest (jack, knob, etc.) are standard parts that we'll probably get in China.As you may have noticed, we set the delivery date for the Electric Loog for May 2014. This is a very conservative estimate, but if things go moderately well we hope to deliver way before that. Why KickstarterSimply put: we don't have the money to launch the electric Loog on our own. We outsource production of most parts to several suppliers (some in China, some in the U.S.) and this requires a sizable upfront manufacturing cost. We need to know if there's enough people out there who want these guitars, before we can commit to placing a large order to our suppliers, and that's why we are here asking for your support.If you think this is a cool project and you would like these guitars to exist, we can make it happen together. This is both our chance to make them, and your chance to get an electric Loog at a special price and before anyone else.Thanks again for stopping by!Cheers!RafaP.S.: See a little bit more of the electric Loog in action in the clips below and also check the FAQs section for technical details such as scale, tuning, etc. Dinamita Pereda killing it on slide guitar.

93`Veggie-Go s are the chewiest, fruitiest way to LOVE your veggies! Veggie-Go s are an organic, chewy fruit and veggie snack (along the lines of a fruit strip or a fruit leather) made with organic fruits AND veggies!Like us on Facebook and we will add one pack of Veggie-Go's to your reward! The Project We have been making Veggie-Go s for a little over a year now and have really made a splash in the Boulder area! We are in about a dozen stores in the Boulder/Denver area including a few Whole Foods (and a few elsewhere) as well as available nationally online! We also have a booth at the Boulder Farmers Market (one of the best in the country) where we sell out of Veggie-Go s on a regular basis and enjoy chatting with customers and listening to the insights of little kids! We currently make Veggie-Go s in a local pie shop where we rent space. It has been a great place to start but now our demand is growing faster than we can keep up with in a shared space! It s time to take a leap and get our own kitchen! That s where you come in. We are reaching out and asking for help with funding to fill our new kitchen with equipment. Luckily Veggie-Go s are minimally processed so we need a minimal amount of production equipment to make them! But as anyone who has looked into commercial food production equipment knows, it s expensive. We already have a fair amount of our own equipment, including our crown jewel dehydrator, but we need things like fridges, freezers and sinks. Having our own space will allow us to grow and keep up with demand. We will be able to hire help and have our kitchen, office and warehouse in one place (so we won t have to spend all day driving in circles!) We will also be able to buy ingredients in bulk which will lower our costs and allow us to use the resources for more important things, like getting Veggie-Go s into more hands as well as reduce our waste! We will also be able to get our USDA Organic certification (a challenge when sharing space with a non-organic company.) Of course none of this will happen in an empty warehouse, the equipment is what makes it a kitchen! More about Veggie-Go s Veggie-Go s are like nothing you have ever tried before! They are similar in theory to a traditional fruit strip or fruit leather, but as soon as you try them your tongue and your body will know they have never had these before! Not only are Veggie-Go's good for you or your kids, they are also easy on the environment. We use compostable packaging, source ingredients locally from organic farms and of course use organic, GMO free ingredients.

94`As Seen On No Key. No Problem. Keys have been used to open locks for centuries. But keys have the same problems today as they did back then. They are easy to lose, they can be stolen, they are a pain to share, and if you share them, you must get them back. Sharing combinations has its own set of issues.At F Z Designs, we thought it was time to put those problems behind us, so we created Noke. By using Noke and your smartphone, you'll always have easy access to all the important things in your life. In addition, you'll be able to share access to your possessions easily, safely, and securely. How It Works We designed Noke to be the simplest electronic device you own. Once you've downloaded our iOS or Android app, Noke automatically finds and pairs to your Bluetooth 4.0 enabled smartphone. You can name your Noke and even give it a photo if you like. That's it. To unlock Noke, simply press the shackle. Noke wakes up and searches for your phone or a shared phone. If the phone is within a few feet, Noke will instantly unlock so you can be on your way. No need to launch an app or remove your phone from your pocket or purse.If you have a specific reason to limit the range or turn off the auto-unlock feature, you can do this within the app. In order to unlock with the auto-unlock feature turned off, you can simply press unlock button in the app or use Quick-Click code. This will allow you to lock your phone in a locker or stand near your lock without fear of it being unlocked. You can also set up push notifications in the app if you'd like to know when Noke is being opened. Optional Cable and Bike Mount You will probably want to use Noke on your bicycle, so we created a custom chain and bike mount to neatly and securely attach Noke to your seat post. Available for only $20. Protect Your Things Once you start thinking of all the places you'll use the Noke, you'll be glad to know we have discounted pricing for multi-unit orders. Sharing Using our iOS, Android or Windows Phone app, Noke allows instant and secure sharing. You can choose permanent, one-time, or custom settings. Need to give Johny access to your locker while you're on vacation? With Noke, it's no problem. History Noke is great in an office environment. In addition to granting access on specific days and times, you can use the history function to track who is using your Noke and when. Quick Click Access What if you forget your phone or your battery dies? With Noke, it's no problem. Our patent-pending Quick-Click technology allows you to create a custom access code. If you're ever without your phone, simply key in those clicks and your Noke will instantly unlock for you. You'll never worry about being stranded again. Design 30 Parts All Come Together to Create the World's Most Advanced Padlock Attractive. We designed Noke to look as good as it functions with a body the same size as an ordinary padlock but with subtle curves and bevels to complement its aesthetic. The compact size allows Noke to be used anywhere you'd use a traditional padlock.Strong. While Noke is an incredibly attractive device, we also made it strong. Using hardened steel and boron, Noke will stand up to the toughest environments. Noke also uses the latest in anti-shim technology so you need not worry about thieves trying to use a shim to open your lock.Water Resistant. You're sure to use Noke in places where it may get wet, so we removed any external buttons and added four silicone gaskets to keep the water out.Long-Lasting Battery. All these features would be useless if you had to worry about the battery. So we packed Noke with a long-life battery that will last over a year of normal use. If you use Noke infrequently, it should last a few years. If you need to replace the battery, this can easily be done without the use of any tools. Security. Noke uses Bluetooth 4.0 which contains the highest level of security. Bluetooth 4.0 uses a 128-bit AES CCM encryption algorithm and we've added our own PKI technology and cryptographic key exchange protocol to ensure Noke keeps your valuables safe and secure. BatteryLong before it's time to replace your Noke's battery, you will receive notifications through the app. To replace the battery, simply unlock Noke and twist off the back cover. It's easier than replacing the batteries on your remote control. In the unlikely event you let the battery completely drain, we've added a simple way to "jump-start" your Noke with an external battery so you can unlock your Noke, open the back, and replace the battery. This ensures you'll never have to worry about being stranded with a dead battery. Take a look at the image below to see how we will allow you to jump start Noke. All you need to do is press the replacement battery against the contact points and it will allow you to open Noke and replace the battery. No tools, dongles, wires, or adapters to lose. The contacts will be covered with a silicone insert to protect the contacts from the elements. Development We spent months researching how existing locks work. We took several apart and learned what makes them strong, what makes them vulnerable, and how they could be improved. We used this knowledge to create the worlds's most advanced and secure padlock. It wasn't easy, but we think you'll love the results. A padlock that works as hard as you do that's also simple enough for anyone to use. Rewards Timeline We've already spent months developing, testing, tweaking, and retesting the hardware, firmware, and app for Noke. Now, we just need your help to make it to the finish line. We've already chosen a manufacturer we've worked with several times in the past. We will continue to improve the final elements of Noke and the iOS, Windows Phone, and Android apps. Tooling will follow shortly thereafter. We will then send production samples of Noke out for external beta testing and torture testing for strength and water resistance. Once we feel 100% sure we've nailed everything, mass production will begin and we expect to deliver Noke to you in early 2015.

95`Herwig struck gold - itsnicethat.comPhotographer Christopher Herwig has covered more than 30,000 km by car, bike, bus and taxi in 13 countries discovering and documenting these unexpected treasures of modern art. From the shores of the Black Sea to the endless Kazakh steppe, the bus stops show the range of public art from the Soviet era and give a rare glimpse into the creative minds of the time. Herwig s series attracted considerable media interest around the world, and now with the 12 year project complete, the full collection will be presented in Soviet Bus Stops as a deluxe, limited edition, hard cover photo book. The book represents the most comprehensive and diverse collection of Soviet bus stop design ever assembled. THE BUS STOPS delicate balance between modern art and clinical insanity - bearsandvodka.com fascinating - Huffington Post Armenia, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan Perhaps it s no coincidence that the word for bus (A ) shares the symbol for anarchy; in many regions of the former Soviet Union the local bus shelter was built seemingly without design restrictions, or even budget limit. These projects became a precious opportunity for local artists and architects to express themselves. Instead of one standardized design we find 1000 s of unique and sometimes whimsical creations. They represent a mix of styles, shapes and sizes, from swirling tile mosaic pieces, to elegant geometric forms, to miniature temples of symbolist expression.THE BOOK hardcover, landscape A4 128 pages A book of Soviet bus stops? It's just what I've always wanted. - The Guardian Herwig s series has proven very popular and appeals to wide range of interests. Now with the travels complete, this book will mark the first time all of these photographs are released. Pre-order your copy of this limited edition book now and make this project a reality.THE JOURNEY AND THE OBSESSIONBy chance I discovered a phenomenon that set in motion a photographic journey that would span 12 years and 13 countries. Hunting for the most amazing road side bus shelters in the former Soviet Union would become my muse and my reason to travel.During a cycling trip from London to St. Petersburg in the autumn of 2002 I set myself a photographic challenge to take one good photo every hour. It was on this trip that I first paid attention to the bus stops. The long hours in the saddle and slowly changing landscape along country roads in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia and Russia provided the setting for my discovery and the birth of my obsession. Here the designs mainly played with purely graphic shapes, each different stretch of road revealing a new set of creations to break up an otherwise bleak landscape.Between 2003 and 2006 I lived in Kazakhstan, and I explored the five Stan countries and former Soviet states of Central Asia: Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan. Along these silk routes I found more fascinating bus stops, often appearing in the middle of the desert, steppe or countryside, with no other sign of human settlement in sight. It was as if the earth was its pedestal and nothing else on the endless horizon could compete with the bold statement it was making. Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Abkhazia My obsession grew and saw me hit the road further to visit five more former soviet countries: Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and the breakaway region of Abkhazia, and later to revisit the Baltics, travelling thousands more kilometres by bus, rental car and taxi with the specific task of hunting down the very best bus stops. I was possessed. On a mission. Nothing was going to deter me from my hunt. I searched travellers blogs for clues, interrogated bus and taxi drivers and even scanned over the roads on Google Earth to plan what I believed would be most effective routes. I was not disappointed as each new discovery pushed to outshine the previous.Several of these countries have little freedom of press and expression. Tourists are rare. Visas for photographers were hard to come by. I often had to instead go into the countries on tourist visas. Despite my efforts not to arouse suspicion I was, on several occasions, accused of being a spy and only narrowly avoided getting caught up in something rather awkward. With reluctance this added to the adventure and made each new discovery even more precious. In Abkhazia my driver accused me of being a Georgian agent and photographing sensitive material. He demanded a bribe, otherwise, it would be straight to the militizia and a firing squad . Needless to say, he was not convinced by my story that I have only come to your country to see your pretty bus stops . I was happy to escape from the journey with relatively little drama, and even happier to have captured some of the most beautifully insane bus stops I had ever encountered, safe on a memory card tucked into my underpants. This photo series is likely the largest collection of Soviet Bus Stops ever assembled. A tenuous claim to fame, I admit, and a strange obsession to have. But still, it s one that I am proud of and I hope it will help to preserve this unique and historical art form. Signed Archival Prints

97`What is it?Have you ever just wished you could lift your pen off the paper and see your drawing become a real three dimensional object? Well now you can! 3Doodler is the world s first and only 3D Printing Pen. Using ABS plastic (the material used by many 3D printers), 3Doodler draws in the air or on surfaces. It s compact and easy to use, and requires no software or computers. You just plug it into a power socket and can start drawing anything within minutes. The latest model 3Doodler Oh, and it s also the most affordable way to 3D print by a looong way! With 3Doodler we re making fun 3D creation accessible to everyone.How does it work?If you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler. 3Doodler in action As 3Doodler draws, it extrudes heated plastic, which quickly cools and solidifies into a strong stable structure. This allows you to build an infinite variety of shapes and items with ease! Most people will instantly be able to trace objects on paper, and after only a few hours of practice you will be able to make far more intricate objects.3Doodler is a brand new way of creating objects and artistic works. Whether you are an artist, hobbyist or 3D printing fanatic, we can t wait to see what you 3Doodle! Six little men and the other one said... 3Doodler! 3Doodler! What can I make with 3Doodler? There are many ways 3Doodler can be used. 3Doodles can be created as flat forms and peeled off a piece of paper, as freestyle 3D objects, or in separate parts, ready to be joined together using the 3Doodler. The creative opportunities are endless, including: Basic 3D shapes and 3D models Jewellery, pendants and hanging ornaments Decorative art and fridge magnets Personalization of everyday objects (iPhone cases, laptops, pens, etc.) A mini Eiffel Tower or a soccer pitch for your Lego men And much much more 3Doodler works on almost any surface, including plastic, allowing users to personalize items such as iPhone cases, or anything else they feel like 3Doodling on. 3Doodler can even be used for minor repair work. 3Doodler "stencils" We re particularly excited about 3Doodler "stencils" - sophisticated print-out stencil kits to help you create awesome objects (like our Eiffel Tower). We'll be making these available online for everyone. Simply print it out, 3Doodle each part according to the stencil and then join them with your 3Doodler. As time goes by we, and the 3Doodler community, will be able to create hundreds (maybe thousands) of stencil kits that can easily be emailed and shared with friends. We ll be hosting these on our website, the3Doodler.com, for anyone to download and use for free. 2 ft Eiffel Tower Stencil We re looking forward to seeing what people create and supporting 3Doodler communities everywhere. The Sellers of Etsy Special We're collaborating with some fantastic sellers on Etsy, all wire artists, to showcase how 3Doodler can be used to create beautiful objects and pieces of art. We're thrilled to be working with Bud Bullivant, Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight), Nakisha and Ele McKay to bring our vision to life. Wire Art by Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight) - sparkflight.etsy.com Wire Art by Bud Bullivant (wiredbybud.etsy.com) Bud and Ruth will be creating a limited edition run of the first professional 3Doodles (see the Seller on Etsy Special Reward above). The ideas are already flowing, and we'll be working together to bring you a truly unique 3Doodle creation from these top artists. The expected size of the 3Doodle is approximately 4 x 2 inches. It will be beautifully boxed and shipped by August.Nakisha will be producing an exclusive template for anyone ordering a 3Doodler. Created especially for you, the template will showcase 3Doodler's capabilities and allow you to make your very own artist-designed 3Doodles. And we'll be announcing a special collaboration with Ele shortly. Wire Art by Ele McKay (elemckay.etsy.com) Wire Art by Nakisha (wireanimals.etsy.com) More to come on all of this in an Update! Bud, Ruth, Nakisha, Ele, we're truly grateful for your support! 3Doodler Components & Accessories: The pen: The 3Doodler pen is 180mm by 24mm. The pen weighs less than 200 grams or 7 ounces (the weight of a typical apple), although the exact weight will depend on the final shell specifications once in production. And we are using a universal power supply, so provided you have the correct adapter for your country, 3Doodler will work just fine on 110v or 240v. The evolution of 3Doodler 3Doodler is not a toy for children (it's recommended for ages 12+). While the plastic extruded from 3Doodler is safe to touch once it has left the pen, the pen itself has a metal tip that can get as hot as 270C. There is no reason for any user to touch the tip while in use, but safety comes first, and we are creating a video series that will explain how to use the 3Doodler, covering off the different techniques and safety precautions necessary. The Ink (i.e. ABS/PLA plastic): The 3Doodler uses 3mm ABS or PLA plastic as its "ink" - just like a 3D printer. Each 3Doodler backed on Kickstarter comes with at least one bag of plastic; each bag will contain ten 1ft strands of plastic; and each 1 ft strand produces approximately 11 ft of 3Doodling fun... yes, you read that right, a foot of plastic goes a very long way in the 3Doodler. Some suitably attractive photos of ABS plastic ABS is one of the most common plastics around. It's used in most of the plastic stuff around you. PLA is what we call a "bioplastic". It's made from corn, is biodegradable and has a lower melting temperature than ABS. We are offering both choices as each has its own advantages and disadvantages. We plan to offer plastic sold in strands (making it easy to switch colours and create different styles), but 3Doodler-compatible plastic is also available in 1kg spools from between $30 to $55 from a variety of sources... such as here, here, here, here, and here. And for some stunning PLA have a look here. This is no ink cartridge model! Fun Fact: The average 1kg spool of 3mm ABS contains approximately 360-370 feet of plastic. That's approximately 3,960-4,070 feet of 3Doodling, or 3 Empire State Buildings with enough to spare for several more weeks of doodling. The Future of 3Doodling: We have a ton of ideas for add-ons and accessories that will make 3Doodler even cooler, more useful, fun, and generally awesomer (is that a word?). We hope that the 3Doodler will be a big success so that we can share all our ideas and offer you even more 3Doodling fun... Pete & Max, Inventors of 3Doodler We have a lot we want to tell you about 3Doodler, so we ve created an extensive FAQ to answer all of your questions. And we re on standby to respond to any other queries you may have! *The 3Doodler was created at the Artisans Asylum in Boston. The whole team would like to thank the Artisans Asylum for their help and support. Without hacker-spaces like this, projects such as 3Doodler could not happen.

98`What's All This? SMBC (short for "Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal") is a daily-updated comic strip about all sorts of topics. Its author, Zach Weinersmith, is a giant dork who also has many other geeky projects such as producing SMBC Theater, writing for Snowflakes, his science blog the Weinerworks, and his science-themed podcast The Weekly Weinersmith (which he co-hosts with his wife, the parasitologist Kelly Weinersmith).So it will come as no huge surprise that this, the third SMBC printed collection, is a compendium of his finest science-related strips. Like these!Theory of Revolution: http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2703Periodic Table: http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2349Flowers: http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2594Science Reporting: http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1623Skeptic: http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2581War: http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2138 Why am I paying for a thing that is free?? The baseline version of the book offered in this Kickstarter will contain over 100 favorite strips about science and scientists from the SMBC archive, delicately hand-selected by only the finest comic consumers and autographed by the author. Societal mores dictate that you can't give free webcomics as a real present to your favorite scientists, but you could give this! But wait, that's not all.The more money raised in this Kickstarter, the more content goes in the book. Below this section is a map with lots of X marks on it. Those X marks represent a point at which you improve the book. Many of these stretch goals unlock exclusive, never before seen new comics. Even better, some of those goals will also unlock Tales of Science comics. These are illustrated, comic versions of AWESOME SCIENCE STORIES from a bunch of our favorite scientists. For the moment, the rewards are secret. But, as we make our way through the map, we'll be revealing them.

My shipping address isn't the same as my billing! Help! Don t worry about this! We don t actually have access to any of your addresses until we send out a backer survey when the books are ready to go out--at that time, please send us your most up-to-date address and we ll make sure your stuff goes there.Can you reduce the shipping for Canada?There s no reduced shipping rate for Canada. Unfortunately, it is actually rather expensive to ship to Canada with most normal postal methods.Breadpig The publisher of this book is Breadpig. If you re not familiar with Breadpig, they re the Newman s Own for Geeks, created by reddit co-founder, Alexis Ohanian. They make geek stuff and give a portion of their profits to awesome trustworthy groups. You may have heard of one or two of their projects, like... oh... the XKCD Book, or Ryan North's To Be Or Not To Be. They were also the publisher behind all of my previous collections, and my choosable path novel Trial of the Clone. In short, they have lots of experience delivering on Kickstarter projects! On a Personal Note Of all my books so far, this is the one I'm most starry-eyed about. I'm a huge science geek, and the biggest pleasure of my cartooning career has been the ability to meet many of my heroes. Several of them actually contributed to this book. I think the mainstreaming of science humor is one of the best things that's happened since the Internet came along. I take a lot of pride in my small contribution to that happening. So, for all of you out there who've been willing to laugh along with jokes about symbolic logic, cosmology, and evolutionary theory, thanks. I'm a lot happier having the privilege of entertaining you.

But you never know whether to trust a master deceiver - and there's more to Randi's life than meets the eye. The Amazing Randi on set at The Magic Castle in Los Angeles. Thanks for checking out our project! We've spent over a year working on this film, but we need your help! Randi is a fascinating, funny, and brilliant man with a great life-story to tell, and it's still unfolding. We're honored to be making this documentary about Randi and his great accomplishments, as well as about the dramas and behind-the-scenes stories of his life.You can help fund our film and spread a call for reason and critical thinking and save the world from falling back into the Dark Ages!If you'd like to see more of what's to come, you can view an extended trailer here.We need your help!The funding of this campaign is essential to enable us to: finance the filming of multiple important upcoming events with Randi (5-6 separate shoots) as well as a number of key interviews around the country that still need to be done, cover the costs of filming of key cinematic recreations of events, pay for a composer to score the film, and hire an archival researcher to help find and gather all of the great archival footage we need. Of course, our goal is the minimum we need to proceed, but more than that will help us to go further in completing the film. Additional funding would allow us to continue into post-production and would contribute towards the very costly needs of audio mixing, color-correction, and the final online. Additionally, exceeding our minimum goal would allow us to increase the quality of the production values in the film (animations, recreations, music, title graphics, and more). Every little bit counts, so we really appreciate whatever you can help us with! Our heartfelt thanks for your interest, and please consider supporting us in other ways as well. One of the BEST WAYS to help us spread the word is by posting a link to this Kickstarter page (http://kck.st/W3RVWs) on Facebook! You can also spread links to our facebook page (http://www.facebook.com/AnHonestLiarDoc), and our website (www.anhonestliar.com) to everyone and everyplace you can!Sincerely,Justin Weinstein & Tyler Measom The Rewards We are so grateful for all your support and encouragement and have come up with a series of great rewards show our sincere thanks! Below is a visual breakdown of the descriptions to the right, followed by a more detailed description of the film. An Amazing Life StoryFor every magician that uses the powers of conjuring for entertainment, there are scores of fortune tellers, psychics, cardsharps, faith healers, and scam-artists that use those same powers for evil. But in the epic battle against the misuse of magical thinking, a hero has emerged: a small, aging, gay magician with wizard white hair and a Santa Claus beard; James The Amazing Randi. As a teenager, James Randi did what most kids only dreamt of, he ran away from home to join a traveling carnival - and he never looked back. Over the decades, his astounding feats of magic, escape, sleight of hand, and acts of mentalism made him an international celebrity. At the same time, however, he saw some of those same powers of deceit being used by con men, faith healers, psychics, and scam-artists for thievery. Knowing that it takes a thief to catch a thief, Randi dedicated his life to expose these charlatans. Today, at the 84, with a vaudevillian s wit and the boundless energy of a teenager, Randi continues his mission - which has only grown more intense. An Honest Liar is a feature length documentary that will reveal the colorful life and escapades of James Randi, explore the dangers of magical thinking and deception, and follow Randi and his partner as they risk being separated after 26 years due to a very personal deception.Through first person accounts, rare photos and footage, An Honest Liar will chronicle the story of how a curious child rose to the ranks of showman and then advanced to become a renowned demystifier of paranormal claims. The film will tell the inside tales of Randi s investigations and adventures, including his discovery of the tricks of the faith-healer Peter Popoff and exposure of the techniques of knife-less surgery . The film will bring to life such Randi-led schemes as Project Alpha , where two magicians pretending to be psychics fooled a scientific research study on paranormal powers, and the famous Carlos Hoax in which Randi exposed the gullibility of the public by unleashing a fake mystic upon the people of Australia. The film will also reveal the discovery of a very personal deception in Randi s life. Randi came out of the closet as a gay man only a few years ago at the age of 81, though he had been living with his partner, Jose Alvarez (who played Carlos in their great Carlos Hoax ) for decades. Recently, Jose was arrested when it was discovered that Jose Alvarez is not, in fact, his real name. Now the couple is at risk of being separated after 26 years together as Jose faces possible deportation to Venezuela, his country of birth.This story is still unfolding in front of our cameras. Speaking with experts, and Randi cohorts, such as Penn & Teller, Richard Dawkins, Bill Nye, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and Adam Savage among others, the film will explore skepticism, illusion, reality and how easily human perception is fooled, and will show the significant harm that can result from unfounded beliefs. With a biographical style similar to Bill Cunningham, New York and Being Elmo, but capped with a twist akin to Exit Through the Gift Shop, An Honest Liar will be an historical biography, a call for reason and critical thinking, and a magic act in itself. The TeamJustin Weinstein (Director/Producer) has been making documentaries for broadcast, theatrical release, and commercial clients for over 10 years. Most recently, he wrote and edited BEING ELMO; A Puppeteers Journey, which won the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 2011, and for which Weinstein and fellow writer/editor Philip Shane were nominated for The Humanitas Prize which honors "film & television writers whose work explores the human condition in a nuanced, meaningful way." Prior to that, Weinstein produced Face Off at Coal River Mountain for Al Jazeera English, and Dirty Business, produced in collaboration with Peter Bull and Alex Gibney. Earlier, Weinstein produced numerous projects for ABC News, Peter Jennings Reporting, and PBS, including Hot Politics for Frontline and the ABC special, Last Days on Earth. He resides in Brooklyn, where it seems like everyone and their dog is a documentary filmmaker.Tyler Measom (Director/Producer) is the co-director/producer of the documentary film Sons of Perdition, which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival and was acquired by the Oprah Winfrey Network. Measom is the producer of the feature film, Take, starring Minnie Driver and Jeremy Renner. He has written, produced and directed nearly one hundred commercials, short documentaries and industrials for a wide range of national and international clients. He recently directed and produced a documentary on the history of alcohol in Utah for a PBS Station. Measom currently lives in Salt Lake City, and no, he s not a Mormon. Duane Andersen (co-producer) produced Dave Boyle s award winning films Daylight Savings and Surrogate Valentine, which premiered at SXSW Film Festival in 2011 and 2012. He and Boyle previously collaborated on festival favorites White on Rice and on Big Dreams Little Tokyo. He has previously produced Kevin Barker s Last Kind Words (starring Brad Dourif), Moon Molson s Sundance short Crazy Beats Strong Every Time, Rich Wong and H.P.

We couldn't have asked for a more amazing, supportive community of backers! Check out the forum they created showcasing their EcoQubes here! We wanted to make the EcoQube even more accessible and efficient, so we took all the feedback we got to further develop the product, which resulted in the EcoQube C! What is the EcoQube C? The heart of the EcoQube C is the aquaponics filter, which we've integrated into the tank to create an all-in-one system that uses plants like Basil or Mint to keep your aquarium clean.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Our names are Eric and Kevin. We're UC San Diego students and aquarium geeks who met in high school and share a passion for planted aquatic ecosystems. We started out working at various aquarium shops in San Francisco, including Aquatic Central and Aqua Forest Aquarium. We eventually started our own online aquarium store called Aqua Design Innovations while selling shrimp out of a garage. As we got older, we started to become more aware of the harsher realities of our world, realizing that there are many people globally who face food and water shortages every day but that for most of us, such issues are so foreign. We couldn't ignore the facts, so we decided to use our knowledge of aquariums to find a feasible solution. We believe aquaponics is a clear solution to many of the food and water shortages humanity faces today. While this food production method was used thousands of years ago in early Aztec and Chinese civilizations, it has since fallen into disuse and become largely forgotten.We hope to educate as many people as possible about the practical solution and beauty of aquaponics and to ultimately help initiate the process of bringing aquaponics to the forefront of today's agriculture. We were able to reach many with the first EcoQube, and now, we hope to reach even more with the EcoQube C! Please join our mission and share the EcoQube C with as many people you know!

102`As seen on: Our new wind meter Wind is an important factor for a wide range of activities, but the greatest places in the great outdoors are far away from any weather station. In order to give you precise and sharable wind readings on the spot, we created the first Vaavud wind meter and launched it here on Kickstarter. People loved it!Now we are back to launch the world's first handheld wind meter that actually measures wind direction, as well as of course wind speed. This is made possible by our unique asymmetrical rotor design (for further details scroll down to the technical stuff).We have gone through countless iterations on the rotor design and we have obsessed about every little line and detail, to make sure that both performance and looks are second to none. The Vaavud app The new device will work with the popular Vaavud app, which features the world's first real-time graph on a handheld wind meter; a global live map; your personal measurement history and much more to come. Device compatibility Currently we have confirmed the new device to work with the following phones and tablets, and the list keeps growing! *iPods do not have a compass, so on those the app will show wind speed, but not wind directionTimeline We are working towards a shipping date in November 2014, and so far all is set to achieve that target Rewards Stretch goals Colour choice: The third colour will be the one that gets the most votes from all backers, once the campaign is over. More info on this will follow when we get thereMount + data export: The mount will be printable on most common 3D printers, and will be designed to work with a standard jack-stick extender cable. The design files will be made available, so you can do all the modifications you want to. The data export feature will upload a time series for each measurement as a CSV file to a dropbox folder of your choiceSpecial carry case: This will be a neoprene hard case similar to the ones known from Oakley sunglasses etc. but tailor made to the Vaavud wind meter. We are quite happy with the current neoprene bags, but this will be something special; a snug fitting, robust, exclusive case made just for your Vaavud V2.0 Welcome on board! Our Kickstarter legacy Comments from backers and press about our first Kickstarter campaign The technical stuffWe are using an optical sensor that measures 40.000 times per second, so we can detect even the slightest variation in rotation speed. By making the rotor of the wind meter slightly asymmetrical we get it to accelerate a bit when the largest part is hit by the wind. We can then compare the point with the highest speed to the compass direction and derive the wind direction. At the same time, data from the highly accurate sensor can be used to derive the average rotation speed and thereby the wind speed.The graph below shows the change in velocity during one full rotation for one of our prototypes. For this one the difference in speed is a bit more than 3%, and the maximum speed is reached at about 45 degrees from start.

We have spent the last couple months sending our socks to media and other influencers their response has been amazing, with dozens of great reviews! Read them all at lilytrotters.com/testimonial.html "All we want to do is make pretty compression socks."This is the phrase we have been repeating over and over for the past three years. When the idea came up for Lily Trotters back in 2012, we had no idea how hard it would be to make high-quality, designer athletic compression socks. Designed, sourced, manufactured, and quality-tested in the USA, no less. But every hurdle, every challenge, every conversation that ended in, "Sorry, we can't help you what you are asking for cannot be done," has been worth it.It has been quite a journey. We started by doing small sock-wearing studies with healthy women who had never worn compression socks to ascertain whether they felt benefits wearing a 15-20mmHg compression sock; the feedback was a unanimous yes! Next, we did extensive market research to analyze the compression sock market and see where Lily Trotters might fit in. We talked to everybody and anybody who had different perspectives along the way. We learned and are still learning so much. Arranging for the production of our socks was a saga in itself. We cold-called so many sock mills in the USA. This was really hard, since most are over-booked and not in a position to even talk to a start-up, let alone develop a new product. Still, we got super lucky and found the right mill. They saw our vision from the get-go and have worked with us to explore every possibility. We have sampled nearly 30 prototypes to date, and discovered how to "knit in" different colored yarns without compromising the compression in our socks.Finally, we conducted a comprehensive sock-wearing study of our prototypes on female volunteers. The findings were overwhelmingly positive. Each and every step of the way we have looked for validation that we were designing a product that would be both desirable to and functional for women.All we wanted to do was make pretty compression socks. Lily Trotters are all that and more. Lily Trotters is not providing any medical advice. Please consult your doctor before wearing compression socks.
104`Snakable's Press Mentions The Problem. We have all fallen victim to the inevitable broken connector on our cell phone or other gadget charging cable. There is a weak point in any design, and with the current USB charging cables, that weak point is right below the connector on either side of the cable. There is a tiny reinforcement piece on most cables under the connector that is supposed to protect the cable for over straining, but in most cases that design falls short. The Problem The Solution.Tired of fixing and/or replacing these expensive cables myself, I came up with a cable design that would incorporate a built in strain relief system. And since I am a tech geek, it had to look incredibly cool! that solution is the Snakable. Snakable Engineering Drawing Snakable is a beautifully designed USB cable for your mobile device, that has built in protection, to protect the wire at the cables' connectors from over-bending and eventually breaking. This typically happens when we roll up our cables for transport, or getting to those hard to reach power outlets. This over bends the cable at the connector, beyond it's normal functioning bend radius. Snakable Snakable fixes this issue with it's patent pending strain relief assembly, that is on both sides of the cable, at each connector. This strain relief assembly has independent free-moving ball joints that restrict the cable from bending beyond a safe bend radius, yet still allows your cable to move naturally. Snakable Specifications: Will be available in Apple Lightning & Micro USB. Will be 4 ft (1.2 m) in length. Will be available in a range of colors to start: Red, White, Black, Green, and Orange. Heavy duty cable (not like the cheapies you get on the street or drug store) with a coating that keeps the Snakable from knotting and tangling. Lightning Snakables will be Apple Certified under the Made for iPhone (MFI) program. That means, no "This cable may not work..." error messages on your iPhone or iPad. The Problem & The Solution Prototypes.I have spent the last year year creating prototypes using 3D printing technology. I began using my 3D printer, but quickly moved onto industrial 3D printing to get the most realistic product for testing. 3D Printing The Strain-Relief Assembly Prototype in Action The Inspiration.I have worked around engineers my entire career, and if it is one thing I have learned is that although engineers work in a virtual world; a lot of the brain storming comes from nature and the world around them. Looking to nature to solve the problem of the broken cable I stumbled upon the snake. More specifically, a plastic toy snake.The inspiration behind the design of the Snakable, actually came from an early childhood memory. The plastic snake has been won by many a kids whom do not have any aim at carnival games. Growing up I had a lot of these! The way these plastic snakes move is that they are jointed every 1 1/2 inches. This allows the snake to move and wiggle, but not beyond the limits of the joint. That is exactly what our USB cables needed, not throughout the entire cable, but on the connectors. And thus Snakable was born! The Inspiration Since this seemingly insignificant toy has been so significant to the development of the Snakable, we have crowned this guys our mascot! As such, our backers will receive one in every order. Don't be afraid, they won't bite. :-)Packaging Since Snakable's roots are in nature, we figured when it comes to packaging we should be sustainable. Our packaging will be made from recycled products. We even gave the design of the packaging an elemental flair. Each color represents a different element or force of nature. The following is a concept of proposed packaging. If our backers have any insight on packaging I would love to hear any suggestions! Proposed Packaging Proposed Packaging Inside
105`ATLAS Throttle Lock - www.ATLASthrottlelock.com We understand the potential risk of buying something for your motorcycle without actually holding the product in your hands. This is why we are offering a 100% refund and paying for any return shipping costs. You will be given 30 days after you have received your ATLAS Throttle Lock to contact us and request a refund. Not only is everything made in the USA, but all parts, except for a spring, are designed and manufactured under one roof. More on this below. The ATLAS functions similar to a retractable pen. When the button is pressed, a friction stopper protrudes from the side of the throttle lock. When the button is pressed a second time, the stopper retracts and disengages the throttle lock. The stopper applies friction between the throttle housing and the grip by pressing against the side of the throttle housing. The ATLAS Throttle Lock was designed with simplicity and universal use in mind. The semi-circular body and clamp arm fit perfectly over 7/8 to 1-1/4 handlebar throttle sleeves. This sizing ensures that the ATLAS will fit on most motorcycles. If, for whatever reason, the ATLAS doesn't fit on your motorcycle, we will give you a 100% refund and we will pay the return shipping. There's no need to worry, we will take all the risk! What makes the ATLAS so unique is the ultra-thin design. The low profile front hinge, slim body and clamp arm are all 100% proprietary designs meant specifically for mounting between the throttle grip and the throttle housing. The retractable button is perfectly placed so it is out of the way, yet easy to reach with your right thumb, no matter your throttle s position. The ATLAS is shown here mounted on my KTM 640 Adventure, between the throttle housing and the throttle grip. No space is taken up on your grip and there s nothing bulky in your way. One thin wall with a reinforcing band across the outer edge, for rigidity, allows the ATLAS to fit in places no other throttle lock or cruise control can. There have been updates made to the clamp that will allow it to have a firmer grip on the throttle sleeve to ensure it stays in place and doesn t rotate. The changes will also make the clamp more universal and fit on even more bikes. We want to deliver the best possible product so we have tweaked the design from the prototype you see here. Once we have images of the updated design, we will share them here first. ALL other throttle locks suffer from one or all of these problems. The ATLAS suffers from none of these annoyances:- Requires a lot of space on your grip. You grip already has limited space, especially when you are wearing gloves. This type of throttle lock moves your hand farther away from your brake lever, and button controls.- Are specific to your motorcycle and maybe 1 or 2 others.- Require drilling or custom fabrication.- Easily removable from your motorcycle in a public parking lot with little to no tools.- Are awkward to engage and disengage in real life riding situation. You may have to decelerate or coast to disengage. There are no other throttle locks which move with your hand as you rotate your throttle. Only the ATLAS will stay in perfect ergonomic positioning with your thumb as you accelerate to different speeds. The ATLAS takes away little, if any, space from your grip. If you ride with gloves, you need all the space you can get.The ATLAS will work on nearly every motorcycle you own. Now you can keep your throttle lock when you upgrade to your next bike.The ATLAS is a bolt-on solution. It takes 2 minutes to install, doesn't require you to remove your handguards and can not be removed from your motorcycle without the proper tools.Simply press the button with your thumb and you're cruising. No more awkward flipping or rotating to turn your throttle lock on and off. You never need to change your speed when you're deactivating your ATLAS. Other throttle locks require you to decelerate to disengage. This is not practical for the active motorcyclist and the ATLAS doesn't suffer from this problem. The ATLAS Throttle Lock was dreamed up while my wife and I were in the middle of a 15 month Round-The-World motorcycle trip. We were at the southern tip of New Zealand, sitting in our tent, seeking shelter from the storm after a long day on the road.I was tired of the awkward throttle lock I had purchased just days before the trip. I sat there in my tent imagining my ideal solution. I ve used several different apparatuses in the past ranging from a rubber band to a plastic paddle to rest my palm on to the pinky workout throttle lock I was fighting with in New Zealand. I easily identified all the issues I wanted to fix and set about designing the ideal throttle lock. The ATLAS, which stands for Adventure Touring Leaves All Signs was born on the open roads of the world. It was dreamt up in New Zealand, modified in Australia and tweaked again in India. Throughout Europe, I was eager to attach my new invention to my bike and finally cruise with comfort and ease. It was on the Autobahn where the logo was born. The white circle with three diagonal black lines signifies the "End of All Road Restrictions". You are free to enjoy the open road on your terms, with nothing impeding you along the way - discomfort and inconvenience included. The ATLAS is your ticket to freedom.So here we are, back Stateside, simply to birth the ATLAS, bring it to market, share my design with the extensive riding community, and get back on the road, this time with the ATLAS on my throttle. The ATLAS Throttle Lock is everything I wanted on that rainy day in New Zealand, and I know you won't be disappointed! These photos are of the ATLAS prototype. We have updated the clamp since these photos were taken. More on this below.Our logo will be directly machined into the button, with a black oxide coating, cut away to expose clean, bright stainless steel. If you have ridden the roads in Europe, our logo should look familiar. It's the sign you'll see each time you exit a village and enter a stretch of road where there's no speeding restrictions.The ATLAS will be made of 304 stainless steel with a black oxide coating. The side of the body piece, which faces the throttle housing, will be made of an embossed spring steel.The prototype was made of 6061 Aluminum and Delrin. You can see this in some of the photos. The ATLAS uses a spring steel friction stopper to "lock" your throttle. Because the ATLAS is clamped to your throttle's plastic sleeve, it will rotate perfectly with your hand.Once you reach a good cruising speed, the button will be right next to your thumb. Press the button in, like a retractable pen, and the friction stopper will press against your throttle housing. This holds your throttle in place, unless you override the ATLAS by grabbing your throttle and rotating.Press the button one more time and it disengages. It is so simple. The clamp is a 100% proprietary design. The inner wall is thinner than 2 bank cards, serrated to grip your throttle sleeve and notched in a way to fit on nearly every motorcycle on the market. (We are currently working on a list of motorcycles which the ATLAS works with, but for the meantime, we are offering a 100% money back guarantee that it will fit on your motorcycle, or your money back. We also pay shipping both ways.)The clamp also has a band of metal running along the outer edge of the inner wall. This is to reinforce the wall and provide a second point of contact for clamping the ATLAS to plastic grips with a thick inner flange. This band of metal has been updated and narrowed even farther than what you currently see in these photos. The ATLAS was also design to fit on all diameters of handlebars, from 7/8" to just a little larger than 1-1/4". With an allen bolt, nyloc nut and an ultra slim design, your ATLAS will look like an OEM part. Installation takes just 2 minutes or less. You don't need to remove anything from your motorcycle to install the ATLAS. One side of the ATLAS' clamp is hinged and has an easy disconnect, while the other side of the clamp has bolt holes. The prototype has only one side of the hinge covered. The updated design will cover both sides of the hinge. First and foremost, we wanted the ATLAS to be sourced, manufactured and assembled in the USA. This allows us to be a more efficient company than those who rely on offshore manufacturers. The overhead is higher but the quality of the ATLAS will not be compromised. Since the designs and manufacturing are all under one roof, nothing will get past our quality control. This is more then made in the USA - this is about building a business that doesn t rely on cheap labor to succeed. We are not only seeking the highest quality manufacturing, but we are keeping our dollars Stateside to grow our economy at home, and minimizing our environmental impact in the process.

That's enough to manufacture and fulfill the orders, pay our wonderful team, cover recording costs, and we have a little left over for promotion and marketing. A few years ago it would have been so much more difficult to get a project like this off the ground, and there would have been a mountain of debt, but here we are - it's amazing to be able to start the release process free and clear. Thank you all so much.We are nearly done with the package design and will send out manufacturing orders as soon as the campaign closes. Vinyl will likely take a bit longer than CDs and posters, but we'll keep updating you with the progress until we can get your orders into your hands.We're so happy we were able to get the music out to you early. Kickstarter isn't actually built for early rewards, but they were generous in allowing us to go ahead and find a workaround to provide you with downloads before the campaign was over. Once we've finished the campaign, artwork will be reworked and we will provide updated download links for you.Perhaps we'll reach the stretch goal of $250k, perhaps we won't. It's been exciting to see the campaign become so active again in the last week (We're back on the front page of Kickstarter!). However it goes, it's been a great ride. It took a while for us to get this record made, and just seeing the early reaction to the music has already made it worth the time and effort.Once again - word of mouth is just about our only way of spreading the news. Thanks for all you've done, and we'd still appreciate it if you shouted out once more through Twitter or Facebook, or if you happen to run a giant media conglomerate and want to stick it on the evening news or a stadium jumbotron that's ok too.Thank you all.You rock-ToadP.S. We thought you might want a sneak peak of the New Constellation Album cover. We hope you like it!P.S.S. Annnnnd an acoustic version of "California Wasted" Project update 9.0Hello, there.This has been an exciting and busy couple of months. We ve been out on the road across the States, overjoyed to play the new material and see the Kickstarter supporters singing along from the audience. Thank you all!So...we are in the final days of the campaign. Artwork has had a few unavoidable scheduling setbacks but is now racing full-steam ahead. My good friend Ben Ciccati has been drawing up a storm - all the images you ve been seeing on the site are his. For graphic design we ve brought in Kii Arens, who will put together the LP and CD Kickstarter packages, as well as poster and shirt design. I love seeing what the two of them are coming up with, and we ll share it with you soon.A few days ago I bought a tin space man and shot a lyric video for New Constellation. It s fairly silly, but if anyone needs motion-tracked rockets added to their home videos I now know how. We might sign the spaceman and have him as a Kickstarter item if people are interested. Let us know.Anyway: Thank you again, and please keep spreading the word. If your friends (or Twitter followers, or Friends) like Toad let them know about the campaign, and if you like the record (and the extra tracks) tell them about that, too. Please. With sugar on top.Many more shows to come, an acoustic EP to record, people to see and places to go...Say hello if you re nearby.Be wellg Project update 8.0Thank you so much for your continued support, we're deeply grateful. We'd like to remind you that if we reach our new stretch goal of $250K before the end of the campaign on August 4th, all backers will get a LIVE EP from the August tour. With that end date on the horizon, we have reached the point where we would like to ask all of you - our core supporters - to help spread the word and enlist support from your extended networks on social media and beyond. Together, we have managed to achieve three times our initial goal with less than five thousand backers and word of mouth alone. With just a little more awareness we should be able to take this all the way to the finish line, so if you know a Toad fan, let them know there's only a couple more weeks to get the album now instead of waiting till September for the general release. From the bottom of our hearts thank you in advance, and hope to see you all on the road! - Glen, Todd, Randy & Dean Project update 7.0A huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to our Kickstarter campaign thus far. We are still completely overwhelmed by the response. We have a lot of updates this week! New backer rewards (based on your feedback) a special note from Todd and a new stretch goal! Since we have reached our first stretch goal of $150K - all backers will be receiving a new, in-studio acoustic recording - distributed as a digital download - and recorded at Revolver studios. For stretch goal #2 - if we reach $250K before the end of the campaign - all backers will get a Live EP from an upcoming tour date. More music!Thank you everyone for your continued support! See you on the road!Check out this personal note from Todd Project Update 6.0 Happy Independence Day, Everybody!Thanks to all of you who have already joined the Kickstarter campaign for our new Toad the Wet Sprocket album New Constellation. We are stunned and humbled by the outpouring of support and the encouraging first reactions to this--our first, new record in 16 years.Due to the overwhelming demand for more Kickstarter packages, we re giving you the chance to create your own custom package! We re calling it Kickstart Your Independence!Please give us your suggested packages below in the comments section of this post. We will pick two new packages to add to our campaign and announce them next week!And remember - In order to get your Kickstarter Early-Rewards Version of the full tracks from New Constellation - you must be a Project Backer. Read this backers only post for instructions on how to get your download! Thanks for hanging with us - and happy 4th of July! Project Update 5.0Thanks so much for hanging in there with us while we have been trying to figure out how to distribute the Kickstarter Early-Rewards Bonus Version of the full tracks from New Constellation. If you are a project backer - you can check out the Backers Only Updates section for instructions on how to get your download. And check out this personal note from Dean!Thank you again for your support and happy listening!- Glen, Randy, Todd and Dean Project Update 4.0Hi Again,We're in the home-stretch! Right now the new record is being mastered (a much more gentle process than the name suggests), whereby the final eq and volume tweaks are made. We're actually on the 2nd round of mastering--it's being "re-mastered", which, frankly, makes no sense. There really should be a different name to the whole process. In any event, that's what's happening. We're also having the final touches done on the artwork. We don't know what that process is called, but it must be a bit less diabolical sounding. What this all means is that you'll be able to download the whole album very soon, and as soon as the artwork is finished we'll get to work on printing up the CD, creating the actual physical evidence that we're a band! We're genuinely excited about this album, but more than anything we're sincerely grateful and humbled by the support you've given us-- now and for so many years. From the bottom of our very full hearts, Thank You!Oh, and one more thing - the single "New Constellation" is available for download right now if you have backed the project. Hope you like it. Again, a thousand thanks. Sincerely, Toad (Glen, Randy, Todd and Dean) Project Update 3.0We made it home from this leg of the tour and are grateful for all of your support - it's really quite overwhelming. Now our goal is to make sure to keep up our end of the bargain to you, so we're hard at work (ok scrambling really) to figure out a way to honor the Kickstarter Early-Rewards Bonus Version of the full tracks from New Constellation. We've been collaborating with the kind folks at Kickstarter to figure out a way to make it work, and ask for a little more time to sort this out. We definitely want to prevent any further SNAFUs with this part of the program.All Kickstarter backers will receive the single "New Constellation" this week in a "backer update". (Going forward new backers will be able to get the single in the same update).Thank you again for your incredible support (and patience)!- Glen, Randy, Todd & Dean ************PROJECT UPDATE! Hello again! This has been a humbling, wonderful few days. In addition to the Kickstarter launch, we are out in New York this week, playing a handful of shows as well as having the honor of playing at 80th birthday celebration for Willie Nelson. Our bucket lists are getting lots of checkmarks.We have set a new stretch goal of $150K for the Kickstarter campaign. Our initial goal was set around the minimum amount we needed to begin promoting the record, but going further will enable us to do so much more. Publicity, radio and retail promotion, music videos, online promotion and on and on...we're just getting started.Once we reach our stretch goal, we will add a new, in-studio acoustic recording to all contributors of the campaign, to be distributed as a digital download. The concert will be recorded at Revolver studios, where we recorded the New Constellation album. Sound like fun? We think so.Thank you again from the bottom of our hearts. This is such an exciting start to a new chapter. Please keep spreading the word, and we'll keep chugging ahead on our side.- Glen, Randy, Todd & Dean************Toad started when Glen was a freshman in high school and met seniors Todd, Randy and Dean through choir and theater. We practiced in our parents' garages, played at dive bars, and recorded two indie records which were inexplicably picked up by the Columbia label. We put out three more records, had some hit singles, toured our asses off and broke up for all the usual reasons in 1998.We've all been making music on our own for a while now, and from time to time would get together for short tours, after which we would quickly scatter again. A couple years ago, something changed. Instead of remembering why we'd broken up, we started remembering why we got together in the first place. We started having fun and feeling like a band again, and that energy on the road led us to want to record a new record. So...we did.We're very proud of what we've created. New Constellation was produced, engineered and mixed by our friend Mikal Blue, and we are releasing it independently. That means no label, so it's our job (and yours as well, if you're willing) to get the word out. We've already invested in the recording and mixing, but this campaign will enable us to finish the art, take a single to radio, shoot videos, manufacture and distribute the album, and hire a team to promote and market the record. It will also allow us to deliver the album early and directly to those who care the most, and provide them with extra songs, cooler artwork, and undying eternal gratitude.We're fortunate to be able to come together and feel like a band again, and we think we've created something worthy of our listeners' expectations. We're also deeply grateful to the people who've stuck with us through the years, letting us know that our music matters to them. So here we are. For those of you who asked for a new record, we've done it. Now we need your involvement. You can use this opportunity just get the record early, or you can go into full Patron Of The Arts mode. Either is a big help.Thanks again, and be well, - Glen, Randy, Todd & Deanwww.toadthewetsprocket.comhttps://twitter.com/ToadWetSprockethttps://www.facebook.com/toadthewetsprocketmusichttp://instagram.com/toadthewetsprocket
107`Peas? Really?Yep. In 2010, I left my job as an attorney to start a business. A pea business. To be an "entre-pea-neur" if you will.The idea for my company came after a food trip to Sichuan province (the foodie capital of China) with my brother. I knew I had to get all of my friends to try this Sichuan peppercorn that was in everything we ate. So I came up with a seasoning and then World Peas to showcase that delicious flavor. I thought there were some other flavors I liked that would taste good on those peas, and World Peas was born. Did I get your attention with this puppy? Everyone that tried World Peas loved them. What's not to love - lower in calories and fat than your regular snack foods, all natural, all vegan, GMO-free, and gluten-free options. And, most importantly, taste. The flavors are what makes World Peas so special. Though they're healthy, they are still packed with flavor! Don't these peas look delicious? What do they taste like?Um, delicious! Look at our reviews on Amazon.com. Handing out samples at a Whole Foods Market in Texas While World Peas was very well received and can be found in certain retailers across the country, a lot of people just wanted a snack size and a lot of our target retailers didn't have the space in snack aisle for World Peas. Most of the big snack food companies can pay thousands of dollars to have a really nice spot on that aisle, but we don't have the cash to do that. So I thought the easiest way to get more people to try and love World Peas as much as I do would be to give them a little snack size to buy - then they'd be hooked. If someone didn't know what it was, they wouldn't have to shell out a lot of money just to try it. You could take it in your backpack or purse for a quick snack. Kids could take them to lunch and avoid nut allergen restrictions. We could hand them out at festivals (an Austin tradition) and other events. Peas on Earth, really.While our current packaging is nice, the labels are hand-applied and often peel off. We also don't feel it tells enough of the story behind World Peas - we need to change that.Flavors?We get asked why there's no wasabi flavor and our usual response is - it's been done! We've found in speaking to our customers, it's not always done well (usually filled with artificial flavors and colors and too hot or not hot enough). So we'll bring our expertise in flavoring to this popular product.As for our other flavors, we'll offer Sichuan Chili and Texas BBQ in the new size. These are our two most popular flavors. We'll slowly roll out the rest, but the high cost of rolling out new items will limit us to these three at first (unless we exceed our funding goal!). The Sichuan Chili is my favorite and is probably the only snack food you can buy that's made with the amazing Sichuan peppercorn. It has an awesome, unique flavor with a spicy punch. Texas BBQ is, well, BBQ. Who doesn't love BBQ?Where does the money go?The redesign of our packaging and design of the smaller bag, the large minimum order quantities from our manufacturer and launching new products with our distributors is very expensive. I don't take a salary and put all of the money I make back into the business. It would be impossible to launch this new size and this new flavor at this time without the help of the Kickstarter community. We'll share the redesign as soon as proofs are available.Rewards!The proof is in the peas. Our rewards are packed with peas...and T-shirts, koozies and other fun stuff. The big "pea-rize" - is awesome. We'll put your face on 1000 bags of our standard size World Peas to show up on shelves around the country.Go ahead, give peas a chance!

We'll share the redesign as soon as proofs are available.Rewards!The proof is in the peas. Our rewards are packed with peas...and T-shirts, koozies and other fun stuff. The big "pea-rize" - is awesome. We'll put your face on 1000 bags of our standard size World Peas to show up on shelves around the country.Go ahead, give peas a chance!
113`I am attempting to self release a 12 inch EP including 4 songs featuring art by Lauren Pakradooni. http://laurenpakradooni.wordpress.com/ "Killin the Vibe" is a song I wrote in Lisbon, Portugal while on tour. It didn't come into full fruition until I arrived back home in the states. Panda Bear sings vocals on the track and it will be released as a bonus track on my new LP Ducktails III: Arcade Dynamics (Woodsist). However, I would like to release the track on vinyl as well as a version of the song performed live in the UK with the band Spectrals. Alongside two versions of Killin the Vibe, we will see the release of 2 other songs that I have been performing live on recent tours "Sit Around With Ya" and "Couch Surfer". I have never released my own record, I unfortunately need money to do so. I am planning on pressing 500- 1,000 copies the record locally in Brooklyn at EKS. Art will be professionally printed at Imprint. Ideally this would be out by March, April. I really need your help and it has always been a dream of mine to release my own record. Thanks, Matt Mondanile

115`Thanks for checking out my project. The GO! Hammock is an amazingly comfortable, lightweight and portable hammock that's built to last and is easy to set up! Stretch Goal Unlocked!The GO! Hammock with an Integrated Bug Net is now available. Details are at the bottom of this page. The GO! Hammock with the Integrated Bug Net Option. Details are at the bottom of this page. The Story Over the years, I've purchased many hammocks but I couldn't find one that was comfortable, so I set out to design the most comfortable hammock possible. After extensive research and building many prototypes, I came up with the GO! Hammock. I call it the GO! Hammock because it's designed to go anywhere with you and it can be set up in a snap. It's great for camping, hiking, picnics or just lounging in the backyard. If you back this project, you'll be among the first to experience the amazing comfort of this hammock and for a great price! What makes the GO! Hammock so comfortable? The GO! Hammock eliminates uncomfortable pressure points by distributing the user's body weight more evenly than traditional hammocks. Its generous size allows freedom to move around and makes it easy find lots of comfortable positions, even for side sleepers! In order to reduce the curved body position that's associated with hammocks, experts recommend lying at a diagonal angle. To enable users to lie even flatter, we made the GO! Hammock extra long and wide. With a length of 11 feet, it's much longer than most hammocks, this extra length helps flatten out the body position dramatically! At 70" wide, one can lie at an even greater angle in the hammock, flattening the body position even more! Optional Tree Straps and Cinch Buckles and Upgraded 1/8" Amsteel Spliced Rope LoopsVideo: How to set up the GO! Hammock with tree straps & cinch buckles. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Our top of the line tree straps with cinch buckles and upgraded 1/8" Amsteel Spliced Rope Loops make set up a breeze and they're easy to adjust. Simply tilt the buckle, pull the strap and your good to go. These heavy duty polyester straps won't stretch like nylon straps that are commonly used with hammocks. We sourced the highest grade materials and parts we could find to ensure maximum durability, reliability and ease of use. These 1" wide tree straps are also recommended to protect the cambium layer of trees while using your hammock. Each strap is 15' long, so it's easy to find a great place to set up your hammock. These tree straps work great in conjunction with the carabiners that ship with every GO! Hammock. Optional Tree Straps and Cinch Buckles and UPGRADED 1/8" Amsteel Rope Loops Cinch Buckle with UPGRADED 1/8" Amsteel Spliced Rope Loop and Tree Strap Optional Ridgeline To take the guess work out of setting up your hammock, I recommend using our optional ridgeline. In order for a hammock to be as comfortable as possible, it must be set up with a certain amount of sag. Our ridgeline sets the sag of the hammock for maximum comfort every time. The ridgeline is made from extremely strong Amsteel rope! It makes a great place to hang items while enjoying your hammock and it can be used to support a rainfly or tarp when hammock camping! Our ridgeline is recommended to maximize comfort and to simplify set up. The Ridgeline is the yellow rope seen in this image. It sets the sag of the hammock for maximum comfort every time! Fabric Tensioners The GO! Hammock is the first hammock in the world with our new Fabric Tensioners! Large hammocks can sometimes have annoying loose fabric on the sides. To eliminate this problem, I designed removable fabric tensioners that pull the loose fabric out of the way. The tensioners make folds in the fabric, giving the hammock its unique shape. Our exclusive fabric tensioners pull loose fabric out of the way and give the GO! Hammock its unique shape. Carabiners and Rope Loops Free Upgrade! Every GO! Hammock will now ship with upgraded Amsteel Spliced Rope Loops! Every GO Hammock ships with two carabiners and rope loops to use with the suspension system of your choice. The included carabiners can also be used in conjunction with our tree straps! Simply clip the carabiner through the sewn loop on the strap, wrap the strap around a post or tree and clip the carabiner onto the tree strap.Specifications:Go! Hammock: 17 oz. Size: 132" Length X 70" Width. Material: 70D Breathable Parachute Nylon. Weight limit: 400 pounds. Ridgeline: Weight 1/2 oz. Length: 110"Rope Loops and Carabiners (pair): Weight 6 oz. Tree straps with Cinch Buckles (pair): Weight 10.5 oz. Each strap is 15 feet long to make it easy to find a place to set up your hammock! The tree straps and cinch buckles and the GO! Hammock will all fit into the integrated stuff sack for maximum portability!Manufacturing Information:The prototypes seen here were made at the same factory that will be manufacturing the GO! Hammock. Everything is in place for us to begin production and we should have our backers orders shipped this summer. But we need your help to meet our minimum order requirements. So please, check out the rewards below and reserve your GO! Hammock today, because you deserve to be comfortable! Stretch Goal: Integrated Bug Net Option will be unlocked when funding reaches $30,000 The GO! Hammock with the Integrated Bug Net add-on Integrated Bug Net DetailsThe Integrated Bug Net add-on is now unlocked! New backers can select a reward for the Bug Net Version of the GO! Hammock. Existing backers can add $34.99 per hammock to their pledge to upgrade their rewards. Details: Please read the details before upgrading your GO! Hammock.The GO! Hammock with the integrated bug net is great for hammock camping and for using the hammock when mosquitoes, flies, gnats, or other insects are a problem. The bug net is designed to be supported by a ridgeline but can also be set up with the three loops that will be on the top of the net. The bug net is sewn onto the hammock and there is a long zipper on one side of the hammock to make it easy to get in and out of the hammock. The two way zipper has two zipper pulls on the inside and two on the outside to make it even easier to enter and exit the hammock. In order to keep the bug net out of the way of the user, the fabric tensioners on the bug net version are replaced with four aluminum stakes and four pieces of shock cord with hooks. These are used to tighten up the loose hammock fabric as well as the bug net. The stakes and shock cord are included with each upgrade! The GO! Hammock with the optional bug net, can be flipped over and used without the net on days that you don't need it! In order to do this, simply move the ridgeline from the inside of net to the outside of the net. It only takes a minute or two to make this change.The GO! Hammock with the Integrated Bug Net add-on allows the user to lay at the very edge of the hammock without having to worry about their head, feet or arms slipping out. The bug net also prevents sleeping bags and pillows etc. from falling out of the hammock. Because of this, we are making the Integrated Bug Net version 64" wide instead of 70" wide. This amounts to 3 inches on each side and the net more than makes up for the difference. Click image to see the Hands On Review
116`Good olive oil is like good wine. The specific variety of the fruit matters. The terroir the land and environment where it is grown matters. The production process matters. They all work in concert to create a unique taste and experience. Just as you enjoy exploring the depth and individuality of fine wine, we hope to introduce you to a similar experience with Auzoud extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).OUR STORYI was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud means olive in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud Waterfalls in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco Ouzoud s waters contribute to the region s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation. It has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping other family members and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma.After moving to the U.S. several years ago, I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region.THE HISTORY OF OLIVES IN THE OUZOUD REGIONAmazingly, the Ouzoud region has some of the oldest olive groves in the world. The ancient Romans were the first connoisseurs of Moroccan olive oil. They established the trading city of Volubilis in the 1st Century A.D. in northern Morocco, from which they could oversee their olive harvest. Old Olive Tree in Ouzoud Region Our olive oil is produced from the Picholine cultivar of olive. Picholines were originally grown in the south of France, but they have found a natural second home in Morocco s shared Mediterranean climate, where they are the dominant variety. The small farmers in Ouzoud have harvested it for generations.Olive oil made from the Picholine variety is recognized for its beautiful light golden color and fresh aroma. It will win you over with its soft, right, fruity and slightly peppery taste. WE OFFER THE HIGHEST QUALITY EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL You ve probably noticed that there are an overwhelming number of olive oils to choose from in the store, but did you know that a 2010 study by the University of California, Davis found that two-thirds of the biggest imported brands failed to meet the requirements to actually label their olive oil as extra virgin ? These companies often source their olive oil in massive quantities without knowing where it comes from, how it was grown or how it was processed. They often mix different varieties of olive oil to create a homogenous flavor that loses any sense of the individual profile and personality of the olives it was grown from. In some cases the oil is also diluted with cheap vegetable oils, like peanut or sunflower. Some producers also use stale olive oil, which may taste rancid. Not only are these practices fraudulent for consumers but they are also setting the tone for a general acceptance of low-quality oil and open the door to other major concerns, such as food allergies/sensitivities. In order to receive U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) classification as an extra virgin olive oil, the oil must be pressed mechanically without the use of any alteration methods. The acidity level must be 0.8 or less for every 100 grams. During the pressing stage, when the oil is squeezed from the olive fruit, the temperature must remain constant at 80 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). At Auzoud we make sure to meet these requirements during our process and with lab testing. The result is a fantastic olive oil with very low acidity and a full, rich flavor. We want to change the way people think about and experience extra virgin olive oil, a staple in so many of our diets. I have participated in every stage of the process from hand picking, pressing and bottling. Auzoud Extra Virgin Olive Oil PROUDLY PARTNERED WITH MOROCCO S SMALL FARMERS In addition to offering only the finest extra virgin olive oil, Auzoud is committed to working with low-income farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Auzoud is proud to partner with the Ben Youssef Farmers Cooperative, which was founded in 2010 to support better social conditions for women, youth and agricultural workers in the region. Partnering With Ben Youssef Cooperative The co-op helps empower local farmers obtain higher prices for their olives and a more sustainable livelihood for them and their families. All of the olives we use are sourced directly from this group. There are currently over a hundred co-op members and many more farmers are working with the organization to participate in the next harvest. One of the co-op s missions is to educate members about sustainable olive farming. To this end, Auzoud and the co-op are working together to obtain organic certification for all members. The money raised through this campaign will help Auzoud expand the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. MORE THAN JUST OLIVE OIL In addition to our oil, we sell batches of pitted green and black olives cured in olive oil. They are delicious! Oil Cured Picholine Black Olives Picholine Green Olives Pitted USE OF FUNDSCustomers and staff of the specialty stores and retailers where we sell our products say they love the unique taste and that we ve changed the way they experience and think about olives and olive oil.Auzoud has already partnered with several retail outlets, and is sold in a number of specialty and natural stores. Many more stores plan to carry Auzoud products but only if we can bring in a new shipment this fall. Demand is high but we have to be able to meet the minimum quantities at which many stores will only agree to deal with us. This will require a significant expansion from the product numbers we were able to bring to market in the past.Funds from this campaign will be used to purchase olives from the Ben Youssef Farmers Co-op. We will also be working with the co-op in its modern facility to press and bottle the oil for shipment to the U.S. Savings and proceeds from previous sales will be used to finance shipping costs. Any funds in excess of our goal will be used to prepare the olives for retail sale, which includes packaging in glass jars and labeling. As with our oil, we already have a waitlist for these. Additional funds will also be used to grow our online presence and online sales capabilities, so that we can continue to grow our company and the pool of farmers we work with.Of course, we will keep you informed about the progress of the project. SPREAD THE WORD Thank you for taking the time to learn about our project. We appreciate your interest and hope you will join us! If you know of anyone who loves quality food, sustainable and natural agricultural production, fair trade, or who might otherwise be interested in our work, please share this campaign with them. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

The support you've shown has been overwhelming, and we're happy to announce that you've earned all 4 stretch goal rewards! We have 18 hours to go and we've already had unprecedented support, but if we can top 650K we want to throw a little party: a PicoBrew Backer Bash!10/24/2013 Stretch Goal #4 - Thank you again! Well, you earned it: a spare Keg Lid and Airlock for all Zymatic(tm)-level backers! Looks like we're well on our way to another big milestone too -- 600k! There are still 5 days to go, so here's what we're going to do. We have a special "keg accessory pack" that we were planning on selling separately -- we're now going to throw that in with your Zymatics if/when we hit 600k in pledges. 10/19/2013 Stretch Goal #3: 500K! - Thank you for your votes on the 500K Stretch Goal Reward! The votes were strongly in favor of a spare keg lid and airlock so upon reaching 500K we'll be adding this to all machines that ship (in addition to the fermenting lid + airlock already included).10/16/2013 Stretch Goal #2: 400K!

Thanks to your great support we are able to include a custom keg-cozy with all PicoBrew machines! Why a custom keg cozy instead of off-the-shelf? Turns out that slipping those off-the-shelf cozies on/off the kegs is not so easy (think sliding a sweater on/off a hot stainless-steel wiener-dog!) So ours opens up via either snaps or a zipper (we re testing both as we speak to see what works best). 10/1/2013 Wow, 100% of Goal in 34 hours! We re very excited and humbled by the amount of support you ve shown for PicoBrewing! It s just been overwhelming! We re so lucky to have such great support (and to have the ability to crank out kegs of our favorite beers on demand!). Thank you Kickstarters! Why can't we brew beer at home as easily as we can make a loaf of bread with a bread-maker, or a shot of espresso with an automatic espresso machine? Making quality beer this easily: that was the dream 3 years ago, and we're proud to announce that after thousands of man hours of R&D, we've made that dream a reality in the form of the PicoBrew Zymatic(tm). I'm Bill Mitchell, CEO and Co-Founder of PicoBrew LLC. My brother Jim and I are avid home-brewers. We started PicoBrew LLC in early 2010 out of frustration with the state of the art: home beer brewing takes entirely too much time, is too imprecise, and frankly, when you account for all of the clean-up, is not all that fun. We wanted to make the creation of high-quality beer brewing simple, amp up the art, and tone down the tedium. So how does one PicoBrew anyway? We're glad you asked! PicoBrewing is a quicker and more enjoyable way to brew! The basic steps are simply creating (or borrowing) a recipe, loading ingredients into a container we call the "step filter", and selecting the recipe to brew using the rotary encoder on the front panel of your PicoBrew Zymatic(tm). After 18+ years as an executive at Microsoft leading pioneering efforts in PDAs, smartphones, automotive and wearable computing I know a thing or two about creating computing appliances. Jim has spent much of the last two decades building innovative food processing plants in CA, following in the footsteps of our grandfather, Dr. William Mitchell, inventor of Pop Rocks, Tang and other fun foods. We got to work quickly in early 2010 and began building a succession of Proof of Concept (POC) systems based on an off-the-shelf Arduino-based controller, off-the-shelf pumps, relays, valves and a custom heating loop. A succession of POC prototype machines followed as we incrementally invented a new brewing process that allowed for the pre-loading of ingredients and total hands-free automation. By late 2011 we had created a proven solution, and were ready to move to the next step: Functional Prototypes (FPs). A custom motherboard design was needed, however, and significant mechanical engineering lay between us and a shipping product. One fateful day in the Fall of 2011 I met with my old colleague Avi Geiger at one of Seattle's great local craft breweries. Avi was a long-time Microsoft hardware architect and beer aficionado, and as luck would have it, had just left Microsoft. When I told him about what we were doing at PicoBrew he was intrigued. We quickly decided to join forces and Avi became the third PicoBrew co-founder, bringing us the perfect set of complementary new skills (electrical and mechanical engineering). In 2012 our PicoBrew team made rapid progress on a sequence of 4 custom ATMEGA controller boards, firmware, web-side services and software. These improvements manifested themselves in Functional Prototypes 1 through 3 (FPs). In August we started refining our process (especially mash efficiency and hops utilization) and focusing in earnest on reliability and repeat-ability testing, and we took a lease on a 4000 sqft lab/shop/office space in downtown Seattle on North Lake Union. This allowed us to move out of our home shops and into a real wet-lab and shop space and hire full-time employees, expanding our prototyping and testing capabilities tremendously. We were also able to take the final step towards manufacturing our first PicoBrew product by hand-building final Engineering Validation Test (EVT) units. Hundreds of test batches through Picobrew's lab The past year has been spent mostly refining our PicoBrewing process, testing recipes, and refining prototypes of the custom parts we need as well as sourcing our necessary off-the-shelf parts. (Avi's quite the CAD-jock, but we had some great summer intern help too!) Now, after over 3 years, thousands of man-hours of effort and over a dozen prototypes, we're almost ready to manufacture the world's most automatic all-grain home-brewing appliance! We're most excited to be shipping you the first Zymatic(TM) beer brewing machines but we also think you'll love our logo t-shirts: We're excited to partner with Seattle-based designer Will Hays to bring you this artist's series of shirts as well: The possibilities for what you can Picobrew are unlimited, but we've tried to capture a few of these on our 32oz growler to help you see what's in your beer. You can pick up these up along with some tasting glasses and a paddle (replete with inset aluminum pucks to keep your beer cold) to share your beers with your friends for a $39 pledge. Whew, It's been a long journey! We now have our machines at the final EVT (Engineering Validation Test) phase, though, and we're really excited to introduce PicoBrewing to the world! We have a few final steps before we can start manufacturing the PicoBrew Zymatic(tm), and some of them, like cutting the tools for injection molding of our step-filter, are expensive. So we need your help: Please pledge today and allow us to take these final steps to bring you the most automatic all-grain beer brewing machine at the best price we can arrange! Thank you from the PicoBrew Team!

119`|hi folks, it's AFP. this is my first BIG, LEGIT studio album undertaking since breaking from a major label. i've spent four years writing the songs for this record, and more recently, putting together the perfect band, The Grand Theft Orchestra, comprised of genius musicians/arrangers/programmers MICHAEL MCQUILKEN, CHAD RAINES, and JHEREK BISCHOFF. in march, we locked ourselves up in a studio in Australia and, with the help of producer/engineer John Congleton (who's worked with a zillion amazing people including St. Vincent, Modest Mouse, and Xiu Xiu), we made what I believe is my best fucking album to date. it sounds...BEYOND EPIC. we laid down "The Bed Song", "Massachusetts Avenue", "The Killing Type", "Trout Heart Replica" and a slew of other tracks...some solo piano, but many featuring HORNS (locally sourced in Melbourne, Australia!), SYNTHESIZERS, GUITAAAARRRRR, and BIG BAD-ASS ORCHESTRAL ARRANGEMENTS that will blow your domepiece. we're working on finalizing the arrangements and mastering as i write this text. i expect great, big, giant things to happen when this record comes out in september. the band & i will be touring it across the globe ALL YEAR. here is me with the band, plus performance artists anthony cleave & jess daly, in melbourne right before taking stage: NOW, about the ARTWORK. over the last six months i've been working in secret with OVER THIRTY visual artist friends of mine (full list below) to create a massive explosion of song-inspired album art, in all different kinds of media. some people took the project really literally and made super lyrics-specific paintings....some people went way abstract. the end result is an EXPLOSION of incredible art.here is the list of artists who made things (alphabetically by first name):Amanda Palmer, Blake Brasher, Cassandra Long, Conrad Keely (...And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead), Cynthia von Buhler, David Mack, Desi, DJ Spooky (Paul Miller), Empire SNAFU Restoration Project, Hans Rickheit, Heide Hatry, Judith Clute, Kambriel, Kristin Hersh (Throwing Muses), Kyle Cassidy, Lee Barron, Meghan Howland, Michael Pope, Michael Zulli, Molly Crabapple, Neil Gaiman, Nicole Duennebier, Rick Berry, Robyn Hitchcock, Sarah Beetson, Shepard Fairey, Steven Bogart, Sylvia K, Tao Lin, Tony Albert, Vladimir Zimikov, Walter Sickert, and Zea Barker.since i'm now without a giant label to front the gazillions of dollars that it always takes to manufacture and promote a record this big, i'm coming to you to gather funds so that i have the capital to put it out with a huge fucking bang. i think kickstarter and other crowdfunding platforms like this are the BEST way to put out music right now - no label, no rules, no fuss, no muss. just us, the music, and the art. i'm also making sure EVERY PRODUCT sold through this kickstarter is unique to this campaign, to reward all of you who KNEW ME WHEN and were willing to support me from Day One.here we go, yo:**ALL SHIPPING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN EVERY PACKAGE, NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE!**please bear this in mind when you look at the prices. it was easier to do things this way, but it also means, in the spirit of art-in-the-mail-democracy, that those of you living in new york might be paying a little bit more to cover the shipping to the people in, say, tibet. while i can't force you to listen to it on a certain type of media, at a certain time of day, with a special pair of headphones, with a certain flavor of incense burning while you consume a very specific whiskey...i CAN make sure that what you get in your mailbox containing said music is as badass, fancy, and gorgeous as possible. i'll be damned if i don't at least PRESENT it to you in as fancy a way as possible.you can get a digital download for as little as A DOLLAR.but, should you wish to HOLD a copy of my album both the COMPACT DISC and VINYL will be limited edition "kickstarter-backer" editions, never to be made again. the COMPACT DISC will be in a beautiful hard-bound case and include an art booklet. the VINYL will be a black 180 gram double-record set, and come in a gorgeously packaged case with extensive large-format art. you will freak. over THIRTY artists have been slaving away for the past few months to make art (over 70 images so far!) for this album, and the results are STUNNING. here's a sneak peak at a FEW: ALL of the art will be printed in a beautifully bound ART BOOK. the artists include some of my long-time collaborators, like Cynthia von Buhler, Cassandra Long, Molly Crabapple, Kyle Cassidy in collaboration Neil Gaiman, Zea Barker, and my favorite 7-year-old draw-er on Twitter, @GavinLovesAFP. I also reached out to some new artists I've never worked with, like the german sculptor Heide Hatry, brooklyn writer/artist Tao Lin, and many others. but best of all I talked some of my musician friends (like DJ spooky, kristin hersh from throwing muses, conrad keely from trail of dead, and one of my songwriting HEROES robyn hitchcock) into making art which you'll be able to see: in a hard-bound ART BOOK (similar to the "Who Killed Amanda Palmer" book) which will contain the art, photos, lyrics, behind-the-scenes looks at some of the artist's creations, and much more LIVE and IN PERSON on our ART SHOW TOUR June-August (we'll be hitting Berlin, London, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Boston) this is a package i dreamed up for people who like to get SHIT IN THE MAIL, CONSTANTLY. when i was a teenager i used to love 7"-of-the-month-clubs, punk rock style, and fanzines that would arrive with weird ziploc bags full of crap in them. if you're a freak for surprises...this is the package for you. over the course of the summer, you'll get a series of 5 packages (sent every few weeks starting in july). the final package will include the deluxe backer-edition of the album, and packages 1-4 are going to be limited edition 7" vinyl that feature some of the amazing album artwork. and with your 7" singles, i'll also include an ARTS&CRAFTS SURPRISE. i wanted to stay away from things like shirts and posters and crap...i wanted to make things for you to DO, and MAKE, and SHARE back at me. i'm really proud of the bizarre things we thought up for this. the shipping of multiple packages all summer long is going to cost us a lot, and that's reflected in the price."BUT ((SAD FACE)) I DON'T HAVE A TURNTABLE...."THEN BUY ONE FROM US. YOU KNOW YOU WANT ONE.VINYL IS BACK. we're going to buy and decorate some really high-quality Crosley USB-turntables and include them in higher-priced packages JUST FOR THIS REASON.at some point this summer Cassandra Long (who also happens to be my housemate), Meghan Howland, and a few of the other Album Artists are going to have a massive 2-day party in boston during which we get together and paint all these turntables for you. your excuse not to buy vinyl IS GONE! POOF! last july, I started randomly drawing people who tweeted black and white photos of themselves to me...with a sharpie of course, because I always have one on my person, because THAT is the secret to being a successful musician. I love to draw these in quiet moments on the road or at home before the mayhem of the day starts. I figured I would extend the offer to be a sharpie-rendition of ANYTHING you send - it doesn't have to be you...it could be a loved one, a lost one, a place, a favorite mug...go crazy. we'll pack it up really nicely and send it to you right along with all the music & art book stuffs. here are some that i've done in the past (for twitter-folk @sermoiii and @SDuPreeBemis): i'll have neil explain this one, because he writes gooder than me. please be amused at the fact he is, therefore, referring to himself in the third person:"To make art for 'The Bed Song', Neil wrote a script, as if Neil were making a script for a five panel graphic novel, and gave it to Kyle. Kyle and Neil talked, emailed, Kyle took photos, and the final sequence of five shots that made 'The Bed Song' art was created.Which left us with a lot of amazing photos of people in beds that we didn't use. And we wanted people to see them. So we are making a limited edition book, with writing by Neil and photographs by Kyle and lyrics by Amanda. Unless you are one of the models in the beds, Neil, Kyle or Amanda, this Kickstarter will probably be the only way you can get one, I'm afraid. There will be a limited, signed, numbered edition of 666 copies, with a very small number of additional unnumbered artists proofs.Warning. The book contains naked people, naked emotions and unmade beds." TO KICK OFF THIS YEAR OF MADNESS, in which we'll be touring ALL OVER THE WORLD, we're going to unveil the new material and the original large-format album art/paintings LIVE in six select cities: BOSTON, NEW YORK, LA, SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON and BERLIN. in every city, we've PARTNERED with a local ART GALLERY or EVENT SPACE, where we'll hang the art on beautiful walls for y'all to come and admire in person. then we'll have a special kick-off ART OPENING just for kickstarter supporters who back the event. we'll load you down with odd gifts, hugs, and drinks (if you're of age...if not, root beer throwdown) & the band will play a special acoustic set in the Art Space. we're keeping these openings limited to about 100-150, even in spaces where we could fit more people. one of my favorite things about this is that i'll get to MEET you guys in person, and thank you for your backing with a kiss. i'm hoping that our night together, among the art, making acoustic music with the band and sharing wine, will be totally fucking magical & unforgettable. in each city, we'll ALSO be playing a SMALL plugged-in rock show. the rock shows are open to the general public and have almost all sold out, but the art show kickstarter backers will have guaranteed guest-list to those performances, as well. the tickets to these smaller rock shows will be HARD to get, so backing in your city is a surefire way to know you'll get in. even though we've assembled a tasty variety of backer rewards - $1 all the up to $10,000 - i also know that there are some of you you are HELLA RICH and who would like to put more money towards the project. i know because...i've been asked. SO: for you more invest-y types, i am proud to announce THE LOANSPARK COLLECTIVE.with LOANSPARK, i'm not asking for donations; i'm asking for people to step forward as high-level patrons and help out with interest-free loans that will be fully paid back after the album is cranked out and earning money. in exchange for your high-rolling loan, i will make some very special art and/or do a performance to support a charity you're passionate about. it's a slightly mad idea, but if it works, we may be onto a new form of patronage that could work for other artists...so i'm very happy to take a crack at it.all the info is up on the LOANSPARK WEBSITE, which we've launched in conjunction with this project: _________and that my dear comrades, is it.WE ARE THE MEDIA: as soon as you support this kickstarter, PLEASE TELL EVERYONE YOU'VE DONE IT, AND SPREAD THE LINK FAR AND WIDE.thank you, thank you, thank you.LOVE,amandafuckingpalmer amandapalmer.net || @amandapalmerp.s. a random note about the video: i DID pick up all those fucking signs i'd drawn. i did not leave them in the street in melbourne. we'll figure out what to do with them later...by the time we finished shooting (we did 2 takes), most of the cards had been run over by a car or a bicycle.Band photos and KS video by Jim Batt || @battsignalCollage of the ART (from l-r, top to bottom): Kyle Cassidy, Tony Albert, Cynthia von Buhler, Cassandra Long, David Mack, and Tony AlbertAFP/Keytar photo by Andrius LipsysAdditional images/editing/maintenance by Sean Francis || @indeciSEAN|
120`Introducing 3Doodler 2.0When we first launched 3Doodler we asked the world to imagine a pen that you could literally lift off the page to create real three dimensional objects; a pen that put the power of a 3D printer in the palm of your hand. Two years later, we ve made the world s best 3D printing pen even better, with a new version that's slimmer, lighter, quieter and even easier to use. Oh, and just like the original 3Doodler, it's still by far and away the most affordable way to 3D print. With 3Doodler 2.0 we re continuing to make 3D creation and 3D design accessible to everyone! How does it work? Compact and easy to use, the 3Doodler extrudes heated plastic that cools almost instantly into a solid, stable structure; and with no computers or software needed, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination. Simply plug your 3Doodler into a power socket and start drawing anything within minutes. If you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler. But you don't need to take our word for it...Since we first showed the world that drawing in 3D was possible, we have sold over 130,000 3Doodlers. Our community has been using their 3Doodlers to create amazing things, going far beyond even our wildest expectations: from jewellery, to fully 3Doodled remote control planes, 3Doodled dresses, architectural models, and even writing braille! The creative possibilities are endless (and at times a tad unusual too!). So just like the Backstreet Boys, 3Doodler's back, alright!It was thanks to the support of the Kickstarter community that we were able to make the 3Doodler dream a reality. It was also here on Kickstarter that we began the process of building a vibrant community of artists, makers, designers, educators, as well as others eager to lift their imaginations off the page. Doodle by Doodle you have pushed the boundaries of 3D art and creation and inspired us further! To say a big thank you for all of your help and inspiration, we decided to come back to the place where it all began, and bring 3Doodler 2.0 to you first! We are eternally grateful for all the support you gave us the first time around, and want to give you first dibs at creating with the new 3Doodler. It's your funding that will help make this a reality! What s new with 3Doodler 2.0?Completely redesigned from top to bottom, 3Doodler 2.0 is the result of over two years of research and development, and feedback from thousands of users. Our aim? To give you the best 3Doodling experience ever! The result? A smaller, more ergonomic, and even more kick-ass 3D pen. We've also housed the new 3Doodler in a sleek metallic casing, so that it's jaw-droppingly beautiful and feels great in your hands. And there's lots more...As well as being the world's smallest 3D printing pen, we've packed the new 3Doodler with loads of other enhancements for smoother doodling in every dimension: a fully re-engineered drive system (the part that feeds the plastic through the pen), for even smoother 3Doodling an entirely new nozzle design, for better performance and crisper Doodles. As well as being technologically better it also looks way cooler enhanced and quieter airflow, to cool your plastic more efficiently and make it even easier to Doodle in the air from the get-go dual speed control, for a more customized Doodling experience (and specially for those of you who just can't get enough speed!) a new double-click function for continuous flow, so that you can Doodle non-stop without having to hold down any buttons manual temperature optimization, for minor flow adjustments and expertly consistent 3D Doodles more efficient and stable heating (or in other words, no stopping and starting while doodling!) and drastically reduced power consumption, under half the voltage of the original 3Doodler It's also easier to use than ever before thanks to a whole host of other design adjustments. These touch on everything from the shape of the pen, which allows you to Doodle into really tight corners, the more intuitive button design, as well as the positioning of the LED indicator light and cooling fan. Accessories & PlasticsWith the launch of the new 3Doodler on Kickstarter, we are also releasing a series of exciting new accessories to supercharge (and beautify) your 3Doodling. These include: a DoodleStand for your pen and plastic a JetPack, a portable power pack that gives you the freedom to Doodle on the go (2 hours of non-stop portable Doodling with ABS and 3 hours with PLA!) a Nozzle Set equipped six changeable nozzles + a smoothing tool a foot Pedal, for more versatile 3Doodling. With the new JetPack we're certain you'll be putting Banksy to shame in no time - bring on that 3Doodled street art! So which pledge level is right for you?We ve tried to create pledge levels to suit everyone, from the novice Doodler to the seasoned designer or engineer, and for those of you looking for a bit of 3Doodling fun. Simply scroll down the right-hand side of the page and pick the combination of plastics and accessories that fits you best. Every pledge level comes bundled with a mix of 3Doodler PLA and ABS plastic strands so that you can start 3D drawing right away! Each pledge level is limited to one pledge per backer. However we have also created special double pledge levels for the 3Doodler 2.0, Accessorize, JetSetter and PowerDoodler rewards, as well as a special Family Pack with four pens and a bunch of accessories + plastic strands.And if you're having trouble deciding which pledge level to go for, please don t hesitate to get in touch to ask us any questions that may help! EducationThe teaching potential that comes with being able to draw in a new dimension has been truly inspiring, and something the whole 3Doodler team has been eager to get behind. Together with teachers and educators, we're working to make the 3Doodler a standard classroom tool, used for everything from teaching geometry, to making award-winning art, or producing learning aids for the visually impaired. To support the use of the 3Doodler in education, we have created a special EDU pledge level for only US$1,000 (worth almost US$2,000), that allows you to send a full class set, loaded with x12 3Doodler 2.0 pens, a ton of plastic and accessories, as well as curricular materials to any school, university, library or non-profit makerspace of your choosing. You ll also get a 3Doodler 2.0 and full set of accessories for yourself!Note: We will require you to designate a recognized educational institutional or non-profit makerspace (as well as a contact there) in order to claim this pledge level. Full instructions will follow in an Update, and further details can be found in the FAQs below. What if "I'm not artistic"?If you can dream it, you can 3Doodle it! (Or so the saying goes.) The more artistically inclined of you will be sketching castles in the air in no time, but even those of us without that kind of talent can use the 3Doodler to draw on flat surfaces, peel off the Doodled pieces and join them together to make awesome 3D designs and creations. And based on what we've seen so far, previous artistic ability is not a prerequisite for 3Doodling greatness. Even those who considered themselves to be "not artistic" have gone on to Doodle breathtakingly impressive pieces! There are a ton of places to find 3Doodling inspiration, including our Community Site, which has hundreds of freely downloadable projects and stencils, how-to videos, and images. Our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages are also frequently updated with Doodles of the Week, Community Doodle-Offs , and cool creations from around the world. When will you get your 3Doodler?We have been working on 3Doodler 2.0 for over 12 months and are inches away from pressing "go" on full production. That means we ll go straight from this Kickstarter campaign to making your pens. Our first backers will get their new 3Doodlers within a few weeks of this campaign closing, and the majority of you will have your pens by April.For those of you curious about the exact stage we're at: All R&D and prototypes (along with compliance testing) were completed in December, all components and suppliers have been locked down, we have finished our final pilot runs (those are the pens you see in the video and images), and the assembly process is being fine-tuned so that we can run as smoothly as possible when full production begins! All that's left to do is put the final touches to tooling and place our first large orders with our suppliers. Then we'll be moving like lightening and hassling our shipping partners day and night to get your pens to you ASAP. We shipped our original Kickstarter 3Doodlers on time and we're determined to do the same, if not better, for 3Doodler 2.0! No waiting six months (or even a year) for this one ;) Thank you!We can t thank the Kickstarter community enough for being part of this amazing journey, and we re super excited to give you a first shot at the new 3Doodler. We know that you'll make the most of this incredible tool and use it to create Doodles that will blow us away.For anyone who has not experienced the 3Doodler yet, now is a great time to start! And for those of you backing us for the second time, thank you again! Thank you from the 3Doodler Team! Is there anything else you need to know?Yes! To help with this we ve compiled an extensive FAQ section below, covering everything from the plastics that will ship with your 3D pen, to the shipping methods we ll be using, details relating to taxes & duties (*sigh*), product safety, as well as the procedures for claiming the School Set pledge level, and much more. We ll be adding new FAQs as we go along, and we ll be keeping you up to date with Kickstarter Updates, messages, and via the Comment wall.Anyone who backed the original 3Doodler will tell you that we d much rather reply to your messages than sleep, so please feel free to reach out to us!

At Copper Canyon we pride ourselves on taking risks, and we make our publishing decisions based on the aesthetic and cultural value we find in poetry, rather than letting the market dictate our list. As a result, not unlike independent record companies and public radio stations, we rely on the support of donors like you, who share our belief that poetry is vital to language and living. All the light, shadow, / stars, About the GoalPublishing Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda is a great challenge and a fantastic opportunity for a small nonprofit press.

We trust that the book will find enthusiastic readership worldwide, becoming a legacy that will help us to publish other extraordinary books of poetry for decades to come.

And now for some big news.When Pablo Neruda s estate granted Copper Canyon Press the rights to publish his lost poems, we requested the privilege of translating and publishing an additional Neruda collection. Crepusculario Neruda s first book, which has never been translated into English is forthcoming from Copper Canyon Press in 2017. The book, whose title is Neruda s twist on the Spanish word crepusculo (twilight), was self-published by the poet. Legend has it that 19-year-old Pablo Neruda sold his father s gold watch to pay for the publication, and accepted help from local poetry advocates who believed in his promise as a young poet. One could say Neruda was an early crowdfunder, going to his community to help him create what needed creating. And now, nearly a century later, we have the opportunity to bring Neruda s hard-earned first book to the English-speaking world for the first time. Like Neruda, we can only do this with the help of our community that s you. If you ll help us keep this campaign going, all proceeds raised from here on out will help us to publish Crepusculario. If we raise $65,000, pre-production costs for Crepusculario including acquisition and translation will be covered. If we raise $75,000, we can budget for the initial editing and design process for Crepusculario, and all campaign backers will receive a complete poem from Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda. If we raise $100,000, Crepusculario will move into production while we go about raising the additional funds to publish, market, and distribute the book. Imagine: together we will have published Pablo Neruda s first book and Pablo Neruda s last book, both in English for the first time ever. This is a tremendous role that we can play together. We re proud to be in it with you. Please spread the word by sharing this link http://kck.st/1Mtnl1P, and consider upping your pledge to be part of publishing Crepusculario. all / the space, the autumn, the carnations RewardsIn thanks for your support of the publication of the lost Neruda poems, you can receive: Behind-the-scenes updates from the publication in progress An advance copy of Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda A beautiful letterpress broadside featuring excerpts from Neruda s lost poems A collection of previous titles by Neruda published by Copper Canyon Press Your name or the name of a loved one printed in Then Come Back: The Lost Neruda as an acknowledgment of your support Thank You We at Copper Canyon Press are grateful for people like you who value poetry and the vitality it brings to its readers.

123`Picking up (and carrying) dog poop is a daily fact of life for dog owners who walk their dogs. A Wise Walker gives you an easy way to stash that nasty poop bag while you finish your walk -- out of sight, out of mind, and out of your hands! A simple solution to a crappy problem. The Wise Walker, showing the zippered side pouch for keys, phone, treats, etc. The Wise Walker weighs only about two ounces -- it virtually floats along with you on your walk. You can see more about the evolution of the Wise Walker below. But first.... Wise Walker: Dogs + Kids + Entrepreneurship + PooTeam Wise Walker is 11-year-old twin sisters, a dog and a dad on a mission to make dog poo less gross and to explore the lessons of entrepreneurship. As a dad and an entrepreneur, the opportunity to share my passion for startups and expose my daughters to the lessons, skills, experiences of entrepreneurship is what this project is about. THE TWINS Sarah and Annalise were born only minutes apart but they couldn't be more different... in just about every possible way. It is a cause for celebration in our home any time the two of them are caught agreeing on anything. We prefer to think of it as Yin and Yang, evidence that there's balance in the universe. They don't fully realize it yet, but they have the makings of a great team. Like lots of kids, Annalise and Sarah LOVE animals. We spend many days each summer bumming around Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo. As much as Sarah would love to have a pet elephant and Annalise can't wait till she can have her own horse ranch, they are both over-the-top in love with dogs. THE DOG Our dog, Lola, is a sweetheart. We rescued her from a shelter about eight years ago. She had been found wandering scared and lost in the Cascade mountains. We don t know what happened to her out there alone in the wilderness but she was terribly distressed by the experience. Lola was first rescued from a shelter by a woman who was diagnosed with cancer just two weeks later. Traumatized herself, she was no longer in a position to help a traumatized pup recover. She needed to give up Lola to a family that could support her recovery. We were searching shelters at the same time and when we found out about Lola we went to meet here and fell in love with her immediately.Lola spent her entire first year in our home crouched in the corner by the front door. She was a basket case. But we loved her and over time she came out of her shell. Lola still gets scared more easily than most dogs but she s now a happy and healthy part of our family.If someone would have told me then that Lola would end up having such a powerful impact on me and my daughters I don't think I could have believed. But because of Lola, we discovered this project and it has been amazing.THE DADI am an entrepreneur, a technologist, and a teacher. I have founded several companies and I'm passionate about sharing the lessons I've learned through that experience. I share those lessons through the work I do as a mentor and advisor to other entrepreneurs pursuing their passions. I work with programs like Techstars, Startup Weekend, TiE Young Entrepreneurs, Fledge, Seattle Women in Tech and others. I came from an entrepreneurial family myself, working since I was 8 years old in an array of family businesses including a commercial rabbit farm, wood products manufacturing, clothing and accessory manufacturing, furniture manufacturing and even a couple of retail stores. I worked in virtually every area of those businesses. I designed, cut, stapled, milled, glued, stained, pressed, packed, shipped and sold products... and eventually managed the adults doing the same jobs. It was hard work (too hard) for a young kid but I mostly enjoyed it and I was always with my family. Decked out for Halloween 2013. Forecasting the future? I'm also on a mission to unleash two powerful women on the world. I believe strongly that the skills and lessons of entrepreneurship are extraordinarily valuable to young people, girls or boys. But as a dad with two daughters I have a special interest in supporting their journey to become anything they choose to be and equipping them to understand that there s nothing they cannot choose. We've learned a lot about entrepreneurship and a lot about what it takes to build a great product. TALKING TO CUSTOMERSThe first entrepreneurial lesson we learned when we started working on the idea for Wise Walkers was to talk to customers to see what real dog walkers like about the product, what they don t like and what could make it better. In the parlance of startups, we needed to do 'customer development'. So we took a walk along a nearby urban trail and approached dog walkers we saw. We learned a LOT! Here s the highlights of what we heard and how it improved Wise Walkers.Overall, everyone we talked to thought it was a good idea. Even if they themselves didn't think they d be a good customer (e.g., they live in a rural area and only need to pick up poop very occasionally.)Wise Walkers would have to be really durable and washable. That makes sense. Denier nylon and rip-stop are both super durable... and washable. That should do it. Gotta have a compartment to store a roll of clean doggy bags. We missed this at first because we were so focused on making a pouch to carry the dirty poop bag that we didn't think yet about the clean ones -- duh! But that was an easy problem to solve -- we added poop bag roll storage to the design. Add a pouch to store keys, cell phone, treats, etc. Great idea! The consensus was that a zippered compartment would be best. Done.Wise Walker would be great for hikers.I didn't realize it, but apparently lots of hikers fail to pack their poop bags out of the woods. Bad form. But with a Wise Walker it couldn't be easier to pack that poop. It's illegal to drop your dog s poop bag into someone else s garbage can. This is true in Seattle, even if the can is at the sidewalk. Who knew?! I m not saying I ever did that in the past... I m just saying I won t ever need to do it in the future. We haven t researched statutes in other cities but I m guessing there are a mess of them that are similar.Many cities prohibit throwing poop bags into municipal trash cans. Dog feces is a vector for a number of disease causing bacteria. You may be wondering (as I did) what s the big deal about contaminating a trash can with bacteria? The answer took me aback. Many of the city s homeless and destitute population are forced by circumstances to scavenge their meals from city trash cans. I have to wonder whether the dozens of Amazon.com employees walking their dogs on the streets of Seattle s South Lake Union neighborhood understand this. MOMMY, YOU ROCK! Our best test customer has definitely been the twins' mom, Kelly. Kelly and Lola are soul mates and Kelly is the primary dog walker (and runner) in the family. Kelly is also an analyst for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and so she has an incredible eye for details and spends her days worrying about how users experience technology products. Turns out those skills translate great to bags of poop. In addition to helping us improve the design in a thousand ways, Kelly also had the great idea of building a version with LED lights to improve visibility while walking Lola in the dark. This is especially an issue in Seattle, where the winter sun can rise as late as 8:00 am and can set by as early as about 4:20 pm. We have an idea about how to solve for darkness and we may introduce a stretch goal for that one. Here s my favorite thing about having Kelly use a Wise Walker every day (usually twice a day). On several occasions, we had to take her Wise Walker off of the leash to work on it or to show it to someone. Kelly noticed immediately, i.e., at the next walk. After using it for a couple of weeks she didn't want to give it up... big time. What happened to the Wise Walker?! When do I get it back?! Music to any entrepreneur s ears. ;-) We spent months iterating on designs that would satisfy the customers we talked to and our own vision of what a Wise Walker should be. Each new version revealed a new challenge. The picture below represents about half of all the prototypes we made. In the picture below, the reddish pouch on the left is the very first prototype. It's actually glued together. It was way too small, had no way to attach it to a leash, was made of cotton fabric that was way too lightweight and had an elastic drawstring that was way too clumsy to use with one hand. The print bag on the right was the second version. Getting closer... but still a little small... and way too hard to use. We eventually got it right and then started working on aesthetics. We experimented with color and trim. Two-tone solid colors were well received. The stylish print patterns got a love-it/hate-it response. We decided that trying to get a print that was solidly on the love-it side was just too much to take on for now. So we're going with solids. Out biggest design challenge came from talking to a woman walking her really big dog. The dog was clearly a feisty pup, tugging at its leash while we talked. The walker was worried that having a leash in one hand and a bag of poop in the other would make is really difficult to open the Wise Walker, get the dirty bag inside and then close it. She wanted the Wise Walker to open and close with one hand. That turned out to be pretty hard to do.We tried a BUNCH of things to build in one-hand operation. But it had to be super easy to use, it had to close the bag tightly to keep as much of the smell inside as possible and it could not be clunky . We iterated on many different closure configurations. We tried magnets, Velcro, plastic strip inserts, padding, bungee cord. Every one of the closure prototypes below is a different configuration. And these are just some of the tries. They all allowed the pouch to open and close... but not easily and not gracefully. We came up with one awesome idea using the principle of a Hoberman Sphere but it was impractical to produce without a non-trivial financial investment in prototyping and multi-medium injection molding. But we tried! Finally, after several months of tinkering with drawstrings, magnets, Velcro, zippers, Hoberman Spheres, strips of plastic and steel, we came up with the cord clutch (patent pending :-). It took some tweaking to get the dimensions just right but in the end it did everything we wanted. With the Cord Clutch, you can easily open and close the Wise Walker without ever taking your hand off the leash. While it slowed us down a bit, struggling to find a solution to the one-hand operation problem was a terrific opportunity for the girls to learn a little about engineering, prototyping, manufacturing and how different materials can be used in different ways to solve a problem. I m pretty sure the public school curriculum for 5th graders doesn't cover any of that. Thanks to this diversion, two 10-year-olds (at the time) got to learn how to use an industrial laser cutter and about the limitless possibilities for turning an idea into a real, physical thing. We have a fully functioning, highly evolved prototype that works really well. Before we spin up manufacturing, we need to make a small investment to have a professional pattern maker create that actual design template that the manufacturer will use to cut and assemble the pieces. We found a great local firm that specializes in helping small companies figure out all the ins and outs of building fabric products.Even though the cost to do so is about a magnitude more expensive, we want to have Wise Walkers manufactured locally and we've sourced a sewing shop right here in Seattle. The minimum order is 300 units but we d like to get to the more cost-effective order size of closer to 600 units. We have access to an industrial laser cutter to make all of the cord clutch components, the cord dongles and the fridge magnets. The twins love seeing the laser cutter work its magic and they ll get to participate on the design as well. We re in a similar place with fulfillment. Which vendor we use or whether we do it ourselves will depend on how many backers we get. We know that we can use Amazon to handle everything if we need to; and there are a slough of smaller fulfillment companies that have risen to the call of Kickstarter projects. We've set all the reward pricing with fulfillment costs in mind. For kicks, we filed a provisional patent on the cord clutch that we invented to allow the Wise Walker to be operated with one hand. We ll see what happens with that. For $65 and a small amount of paperwork, it was a good intellectual property lesson for all of us. As you peruse the reward levels, we encourage you consider....Wise Walkers make great gifts! In addition to the reward levels below, can also "add on" additional Wise Walkers for $18 each to any pledge level of $25 or greater. To add on extra Wise Walkers, just increase your pledge amount by $18 x the number of add-on Wise Walkers you want, up to a maximum of 10. (Full instructions for how to add on is included at the bottom of the Rewards section.) Wanna gift other pledge packages? Just multiply the package cost by the number you'd like to receive. Again, Kickstarter limits the number of Wise Walkers to 10 per backer. It makes a toddler giggle. It makes Sarah and Annalise laugh with delight. It makes dad smile big.

Our Story Most of our team used to work in a digital agency called Lemberg before forming Smart Atoms. We often had a hard time gathering all the most important product numbers like app s ranking, downloads and website stats. It simply took too long to gather them from different slow loading sites. We decided to solve this problem by creating a simple device that saves time, tracks key metrics autonomously and shows them in real-time for the whole team. We started building LaMetric almost a year ago. First, we created a concept what we intended to implement and built our first prototype. Hardware building blocks helped us build the MVP prototype and quickly proved the validity of the idea. Next, we made several paper prototypes and selected one that worked well for a desk, wall and shop-front. Nike+ FuelBand was a huge inspiration at the LaMetric concept stage. We wanted to build a screen that looked like was part of the black casing when the device was switched off, and when switched on clearly projected the screen across a large physical space with sharp bright square pixels. Most people doubted it was even possible, but this motivated us even more to bring it to life. We went through a lot of challenges and after a year of hard work built the perfect prototype. We even received encouragement from Marco Micheletti who worked on Nike+ FuelBand: Rewards Schedule Meet the Team Smart Atoms is a small company where every member is deeply involved with the product. The core thing we all share is a passion for productivity gadgets. We believe we can provide the best productivity gadgets for people and businesses to make a huge improvement in their daily activities.

126`|Four Versions Now Available: Une Bobine - For iPhone (24 inches / 60 cm) Une Bobine - Micro||USB (24 inches / 60 cm) Petite Bobine - For iPhone (12 inches / 30 cm) Petite Bobine - Micro||USB (12 inches / 30 cm) All reward levels have the choice of version(s). After the project is complete, we will send a survey for you to make your choice and provide your shipping address. Please read Update #8 and #9 for some great announcements! We have announced Une Bobine - Micro||USB for Android devices and Petite Bobine, a 12 inch version to complement the 24 inch Une Bobine. Every pledge level will have complete choice of which versions you want. Because project funding has hit our stretch goal of $90,000, all Bobines will include a 3 foot USB Extension Cable at no charge! Also, be sure to check out the video of our 'Kickathon' (sort of a hackathon for our Kickstarter project) on Update #9! This gives you a little behind the scenes peak at what goes into making products like these.Android Guys "Make your Android happy..."TUAW "...a stylish and handy iPhone cable..."9to5 Mac "The benefits of the Une Bobine (which is French for "A Coil") are obvious"Mashable "...the coil created by [FUSE]Chicken is pretty clever." (video review embedded below)Technabob "There are a million docks, stands, and cables...Une Bobine can replace them all"Lazytechguys.com "The Coolest Way To Charge Your iPhone!" ,"This is innovation at its best."Geeky Gadgets "...a new innovative flexible cable"macgasm.net "...a perfect example of what we love to see on Kickstarter."Buzzraid "...this is something you should add to your arsenal." What is Une Bobine?Une Bobine is a patent pending flexible and eclectic stand, sync, and charging cable for iPhone... and Android. We have designed the cable with a very specific metal gooseneck material that provides a fully flexible cable with enough strength to hold the weight of your phone. The cable can be flexed in different positions, coiled, wrapped around objects.... the only limit is your imagination. I still don't know what "Une Bobine" is...We went through dozens of product name ideas before we settled on Une Bobine. It is French for 'A Coil' and also has Bob's name in it, which made Bob happy.Who is Bob?Bob is a stick figure and he had a problem. He didn't like setting his iPhone on a table to charge and sync. Too many scratches and spilled drinks. He also didn't want to buy docks for everywhere he wanted a stand. So he had an idea... what if he could make an iPhone (and Android) cable accesory to charge and sync that was also flexible and strong enough to be a stand for his phone? This is how Une Bobine was created.Who is [Fuse]Chicken and why are you here?[Fuse]Chicken is the off-shoot of our design and engineering studio. We have been developing award winning products for clients around the world for over 25 years. We have created everything from toys to vacuum cleaners and everything in between. You can check out some of our products at www.fawcett.com. Until now, there has not been an avenue to pursue our own product ideas that we regularly have. So that's why we're turning to you on Kickstarter. Creating a new product is easy, manufacturing it isn't. We have our own rapid prototyping and CNC machines, but these are limited to low quantities.We need your help with the funding to be able produce the Une Bobine cable affordably in larger quantities. What can Une Bobine do? Look very cool on your desk or table Charge your phone by connecting to USB or a wall charger Sync with a computer by connecting to USB Adjust based on your mood Hold your phone in your car Place iPhone at eye level for FaceTime Hold your phone steady for photography and videography Did we mention that it looks very cool? Why does Bob need my pledge?It is surprisingly expensive to produce a cable. Each end of the connector requires mulitple injection molds to create the custom fitting in the housings that we need to securely attach to the flexible cable. The connector housings are also sonically welded together, which requires additional tools to produce each end. Your pledges will directly pay for these startup costs required to produce the cable. What are the rewards? There are 4 versions available. All reward levels will have the choice of which version (or versions if you pledge for more than 1) you will receive. This selection will be made after the project is complete. Une Bobine - For iPhone (24 inches/60 cm) Une Bobine - Micro||USB (24 inches/60 cm) Petite Bobine - For iPhone (12 inches/30 cm) Petite Bobine - Micro||USB (12 inches/30 cm) All rewards include free shipping worldwide (except for shipping people)$1 - Thank you very much. Every dollar helps.$10 - An 8x10 glossy print of any frame from Bob's video, product photo, or rendering from the project.$25 - Your very own Bobine.$40 - Bob's Early Bird Special! 2 Bobines$50 - 2 Bobines shipped to your door.$75 - 4 Bobinesand a 5 pack of stickers with the [FUSE]chicken beak logo.$100 - 6 Bobines and a signed 8x10 print of any frame from the Bob video.$250 - 15 Bobines. And we'll call you to personally thank you while you are eating the chocolates that Bob sends you.$500 - 33 Bobines...gifts for all of your friends. And Bob (or a look-alike) will pick you up from Cleveland Hopkins or Akron-Canton Airport and take you to a celebration in your honor where you will be toasted with Great Lakes Brewery's finest while dining on Cleveland's famous Polish sausages. (Airfare and accommodations not provided).$750 - In addition to the $500 reward above, we will also produce a new 'Bob' video based on your life.$1000 - In addition to the $750 reward above, the soundtrack for your video will be a song written just for you.$1350 - Retail Pack of 100 Bobines.$2500 - The $500 reward level plus lunch for 4 with our staff in Cleveland. You pick the cuisine, we'll pick the restaurant... don't worry, we have good taste.$5000 - The $500 reward level plus a half-day design workship and lunch with our staff. Design, Engineering, Marketing, and more. And we'll throw in a brand new 16GB iPhone 4S along with your Une Bobine Cables! This will be an unlocked GSM iPhone. How long until I will receive my reward?Because we have already been through many prototype tests and have reached a final design, we have a manufacturing partner finalized and are prepared to approve them to begin tooling on the day that we reach the funding goal. This is the step to start building the injection molds for the custom connector housings. This process will take approximately 30 days to complete. All of the electrical wiring, connectors, and the flexible coil are already sourced and ready for purchase. When it's all said and done, we expect parts to ship from the manufacturer within approximately 45 days from the day we reach the funding goal. We have even calculated for air freight because the parts are lightweight. So there should only be a few day turn-around from the time they ship to us until they are shipping to you. Use your imagination! Une Bobine can be positioned nearly every conceivable way.These are functional prototypes being used for testing, so the connector ends are not the finished product. Part of the funding goal is needed to create the injection molds for the connectors. We hope you enjoy watching the trailers for Une Bobine as much as we enjoyed making them! Mashable Review Une Bobine works for your car|
127`You Can't Fight Ebola in the Dark. As a WakaWaka backer you help courageous healthcare workers, first responders and families in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Over 90% of the population in these countries is not connected to the electricity grid. Once Ebola is gone, the WakaWaka lights will remain there to help people be more resilient for future crises and provide light to peoples homes. MTV News; THE HUFFINGTON POST; TreeHugger; USA TODAY; RYOT The WakaWaka Base is the next step in the evolution of portable solar power. An all-in-one compact kit for when the light goes out. The Base is intended for anyone that hates to be out of power, or loves to be on the move. The Base converts solar energy into battery power significantly faster than any other solar charge pack on the market today. It will charge any device connected via USB. The 5,000 or 10,000 mAh battery pack is enough for multiple smartphone charges or an entire week of light. The separate 7.5 or 10 watt super efficient solar panel ensures the Base will charge even on cloudy days. We love our two custom designed LED lights, one that connects to the battery pack and another with a small rechargeable battery. The Base comes with a compact and rugged pouch to store all this gear.WakaWaka is the maker of the award winning WakaWaka Power+, also known as the 'iPhone of solar power' and we are back on Kickstarter with a bigger, brighter, beautifully designed solution for anyone without access to electricity. The WakaWaka Base![Are you in the Netherlands? Click here!] Hurricanes in the fall, blizzards in the winter. When a storm hits and the power goes out, technology is there to keep us connected. These days, most of that technology operates on rechargeable batteries. So what happens when those batteries run out of charge? Whether you want to prepare for the next winter storm, whether you are a hiker or camper, or if you just want to be powered up as you travel around the world: the Base is here for you. A dependable, affordable solar solution for power and light, that will always be ready when its needed most. Use the power of the sun to stay connected ---- and become an #AgentofLight Its compact design makes it perfect for camping and hiking and will make it easily fit in your backpack or briefcase when traveling or commuting. A single day of sun is enough for an entire week of light ---- it's #AllAboutTheBase! We are becoming increasingly dependent on our mobile devices, but keeping them running is not easy. The Base aims to keep everyone connected no matter what the weather is like or how many plugs we need. Wherever you go, the Base will fit your adventure ---- #sharethesun Power outage? Blackout? Be prepared! -------- #sharethesun The WakaWaka Base is not only an essential during power outages and extreme weather in the US, for the 1.2 billion people in the world that live off-grid it is truly indispensable. The Base offers them enough light and electricity to light op their homes and allows them to charge multiple mobile phones. This enables communication, entrepreneurial activities, and socio-economic development in general. It is because of these 1.2 billion people that development of this WakaWaka Base is needed. We expect the suggested retail prices for the WakaWaka Base to be up to 40% (!) higher than your Kickstarter Reward tiers.By backing the project on Kickstarter we consider you an #AgentofLight. It's entirely up to you to do more and tweet, share, like and talk about WakaWaka - all of which creates more impact and literally helps us spread more light & power in the world. Using the latest in patented solar technology, developed by our partner and market leader Intivation, the WakaWaka Base is a true lifesaver for anyone without electricity. The technology in combination with truly brilliant design and a high efficiency solar panel ensures that The Base harvests more power from the sun than any other device on the market. Place your solar panel in direct sunlight for a day and the battery pack will be completely full, even if you live in New York or Seattle (where the intensity of the sun is far less than in Texas). The Base will also charge on cloudy days or in the winter, though that will take a little longer of course. The capacity of the battery on both models is large enough to fully power several smartphones, cameras or other USB powered gear. On top of this, you will have dozens of hours of excellent reading light from the two included LED lights. The Base will be more affordable and efficient than any other solar powered gear on the market today. The custom power management software ensures efficiency levels way beyond the reach of any competitors, while the great design makes the Base a perfect new member of the WakaWaka family! Before I started WakaWaka I developed and manufactured all sorts of products and advertising materials for companies such as Goodyear, P&G, Red Bull and others, so I know a thing or two about delivering high quality products on-time and at the best possible price. What's more: we delivered on our promises during the last two Kickstarter projects (here and here). That's why we are confident we can get you your WakaWaka Base at (or even before) the estimated delivery date! Here s our plan to achieve just that. January 2014: presentation of initial concepts during the International CES February - May 2014: market research & development May - August 2014: 3D development - pouch design September 2014: prototyping October 2014: KICKSTARTER! November - December 2014: mold making, purchasing components January 2015: pilot assembly February 2015: field testing and final adjustments March - April 2015: mass assembly May 2015: back-up time - SHIPMENT to BACKERS As you can see we are asking for your support to help us fund the tooling, final design costs and the remaining programming costs. Also it will help us in placing a first significant component order so we can reach the anticipated price level. Exploded view, a technical drawing of the Base10 And here's one of the LED lights WakaWaka got some great press over the last two years! WakaWaka develops, manufactures and markets high-tech low-cost portable solar powered products. Literally lifesavers both in the developing world and in developed markets. We are a 'Social Enterprise': a business with an impact driven mission. Over 1.2 billion people still have no access to electricity. This has a critical, large-scale effect on health, education, and economic development, especially in remote regions, disaster-struck, or war-torn areas. WakaWaka is in the business of saving lives. We believe that everyone, regardless of age, position, or predicament, has the ability to be an agent of light that can spark positive change. Sounds great doesn t it? But where did we start? How did we get here? With my partner Maurits Groen we founded WakaWaka with the sole purpose to ensure no one has to live in the dark any longer. We aim to achieve our goal of brightening the lives of 1.2 billion people before 2030. It may sound like an impossible goal, but we take this ambition very serious! In 2012 the first WakaWaka Lights were sent to our first Kickstarter Backers, check out the project here. This led to lighting up the lives of 800 school children in Tanzania. Less than a year later we introduced the WakaWaka Power, a solar powered phone charger & light. Right when we were ready to ship out to our 5,622 backers (check out the campaign here), the International Rescue Committee asked us whether we could send our first batch to Syrian refugees instead. You will understand we could not refuse this. I am proud to state that not a single backer complained about this. Today, the WakaWaka Power is the most valued non-food item in Syrian refugee camps. Thanks to that Kickstarter project we were also able to donate 12,000 WakaWaka Lights to Haitian families still living in shelters after the 2010 earthquake. That's 60,000 people no longer at risk from kerosene accidents which in the past led to lifelong mutilations. They save up to 20% of their expenses now, which does not need to be spent on expensive lighting fuels. We did not just give them away though. They were free, but not for nothing . Through some 13 different NGO s the WakaWakas were distributed and the recipients did all sorts of things in return. One village with a few hundred people cleaned up the streets for the very first time since the earthquake, another project planted 50,000 additional trees in exchange for their WakaWakas, so there s a WakaWaka forest growing in Haiti now! 12,000 WakaWakas went to the people of Haiti We keep track of every WakaWaka project that takes place off-the-grid on our Impact Map. I am so incredibly proud to be able to tell you we have well over 100 projects on the map now. Check it out and zoom in to see pictures, sometimes a video and more details on the impact of light on the lives of people around the world. The Impact Map: WakaWakas in developing countries I'm proud to introduce you to the some of these amazing #AgentsofLight that make up WakaWaka's growing team of staff, volunteers, interns, ambassadors and more. They are all dedicated to making the worlds most efficient solar powered products available to you and the 1.2 billion people who lack access to electricity. Help us bring the Base to market, and be one of the first proud owners of your own Power & Light First Aid Kit. And on top of that, your support helps people elsewhere in the world bring some light in their lives.I look forward to welcoming you (back) as a WakaWaka Kickstarter Backer and once you do, would like to thank you for also becoming an #AgentofLight THANK YOU! - Camille
128`|Our Kickstarter campaign has ended, but you can still order your own Kano at get.kano.me 1 MILLION!! THANK YOU!!! We're humbled, amazed, and committed to getting you your kits.Love,KanoFacebook || Twitter || Blog || Newsletter || Press || Say hi!(Want to help? These two clicks.)What s Kano?It s a computer you make yourself. It's simple, fun, and for everyone. And we need your help to make it happen.Here's something we made earlier... What can I do with it?Build... A computer, powered by Raspberry Pi Games like Pong, Snake Music and sounds HD video A speaker Towers of dynamite (...in Minecraft) A wireless server A custom case, with stickers, decals, or any printed design Most Debian Linux packages Pretty much anything else, because Kano is open source Who s it for?Kano is for anyone who wants to start creating with technology not just consuming it. It's a simple, fun, useful toolkit that you can use to start taking control of the world around you. Stretch Goals! Does it work?Kano emerged from a year of making computers with hundreds of kids, teachers, engineers, and artists. It's based on simple steps, physical computing, and play.In May, we created 200 early prototype kits and put them to the test. These are some of the people who tried them out: We also put some of the first 200 quietly up-for-sale. We wanted to learn by doing so that when it came time to make the kit and get it to your door, we wouldn't slip on a banana peel. (We also folded and packed the boxes in our apartment but that was just for fun.)What's inside? 1 Kano Books, illustrated and intuitive2 Kano OS and Levels on 8GB SD card3 DIY Speaker4 Raspberry Pi Model B5 Kano Keyboard Combo6 Custom case7 Card mods and stencils8 Stickers!9 Cables: HDMI*, Mini-USB10 Smart power plug (all region pins available)11 WiFi powerupThe Kano box is light, recyclable, repackable, and fits through 85% of urban mailboxes.Our favorite pledgesWe'd love to send you these rewards for supporting us, and there are even more at right. Why?99% of the world is designed by and for a tech-literate 1%. That's a problem, caused by: Closed devices Un-fun, top-down teaching The intimidation factor "geeks" vs "noobs" We often draw lines between things: art and science, code and design, STEM and the humanities. It makes digital literacy seem like brussels sprouts good for you, but hard to chew.It shouldn't be so hard to get started to make, play and experiment right out of the box. Start codingKano is a toolkit for anyone to start coding right away. We think you learn faster and better when you have control and freedom, like in a good videogame. Then, when you can bend the rules, things get kung fu.We love visual programming languages, especially Scratch, and wanted to hook them up to our favorite games. We came up with Kano Blocks, inspired by Google's Blockly and many hours of button-mashing. Connect blocks, output Python or Javascript, and see games change before your eyes, with live code updating. Make your own power-ups (two-player-mode, teleportation) then earn new ones. Huge Pong balls! Massive TNT towers! Code cheats, beat your friends.Our software combines Kano OS, a distribution of Debian Linux, with an interface that feels a bit like a console game. It runs six Kano Levels, software projects to make Pong, Snake, Minecraft, videos, and music with (inshallah) more to come. We're also loaded with Scratch, Codecademy, and "Hacking Fundamentals," an introduction to the world of the Linux shell, where you can join the free software movement worldwide (and go on spy missions).Simple steps, fantastic projects A year ago, we started with a book Lego-inspired, with a hint of our favorite manga. It's beautifully illustrated, instructional, with an achievement on every page. Our narrative (and name) is inspired by judo, and its creator, Kano Jigoro, a lifelong schoolteacher. In the Bronx or Beijing Kano is for everyone, so you can get our books in English, Spanish, Arabic, or Mandarin, and we're working on more languages. We deliver around the world with flat shipping costs. (See rewards at right.)We'd love to make you a $99 kit. But any pledge, any size, will go toward building the first computer made by and for the majority world, and end-to-end with open source software. Plug and play your own way We designed the Kano Kit to be a bit like our favorite boardgames growing up. It's vibrant, repackable, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Trick out your computer with stickers, decals, and your own designs. Or turn your computer into a mini-boombox with a D.I.Y. speaker, powered by an amp and the Pi's own GPIO pins. At school and at workMake Kano with your cousin, your Dad, your friends, or your dog. (Caution: do not put stickers on dog.) The kit is also great for schools, clubs, companies, and places where people ponder. It introduces computing and code in simple, tactile ways. Make hardware Hack games Share projects Onboard Scratch, Codecademy, Minecraft, and more Kano provides pedagogy, exercises, and tools for each key stage rubric in the new UK computing curriculum it's great for small groups (a semester project) or a take-home project. Get the projects and booksWe want to get our content and software into your hands as soon as we can. Support us with more than $9, and you'll be an Alpha hero you'll get early downloads of our books and software before our full release. $9 is a great pledge for anyone who has a Pi in their drawer and wants a cool way to get started (or teach it!).(Pledge more than $19, and we'll send you a t-shirt and stickers too!)Support computer kits for kidsKano Academy is our not-for-profit project. Through it, we're working to get low-cost, homebrew tech into the hands of smart young people woldwide. We need your help to keep it going. So far, we: Supported a scholarship for the 16-year-old inventor Kelvin Doe Freetown, Sierra Leon Supported the Caine's Arcade scholarship fund in Los Angeles, USA Sponsored the Learning Inventions team to workshop RPi robotics with fifty kids in Chiang Mai, Thailand Thirty gratis 'make a computer' workshops in Primary & Secondary Schools around the UK Committed to sponsor Kano kits to Martha Chumo, who's setting up a non-profit Dev School in Nairobi, Kenya Committed to donate 25 Kano kits to a new Innovation Lab in Freetown, Sierra Leon Sponsored the first Codemakers camp in Newcastle, UK Supported the Internet Archive to rebuild its fire-damaged scanning center in San Francisco, CA We want to get kits to those who have been excluded by economics or geography. Your pledge helps us make it possible. Pledge $229, get a kit for yourself, and give one to a kidIf you want a kit and you're feeling the holiday warmth, consider pledging on behalf of a smart kid who can't afford one. Just email us at rewards@kano.me to let us know you want to Give-One-Get-One, and we'll pledge the kit in your name, to whomever you want, after the campaign.Or, if you're feeling extra magnanimous, you can bump up to a Kano Lab pledge. You'll utterly transform a classroom, makespace, or institution with DIY computers and a hands-on introduction from us. (Details at right.) Oh and you get a Kano kit too which is sweet. Proudly PiWe love building on top of the Raspberry Pi board, and alongside the foundation and community. We're working open up the device's promise and power to everyone, and expand the ecosystem. We've designed brand new hardware and new hacks, and fixed dozens of known issues on the Pi they'll be open, so anyone can have at them and improve. Who are you people?We're a group of eight from six different countries. We've been around for a year now, making things we think are cool and shipping kits around the world. If we were a collective animal, it would be an octopus. pizza, beer, sidewalk, kano The ChallengeLast November, Alex, Yonatan, and Saul were trying to imagine what a computer for the next generation would look like. the aforementioned In the end, it came down to a challenge from Micah, a smart seven-year-old Saul's boychik, Alex's cousin.Micah wanted to make his own computer. But he had two rules: It had to be as simple and fun "as Lego." No one "teaches me" how to do it (zzz) Saul introduced Yonatan (who loves big challenges) to Alex (who likes beautiful things and good stories.)Then this happened (*whooosh flashback*) Hey Kickstarter! We ve spent the last year making, playing, and remaking the kit around the world with hundreds of young people tech educators musicians teachers gamers and the open-source community. The prototype works beautifully, we ve nailed suppliers and production, and we know we can make it at $99 so it can reach everyone. But we need your help to make it happenWe always knew that Kano was something we wanted to take directly to Kickstarter for a first run. It's a place that blurs those lines from earlier art, science, etc. and thus can make really audacious dreams come true. $100,000 will allow us to make up to 1000 more kits, keep the lights on, and work on new hardware expansions. With your help, we can continue to make "making" even more accessible and fun. A bonus!Kickstarter backers will be the first to get the new Kano Kit, and also to play with the new Kano OS as treasured Alpha testers. Plus, just for here, we're offering the Kano keyboard as a separate accessory wireless, independent mouse buttons, multitouch trackpad, awesome, orange. Just pledge more than $49 to get it. (Smaller than a Subway sandwich.) Everything is a prototypeWe want to keep designing projects, books, software levels, hardware, and experiences that you want then releasing and open-sourcing them as soon as they're working. It's messy but fun, and keeps us thinking. Early book sketch (boom!) Early case rapid prototype Kit starts to take shape It fits! Origin of species Production timeline Pledge promise Before Kickstarting, we wanted to ensure we could make good on our promises. So we started early we designed, developed and released 200 prototype kits (white box), and brought them to market. A year later, we ve sourced hundreds of components from dozens of suppliers, completed product assembly and order fulfillment ourselves (at first from Yonatan and Alex s apartment), and pulled off operations for our early adopters. If you join us with a pledge, we'll be able to go the last mile.It s been an adventure, and we re ready for larger volumes and new expansions. Our prototypes are up, running, and ready for next summer all we need is you.We hope we can get you started with Kano. But after that, it's your's to create.Thanks for reading,Alex Klein cofounder, writer, productYonatan Raz-Fridman cofounder, dreamer, making things happenSaul Klein cofounder, guru, dadAlejandro Simon chief software architect, couch surfer, raverTommy Seal artist, Swedish, 1st-gen b zier blenderTancredi Trugenberger front-end ninja, known deviantMathew Keegan community champion, Welsh wizardRadek Pazdera open-source, open-minded engineerNathan, Albert, Emma, Justine, Caroline, and Tom Kano fellowsFollow along! Our blog Facebook Twitter More info, for writers or curious folks Shoulders of giantsOn the shoutouts front, we're lucky to have built on top of Raspberry Pi, an amazing invention that has pushed the ball forward for computing education in innumerable wonderful ways. We've also built on top of the work of fine Pi hackers like Sam Aaron, Rich Wareham, and Alex Bradbury, and are pushing all our own code back into the community. We are also grateful for the Debian community, who have been huge assets as we try and create a new generation of open-source engineers and creators by making Linux fun. We're also grateful to Mojang for Minecraft and the Pi Edition. For the new hardware and packaging, we worked with the geniuses at MAP, industrial designers who make mindblowing classroom chairs and watering cans. They've pioneered a process called "informed creativity" and were founded by the guys who did the London Olympic Torch. We collaborated with Jon Marshall, Scott Barwick, and Jacky Chung, mould-breaking thinkers and artists.We started this a year ago with the thought that anyone should be able to make and change technology. We're just one group of people working in a broader movement to bring technological creativity to the masses (Codecademy, Code.org, Raspberry Pi). Hope you can be, like us, a small part.Some things we're glad people said "There's enormous value to platforms like Kano which add hardware, software, peripherals and documentation to the Pi to make it more appealing to users who are under-served by the standard offering.

130`Nuimo is an intuitive and natural way to interact with your connected devices. Nuimo works with any bluetooth device or application including Sonos and Philips Hue. Nuimo is a freely programmable controller and wireless so you can take it anywhere. Using the nuimo you can control all of your devices through our simple and seamless physical controller. Unlike the touch screen, nuimo has a number of touch based inputs that feel familiar and suit your needs. It incorporates capacitive touch, gesture recognition and a 360 degree analog ring that gives you precise control over everything from the volume of your music to switching off your lights. These inputs are easily mappable to the devices and applications you care about most. The LED matrix on the face of the device lets you change apps quickly or event display a timer app in the kitchen. We have built 30+ integrations for nuimo and with our community of developers, that number is growing rapidly. Don't see the integration you're looking for? We are working hard to prioritize building the most-suggested integrations from our community to give nuimo even greater versatility. Nuimo is built on an open platform. This means that developers will be able to create even more integration with your favorite apps and smart devices over time. For more on developing for nuimo check out our blog post. Nuimo can connect to anything that uses Bluetooth Low Energy, this includes your computer and most connected devices. No additional hardware is required to connect to your smart devices. Setup is simple through a smartphone or computer - simply load on the applications you want for nuimo and adjust the controls to suit your needs. Once setup is complete you can switch through apps you're using right on the face of the device. Nuimo is wireless so it can go with you. It was designed to be beautiful and not only act as a seamless interface for technology but fit seamlessly into your home among your most treasured objects. Our team has been working for over a year in prototyping, creating dozens of versions of the design. We are now ready to begin manufacturing right here in Germany. We have our suppliers, manufacturing partners and distributors waiting for the final order to go into production with support from our backers for highest quality materials and certifications. We care about local manufacturing because it allows us to make better products. Because of our proximity to our manufacturing partners we can prototype faster and deliver sooner. At our headquarters in Berlin, we are surrounded by some of the best engineering and manufacturing in the world - that is why we have decided to make our entire product 100% in Germany. We started our company as a group of friends looking to solve a problem that we had ourselves - how we could use the technology we loved in our homes, but get away from the screens of our computers and phones. We spent over a year thinking of ways we could put the user back at the center of the smart home and our first solution in a line of products is the nuimo. In December 2014 we ran a successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. Thanks to our 2,500+ backers we were able to develop the nuimo hardware much further and build the integrations they care about. We are so excited to release this improved version as a result of their input to both our early supporters at Indiegogo and our growing community of Kickstarter backers. We believe in the importance of top-quality craftsmanship, good design and great engineering. Because our team grew up immersed around tools and raw materials with parents that worked as carpenters, engineers and electricians - it only makes sense for us to have direct contact with the manufacturing process We believe that in 15 years we will look back on the 8+ hours a day that we look at screens and laugh. We want to reinvent the way we interact with technology in 2015 by taking our interfaces beyond the limits of the touch screen and into point where we engage multiple senses intuitively. We believe it is time we let technology work for us seamlessly and bring human interactions back into the foreground. Nuimo is just the first step toward better designing technology to fit into our lives. We will be expanding our product line to feature smart surfaces and interfaces that reenvision the way we use technology. Hardware is expensive to create with a small team and limited resources, which is why we need your help. In order to do final certifications for CE and FCC, as well as make sure we use only the highest quality materials we need the support of our backers. We are committed to keeping our backers up-to-date with our process of manufacturing through campaign updates and our blog. AccessoriesWall Mount - increase your existing pledge by 10 Many of you asked us to add a backplate as an extra perk so you can get multiple ones. You can now select them on the project page and you don't need to pay for extra shipping! hooray. You cannot make two pledges on Kickstarter. The way to do this is the same way you can get an additional Nuimo: You need to increase the amount of your existing pledge.For example: If you pledged 149 for one Nuimo incl. international shipping, click on your existing pledge to manage in. If you want to add one extra wall mount for example, change 149 to 159 . Stand from solid wood - increase your existing pledge by 15 We also added a stand made from a solid piece of wood as an accessory. You will be able to choose between a few different kinds like walnut and ash. It is the perfect companion if you want to use Nuimo on your work desk and get feedback at the right angle or use the timer app. You cannot make two pledges on Kickstarter. The way to do this is the same way you can get an additional Nuimo: You need to increase the amount of your existing pledge.For example: If you pledged 149 for one Nuimo incl. international shipping, click on your existing pledge to manage in. If you want to add one extra wall mount for example, change 149 to 164 .Without our incredible supporters we wouldn't be able to create products that we care about. We are so happy to be among a community that cares about an exciting future for design and manufacturing. We can't wait to grow that community to an international movement that brings together better interfaces, great hardware and seamless technology to the masses.
131`Meet Honey Soles: The best way to comfortably wear your shoes without socks The ProblemMost insoles have no arch support, no shock absorption and no moisture protection. So at the end of the day your feet hurt and your shoes stink. And this can be especially apparent when not wearing socks. That's why we developed a solution: Honey Soles Honey Soles: A natural solution to wearing your shoes without socks. Cork is a simple, natural material that's been around for thousands of years and is the key to preventing bacteria and fungus from building up in your shoes. Honey Soles are shaped to support your feet and feel like flip-flops inside your shoes, resulting in far greater comfort. Honey Soles protects and supports your feet from the impact of hard surfaces. These durable insoles offer incredible comfort and high-performance shock absorbing technology built to absorb and then disperse harmful vibrations. Cleverly designed with high quality, super-premium materials, Honey Soles gives you the strong support you need for your favorite adventures. Sustainability: Thoughtful Design, Materials & Process We're using environmentally friendly materials, including recycled rubber foam and sustainably harvested natural cork. We tracked the origins of our materials and found a manufacturer with integrity. Easy to Use - It's simple: Honey Soles are inserted into the shoe, replacing your current shoe insoles. Honey Soles fit best in most footwear with removable insoles. Cork wicks away moisture - Cork is an amazing material with a honeycomb cell structure. The cells of the cork are polyhedron and filled with air with an extremely strong and flexible membrane that's waterproof and airtight. Natural anti-bacterial and anti-fungal - Cork contains a waxy substance called suberin. This material is able to naturally repel the growth of fungus and bacteria and promote a healthy environment in your shoes. The cork layer wicks sweat away from the feet, while the open-cell structure of the foam layer absorbs any moisture and vapor inside the shoe, preventing bacterial buildup and odor. Shock Absorbing - Honey Soles are durable and shock absorbing. Our proprietary foams help to disperse harmful vibrations that are commonly experienced when walking on hard surfaces. Arch support - Honey Soles also have a supportive, contoured design. Which means they re engineered to help with things like posture, alignment and arch support. They help with over-pronation which is the leading cause of plantar fasciitis. Molds to your foot - Cork is a soft material that molds to the shape of your foot over time. We're also using a thin layer of memory foam that also helps to mold to the shape of your foot when worn. It feels like you're wearing flip-flops but inside your shoes. Washing Honey Soles A great part about Honey Soles is that they're naturally anti-bacterial and anti-fungal. The top cork layer wicks away sweat. But sometimes, they do get dirty. If you see your Honey Soles beginning to get dirty (especially if you like to walk around barefoot), simply remove them from your shoes and scrub them with a damp paper towel. You can also use a light application of hand soap to help in some cases. Honey Soles are very easy to clean. Our Story: The Making of Honey Soles We frequently wear our shoes without socks, and were getting frustrated with the excessive sweating, smelly feet and shoes that were literally falling apart. We researched the insole market, but the best insoles we could find were washable fabric inserts that absorb sweat like a sponge and required frequent washing. There were powders and sprays that eliminated odor, but required frequent use. Plus, none of these offered much in the way of arch support, so at the end of a day of walking around New York, our feet still ached. After understanding the problems first hand, we got to work and after months of testing different materials and prototyping designs, Honey Soles was born. Production Plan Sizing Chart Honey Soles are full-length insoles that span 1.5 sizes per pair to accommodate variations in industry shoe sizes. You may need to trim your insoles to fit your footwear. We will collect all sizing info at the conclusion of the campaign. See our USA sizing below. The Honey Soles Team We are a group of active people who love developing products. Along with our design partner, Impel Studio, we have over 20 years of experience creating consumer products for major companies. Our Supplier & Manufacturer We selected a top insole manufacturer. They're an American company that's been around for over 80 years. They invented the lathe used for modern shoe insoles. And they've made high-quality insoles for some of the world s top brands.
132`|Hi Kickstarter!! Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about Masontops and our newest product, the Pickle Pipe:The only one-piece, silicone, self-sealing, and waterless airlock designed specifically for wide-mouth mason jar fermentation.Like many of you out there, we love making healthy and delicious naturally fermented foods at home. But we've become frustrated at the lack of a mason jar fermentation airlock that will let you "set it and forget it", mind the cliche. We wanted to create something that eliminated the need for monitoring your jars everyday, and took care of a bunch of other inconveniences at the same time. The Pickle Pipe has made fermentation easier and more fun and we think you ll love using it in your own home. One-Piece || Food-Grade Silicone || Waterless The benefits of lacto-fermentation are truly too great to list. They range from promoting strong gut health to improved digestion and nutrient absorption, they have detoxifying powers, and even help reduce sugar cravings. No wonder fermented foods like sauerkraut, kimchi, and real pickles are referred to as the modern day Superfoods. Real pickles, kimchi, and sauerkraut. Lacto -fermentation is an anaerobic process (complete absence of oxygen) which encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria commonly known as probiotics. Exposure to oxygen can encourage the growth of surface scum and microbes and often leads to fermentation s nemesis: mold. Oxygen can also deprive your ferment of Vitamin C, and lead to soft or soggy food without any crunch as well. For these reasons it is critical that no oxygen is allowed to enter your fermenting environment. Once the process is underway, carbon dioxide is produced as the probiotics convert the natural sugars in your veggies into tasty amino acids (this is what you re seeing when your jar is bubbling). For these two reasons, an airlock becomes a critical component serving two very important functions: 1) Allowing carbon dioxide to escape the jar and avoid it from exploding and 2) Keeping oxygen out of the jar to prevent mold from spoiling your ferment. The Dos and Don'ts of Lacto-Fermentation Complicated, inconvenient, expensive. Simply put, current airlock solutions are over-complicated, inconvenient, expensive, and after all that, still require regular maintenance and monitoring. Say goodbye to multi-piece airlocks! A popular airlock solution uses a three-piece plastic water-filled airlock system whereby gas can escape one way but not re-enter. The problem is the airlock is made from brittle plastic which is prone to breaking and requires an additional three-piece lid mechanism to attach it securely to a mason jar. The end result is a clumsy six-piece contraption which is designed to relieve you of checking on your ferment to "burp" it. Ironically, it still must be monitored regularly to ensure the water has not evaporated, allowing oxygen into the ferment, and rendering the airlock useless. Even with these drawbacks, these water-based systems regularly sell for over $15 each! And that does not include the inevitable costs to replace a broken airlock from time to time. The Pickle Pipe solves these problems by eliminating the need for multiple components AND the use of water. The Pickle Pipe is a super simple one-piece waterless airlock that allows gas to escape as necessary without letting any contaminants back flow into the jar, and it screws into place using any standard mason jar band. FDA food-grade certified, waterless, dishwasher-safe, and more compact... the Pickle Pipe is the natural evolution of the mason jar airlock. Once screwed into place, you can forget about the Pickle Pipe for days, or even weeks. There is ZERO maintenance or monitoring required at all. We sent samples of the Pickle Pipe to some incredibly knowledgeable experts in the fermentation community. The feedback they provided helped shape this campaign, and also let us know that we had created something with real value that actually simplifies a key part of the fermentation process. Here's what they had to say: Jane Campbell, Fermenter's Kitchen Kate Payne, Hip Girl's Guide to Homemaking Sharon Peterson, Simply Canning Marisa McClellan, Food in Jars The Pickle Pipe relies on a tried and tested engineering component: the one-way valve. One-way valves are designed with the simple purpose of allowing the flow of a material (usually gas or liquid) in only one direction, and preventing it from flowing in the opposite direction. This is the exact objective of an airlock: to allow carbon dioxide gas to flow out of the jar, and prevent oxygen (or anything else) from flowing into the jar. How a One-Way Valve Works The Pickle Pipe is simply placed on top of a mason jar opening and then secured using any standard mason jar screw band (not included). The flexible nature of the silicone provides a perfectly airtight seal with the rim of the jar. The one-way valve works to release carbon dioxide as pressure builds up within the jar during the ferment, and it cannot open to allow oxygen or other contaminants in the other way. It's really as simple as that! We cannot do this without your support and so rewards should be just that: rewarding. Every reward will feature at least one Pickle Pipe, so backing this campaign is the fastest way to get your hands on one (or three, or six!). We're also bundling the Pickle Pipe with some complimentary Masontops fermenting tools, at up to 40% off standard pricing! Best of all, we are confident that we can deliver these rewards by December 25, in time for the gift giving season. We started masontops.com a year ago to help bring our first fermentation product to market: Pickle Pebbles. We saw a need for a product that was made with quality and consistency, and we delivered on those attributes. We are now the leading seller of glass fermentation weights in North America and the Pickle Pebbles have received a 94% approval rating across hundreds of reviews. This is only mentioned to demonstrate that we have a track record of delivering an excellent customer experience around a product that we manufacture. After the success of the Pebbles, we set our sights on another product that was being under-served in the market: The Pickle Packer - a vegetable tamper made from all natural Acacia wood and designed to work with regular and wide mouth mason jar ferments. The Pickle Packer has quickly become a hit with our customers, with a 98% approval across dozens of reviews in just a few short months since being introduced. We love mason jar fermentation. We understand it, and we have a proven track record of developing and manufacturing high-quality products. Existing products have been very well received. We've spent nearly a year, hundreds of hours, and thousands of dollars getting to this point. 3D design engineers, testing out various valve types and sizes, silicone shore hardness levels, and much more. The Pickle Pipe is finally designed, tested, and ready to go... but production molds for silicone products are quite expensive, and the minimum order quantity is rather high if we want to bring the price of the unit down to something affordable. This Kickstarter campaign has two purposes: (1) to gauge the interest in the Pickle Pipe, and (2) to help offset some of the initial expenses of bringing this product to market. We are so grateful for any assistance received that help accomplish either of these goals. Lots of ways! In addition to taking advantage of the great rewards being offered, you can share your feedback on the product with us and with your friends and families! Tell your favorite blogger about this campaign! Follow us on Facebook and Twitter! Every bit helps and we're so appreciative of your support. Developing this product and this Kickstarter took many many hours and was truly a collaborative effort. First and foremost, we have to thank our families for being so supportive of this project and the many late nights that it demanded. In no particular order, we'd like to extend a heartfelt thanks to the following people and organizations as well: Kickstarter Video - Jesse Cappe, Big Ticket Productions Social Media Wizardry - Andrew Simon Graphic Design - Kelly Lemme, Kelly Lemme Graphic Design Product Development Feedback - Sharon Peterson, Simply Canning || Sarah Nelson Miller, Killer Pickles || Marisa McClellan, Food in Jars || Jane Campbell, Fermenters Kitchen || Kate Payne, Hip Girl's Guide to Homemaking YOU! If you are reading this right now, THANK YOU! Thanks for your interest, for your time, for considering backing this project, and for hopefully telling your friends about this campaign. We can't do any of this without you! THANK YOU!|
133`If you ve been bitten by the roller derby bug, you already know what an incredible sport it is. Roller derby has its own culture, even its own language. It can be confusing and frustrating at every level, but especially for new skaters and fans!That s why I ve written this book. From the history of the sport to strategy to gear, Derby Life: Stories, Advice & Wisdom from the Roller Derby World will teach you what you need to know to get rolling. This book can t teach you how to skate, but it will get you up to speed on everything else!Veteran skaters will appreciate chapters on building mental toughness, dealing with derby drama, and getting back in the game after an injury. But I don t want this book to be just what I know. The book includes advice from derby greats. It will also include personal stories from derby people all over the world. Who am I?Good question! I m Em Dash (aka Margot Atwell). I ve been a skater with Gotham Girls Roller Derby for 7 years (and with Suburbia Roller Derby for six months before that). I skated with the WFTDA-champion Gotham All Stars for four seasons, and co-captained the Manhattan Mayhem to its first-ever home team championship victory in 2012. I ve run Gotham s PR and Finance committees, and laid more sport court than you can even imagine.I co-founded Derbylife.com in 2011 and have edited the site for three years. I ve written articles such as 8 Reasons You Shouldn t Play Roller Derby, 10 Things I Wish I Had Known Before Strapping on a Pair of Skates, and Dealing with Injuries. I ve also written for fiveonfive. My thoughts on roller derby have been featured in Ellen Parnevelas' book, The Roller Derby Athlete and Dr. Lynn F. Hellerstein's book, 50 Tips to Improve Your Sports Performance.When I don t have my skates on, I m a professional editor and writer. I ran an independent book publishing company for seven years. The first book I co-authored, The Insider s Guide to Book Publishing Success, came out in 2013. I have also written for The Huffington Post, Moviefone.com, Publishers Weekly and other print and online publications. Me chasing Suzy Hotrod, photograph by Sean Hale aka Hale Yeah. About the BookThe book will be a perfect-bound paperback, black and white, with both text and photos. It will be approximately 160 pages long and 5x8 inches. It will also be available as an ebook in MOBI, EPUB, and PDF formats. It will be published through Gutpunch Press.ContentsThings might change a bit in the final book, but this is what the table of contents looks like now! IntroductionChapter 1: The History of Roller DerbyChapter 2: TryoutsChapter 3: Fresh MeatChapter 4: Rules & StrategyChapter 5: Derby CultureChapter 6: Making Your League RunChapter 7: Diet & ExerciseChapter 8: InjuriesChapter 9: Levels of CompetitionChapter 10: How to ImproveChapter 11: With Age Comes WisdomChapter 12: Life After SkatingChapter 13: Derby StoriesAdditional ResourcesDerby DictionaryDerby Shops & BusinessesDerby World Calendar Some derby memorabilia I've collected over the years. BudgetI ve been creating budgets for books for a long time, so I m fairly confident about these numbers. That said, I ve heard horror stories of cost overruns, shipping problems, and other unexpected costs, so I ve included a little bit extra to cover those unforeseen costs. Pre-Production: $2600Includes copyediting, proofreading, typesetting, etc.Contents: $1100Includes licensing the cover and any other images in the book, and paying writers (other writers, not me) Printing & Shipping: $2200Includes printing and shipping 300 books, buying mailers and postage, etc.Just in case: $500I've budgeted a little extra in case of any cost overruns or changes in cost. For example, the cost of paper might change between now and when I go on-press. This makes sure I don't run into any problems fulfilling your rewards. Fees: $600The Kickstarter and payment processing fees will be 8-10% of the total raised. Total needed: $7000Stretch GoalDerby photographers are a wonderful part of our community, and I d love to include photographs in the book, but it will cost more than I have budgeted for in the original goal.If we hit $8000, I will include ~10-15 black & white roller derby photos in the book (approximately one per chapter). The additional $1000 will cover payments to photographers and the additional costs of printing and shipping the books, which will be around 160-176 pages instead of 144, as I had originally envisioned.Photographers will be paid $30 plus two copies of the book for their images. Photo by Sean Hale aka Hale Yeah ScheduleI am planning to go to press in April 2015 and ship rewards in June. It's easy for delays to crop up in a complicated project like making a book, but I have tried to build enough time into the schedule that I can weather a few delays. That said, any time you're relying on other people for critical parts of your projects, some things will be out of your hands. RewardsEveryone who backs this project at any level even a dollar will be thanked inside the book. I appreciate every single person who helps make this dream a reality! In addition to the book itself, I'm offering a few other rewards for the awesome people who help make this book happen. You can find them on the right side of this page. Feel free to send me a message if you have any questions about them! Limited-edition Derbylife mustache bottle opener. You know you want one! New Reward LevelsA few years ago, I tinkered with the idea of creating roller derby athlete cards. At the $200 level, you can get your very own custom derby cards for yourself or a loved one. (You'll also get the book in print and e-book format and a mustache bottle opener keychain.) Here are some sample designs: A book of Damon Runyon stories published in 1943. Only one is available! There are a few notes in the book but it's mostly clean, and in good condition considering its age. A Note on International BackersI absolutely love that derby is a worldwide phenomenon now. I think this book will be useful for derby lovers anywhere.That said, it is very expensive and challenging to ship overseas. For this reason, physical rewards that must be shipped have additional shipping costs. Backers who don't live in the US who select the $5 level will receive an e-postcard instead of a printed one. I hope you understand!Submission Guidelines I m now officially soliciting stories and photographs for Derby Life: Stories, Advice & Wisdom from the Derby World. Stories may be on any subject related to roller derby and should be between 500-2000 words. I prefer original work that hasn t been previously published, but if it has, please include information about where and when it was published, with a link if available. The writer must have the right to republish the story. Stories should be: Polished Original Emotionally resonant (funny, inspiring, sad, instructive you get the picture) Well-written, with a strong voice and sense of character And represent a range of experiences within the derby world.I hope to get stories from skaters, refs, NSOs, jeerleaders, mascots, support staff and volunteers of all stripes, derby widows and parents, juniors and seniors, and everyone else who makes this sport great. Writers who submit their work agree that it may be edited for style, length, and content. Writers will have the right to approve substantive edits (aka edits that don t significantly change the meaning of the work). Writers should send their stories to margot@gutpunchpress.com as a Word document or Google Document. There is a limit of 2 stories per person. Please include your name (derby and/or real) and the title of the piece in the body of the email, but only include the title, not your name, in the piece itself. I m going to strive to read these without bias! Now that we've reached the $8000 stretch goal, I will include black and white photos in the book as well! I'm looking for images that represent all different aspects of the sport, from action shots to portraits to photos of the crowd.Photographers should send their best images (no more than 5 per photographer) to margot@gutpunchpress.com. Photos will be licensed for the book on a non-exclusive basis, so the images may be used elsewhere as well. The submission deadline for stories and images is Monday, December 15th 2014 by midnight Eastern Time. All writers and photographers whose work has been chosen will be notified by January 31st, 2015 at the latest. Unfortunately I can t reply to every submission, as I suspect I might get a few. Writers whose stories are accepted for publication will be paid $30 and two copies of the finished printed book. The photographers whose images are chosen will be paid $30 plus two copies of the book for each accepted image. You can stay informed about the project by checking the backer updates or visiting the Gutpunch Press website or following Em Dash on Facebook or Twitter.Cover image by TJ Chase, used with permission.

Official Poster Hi Everyone,Last year I made a movie called, HITS, a low budget indie thing, with a bunch of my very talented friends. It stars Meredith Hagner, Matt Walsh, James Adomian, Jake Cherry, Derek Waters, Wyatt Cenac, David Koechner, Jessie Ennis, Amy Sedaris, Michael Cera, Amy Carlson and Jason Ritter. It's a dark independent comedy exploring the nature of fame in 21st Century YouTube America and we're releasing the film in February.We went to Sundance and while we received offers from some great distributors, their plans with the film were a little lackluster... so we decided to release it ourselves in an unusual way, as an experiment! We're launching it nationally in theaters and on BitTorrent as a Pay What You Want release! It will be on iTunes and other platforms but they will be more traditionally priced. We want you to decide how much tickets cost and you pay artists directly, not distributors or studios. This is an experiment, a first of its kind to see if we can make it more sustainable for both fans, and filmmakers. In order to do this in theaters as widely as possible we need your help to raise $100K. We are distributing ourselves and there are costs associated with making all of this happen. In addition to theater rental fees, we need to cover our marketing and publicity efforts. We ideally want to be in 50 markets, but the more money we raise the more theaters we can be in, so if we go over $100k, we'll just expand our plans, which would be great!Thanks for supporting the film and for being a part of our experiment and check out the trailer above! Oh and here are a few behind the scenes pictures from set.David

Rewards Stretch goals The more Beams we sell, the more awesome the version we ship to you will be! So help us: share, tweet, write a blog post etc, all help is appreciated! Project Development For over a year we have been working on Beam, which evolved from a wild idea to the product you see right now. The idea of Beam is born during a brainstorm session in March of 2014 with the thought what if we could make a projector that you could screw in your light socket . The next month we evolved this basic idea to a full product concept, by brainstorming, discussions and having meetings with various experts. Soon after, we formed the Beam-team and started working on the first prototype. When the technical details were defined we had all the information to start designing the look and feel of Beam. The design of the Beam that you see today was completed in November. In the meantime we started the development of the iOS and Android apps and the software on Beam itself. Timeline Meet the Beam-team! Beam is what happens when you put talented and passionate engineers and designers in one room. Our team has many years of experience designing connected devices, award winning user interfaces and innovative concepts. Thomas de Wolf MSc. and Guust Hilte MSc. are the teams inventors and can create any device they come up with. They've even created an aquarium on wheels that is steered by fish, go figure. Combined they have more than 20 years of product development and engineering experience. Marten de Jongh, Jeroen van Geel and Sophia Altekamp are the creative side of the team. Over the years they have worked on product and UX design for clients ranging from international airport Schiphol to Rijksmuseum Amsterdam. Don Molenaar is responsible for keeping the team flowing and to make sure we don t have too much fun with Beam, but he actually makes sure it s finished. With his years of experience working for Ubisoft, he is also the one with the sales and marketing knowledge to bring Beam into the retail shelves. Why we need you We need you! And no, we're not just saying it. We really need your help. Without your support we can t start the production of Beam and tie up the last loose ends in development. We have been working hard to create the best product possible and we want to release it to the world ASAP! We have finalized the prototype and now we need your help to get the production volumes up to get the prices down. It s that simple! Shout out to the developers! We created Beam with the vision to be a completely new product category, enabling users and developers to do things they were not able to do before. Because Beam is running Android you can use the existing IDE and tools to develop. Combine that with the fact that Beam is always connected and you have a great platform for development. No need to learn any new skills, but still the possibility to create truly new and innovative apps for a brand new platform. Although we believe in the uniqueness of Beam, we need your support to bring Beam to an even higher level. Therefore we ll make sure you have access to its various functions and controls when building apps for Beam itself. We will also make the connection to smartphones into an easy to use protocol so you can build your own control apps for iOS, Android or any other operating system and we ll even let you specify your own IF s and THEN s to make it react to specific devices, commands, notifications or events. We ll make all of these tools and manuals for developers available on our website in a later stadium. But don t wait for that moment! Let us know your awesome ideas on hacking@beamlabsinc.com and we ll let you know if we can find a way to enable you to make it!

We have spent the last couple months sending our socks to media and other influencers their response has been amazing, with dozens of great reviews! Read them all at lilytrotters.com/testimonial.html "All we want to do is make pretty compression socks."This is the phrase we have been repeating over and over for the past three years. When the idea came up for Lily Trotters back in 2012, we had no idea how hard it would be to make high-quality, designer athletic compression socks. Designed, sourced, manufactured, and quality-tested in the USA, no less. But every hurdle, every challenge, every conversation that ended in, "Sorry, we can't help you what you are asking for cannot be done," has been worth it.It has been quite a journey. We started by doing small sock-wearing studies with healthy women who had never worn compression socks to ascertain whether they felt benefits wearing a 15-20mmHg compression sock; the feedback was a unanimous yes! Next, we did extensive market research to analyze the compression sock market and see where Lily Trotters might fit in. We talked to everybody and anybody who had different perspectives along the way. We learned and are still learning so much. Arranging for the production of our socks was a saga in itself. We cold-called so many sock mills in the USA. This was really hard, since most are over-booked and not in a position to even talk to a start-up, let alone develop a new product. Still, we got super lucky and found the right mill. They saw our vision from the get-go and have worked with us to explore every possibility. We have sampled nearly 30 prototypes to date, and discovered how to "knit in" different colored yarns without compromising the compression in our socks.Finally, we conducted a comprehensive sock-wearing study of our prototypes on female volunteers. The findings were overwhelmingly positive. Each and every step of the way we have looked for validation that we were designing a product that would be both desirable to and functional for women.All we wanted to do was make pretty compression socks. Lily Trotters are all that and more. Lily Trotters is not providing any medical advice. Please consult your doctor before wearing compression socks.
139`Thanks for checking out my project. The GO! Hammock is an amazingly comfortable, lightweight and portable hammock that's built to last and is easy to set up! Stretch Goal Unlocked!The GO! Hammock with an Integrated Bug Net is now available. Details are at the bottom of this page. The GO! Hammock with the Integrated Bug Net Option. Details are at the bottom of this page. The Story Over the years, I've purchased many hammocks but I couldn't find one that was comfortable, so I set out to design the most comfortable hammock possible. After extensive research and building many prototypes, I came up with the GO! Hammock. I call it the GO! Hammock because it's designed to go anywhere with you and it can be set up in a snap. It's great for camping, hiking, picnics or just lounging in the backyard. If you back this project, you'll be among the first to experience the amazing comfort of this hammock and for a great price! What makes the GO! Hammock so comfortable? The GO! Hammock eliminates uncomfortable pressure points by distributing the user's body weight more evenly than traditional hammocks. Its generous size allows freedom to move around and makes it easy find lots of comfortable positions, even for side sleepers! In order to reduce the curved body position that's associated with hammocks, experts recommend lying at a diagonal angle. To enable users to lie even flatter, we made the GO! Hammock extra long and wide. With a length of 11 feet, it's much longer than most hammocks, this extra length helps flatten out the body position dramatically! At 70" wide, one can lie at an even greater angle in the hammock, flattening the body position even more! Optional Tree Straps and Cinch Buckles and Upgraded 1/8" Amsteel Spliced Rope LoopsVideo: How to set up the GO! Hammock with tree straps & cinch buckles. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Our top of the line tree straps with cinch buckles and upgraded 1/8" Amsteel Spliced Rope Loops make set up a breeze and they're easy to adjust. Simply tilt the buckle, pull the strap and your good to go. These heavy duty polyester straps won't stretch like nylon straps that are commonly used with hammocks. We sourced the highest grade materials and parts we could find to ensure maximum durability, reliability and ease of use. These 1" wide tree straps are also recommended to protect the cambium layer of trees while using your hammock. Each strap is 15' long, so it's easy to find a great place to set up your hammock. These tree straps work great in conjunction with the carabiners that ship with every GO! Hammock. Optional Tree Straps and Cinch Buckles and UPGRADED 1/8" Amsteel Rope Loops Cinch Buckle with UPGRADED 1/8" Amsteel Spliced Rope Loop and Tree Strap Optional Ridgeline To take the guess work out of setting up your hammock, I recommend using our optional ridgeline. In order for a hammock to be as comfortable as possible, it must be set up with a certain amount of sag. Our ridgeline sets the sag of the hammock for maximum comfort every time. The ridgeline is made from extremely strong Amsteel rope! It makes a great place to hang items while enjoying your hammock and it can be used to support a rainfly or tarp when hammock camping! Our ridgeline is recommended to maximize comfort and to simplify set up. The Ridgeline is the yellow rope seen in this image. It sets the sag of the hammock for maximum comfort every time! Fabric Tensioners The GO! Hammock is the first hammock in the world with our new Fabric Tensioners! Large hammocks can sometimes have annoying loose fabric on the sides. To eliminate this problem, I designed removable fabric tensioners that pull the loose fabric out of the way. The tensioners make folds in the fabric, giving the hammock its unique shape. Our exclusive fabric tensioners pull loose fabric out of the way and give the GO! Hammock its unique shape. Carabiners and Rope Loops Free Upgrade! Every GO! Hammock will now ship with upgraded Amsteel Spliced Rope Loops! Every GO Hammock ships with two carabiners and rope loops to use with the suspension system of your choice. The included carabiners can also be used in conjunction with our tree straps! Simply clip the carabiner through the sewn loop on the strap, wrap the strap around a post or tree and clip the carabiner onto the tree strap.Specifications:Go! Hammock: 17 oz. Size: 132" Length X 70" Width. Material: 70D Breathable Parachute Nylon. Weight limit: 400 pounds. Ridgeline: Weight 1/2 oz. Length: 110"Rope Loops and Carabiners (pair): Weight 6 oz. Tree straps with Cinch Buckles (pair): Weight 10.5 oz. Each strap is 15 feet long to make it easy to find a place to set up your hammock! The tree straps and cinch buckles and the GO! Hammock will all fit into the integrated stuff sack for maximum portability!Manufacturing Information:The prototypes seen here were made at the same factory that will be manufacturing the GO! Hammock. Everything is in place for us to begin production and we should have our backers orders shipped this summer. But we need your help to meet our minimum order requirements. So please, check out the rewards below and reserve your GO! Hammock today, because you deserve to be comfortable! Stretch Goal: Integrated Bug Net Option will be unlocked when funding reaches $30,000 The GO! Hammock with the Integrated Bug Net add-on Integrated Bug Net DetailsThe Integrated Bug Net add-on is now unlocked! New backers can select a reward for the Bug Net Version of the GO! Hammock. Existing backers can add $34.99 per hammock to their pledge to upgrade their rewards. Details: Please read the details before upgrading your GO! Hammock.The GO! Hammock with the integrated bug net is great for hammock camping and for using the hammock when mosquitoes, flies, gnats, or other insects are a problem. The bug net is designed to be supported by a ridgeline but can also be set up with the three loops that will be on the top of the net. The bug net is sewn onto the hammock and there is a long zipper on one side of the hammock to make it easy to get in and out of the hammock. The two way zipper has two zipper pulls on the inside and two on the outside to make it even easier to enter and exit the hammock. In order to keep the bug net out of the way of the user, the fabric tensioners on the bug net version are replaced with four aluminum stakes and four pieces of shock cord with hooks. These are used to tighten up the loose hammock fabric as well as the bug net. The stakes and shock cord are included with each upgrade! The GO! Hammock with the optional bug net, can be flipped over and used without the net on days that you don't need it! In order to do this, simply move the ridgeline from the inside of net to the outside of the net. It only takes a minute or two to make this change.The GO! Hammock with the Integrated Bug Net add-on allows the user to lay at the very edge of the hammock without having to worry about their head, feet or arms slipping out. The bug net also prevents sleeping bags and pillows etc. from falling out of the hammock. Because of this, we are making the Integrated Bug Net version 64" wide instead of 70" wide. This amounts to 3 inches on each side and the net more than makes up for the difference. Click image to see the Hands On Review
140`If you didn't get a chance to pre-order through Kickstarter, you can still order HERE! Please join us, and enjoy grit free press coffee. Thanks, from the whole Espro team!"A Sludge-Free French Press" - Florence Fabricant, New York Times"It definitely achieves its goal to bring a press-pot cup of coffee without the grit" - Dan Nosowitz, Popular Science"ESPRO Press, a French Press That Works." - Charlie Sorrel, Wired"A Cleaner, Tastier Cup of French Press Coffee in the Morning" - Leslie Horn, GizmodoGOOD MORNING!I love mornings. Up at 9, relaxing with a beautiful cup of aromatic coffee or tea. I usually sit on the porch with a croissant, thinking of life and love Yeah, that s not my typical morning either - let s start again with that early morning alarm.Twenty five minutes to get out the door and on the run. Between the clock, packed bags, packed trains, and interruptions, there s a lot in the way of that perfect morning cup. INTRODUCING THE ESPRO TRAVEL PRESS When life takes you on the road, you should be able to lean forward into that next adventure with a fantastic cup of coffee or tea in hand. That first cup of coffee or tea sets the tone for your entire day. For the most creative and productive day possible, it should be mind-blowing! So we created the definitive travel brewer for both coffee and tea, with three filter options. 1. A DOUBLE FILTER FOR GRIT-FREE COFFEE The Espro travel press uses the same double-filter mesh technology as the table top press, for aromatic, grit-free, and flavorful coffee. They filter coffee twice, with filters 9 and 12 times finer than a common French Press. And once pressed down, they block extraction so the last sip tastes like the first. We also introduce a brand new twist-lock system that makes the separation and assembly of the two micro-filters easier than ever. 2. AN ADDED PAPER FILTER FOR EVEN CLEANER COFFEE If you want even cleaner coffee, you can add a third paper filter between the two metal filters. This can highlight the fruitier and floral flavors in your coffee. 3. A NEW TEA FILTER JUST FOR TEA LOVERS Tea is important enough to get its own new filter design. The unique seal at the lower end of the filter sweeps loose leaf tea to the bottom, then folds upward and seals the tea leaves under the filter to stop extraction. You get the full flavors of loose leaf tea. BACK TO OUR HERO Coffee or tea made, you are ready to leave the house. The clock is still ticking, and there's a lot between you and nirvana. SIZED TO TRAVEL Books, papers, lunch, computer there isn t much space left in that bag. The Espro Travel Press is the perfect 12 oz size, and fits comfortably in your bag, cup holder, or bike bottle cage. NO SPILLS TO RUIN YOUR DAY We ve all had a mug leak in our bag Beyond the tragic loss of coffee, that wet report won t get the same respect. A double lid with silicone seals keeps your drink safe while you navigate the urban-jungle (or jungle-jungle, if life takes you off the beaten path). HARD TO LET GO OF We want you thinking about your next great idea, not how to hold your travel press as you wind your way through crowded subways, sidewalks and busses. So, we made your Travel Press easy to grip and hold onto, by gently curving the outer walls. EYE CATCHING, STATEMENT MAKING Your style says what you stand for. So we re starting with three colors Bright White, Blue Glass and Matte Black. We'll use the Kickstarter survey to let you choose your color after the campaign ends. COMFORTABLE TO DRINK FROM The ESPRO Travel Press sips like your favorite mug. The shape of the lid is comfortably molded to your lip, and the press rod neatly disappears out of the way for comfortable drinking. STAYS HOT FOR HOURS And when the moment finally arrives for that first sublime sip, only to be torn from your hands by someone who needs something, faint nor fret not! Your drink will still be hot when you are ready. The stainless steel vacuum insulated double walls keep the outside cool and the inside hot (or the other way around for iced tea and cold brew coffee). AND IT'S EASY TO CLEAN We expect the Espro Travel Press to get used a lot. We made the components dishwasher safe, so you can wake up to clean gear and repeat. But this time, it won t be the same old grind! REWARD YOURSELF WITH GREAT TASTE WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP For months we ve been designing, testing and refining the technology behind the ESPRO Travel Press. We have world-class production partners standing by and ready to go. Your support will assist with the cost of tooling, manufacturing and large-scale production. In order to bring the ESPRO Travel Press to life, we need your support! Please pledge and help us get the word out about this project to your busy caffeinated friends on Facebook and Twitter.

141`Good olive oil is like good wine. The specific variety of the fruit matters. The terroir the land and environment where it is grown matters. The production process matters. They all work in concert to create a unique taste and experience. Just as you enjoy exploring the depth and individuality of fine wine, we hope to introduce you to a similar experience with Auzoud extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).OUR STORYI was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud means olive in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud Waterfalls in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco Ouzoud s waters contribute to the region s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation. It has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping other family members and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma.After moving to the U.S. several years ago, I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region.THE HISTORY OF OLIVES IN THE OUZOUD REGIONAmazingly, the Ouzoud region has some of the oldest olive groves in the world. The ancient Romans were the first connoisseurs of Moroccan olive oil. They established the trading city of Volubilis in the 1st Century A.D. in northern Morocco, from which they could oversee their olive harvest. Old Olive Tree in Ouzoud Region Our olive oil is produced from the Picholine cultivar of olive. Picholines were originally grown in the south of France, but they have found a natural second home in Morocco s shared Mediterranean climate, where they are the dominant variety. The small farmers in Ouzoud have harvested it for generations.Olive oil made from the Picholine variety is recognized for its beautiful light golden color and fresh aroma. It will win you over with its soft, right, fruity and slightly peppery taste. WE OFFER THE HIGHEST QUALITY EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL You ve probably noticed that there are an overwhelming number of olive oils to choose from in the store, but did you know that a 2010 study by the University of California, Davis found that two-thirds of the biggest imported brands failed to meet the requirements to actually label their olive oil as extra virgin ? These companies often source their olive oil in massive quantities without knowing where it comes from, how it was grown or how it was processed. They often mix different varieties of olive oil to create a homogenous flavor that loses any sense of the individual profile and personality of the olives it was grown from. In some cases the oil is also diluted with cheap vegetable oils, like peanut or sunflower. Some producers also use stale olive oil, which may taste rancid. Not only are these practices fraudulent for consumers but they are also setting the tone for a general acceptance of low-quality oil and open the door to other major concerns, such as food allergies/sensitivities. In order to receive U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) classification as an extra virgin olive oil, the oil must be pressed mechanically without the use of any alteration methods. The acidity level must be 0.8 or less for every 100 grams. During the pressing stage, when the oil is squeezed from the olive fruit, the temperature must remain constant at 80 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). At Auzoud we make sure to meet these requirements during our process and with lab testing. The result is a fantastic olive oil with very low acidity and a full, rich flavor. We want to change the way people think about and experience extra virgin olive oil, a staple in so many of our diets. I have participated in every stage of the process from hand picking, pressing and bottling. Auzoud Extra Virgin Olive Oil PROUDLY PARTNERED WITH MOROCCO S SMALL FARMERS In addition to offering only the finest extra virgin olive oil, Auzoud is committed to working with low-income farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Auzoud is proud to partner with the Ben Youssef Farmers Cooperative, which was founded in 2010 to support better social conditions for women, youth and agricultural workers in the region. Partnering With Ben Youssef Cooperative The co-op helps empower local farmers obtain higher prices for their olives and a more sustainable livelihood for them and their families. All of the olives we use are sourced directly from this group. There are currently over a hundred co-op members and many more farmers are working with the organization to participate in the next harvest. One of the co-op s missions is to educate members about sustainable olive farming. To this end, Auzoud and the co-op are working together to obtain organic certification for all members. The money raised through this campaign will help Auzoud expand the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. MORE THAN JUST OLIVE OIL In addition to our oil, we sell batches of pitted green and black olives cured in olive oil. They are delicious! Oil Cured Picholine Black Olives Picholine Green Olives Pitted USE OF FUNDSCustomers and staff of the specialty stores and retailers where we sell our products say they love the unique taste and that we ve changed the way they experience and think about olives and olive oil.Auzoud has already partnered with several retail outlets, and is sold in a number of specialty and natural stores. Many more stores plan to carry Auzoud products but only if we can bring in a new shipment this fall. Demand is high but we have to be able to meet the minimum quantities at which many stores will only agree to deal with us. This will require a significant expansion from the product numbers we were able to bring to market in the past.Funds from this campaign will be used to purchase olives from the Ben Youssef Farmers Co-op. We will also be working with the co-op in its modern facility to press and bottle the oil for shipment to the U.S. Savings and proceeds from previous sales will be used to finance shipping costs. Any funds in excess of our goal will be used to prepare the olives for retail sale, which includes packaging in glass jars and labeling. As with our oil, we already have a waitlist for these. Additional funds will also be used to grow our online presence and online sales capabilities, so that we can continue to grow our company and the pool of farmers we work with.Of course, we will keep you informed about the progress of the project. SPREAD THE WORD Thank you for taking the time to learn about our project. We appreciate your interest and hope you will join us! If you know of anyone who loves quality food, sustainable and natural agricultural production, fair trade, or who might otherwise be interested in our work, please share this campaign with them. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
142`UPDATES: Please check the updates section for new info! THANKS EVERYONE FOR BEING SO AWESOME! ----------- My name is Jason Brubaker and I've been working on a graphic novel for almost 4 years in my free time. It's 136 pages for the first volume and who knows how many pages the second Volume will be. But for now I'm just trying to finish the first one and get it printed and sold. My vision has always been to make a nice sturdy hard cover book similar to the European comics. Something that can be compared and left next to a beautiful coffee table book. This whole thing started out as an animated project almost 10 years ago but that took way to long so I switched gears and decided to make it a book instead. I've been posting new pages every Monday on my blog and talking about the process and what I'm learning. I have about 6 months before I am finished with everything and I was hoping to print it overseas early 2011 when the first volume is complete. I've invested so much time into this project already that I can't even begin to calculate the total hours and it's kinda embarrassing. But my main concern is finding the funds to make this final step possible and finding the right audience to share it with. The 136 page, full color book is estimated to cost about $7,500 to print in China as well as some set up fees. Luckily in June I was awarded $5000 from the Xeric Foundation to help with the printing. Now I just need to collect the rest and anything over my $3000 goal will go towards making the books even better quality with a cloth bound hard-cover. Please visit my blog to see the entire first two chapters online. I post new pages every Monday and will continue to do so until the book is printed. http://remindblog.com/ For those of you interested in pledging over $39 to get your name in the acknowledgements, here is a link to a fake page in the book to demonstrate how and where it may go. http://www.remindblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Made-Possible-By.jpg Thanks for your support in making reMIND the best graphic novel it can be! - Jason

A nice shower after playing in the outdoors. Road Shower has enough pressure to get the job done, whether it is rinsing off your gear, or washing your hair. Clean that muddy gear before loading it up. Joel shows the 60' trajectory of the shower in jet setting. It gets the shampoo out of your hair like showering at home. Road Shower is rugged and has been used on 4x4 roads all over the US. It is simple to attach to most rack systems. Uses a rack mounting system that fits on Yakima, Thule, and other racks. Hardware is available for factory mounted racks and other rack types. There are no complex parts or gadgets. There are no electrical connections or propane involved. It is simple and works well.Road Shower can also be used on boats, Vanagons, and RV s, to provide a pressurized fresh water supply. It could be used at a remote cabin or camp as an inexpensive shower system.Features Uses any standard hand powered or CO2 bike pump. Uses a commercial radiator cap. This shows the retaining chain to prevent lost caps and the pressure release tube. The clear food grade hose and the aluminum tank are non toxic. Water level can be checked using the hose. T-Slot on the base allows mounting to most rack systems. The 7 setting spray nozzle has shower, jet, and mist settings as well as others. HistoryThe White Rim Trail in Utah s Canyon lands inspired the creation of Road Shower. It is a 140 mile hot dusty ride through the desert with a support vehicle. A shower sure feels good at the end of the day. However, I could not find a really good shower solution. We used the 5 gallon solar bag showers. They are inexpensive however, they do have their drawbacks. When you are driving on rough roads and they are stored in the back of your vehicle, they can slosh around and the cap can pop open and flood the back of your vehicle. They are made of soft vinyl, so if something falls on it, they can be punctured. They are not very easy to fill by yourself. They do not have very good pressure, so it is hard to rinse shampoo and conditioner out of your hair. And you need to find somewhere to hang them up. And they need a few hours of sunlight to get warm, which is not always possible when you arrive into camp late in the day.I set to work on solving the problem of creating a portable solar shower that uses no electricity or fuel, keeps the water on the rack, mount to most roof racks, be easy to fill up, have great pressure, and would be durable enough to last a lifetime.In 2009 I created the first Road Shower made from black ABS pipe and clear acrylic. I sold over 100 of these online and in retail outlets, and they were featured on Denver ABC news. These worked great, but they were hard to make and were fairly fragile. In 2011 I started experimenting with the first black aluminum prototypes. I was amazed to learn that the black aluminum heated water better than a clear solar tube. July 2012, I was granted US Patent 8,225,436, a utility patent which will help me protect my invention. I made 100 prototype units here in the US. I sold them all and people loved it. There were markets out there that I had not thought about, such as VW Van campers and sailboats.Retail outlets include Cracks and Racks in Aspen, Colorado as well as Gear Heads in Moab, Utah and GoWesty! in California. I looked for a way to mass produce them at a price that allows them to be sold in stores and still be profitable.I found a company called Shape Point, with headquarters in Utah which is a turnkey contract manufacturer. They have provided technical drawings, 3D modeling, assistance with design, engineering, and tooling. They are ready to manufacture Road Shower at a fair price.They are a reliable company and have made products for US customers for over 10 years, such as Jet Boil.The funds generated by my Kickstarter campaign will help pay for the tooling and meeting the minimum order quantities. The goal is to stock a finished product in the US at a shipping and fulfillment center in Denver.At this point I have: a patent 4 years of research and development honed by hundreds of hours of field testing. a prototype - 100 units that are in customer hands that have field tested them. So far people love them. a patent: US Patent 8,225,436 a domain: www.roadshower.com and a website. a trademark: Road Shower, LLC and a logo. several retail establishments, both online and traditional. an engineered and documented model with plans and CAD drawings. tooling developed. a company willing to manufacture them. a shipping facility in Denver which is centrally located in the US. Thank you for considering my project. Thank you Kickstarter.The T Shirt The Road Shower Logo on a Heavy Weight T Road Shower duffel bag.
144`Salem is a strategic card game of deception, built for 4-12 Players. It is most suited for players aged 12-93. Estimated game time is 25-35 minutes.GAME CONTENTS 1 Faux Book Container 111 Cards (15 Town Hall, 36 Tryal, 59 Playing, 1 Moderator Script) 1 Thirty-second Hourglass 1 Instruction Manual (Includes character biographies) 14 Circle Tokens WELCOME TO SALEM Who needs a game closet? Hide Salem on your bookshelf. The year is 1692, and it is a perilous time to live in the town of Salem, Massachusetts. One wrong step, or one misplaced accusation, and you could be the next witch to hang. "Salem" takes players into this perilous world and lets them re-live the tension, politics, and religious extremism that still has people talking about it 300 years later. The game is packaged in a faux book box that closes magnetically. The game, disguised as a worn out leather book, can easily hide on your bookshelf and masquerade as an antique. Players can play as prominent villagers from the old Salem town, and even read their bios in the instruction manual. The servant girl Mary Warren, pastor Samuel Parris, farmer John Proctor, storyteller Tituba, and beggar Sarah Good are some of the 12 characters featured in the game. Players, each acting as one of these unique characters, are given 3-5 Tryal cards (depending on the number of players). These Tryal cards reveal the true identity of each player, "Witch" or "Not a Witch." During gameplay, players gather cards that they use to accuse, or defend, other players. Deciding who to trust is key to survival, since you can never play a card on yourself. When you suspect someone to be a witch, you can begin accusing them with red accusation cards. When enough accusations have been placed on one of the players, the player who lays the final accusation chooses one of that player's Tryal cards to reveal. Once all "Witch" Tryal cards have been found, the villagers of Salem win.Players can also use green and blue cards such as "Alibi", "Stocks", "Matchmaker", "Asylum", and "Scapegoat" to help or hurt their allies or enemies.As players draw cards, they will eventually draw black cards that take immediate effect. One black card, "Night", forces all players to close their eyes while the Witches choose someone to eliminate and the Constable chooses someone to potentially save. The other black card, "Conspiracy," forces all players to take a face-down Tryal card from the player to their left. Killing witches quickly is essential, otherwise "Conspiracy" may soon have the whole town turned evil. Before long, accusations will be flying, and screams of "She's a WITCH!" will wake the neighbors. Will you be the hero who purges your town of witches, or will you be wrongly accused and hung for witchcraft? Or perhaps you will be a witch yourself, escape conviction, and bring Salem to the ground. THE GAMETOWN HALL CARDS All cards are top-quality 310gsm ivory core (premium) TRYAL CARDS (note the old spelling) PLAYING CARDS FAUX BOOK, HOURGLASS Faux Book is the game container and closes magnetically. TESTIMONIALS"Salem is an awesome group game and never gets old! Every game you assume different roles, and with the design of the game, things are constantly changing. Right when you think you know who the witches are, cards start getting passed around. The game Salem requires strategy and teamwork. You will really get to know your friends." -Jayson Jensen, Computer Guy"Salem has just the right amount of challenge so that it makes you think and strategize at how to win. Anyone who likes Mafia or games that involve moderately sized groups of people playing to the death will love this game! It's a great game to play with a good group of friends at a party or after dinner. Super fun and I totally recommend it!!" -Mary Nichols, Music Major"Your friends may become your enemies, your enemies may become your friends, but you can never be sure. Besides being a ton of fun to play, Salem is also a visually stunning game which sets it apart from other mystery games. I give it 5 stars. -Ben Nielsen, Social Media Guru"What an incredible game! I want to play it over and over again because each game presents new and exciting challenges. I love that it accommodates a small group of friends in addition to a big crowd which makes it perfect for any event. Once the game is over, you won't be able to stop talking about it." -Whitney Jensen, School Teacher Salem News:http://boardgaming.com/news/board-games-on-kickstarter-mar-26http://breacher18.com/killer-kickstarters-april-2015/http://initiativetabletop.com/2015/03/30/guest-post-kickstarter-preview-salem/https://www.facebook.com/SalemCardGame?ref=hlhttp://www.purplepawn.com/2015/04/crowdfunding-highlights-21/http://geekdad.com/2015/04/kickstarter-salem/http://trollitc.com/2015/04/kick-the-box-april-6th-2015-edition/http://www.sweetkickswithbricks.com/sweet-kicks-with-bricks-40-salemhttp://sameroomgaming.tumblr.com/post/116998449969/mafia-and-werewolf-re-imagined-in-salem http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/4/2/6/42672290425aa393/DTN393-DiceTowerNews-Episode393.mp3?c_id=8806282&expiration=1429421492&hwt=75727e7bc98d2cfe8e5ceffa8edfcc7e http://www.gameskinny.com/d4z5s/interview-with-designers-of-witch-trial-game-salem HOW TO PLAYRules Note: Full instructions and further clarifications are included in the Game's instruction manual. Of our hundreds of play-testers, each felt that the game was very easy to learn and each felt quite knowledgable of the rules after their first game.Moderator Note: Since we hit our $55K stretch goal, tokens have been added to each game, allowing for each game to be played with, or without a Moderator. GAMEPLAY DEMO Demo Note: Here we show 4 players, although up to 12 players can play. The demo does not show the use of tokens, since these were recently added as a stretch goal to better accommodate games without a Moderator. The tokens do not change gameplay. The video may not show this clearly, but at the beginning of the game the witches see who each other are when the Black Cat is played. They also see each other when they eliminate someone during the Night. A big part of the witches' advantage and deception comes from their extra knowledge about who everyone is. Tokens are used in the Night rounds to indicate who was killed, and who was saved. Strategies: The townspeople try to find the witches based on how people are acting (some people are good liars, some people are not!), how people are treating each other (since the witches have a secret alliance with each other), who people are playing cards on, whether witches themselves choose to confess after the Night, etc. Players can also analyze who was given the black cat and who was killed during the night and why. Also, since the first law of Salem says that you can never play a card on yourself, the only way to play the game is with allies. You can't win the game without trusting someone else. So a lot of the game is about you individually choosing who to place your trust in. There's also an element of the shell game involved- if I am a witch, would I put my witch card closest to my neighbor or near the middle? Did I move the Tryal card I got from Conspiracy to a new location in front of me or keep it in the same spot? Where should I put my Witch card so that my neighbor will be most likely to grab it during Conspiracy and join me as a witch? There's also an element of deck management. If everyone holds on to their cards, then when the deck runs out and the discard pile gets re-shuffled, Night and Conspiracy are going to happen again very soon, since the new deck is so small. It's in the townspeople's best interest to move quickly. It's in the witches' best interest to run through the deck and hold on to their cards.In Mafia/Werewolves the only data points you have are how people are acting. In Salem, you have more data points to go off of, since you can analyze how people are acting, and what cards they are playing on who. There's also a hint of logic with tracking the Tryal cards as they move around the circle. As a person's Tryal cards get revealed, and they keep coming up "Not a Witch", they develop a stronger and stronger alibi and become a less desirable target.Feel like we missed something?

One of the print-and-play cards you will receive, and the "Salem" buttons SALEM INSPIRATIONA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and great design.1. MechanicsGrowing up, I always loved playing "Mafia" at family reunions. It was the best kind of game- one that involved reading other people and hiding your own role from people who knew you very well. It was a challenge. Over time I grew frustrated over several aspects of the mafia game. There wasn't an official structure to the game, the game always required a moderator, someone always had to die right at the beginning, rounds could drag on forever, there was no way to partially accuse someone, etc. Salem aims to right these wrongs while still bringing forth a new game that captures the essence of the Mafia spirit. We have also enjoyed games such as "Bang", "Ticket to Ride", "Betrayal at House on the Hill", and "Werewolf" and have brought the best parts of each of these games into "Salem," while also adding completely new game mechanics. Every round of play-testing led to more and more tweaking, adding, and eliminating. We're very happy with the end result.2. ThemeHalloween has always been my favorite holiday. Something about the theatricality and intent to frighten just seems to heighten the stakes. We felt that the Salem Witch Trials captures this feeling perfectly. The old Protestant strictness, the spooky northeast, and a cast of characters that has been studied and been made larger than life through pop culture take this game beyond the mechanics and into the imagination. For whatever reason, "witch hunting" has become a common phrase in our everyday life, in news stories, and in politics. We felt that using the most famous example of witch hunting would naturally lend itself to a game like this one. The accusations, defenses, and instinct of self-preservation that can be found in the history of Salem seemed to be the perfect setting for our game.3. DesignThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and the graphic design from Holly will take you into the world of Salem, just as a piece of literature, music, or film would do. We used a lot of browns and textures, to make it feel like entering a world of dirt roads, wooden churches, and town squares. Note the crosshatch design patterns on the bonnet and dress. For the characters and card illustrations, Sarah employed a crosshatch method to give the characters dimension while still retaining the texture consistent with the game. In the graphic design, Holly used Old-Style fonts, reimagined the city seal of Salem, and used a 17th century quilting pattern across many of the card backgrounds.WHAT WILL THE KICKSTARTER FUNDS BE USED FOR?If we reach our goal, Holly and I will be able to pay for the manufacturing and shipping of the first edition of faux books, card decks, hourglasses, and instruction manuals. We already have our manufacturers (Yifeng Packaging, Panda Manufacturing) lined up and ready to go! We just need to raise the funds and say go!This first edition will turn one of our long-loved projects into something that our friends, families, and backers can enjoy.FOR ALL GAME RETAIL STORE OWNERS:We understand that demand for Salem in game stores will be very high right when the game first gets into the hands of our backers. If you would like to reserve the right to purchase Salem copies at a special retail rate, please send me a direct message that includes your store website, email, and how many copies you'd like me to hold for you.A couple of weeks before we ship games to our backers, I'll make sure that you still want the games you've reserved, take payment, and ship them to you soon after we've shipped the games to backers.

145`You may have noticed that we hit our goal. The response so far has been tremendous, we're extremely grateful, and it's true that $38,000 will pay for the songs we absolutely need to clear! However, to clear all the songs we'd like to clear, pay our music supervisor, and deliver a finished, legal film to a distributor like the great ones we're in talks with, we need significantly more money. While it's possible to self-distribute a cleared film for less money, we want to pursue the opportunity to work with a distributor who can get it to as WIDE an audience as possible. A few theaters across the country are already itching to play it! Any contribution beyond our goal brings us closer to getting Tchoupitoulas to be seen far and wide.The film has received some great press since its premiere at SXSW -- check some of it out: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, the Indiewire review, a full spread in the New Orleans Times-Picayune, and a Filmmaker Magazine article about the connection between "Beasts of the Southern Wild" & "Tchoupitoulas"THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT: Our new film is about 3 kids, New Orleans at night, and MUSIC -- but we need to raise money to clear the music in order to release the film! Besides some other work by us, we've chosen rewards that commemorate New Orleans, music, and our personal commitment to you if you help us out (e.g., we'll make a movie for you!). If we don't raise at least $38,000, the music in Tchoupitoulas will remain uncleared, the film unreleaseable, and we'll never be able to show it to everyone. The bottom line: WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SHOW YOU THIS MOVIE!WHO WE ARE: BILL and TURNER ROSS (directors/editors) - We made a documentary called 45365 about our hometown of Sidney, Ohio, that had a successful festival run in 2009 -- it won the Best Documentary Prize at South by Southwest, was one of Metacritic's best reviewed documentaries of 2010, and got shown on PBS' "Independent Lens." Roger Ebert said a lot of nice things about us. Three years later, we premiered again at South by Southwest with a film about our second hometown: New Orleans.MICHAEL GOTTWALD, DAN JANVEY, JOSH PENN (producers) - Founding fathers of the New Orleans based Court 13 film collective, our film Beasts of the Southern Wild just won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in January and will be released by Fox Searchlight this summer. JOE RUDGE is our music supervisor. Some films he's worked on: Margin Call, Blue Valentine, Brick, and more. WHAT'S THIS FILM ABOUT: Tchoupitoulas (pronounced "chop-ih-TOOL-us") follows three young brothers from the West Bank of New Orleans as they cross the river on the ferry and spend one night in the shining, peculiar pleasure island that is the French Quarter. Music propels them down the streets as we witness the bewildering sights through their eyes, spending time with everyone from burlesque dancers to oyster shuckers to street musicians. Our hero, 11 year-old William, a budding novice at the flute, is particularly drawn to the sounds that emanate from the bars, the clubs, and the sidewalks -- all places we roam in Tchoupitoulas. In short, it's a movie about the feel and sound of New Orleans at night -- all night -- through the eyes and ears of a kid.HOW YOU CAN HELP: Although our film is finished, we can't release it or show it beyond festivals, because the music rights must be cleared. Being able to pay for the songs in our film is crucial to Tchoupitoulas -- it simply would not be the movie that we envision without the music in it, just as life in New Orleans would not be the same without the music we hear here. We've determined that we could pay for the songs that are absolutely necessary to clear with $38,000. Though our last film 45365 received much praise at festivals and great press, ultimately it was very hard for people to see it -- largely because some of the music rights were never cleared. If we don't raise enough money to make it release-able, Tchoupitoulas will go the way of 45365: it will be near impossible to see. So, we have learned from our mistakes. Your generosity will enable us to show you and a wider audience our story in the way that it needs to be told. We'll be able to share accurately the musical culture of New Orleans as seen through the eyes of our young heroes, a perspective that we believe is important and that makes our film what it is.GIFTS FOR YOUR GENEROSITY!: We've come up with some prizes that reflect the focus on music and New Orleans in our film, some that involve the other stuff we've made over the years, and some that are just plain goofy, but we hope you like them. That's all. We've spent the last 2 and a half years completing this film. Please help us bring finally bring it to the world! We don't want to keep it for ourselves -- we want as many people to see it as possible. And this is the only way to make that happen!

In short, it's a movie about the feel and sound of New Orleans at night -- all night -- through the eyes and ears of a kid.HOW YOU CAN HELP: Although our film is finished, we can't release it or show it beyond festivals, because the music rights must be cleared. Being able to pay for the songs in our film is crucial to Tchoupitoulas -- it simply would not be the movie that we envision without the music in it, just as life in New Orleans would not be the same without the music we hear here. We've determined that we could pay for the songs that are absolutely necessary to clear with $38,000. Though our last film 45365 received much praise at festivals and great press, ultimately it was very hard for people to see it -- largely because some of the music rights were never cleared. If we don't raise enough money to make it release-able, Tchoupitoulas will go the way of 45365: it will be near impossible to see. So, we have learned from our mistakes. Your generosity will enable us to show you and a wider audience our story in the way that it needs to be told. We'll be able to share accurately the musical culture of New Orleans as seen through the eyes of our young heroes, a perspective that we believe is important and that makes our film what it is.GIFTS FOR YOUR GENEROSITY!: We've come up with some prizes that reflect the focus on music and New Orleans in our film, some that involve the other stuff we've made over the years, and some that are just plain goofy, but we hope you like them. That's all. We've spent the last 2 and a half years completing this film. Please help us bring finally bring it to the world! We don't want to keep it for ourselves -- we want as many people to see it as possible. And this is the only way to make that happen!
147`The Project Since 2007, photographer Richard Renaldi has worked on a series of photographs for which he asks complete strangers to physically interact while posing together for a portrait. Working on the street with a large format 8-by-10 view camera, Renaldi encounters his subjects in towns and cities all over the United States. Michael and Kimberly, 2011, New York, NY Renaldi s objective was to introduce an unpredictable variable into a traditional photographic formula, and to create spontaneous and fleeting relationships between complete strangers. The portraits are extremely difficult to make, involving complex negotiations with the participants that push them past comfort levels, into a physical intimacy normally reserved for loved ones or friends. Touching Strangers creates intimate and ephemeral relationships that exist only for the moment of the photograph. The images are beautiful and strange, crossing out of the zones of safe physical intimacy with strangers and into deep emotional landscapes never photographed before. Touching Strangers PhotobookIn Spring 2014, subject the success of this Kickstarter campaign, Aperture Foundation, the photography publisher based in New York, will publish Touching Strangers as a photobook, including new photographs from Renaldi s shoots this summer in Albuquerque, Chicago, New York City, and Southern California. As a non-profit foundation, Aperture relies on contributions from supporting individuals, companies, and foundations, and on sales of photographers limited-edition prints, to help make and publish photobooks works of art in their own right that inspire the reader and promote awareness of the photographer.Chris Boot, executive director of Aperture, says We think these great photographs have something positive to say about human connection . . . about a diverse society in which people have been taught not to touch each other but in which we can and do transcend the boundaries set around us. In seeking support to make the book possible, we want to ask you strangers to help us. This makes this Kickstarter campaign Aperture s first part of the work itself, a way for strangers to connect with each other. We hope this project touches you, and that you ll want to participate with us in bringing this book to the world. Thank you for your help making this book possible.

SolSource generates zero emissions while still grilling your steaks to perfection. For every SolSource you back, you offset the carbon footprint of four Americans.SolSource is designed to create net positive environmental impact over its lifetime. In 2012, we became a certified B Corp for our commitment to bringing measurable benefit to both people and the planet. We earned a top B Corp score because of our equitable and environmental practices in all aspects of our business operations, including manufacturing. How SolSource was bornOur core mission is to bring innovative energy solutions to people around the world. We began this quest working with rural Himalayan families to help find a solution to meet their energy needs. Five years and thirteen prototype generations later, we ve created a product that people love and significantly improves their quality of life. Right now, many families rely on SolSource for their daily cooking needs. SolSource saves them time and money, reduces their exposure to harmful stove pollution, and preserves the environment. Why Kickstarter?After building and testing many generations of SolSource prototypes with Himalayan families, interest flooded in from people around the world--particularly the US! That got our creative juices flowing - why not empower everyone to harness the sun for cooking?We ve invested years of our lives and our own money to create SolSource. Next, our challenge is the incredibly high cost of setting up a production line in China. We need to meet minimum order quantities with our awesome manufacturing partners and fill shipping containers to bring SolSource to the world.By backing our Kickstarter project you ll help us fund the first production run and enable people around the world to cook with the sun.

149`Our Kickstarter campaign has ended, but you can still order your own Piper Toolbox at build.withpiper.comWhat's Piper? It's a toolbox with a Minecraft adventure world that lets you build real electronics. It's simple, fun and for everyone. And we need your support to make it happen. We made this just for you: As Featured In: What Can I Do With It? Play an an awesome series of adventure maps in Minecraft Build a controller to navigate your robot in the game Assemble your own electronics to power-up mission control on the Raspberry Pi 2 Add switches to uncover secret doors and bridges Make an LED light proximity sensor for finding diamonds Use a buzzer piano to enter secret codes and find hidden rewards Add motion detectors when traversing underwater levels Switch on an LED flashlight to see at night Build and customize your own beautifully engraved box Decorate your Raspberry Pi 2 with a beautiful laser-etched acrylic case Create your own custom levels and modifications to share with your friends Pretty much anything else as Piper is end-to-end Open Source! Let's Build! Who is Piper for? Everyone! We ve spent over a year building and testing Piper to make it simple enough for anyone as young as 5 and as old as 75 to play! Regardless of your experience with Minecraft or physical engineering, we've created something that you can pick up and start playing right away! It's based on 3 principles: Involves physical, hands-on building Easy for anyone to get started (doesn t require an instruction manual**) Is as fun to play as other mobile and social games **Don't worry, we include an instruction manual with every kit for those who learn by reading. But for everyone else, you can dive right in and experiment and explore without flipping pages! We ve removed all the barriers between your imagination and what you make. We made Piper simple and intuitive so that nothing stands in the way of your creations. Build electronics easily with real-time feedback in the game and use what you build to play and beat Minecraft. No barriers. Just you and your creativity. So go ahead. Give it a shot. What will you create? What's the Word on the Street? Since last year we have been all over the world giving Piper to kids, teachers and game designers. This is what they think: What's inside? Laser cut and custom designed plywood case with an inbuilt 7'' LCD Display The newest and fastest Raspberry Pi 2! Beautiful laser-etched acrylic Raspberry Pi 2 case A powerbank that will power the screen and the Raspberry Pi for 5 hours of continuous game play Cables to connect the screen, Pi and powerbank together USB mouse with a cute retractable cable An 8GB SD card that holds your game progress and creations safe Electronics! (wires, buttons, lights, switches, sensors, tiny breadboards, and everything else you need to start building right away!) It even comes with a Piper Screwdriver! (And P.S. for the parents who've stepped on too many Lego pieces lying around on the floor, all the parts of Piper fit neatly into the box for transportation and storage!) Why Piper? We believe that when you use electronics straight out of the box, you don't really own it or understand it. Somebody else made it for you to consume, so we wanted Piper to be different. You first get to make and assemble the box, and connect the components (Raspberry Pi 2, Powerbank, LCD display) in order to start playing. By building it yourself, you make it your own. You decorate, color, and arrange the pieces however you want. You learn how to make a fully working computer and then you think: "What else could I make with this?" You are empowered to create. He didn't want to return our prototype :) How Does It All Work? Now for the fun part. Once you turn on the powerbank, and boot up the Pi, you realize that you are sitting at mission control in a modified Minecraft world. You are sending a robot to an unknown planet and on the way over his hardware is damaged. Now it's your job to build his hardware in real-life, to control him on the screen. You first build his controller to navigate. The schematic on the screen shows you how to build and gives you realtime feedback as you add your buttons and wires correctly. Making your first button! Yay! From there, it's up to you what you do. Want to mine resources hidden in the lava lake? Build a switch to turn on a hidden bridge to take you there! Searching for diamonds in the dark? Add a row of LED lights that serve as a proximity sensor. The closer to the diamond you get, the more lights light up! Diamonds! Here I come! With Piper we have already created more than 10 different hardware projects that you can build and create. Each one can give you power-ups, but the real question is: Can you beat the levels? What else can you build? Motion detectors to control the robot when his controls stop working underwater. Buzzer piano to enter a secret Morse code LED Flashlight to see at night System of switches to control lava flow Buttons to activate secret doors, passageways and tunnels And anything else that you invent! Replacing Screen-time with Build-time Today kids grow up surrounded by technology and they play and consume it with ease. But most don t know how to create with it. We think that by restricting kids to closed, black-box devices like tablets and phones, we deny them an opportunity to tinker and explore and develop their creativity. What's inside my iPhone dad? We wanted to show kids that they can create real things and give them a fun way to do it. Not just consume apps or share photos, but build real things in real life that actually mattered to them. And the best way to do this, was to harness their love of Minecraft. Any power-up you ever dreamt of having in the game, you can make by adding your own custom hardware. Finding diamonds in Minecraft is such a pain, but by building your own LED proximity sensor, the task becomes a lot simpler. By the end of the process, the kids we worked with became a lot more confident about themselves as creators and builders. It doesn't take a lot to inspire a child to believe in herself. And we want Piper to be the first step. To give today's kids a relevant and fun way to become the inventors of tomorrow. Sharing is CaringYou know what's even better than building something in Minecraft? Sharing what you built with your friends! Maybe you make one of the power-ups we give you, or tweak it and invent your own. We want you to share that with your friends, and let them try it out too. We are developing an interface that will allow you to easily share your Minecraft mods and custom worlds with others who have Piper so that you can build together. And we want you to invent things we didn t even think of, so we are using completely off-the-shelf hardware and electronics so that you can add literally any electronics components in existence to build your own cool power-ups! We Love Pi!Piper comes with the newly released Raspberry Pi 2, a revolutionary computer board that makes Piper possible. Moreover, we've built the Piper end-to-end open source, from the design of the box to the code of the game. The Raspberry Pi 2 can run Minecraft at the same frame-rate as your computer or iPhone, so there is no compromise in gameplay. The Pi also has easy to use GPIO pins which allow you to add your hardware and gadgets to alter Minecraft. Another really awesome part of using the Pi is the huge online community that has developed around it. We know that once Piper is released, there will be a community of tinkerers and creators who will make additional levels and add-ons for Piper. Let s create together! Iterate, Iterate, Iterate, Iterate, Iterate . Engineering and building electronics aren't simple. But once you master them, you can make anything! So we had to make sure that Piper was easy to play, but still let you build real things. "Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls." The attributes MIT's Mitchel Resnick described as crucial for a learning platform to have. So we tested with hundreds of kids, in dozens of schools all around the world to make sure that Piper was simple enough to play for anyone, but still allowed them to create complex gadgets. Every single aspect of our game has been tested and re-tested and we know that you will love it. Check out some of the many, many iterations we've gone through to make Piper the awesome toolbox it is now! From black box to open box. Rewards We Really LikeSo what do you get for supporting us? Check out these cool rewards that we would love to send you! There's also more awesome stuff on the right! Who are We? We're a team of hackers, builders and fun-lovers from around the world with expertise in STEM education, software development, curriculum and learning development, and hardware products who came together to make this all happen. A pretty attractive bunch, if I do say so myself. The BeginningsThe idea for Piper was born when Mark was playing games with kids in Ghana and thought that it would be cool to give them an inexpensive Raspberry Pi to hack and build with. He put some Pi's in a box with a screen, battery pack, and some games and sent these boxes to schools in Ghana, Kenya and India. After Mark met Shree, the winner of the first Google Global Science Fair and STEM advocate the two began thinking of how to use Piper as a global platform to give kids all over the world an opportunity to build real gadgets in a fun way. They got their friends to help them, and eventually joined Zynga.org and co.lab to work with the best minds in game design to make Piper into a really special product. To our dear Kickstarter backers, We've been working really hard for the past year to create something that is really different and really unique. We want to let kids build. And not only to hook together wires and create hardware with a Raspberry Pi, but to inspire them for the future, in which technology will only get more pervasive and more complex. We want kids to look at technology and be able to deconstruct it and reconstruct it in a way that can be better, more efficient, and really innovative to improve the world. We've created Piper to be a way to get started, with projects to teach the basics, and an interface to let kids make Piper even more awesome themselves. Our entire process has been based on talking to kids and parents and teachers, and then iterating repeatedly to arrive at the product you will love.We're coming to Kickstarter as the platform to make it happen, because we want you to be part of it. To make it with us. To share our dream of giving our generation a way to look up from the screen, and build something in real life.As a bonus...We are giving you the Kickstarter early bird price of $149, and putting your name on the back of the box! Having worked with suppliers and logistics specialists for the past months, we're excited to begin shipping out the first batches of Piper to makers all over the world and we have our kits and some other really awesome rewards set up and ready for fulfillment once we reach our goal. With our goal of $50,000, we'll be able to ship the Piper, keep the lights on and build out new levels to encourage kids all over the world to play, build and invent. Here's our production timeline, and since we've been working with suppliers for all our prototyping, we're on schedule to get your kits to you as per your orders! Piper is more than just a tool to get you started with physically building hardware. With Piper we want you to look at the technology around you in a different way - as something to create with rather than something to consume. We want you to develop a curiosity for tinkering and a creativity for creating. Because not only is it fun, but it's useful. With technology affecting every part of our lives, we think the future will be created by those who understand how it works. Join us and let's see what we can create together :) Piper <3,Mark Pavlyukovskyy, Shree Bose, William Brown, Ruslan Klyuev, Benjamin Benavides, Alex Stokes, Mary Shao, Mehdi Imani, Jared GriffinMade with love in San Francisco, USA. Follow Our JourneyFacebook: facebook.com/withpiperTwitter: twitter.com/withpiperWebsite: build.withpiper.comIf It Wasn't For You GuysWe would not personally have been able to create Piper without huge trailblazers ahead of us - from amazing people like Dale Dougherty kicking off the Maker Movement to Notch, for creating Minecraft and giving us a platform on which to build. It's really a humbling experience to create something built off the work of so many others, and for that we just want to give a few major shoutouts to: Esteban Sosnik, Cameron White, Maureen Fan and Ken Weber of Zynga, Zynga.org and co.lab, who shared our vision for making technology fun to learn and provided the support to make it happen Ken Willers and Lisa Anthony and all the students and parents at the School of the Madeleine for working with us to make Piper great! Jan Robertson and the Mount Diablo School District for working with us to bring Piper to dozens of their classrooms Matt Richardson and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, for creating a platform that has revolutionized how we build hardware. We're excited to be using the newest Raspberry Pi 2 in our kits! Ananya Birla for supporting Piper from the very beginning, piloting with us in India and being an awesome friend and mentor. Mojang Minecraft and the Pi Edition, which we have been able to work with and modify for Piper. And to the countless other teachers and parents who have taken the time out of their schedules to support us to create something amazing. And finally (drumroll please)... The over 400 kids we've had the chance to demo with in the past year. Educating kids about hardware and technology was the inspiration behind it all, and without the feedback of kids playing and testing our (sometimes super buggy) game, we could not have made Piper as amazing as it is today.
150`Update: We've reached our goal with a week to go! Let's dream bigger. More money means we can expand to more cities like St. Louis, Cleveland and Ferguson! Audience Award Best of Fest - RiverRun International Film Festival"An essential history, THE BLACK PANTHERS: VANGUARD OF THE REVOLUTION, is a vibrant, human, living and breathing chronicle of this pivotal movement that birthed a new revolutionary culture in America."- Sundance Institute"Unyielding in its exploration of Black Panther pride, confrontations and in-fighting, THE BLACK PANTHERS: VANGUARD OF THE REVOLUTION is a documentary that uses rare footage to chronicle the explosive movement in a most comprehensive way." - NBC News"A thrilling, comprehensive history of the revolutionary movement that transformed race and class in America, told through meticulous research and astonishing archival materials by MacArthur Genius Fellow and Emmy Award winner Stanley Nelson." Museum of Modern Art"The moment is right for a documentary history of the Panthers." - NY Times THE FILMTHE BLACK PANTHERS: VANGUARD OF THE REVOLUTION is the first feature length documentary to showcase the Black Panther Party, its significance to the broader Americans culture, its cultural and political awakening for black people, and the painful lessons wrought when a movement derails. Veteran documentarian Stanley Nelson (FREEDOM RIDERS, FREEDOM SUMMER, JONESTOWN: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF PEOPLES TEMPLE, THE MURDER OF EMMETT TILL) goes straight to the source, weaving a treasure of rare archival footage with the voices of the people who were there: police, FBI informants, journalists, white supporters and detractors, and Black Panthers who remained loyal to the party and those who left it.FROM DIRECTOR STANLEY NELSON Seven years ago, I set out to tell the story of the rise and fall of the Black Panther Party, a little known history that had never been told in its entirety. There is so much we think we know about the Party but I wanted to go beyond the oversimplified narrative of the Panthers as prone to violence and consumed with anger, and explore why so many people joined, what they accomplished, and why it fell apart. Producer Laurens Grant, former Black Panther Kathleen Cleaver with Director Stanley Nelson After years of hard work we were thrilled to premiere the film at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The film has gone on to sold-out screenings at festivals in Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis and Los Angeles. The response so far has been amazing, but we have bigger goals for the film. Kathleen Cleaver at the Sundance Film Festival I made this film with the hope that it would reach diverse audiences - folks who might not attend film festivals or watch PBS. That is why I am launching this Kickstarter campaign. My goal is to raise $50,000 to support a theatrical release of the film.In my 20 plus years of independent filmmaking, I've had great success in premiering eight films at the Sundance Film Festival, as well as numerous national PBS broadcasts. However, theatrical releases have always been a challenge, not only for me, but also for the majority of independent documentary filmmakers. Between the high costs of booking and promotion, and the bare bones budgets for indie films, getting a documentary into theaters is next to impossible. I believe this film will be even more powerful on the big screen, where people can share the experience with their peers, youth, elders and other community members who recall that turbulent time. So, in the spirit of the Black Panthers I am taking our cause to the people!WHY THE STORY OF THE BLACK PANTHERS NOW?"The issues that the Black Panther Party and other Black Power organizations dealt with in the 1960s continue to be the major issues confronting the black community today...The film is a must-see for all who are looking to better understand where we are at this historical moment and where we might go in the future." - Pan African Film Festival Black Lives Matter protest When people see the film they tell us the same thing, "This film could not have come at a better time."For us this Kickstarter campaign is about more than just getting into theaters, it's about sparking a national conversation on the conditions that created the Black Panther Party, conditions - like police violence, substandard education, joblessness - that continue to plague us today. As we witness the similarities between the injustices of yesterday and the tragedies of today, we feel a sense of urgency to share the story of the Black Panther Party. We are struck by the way today's movement around police brutality and accountability is being led by young people seeking change, just as it was with the Black Panther Party almost 50 years ago. We believe we can reach a greater number of young people from diverse communities by bringing the film to theaters across the country. Ultimately, we want to bring this vibrant chapter in American history to life so that we can all understand it, learn from it and make better decisions - personally and collectively.WHO IS ON BOARD?We are fortunate to have the support of an amazing group of organizations and individuals who believe the film needs a wide audience. HOW WE WILL USE THE FUNDSOur plan is to open theatrically in at least thirteen cities - New York, Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, Berkeley, Chicago, Boston, Portland, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Atlanta, Seattle and Washington D.C.

153`For media inquiries, please contact media@productofgir.com. Get social with the GIR team on Instagram and Twitter @productofgir and facebook.com/productofgir. We started GIR with a simple mission - to revolutionize the spatula.We knew that if we designed a product with carefully chosen materials, an uncompromising focus on quality, and a bit of attitude, we would have something worth sharing with the world. And we hit on something big.In 2012, we launched our first design - the Ultimate Spatula. It's a multipurpose kitchen tool made out of the best food-safe silicone in the world. Heat proof, dishwasher safe, and indestructible. Most importantly, its unibody design eliminates the problems found in most common spatulas:- joints and corners can trap food/oils and foster bacteria- wooden handles aren't heat-safe, and warp in the dishwasher- metal handles scratch nonstick surfaces and get hot to the touchThe Ultimate Spatula is finally getting some company. The design principles that made it so awesome are being extended to three new sizes: MINI, SKINNY, and PRO. We are so excited to introduce these new products to the Kickstarter community. The Mini, Skinny, and Pro sizes are every bit as "Ultimate" as our original spatula. PRO: Made for professional kitchens and serious home cooks. Ideal for large, deep mixing bowls or pots. Broad, strong blade. Balance and heft that will rival any professional foodservice utensil.length: 40cm (15.75in)blade width: 6.8cm (2.7in)weight: 169gmheat proof: -40 F to 464 Fsuggested uses: - scrape dough out of a KitchenAid stand mixer - gently fold a meringue - the wide blade can move a large volume of food - quickly transfer and spread chopped vegetables or batter on to a baking sheet - make caramel/candy in a high-walled pot (bonus: sticky residue is easy to clean off) ... SKINNY: Created to reach into tall, thin jars. Scrapes the deepest corners of any container. Leaves nothing wasted.length: 28cm (11.01in)blade width: 3.9cm (1.5in)weight: 42gmheat proof: -40 F to 464 Fsuggested uses:- scrape mayo out of a deep container- scoop the pesky "last bits" around the inner lip of a jar or bottom of a can- stir iced tea in a tall pitcher ... MINI: For smaller jobs - and even smaller hands!length: 21cm (8.27in)blade width: 3.6cm (1.4in)weight: 36gmheat proof: -40 F to 464 Fsuggested uses:- spread icing on a cupcake- scrape ingredients out of measuring cups, small mixers/bowls, coffee grinders, cans- kids need a spatula too! this one is the perfect size for the mini-me in your lifeLike the original Ultimate Spatula, the Pro, Skinny, and Mini are made from a single piece of solid, FDA-grade silicone. Each of them has been designed for optimal flexibility. And of course, they're heat resistant and dishwasher safe. ... Choose from a full lineup of colors to create a set that matches your kitchen, combine your favorites, or even color-code based on food types. ... We spent seven months testing and perfecting these models, using our experience with the Ultimate Spatula to inform high-level design and then giving each size a lot of individual treatment to create three excellent new products.Our spatulas are patent pending. Fingers crossed! ...A TOOL FOR EVERY NEED- PRO spatula measures up to the industry standard in width and length- SKINNY spatula's blade fits inside narrow containers, with a long handle so your hands stay out of the way- MINI spatula is great for small bowls. It's also the perfect size for kids in the kitchenHEAT PROOF AND KITCHEN SAFE - Leave it on the pan - it won't get hot. Designed with the cook's safety in mind. - The Pro, Ultimate, Skinny, and Mini are heat rated to 464 F for prolonged exposure - All sizes are spot-heat resistant to 525 F (but your food would burn at that temp anyway!)EASY TO CLEAN - Dishwasher safe - Stain resistant silicone won't discolor from time or continued use - Oils and food particles come off easily with soap and waterHYGIENIC - Inert, stainless, tasteless, odorless - Bacteria and fungi have no chance to grow or spread - Hypo-allergenicECO-FRIENDLY MANUFACTURING - Made from 100% non-toxic materials - Compliant with ISO 9001 : 2008 - BPA free - GIR Silicone = hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, silicon (and a dash of love)APPROVED MATERIALS - European Union Food Regulations approved - FDA approvedPATENT PENDING- According to our patent attorney, we invented something very coolWe're just about ready for manufacturing! We have working prototypes being tested in two Michelin-starred kitchens in NYC. The next three months will be spent making final adjustments to our designs, casting molds, creating packaging, and organizing our distribution plan. ... Our original Kickstarter campaign for the Ultimate Spatula was a huge success. We wouldn't be here without the incredible support of our backers and the Kickstarter community, so here's where we say THANKS AGAIN FOR MAKING US REAL.The Ultimate Spatula's Kickstarter page lives on - click here to see where it all began. And if you're skeptical of our ability to deliver by the holidays... check out the updates and comments :D ... .....................................

Just add the additional price when you checkout. Here's a video of what it does: Cloop was built to help keep busy people organized and keep cables and cords, such as, headphones and smartphone chargers, neat and tangle free. Messy cables have a knack for wrapping themselves into endless knots and taking up far too much space in drawers, and storage spaces. In fact the natural state of cables is "tangled". In the past, many solutions have responded to this problem with simple or impractical solutions. But, with today's new tech and the brainpower of creative engineers, your best solution to tangled cables and cords has arrived. Cloop is patent pending. Our Problem: Frustrating + Time Burner BEFORE CLOOP Our Solution: Space Saver + Time Saver AFTER CLOOP Eliminate Cord ClutterCloop can be used to create extra space wherever you store your LAN and USB cables. If you've ever had to go through untangling messy cables, Cloop is for you.Makes Traveling EasierIf you travel, Cloop keeps your cables available and ready for use with just a quick gesture, it prevents your cables from getting tangled with other items in your bag and helps reserve extra space to make room for all your traveling essentials.Organize Your Living AreaDeclutter your living space, and use Cloop to keep your smartphone chargers and cables off the floor, and out of reach of children and pets. Organize Your WorkspaceKeep your workspace organized and your extra cables, cords and wires fastened with Cloop to increase productivity. Prevent EntanglementThe average person has their mobile phone within reach 91% of the day. Put Cloop in place, and it becomes a companion device to make usability an transportation much more efficient. Utilize More Drawer SpaceIncrease your storage space with Cloop by keeping your cables organized. You'll never have to deal with a drawer full of tangled cables again. Exercise Without Headphone MalfunctionsCloop can attach to your clothes when running, jogging or working out to prevent headphones from falling to the ground while in motion.Easy Cable IdentificationMix and match using different Cloop colors so you can keep track of what your cables and cords are being used for. Tidy Up Family Charging StationsIf everyone in your family charges their smartphone or tablet in the same place, you'll find immense benefit in using Cloop to stay on top of extra chargers that aren't in use. Prevent Cable BreakageTying a cable around itself to keep it organized actually causes severe damage to the inside of the cable over a short period of time. Protect your cables, with Cloop. Save Yourself Tons of TimeYour time is precious...so imagine spending a full work week untangling your cables every 5 years. Thats the estimated amount of time you're currently spending fussing with messy cords, cables and chargers. You might even find some unconventional ways to use Cloop, like we have. Cloop's magnetic ends are strong, check it out: Cloop keeps your headphones from falling when running or working out. Keeps your pets safe from cord chewing. How to wrap USB cables using Cloop? Small Cloop fits around cables such as: Smartphone Charger Headphones & Earbuds (Compatible with popular brands such as, Beats by Dr.Dre, Bose, Shure, Sennheiser, Apple) iPad & Tablet Charger iPod Charger Kindle Charger Video Game Cords Large Cloop fits around cables such as: Guitar Cables Laptop Charger Hair Dryer, Curling Irons, Straightening Iron Cord HDMI Cable Camera Cables & Accessories LAN, USB, Ethernet Cables Cloop comes in three vibrant colors: Black, White and Red. Cloop is made from an elastic silicone material that provides it with the flexibility to fit around Small to Large sized cables, using our two different band sizes. We designed Cloop with a neodymium magnet located at both ends, which makes Cloop easy to snap shut and easy to open. We chose to enclose the magnetic ends for one simple reason, it protects them from the environment, and protects your belongings from getting scratched. In doing so, the magnets remain strong, without diminishing magnetic closure strength. Cloop won t slide off your cables and cords, in fact, it actually works as a companion device. Cloop stays attached to your cord, even when not in direct use, so you don t have to worry about losing it.We designed Cloop with optimal simplicity and without compromising function.Our patent-pending product gives Cloop the flexibility to wrap around small to large sized cables and the the strength to securely hold them together. A convenient slit to route and hold your cables neatly in place and readily available for use. The Cloop base increases workflow by keeping your cables within reach. The base can be attached to almost any flat surface such as a desk, wall or sidetable.The micro suction silicone surface creates a partial vacuum to keep the base from moving around when in use. You can also affix the base to a wall, or the side of a desk using a 3M Command strip (not included). The Cloop Base is a great solution if you charge your smartphone or any of your portable devices in the same spot everyday. Your cords won t fall to the ground, and they re always within easy reach when you need them. Cloop Base We started Cloop as an idea we had to remedy a common daily problem we encountered while traveling for business- messy cables that we had to sit and untangle before the plane even touched up off the ground. We realized we had a similar problem at home with cables and cords that took up far too much drawer space, chargers that we had to sidestep and constantly pick up off the floor. My Brother and I began drawing up the design elements for a product that would serve to resolve these problems. We sent out prototype after prototype until Cloop finally evolved into what it is today- the perfect solution for cable management. Cloop Design Schematics Cloop Early Prototypes 3D CAD Cloop Final Design REWARDS **ERROR in reward tier "Early Bird Special 9-pack for $27: Please only add $10 if you are wanting the add-on for the Base. It says, $12 (in the reward), but should only be $10. We'll be fixing this automatically for you guys when we fulfill the orders. EARLY BIRD SPECIAL ONLY.Cloop Vs. The AlternativeWe created this chart to show you the difference between Cloop, and other alternatives on the market. Cloop resists color transfer on cables, and your desktop. The magnet is covered, so it won't scratch the base, or your belongings...not to mention it keeps the magnets from popping out. The silicone is durable and resists snapping and tearing. We spent the last year perfecting Cloop's design, and it's far superior than anything you can buy anywhere else. See for yourself.
155`Roomful of Teeth is making its first album. This is an incredibly exciting moment in our story and we need help to bring it home. Since 2009, our ensemble of eight classically-based vocalists has been coached by masters of some of the most vivid and varied singing styles from around the world: Tuvan throat singing, Korean p'ansori singing, yodeling, and belting among others. And we have commissioned some of today's most vibrant composers Judd Greenstein, Merrill Garbus (of tUnE-yArDs), Caleb Burhans, Sarah Kirkland Snider, Rinde Eckert, William Brittelle to compose specifically for our mix of polyglot vocalists. The result is absolutely more than the sum of its parts. True to our original vision, we are reuniting the world's singing languages, creating music that is beautiful, smart and immediately engaging. And truly unique.Our album, titled simply "Roomful of Teeth," will be released by New Amsterdam Records and produced by Grammy-winning engineer and producer, Jesse Lewis of Soundmirror. The tracks were recorded this past November at the DiMenna Center in New York City and we hope to release the album in late September. Your support will help us cover the substantial production and post-production costs. From the expenses of the recording itself, to editing and mastering, to creating the artwork and manufacturing discs, we could not do this without help from our friends. Thanks so much for joining us in this project,Roomful of Teeth
156`Gravity X The easy to use car mount for all your mobile devices. Our Inspiration We have all used them... the car mounts that won't stick, or end up falling off while driving. It was from this experience that we created the Gravity X, a mount that is easy to set up and equally as easy to use. We have spent months fine tuning the design so that it universally fits and holds any phone or tablet. We invented an entirely new way to secure a phone using the weight of the phone which in turn applies a force to a silicone pad that firmly press against the face of the device. Unlike other mounts, the more pressure you apply, by pressing on the face, the better the grip. Now we need your help to bring Gravity X to the market. Final product will be manufactured out of high impact ABS plastic with a black satin finish with a texture, giving it a high quality high tech appearance. Thank you so much for your support! 2nd generation prototype How It Works1. Peel the 3M (safe for your car) tape from the mount. 2. Press onto a clean flat service on your dashboard. 2 nd generation prototype 3. Place your mobile device in. It's that simple. Many other uses including on your monitor Monitor Mount or mount on your headboard to use your alarm. bedside Rewards Press KitThank you for your interest in our project!The Gravity X press kit is available for download here.Gravity X Kickstarter video on Youtube.
157`BLINK(1), THE WORLD'S BEST INDICATOR LIGHTblink(1) is a super status light: it packs three dimensions of information (color, brightness and pattern) into a single tiny package that fits into any USB port on nearly every device. It makes it incredibly easy to connect any data source in the cloud or on your computer to a full-color RGB LED so you can know what's happening without checking any windows, going to any websites or typing any commands. We designed blink(1) in the spirit of our favorite old school Unix tools and we tried hard to make it simple, flexible, and robust. Do you want to know if a friend has signed onto Skype, but don't want a window popping up every time anyone has logged on? Do you want to be notified when a long download has finished? Do you want to know the snow conditions at Tahoe without checking every hour? Do you want to make a "busy" light for your office that glows red when your calendar says you're in a meeting? You can do all four at once: you can simultaneously control as many blink(1)s as you have USB ports. Have a 36-port USB hub? You can fill it with 36 blink(1)s, each of which is showing a different piece of information.BLINK(1) AT HOMEGet things done without having your face buried in the computer. If you're expecting a call and don't want to make noise, blink(1) can help. blink(1) in the home BLINK(1) ON THE GOMonitor network speed when you're in the cafe, so you know when the guy in the corner is seeding on BitTorrent and it's time to go elsewhere. blink(1) at a cafe BLINK(1) AT WORK Ever wanted a physical "Busy" indicator for your cubicle or office? With blink(1) and a USB extension cable, you can let your coworkers know when you really can't be interrupted.And because blink(1) is physically unobtrusive and requires no drivers to confound the OS, it makes a great multi-modal notification light for rack-mounted servers, alerting to task updates or system alerts. blink1 in a server farm CROSS PLATFORM EVERYWHEREblink(1) is a USB HID device, so no special drivers are needed, just applications. We provide apps for Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and embedded Linuxes like those used on BeagleBone and DD-WRT.On Windows, blink(1) can appear as a system service. On Mac OS X, it can be an Applescript target. On Linux it's a command-line tool. blink(1) works on most everything with a USB port WHAT'S WITH THE NAME?The name "blink(1)" is a play on the Unix help system ("man pages") where command's help pages are given by their name and section.OPEN SOURCENot only are the blink(1) tools and apps open source, so is its entire design. Feel free to hack it to make it do cool new things. blink(1) internals WHERE WE'RE ATblink(1) builds on our experience making thousands of BlinkMs, the popular Smart LEDs for Arduino.We wanted something that is as fun and as useful as BlinkM, but made for everyone, not just prototypers and designers. blink(1) enclosure concept 5 FAQQ. Wait, so this is just an RGB LED with a USB connector in a case? A. Yes, and it's the most flexible and easiest to use one, anywhere. To make it all work, there's also a tiny USB controller with our firmware to make it easy to program and control, but basically yes.Q. Which computers does blink(1) work with? A. Just about anything with a USB jack. Specifically, blink(1) is a USB HID-compliant device and the apps we release for it work on Mac OS X 10.6+, Windows XP+, Ubuntu/Debian-style Linux. The command-line tools can be compiled for just about any POSIX-compliant Unix-style platform including the Raspberry Pi, DD-WRT WiFi routers, BeagleBone, and some Android phones.Q. Can I hook it to my Twitter? A. Yep! Our BlinkATweet app lets you control blink(1) based on Twitter keyword search or Twitter user post.Q. What other web apps does blink(1) work with? A. At launch we plan on having blink(1) work with Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, and through IFTTT.com, Boxcar.io many other web services.Q. Can I control it from my phone? A. Yes! If your phone can load a web page it can control blink(1). The blink(1) service on your computer can appear as a password-protected web app for your phone or any other network enabled device. Q. Is blink(1) hackable? A. Definitely. We're working to make the enclosure openable so you can get at the circuit board. And if you know Arduino or AVR programming, you can modify how blink(1) functions. blink(1) can be programmed with the Arduino IDE. We will include example hacks of how to turn the blink(1) into a USB keyboard and mouse emulator.

159`[Check our update 6 about the final flash sale]As the number of smart devices in your daily life is increasing, organizing things has become time-consuming. We created MYNT to be the simple device that makes organizing personal items easy. Meet MYNT: the one button remote. The smart button will perform three preset and customizable actions distinguished by single click, double click, and triple click. The smartphone app allows user customization for each type of click. Featured on: At first glance, MYNT is similar to an oval shaped decoration. The simplistic look hides the advanced functionalities inside. At 1/8th of an inch thin, with a size of about 1.5 of an SD memory card, MYNT is able to control music players, alarm devices, computers, smartphones, and so much more. MYNT is versatile and nimble. The smart companion can inconspicuously be placed in wallets, attached to key chains, and anywhere that fits. All the functionalities will not be useful if the remote cannot be located easily. So we added the tracking function. MYNT is a smart tracker. The app interface provides intuitive control. The app's GPS map and close distance map accurately indicate the item location. MYNT also has an alarm speaker on board. The flat surface and small size allows MYNT to be easily attached to a wide range of items. MYNT s metal body is resistant to physical impacts and wear-tears. The replaceable battery has a lifespan of up to one year. It's the perfect companion gadget. With MYNT: Functions MYNT has perfected:Out-of-range alarm: notify through a smartphone or onboard beep if MYNT is out of range. To find the smartphone, press and hold the button, which signals the phone to generate an alarm. Distance will be indicated in the proximity map. The last location recorded: the app records the last location of MYNT. Present the location on the GPS map. Selfie Shutter: single click for taking picture. Multi-device music control: single click for play, double for skipping to the next song, triple for previous song. Presentation remote: play, backward, skip. Weather alarm: app sends beep alarm about weather. These are pre-setting. Users can customize their own functions for each type of click. Functions we are fine-tuning for MYNT:Control smart TV (on/off, next channel, and more), smart air conditioner (on/off, increase temperature, decrease temperature, and more), game devices, smart home appliances and many other devices that may need a remote control. Simply set the three types of actions through the app, MYNT will take care of the rest. Activity and fitness tracking. Design: We thought about the different scenarios: we want you to put MYNT in your wallet without noticing it, so we made it extremely thin. Now, MYNT is 1/8 inch thin, just the thickness of two coins. We want you to use MYNT as a keychain tag, so we created a hole and included a string in the package. We want you to attach it to your laptop or tablet, so we made the surface flat and included two double-sided stickers. Super Strong Material We want MYNT to be durable and also fashionable, so we used stainless steel and processed it with different process techniques: original stainless steel silver with metal wire drawing, sand blast black, gold and sky blue mirror surface. As thin as a sheet of bubble gum Small details: Replaceable battery + long battery + smart battery reminder MYNT currently supports iOS, Android, and Mac OS X. CrowdGPS: our global support community (compatible with communities of other tracker brands) Open building kit: everybody is welcome to contact us and use our free kit to build more applications based on the MYNT platform. Where we are now: The production type for MYNT is ready to be delivered this November. The app and MYNT currently work on most smartphones. We are testing the customization and compatibility of MYNT, and also fine-tuning the manufacturing process. Where we are headed:We are working on adding more connectivity as a smart remote, connecting to a wide range of devices such as automated home appliance, robot playmate, and new smart devices. We are also working on adding fitness and activity tracking.

161`Update on film licensing -- Producer/Directors updated Another update: Here is a segment that just aired on CBS Evening News: http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/... Update: Here is a wonderful segment that Chicago Tonight just aired: http://www.wttw.com/chicagotonight/video/A1hO97qcWo7ViDL_rWniVH2LakYxNa7J/ About the Film Finding Vivian Maier - a feature-length documentary Vivian Maier s photographs were seemingly destined for obscurity, lost among the clutter of the countless objects she d collected throughout her life. Instead these images have shocked the world of street photography and irrevocably changed the life of the man who brought them to the public eye. This film brings to life the improbable saga of John Maloof s discovery of Vivian Maier. Along with her documentary films, photographs, odd collections, and accounts from people who knew her, we take you on the journey of 'Finding Vivian Maier'. What started as a blog to show her work quickly became a viral sensation in the photography world. Photos destined for the trash heap now line gallery exhibitions, a forthcoming book, and this documentary film. The world wants to know more about Vivian. In order for us to deliver the quality documentary film that we would like to produce, we need funding. The Status The film is currently in the pre-production stage. We have recently joined forces with an award-winning Danish filmmaker, Lars Oxfeldt Mortensen (www.mortensenfilm.dk). Once we have pre-production financing, we can move forward with the promotional trailer to seek broadcaster financing for the feature-length film we are set out to create. Funds Monies raised will go to the pre-production budget for the film. This includes equipment, research, trips to conduct interviews and collect footage, editing costs for promotional trailer, and miscellaneous financing. All funds will be used for the film. If we exceed our pre-production budget goal, then all proceeds will go toward the production budget. With your funding help through Kickstarter, we'll be able to move forward on this film with less of a funding hurdle. It all started here: http://www.vivianmaier.com ...and here: http://www.flickr.com/groups/onthestreet/discuss/72157622552378986/ Press Vivian's work has received a considerable amount of press and much more are to come.

162`Introducing the laptop desk that's Lapdeck gets the weight and heat off your legs Be comfy and productive on the bed, couch, or in the car Great at home and while traveling Lapdeck fits in a standard padded envelope for easy storage Collapses and expands dozens of times and can easily support your laptop 4-12 months depending on use Stretch goal reached! The #1 question from our amazing backers is if Lapdeck will be available in colors other than white... so with our $10,000 stretch goal behind us, Lapdeck will also be made in an additional color or design you help choose! Here are a couple ideas so far. Or it could be a calendar, a map, the periodic table, or something you propose. More mock-up ideas here! Let us know what you think on our Facebook survey here, and since we've reached this stretch goal, you ll be able to mix and match with white and the graphic Lapdeck that gets selected. About Lapdeck One sheet of corrugated fiberboard (a heavy-grade cardboard) 66% recycled material: 33% post-consumer 12 ounces (340 grams) No adhesives Fits standard #7 padded envelope Expands to 21 x 12 x 8.5 inches (53 x 31 x 22cm) Collapses to 18 x 12 x 0.9 inches (46 x 31 x 2cm) How is Lapdeck so strong? Message from our lawyer: This was a test, please don't try it! Along with our structural designer Peter Stumpp, we designed Lapdeck to capture the strength of the grain of the corrugate (the fluting ) which enables it to support many times its own weight. After experimenting with different materials, we decided on 200 pound test corrugate, which balances durability with minimal weight and bulk. Dozens of digital and handmade prototypes later, we found a geometry similar to the architecture of a cantilever bridge, with a central truss aligned to the direction of the corrugated fluting to maximize rigidity and distribute weight. We're not talking pizza boxes.During our testing, Lapdeck had no problem supporting a 37-inch flat screen TV and a 25-pound laser printer, among many heavy items we subjected it to. Lapdeck is designed for use on soft surfaces like upholstery and bedding. As long as you're on a soft surface, Lapdeck s patent-pending geometry actually becomes more rigid supporting heavier, wider objects. Since Lapdeck is made from corrugated fiberboard and uses no adhesives, it s naturally less rigid than materials like wood and plastic, but is plenty sturdy for normal use with laptops up to 18 inches and 8 pounds. Lapdeck creates a portable workspace anywhere you need it Lapdeck is made to be personalized with your own notes, drawings, and creativity. To inspire you with the possibilities, we've partnered with 4 amazing artists to create the Lapdeck Art limited series of backer rewards, in addition to the pure white Lapdecks that are ready for your imagination.Each artist will paint, illustrate, print, or otherwise customize a standard Lapdeck in their style, to help inspire you when you're doing what you do best! Each Lapdeck from the Lapdeck Art limited series is available for $60 (before shipping.) Mandy Grotie Mandy's portfolio: http://www.findmeintheclouds.com/Mandy's philosophy: "My artistic vision is to explore the funky life of color and lines, exploding them together to create something magical and inspiring!"Here's a sample of what Mandy has in mind. The final design of each Art Lapdeck will be at the discretion of the artist. "Infamous" Tony HernandezTony's portfolio: http://talentedgraphicdesigner.comTony's philosophy: "I love to create.

Jeff Williamson Jeff's portfolio: http://www.jwilliamsondesign.com/Jeff's philosophy: "I see my work in the tradition of painting and collage while exploiting the power of the digital."Here's a sample of what Jeff has in mind. The final design of each Art Lapdeck will be at the discretion of the artist. Lapdeck tucks away How the Lapdeck came to be Trying to roadtrip with my laptop desk, the proverbial "eureka" hit me: if only this was made to travel! And so launched my mission to make the laptop desk portable: lightweight, packable, and easy to replace and recycle when necessary. Production Plan Developing Lapdeck is not my first rodeo. In 2004, I created the Cordster, a simple product available here. Tens of thousands have been distributed by Google, FedEx, and many other companies. Our manufacturing partner for Lapdeck is here in Atlanta, Georgia, and they specialize in production of corrugated pieces for commercial packaging and promotional use in store displays. I have spent time getting to know their operations and they know how to produce the Lapdeck with a high level of precision. Lapdeck production HQ The first step in producing the Lapdeck is the creation of the die that will cut and score the necessary shape from the raw corrugate. At the volumes our manufacturing partner works, it will take approximately 2 weeks to produce the tooling and make the first test run of Lapdecks. This will allow the quality of the die to be checked against the prototypes and ensure that the full run will match the specifications required. Dies After delivery of the initial run of Lapdecks, they will be shipped. We have identified the most suitable shipping materials and methods to deliver to you, our backers, your finished Lapdecks. Budget This Kickstarter will fund the tooling necessary to manufacture the Lapdeck, as well as the production and shipment of all backer rewards.Thank you for checking us out and please share with your friends!
163`THIS POWER IS YOURS!www.StowerEnergy.com The Candle Charger by Stower is the first indoor power plant for smartphones. Candle + water = essential USB power for your home during grid outages and blackouts. Stay charged...no matter what. Stay connected to family and friends Ultra dependable 2.5W USB power source - indoors or out Six hours per candle - fully charge 2 smartphones New, personal energy design for ready storage and use. TIME - "Should be in your emergency kit"News Ledge - "Its a damn cool product"FastCo - "A product everyone should have in their homes"When power outages hit, staying connected to family, friends, and emergency services is critical. But how to keep charged? Batteries store power - they don't make it We love solar, but it doesn't work at night or indoors Hand cranks produce minimal power. 10 hours cranking to charge a phone? That's tough. We want a reliable solution, and the Candle Charger is the first indoor generator designed to charge smartphones and keep them charged. The Candle Charger is a safe, miniature power plant that provides on-demand electricity when the grid can't. It's power we control, anywhere we need it - indoors or out, day or night, grid or no grid. We also offer the Candle Charger in the Stower P.O.P. Kit! P.O.P = Power Outage Prepared, a necessary update for home readiness. Thanks to our amazing community of Kickstarter supporters (thank you! thank you! thank you!), we raised enough money to manufacture and ship our first product, the FlameStower - its now for sale across the US and Canada.The FlameStower is portable power for campers. Based on your invaluable feedback and our own experiences we needed to design a power generator - elegant and simple - to work inside the home during blackouts. The Candle Charger fits in existing emergency kits and works readily with common household items: candles and water. With your help, we want to make the Candle Charger a reality and modernize power outage readiness. We hope you'll join us and Get Charged! The Candle Charger uses the heat energy from candles to generate electricity. Opening the handle Locking into place Bonus! The Candle Charger also quickly boils and sterilizes water, which you can reuse for cooking or making a cup of something nice before the grid returns. We recommend tea, Earl Grey, hot. $125 - P.O.P KIT - UNLOCKED!Most emergency kits are overkill and don't really offer much for the usual 2-3 day power outage. So we built a better one! For the first time ever, we're excited to introduce the P.O.P Kit by Stower! P.O.P = Power Outage Prepared! The P.O.P Kit includes everything needed to operate the Candle Charger and more: A Candle Charger and two 6-hr Stower Candles for charging and boiling water Matches and emergency water pouches Long-burning candles and USB rechargeable flashlights A kickass multitool and basic first aid kit to take care of business Some hand wipes to keep it clean. $99 - BUY ONE, GIVE ONE - UNLOCKED!Stower works with our partner Grupo EBIS in Guatemala to integrate Candle Charger technology into clean, efficient cookstoves - an amazing collaboration for personal, reliable energy! Guatemala Ecoestufas and Prototypes You reserve a Candle Charger at retail price and we'll install one of our chargers into a clean cookstove for a family in Guatemala. Buy one, give one - excited to try this exclusively on Kickstarter and see what we can do! Stower is a leader in personal energy product engineering and design. Together with our manufacturing partner PCH, Stower makes smart, reliable energy products that 1) do their job and 2) do it well.The Candle Charger contains two core pieces of technology: A thermoelectric module, also known as a Peltier cooler. Thermoelectric modules are semiconductor devices that convert temperature gradients one side hot, one side cold into electricity. The Candle Charger uses nontoxic bismuth telluride-based modules, which have been in mass production for over twenty years for scientific, refrigeration, and automotive industries. The Stower smart circuit that conditions the power coming from the module to match power requirements of the device being charged (e.g. a smartphone). What makes the Candle Charger an important innovation is the conversion efficiency of the device, its electrical strategy, and the focus on design for indoor use. Conversion EfficiencyThe Candle Charger achieves class-leading power output from thermoelectric modules, providing reliable USB power over extended periods of operation. We do this through a combination of patented mechanical engineering steps to optimize heat transfer from the candle, to the thermoelectric module, and into the water bath; careful control over thermal interfaces; and spatial design to position the Candle Charger relative to a heat source (i.e. the candle). Electrical Strategy To increase cost savings and overall efficiency, Stower directly charges your electronic devices rather than charge an intermediate battery. We re able to do this through circuitry developed exclusively for Stower products that continually monitors the power output from the thermoelectric generator, boosts the voltage to USB standard 5V, conditions the power from the generator so it matches internal charging requirements of smartphones, switching between bands of acceptable current levels and gradually dropping the voltage so phones don t drop the charge, provides LED indicator sequences to clearly show power availability a flashing light means power is available, while a stead light means steady power is achieved and the power output is iPhone ready. Designed for Indoor UseWe began with energy - the candle - and built the Candle Charger from there. The Candle Charger is sturdy enough to work outdoors, but its sleek design fits in with other beautiful shelf items for in-home storage and use. The handle and locking mechanism are necessary features that provide safe interface with the water bath during operation and collapsability for anywhere storage. The all-aluminum exterior - designed for maximum thermal efficiency - lends a modern look while being durable enough to take outdoors. Stower's been a hard charging machine since our birth in 2012. Stower is led by Andy, Adam, and Jason. Andy and Adam met in grad school studying materials science. Both were obsessed with solar technologies and nanomaterials - so much so that Adam once illicitly snuck Andy into the campus nanofab, bunny suits and all, to help characterize sapphire wafers. STOWER GONE WILD! We're also lucky enough to work with some extremely talented advisors and partners that help make Stower a reality, including: Dr. Reza Kassayan - our world-class electrical engineer and advisor PCH - our supply chain, design, and manufacturing partners REI, Sportsman's Warehouse, FGL Sports in Canada, and other retail partners who've helped deliver our first product nationwide. Stanford, StartX, and Orange Fab - hundreds of folks who support and help us make new energy innovations. Stower builds energy products for individuals, making it easier and more efficient to generate and control our own electricity. Smartphones are amazing machines: Stower chargers keep these powered when the grid can't. With this technology, Stower is also introducing electricity to thousands of homes in emerging markets. To learn more about our work with clean cookstoves, you can visit the Patents for Humanity website. Thank you for visiting our page and checking out what we're up to! Before you leave, please check out our website for more information on us and be sure to pass on the news that now we all have control of our power - with the Candle Charger!
164`If you love coffee as much as we do, we're sure you would LOVE to be able to drink it anytime anywhere. And so would we! That is why we decided to make a coffee mug that is practical and sustainable, but is also a fashion accessory and tells the primeval story of coffee. Its most obvious feature is definitely its shape which resembles the goat s horns but it also helps you drink that last sip of your coffee and makes you look good. We designed a special holder with leather touch which simply turns into a coffee mug stand so you can easily keep the Goat mug on your desk. Also, Goat mug comes with a set of two straps (short and longer part combine in to one), so you can simply attach it to your bag or just let it fall across your shoulder. This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around. Goat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE. Since you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand. Here's a look inside the Goat mug. It's shape makes it simple to clean. We designed a beautiful packaging to deliver your Goat mug in style. It can then become a perfect storage place for your fresh coffee beans. We would love for more coffee lovers to learn the real story about coffee as much as we would love all of them to be stylish and eco-friendly while drinking their coffee wherever and whenever. That is why we would appreciate you backing our project. Surely, there will be more coffees enjoyed if we manage to make our dream come true.Help us share our project among other coffee lover out there Awards structure: The first stretch goal is an idea we got from our backer Tamara. If we manage to raise $60,000 we will offer everyone a new colour option of the Goat mug - the PANTONE COLOUR OF THE YEAR: MARSALA. Let's do it! The second stretch goal is out! If we manage to raise $250,000 we will offer a new reward: HEMP EDITION Goat mug - for all those on the relaxed side of fashion. Never. Enough. Coffee. You asked for big, we're giving you GRANDE.

Design of the GOAT STORY Coffee mug was done by design studio Desnahemisfera in cooperation with MyEqua.
165`As seen on: The Devotec Fuel Micro Charger is the smallest emergency phone charger, and its 220 milliAmp hour battery is designed to give you around 20 - 30 minutes extra talk time, or up to a few hours more standby, depending on how you use your cell phone. Perfect for when you have had an unexpected delay, or haven't been able to fully charge your phone, and you need to make a few calls, send a work email or use your GPS and maps function to find your way home. Tiny Tiny Tiny So we believe the Fuel Micro charger is the world s smallest cell phone recharging device. And it is absolutely tiny- just 1.3 by 0.9 by half an inch. It s so small that it can sit easily on your keyring, you can slip it into the 5th pocket of your jeans, or even have it hanging off your cellphone. The Devotec Fuel Micro Charger is an emergency back-up solution. The Micro Charger is fully rechargeable, and is able to keep it s charge for at least 1 month before needing to be recharged (our calculations suggest closer to 3 months, so we are being conservative!)How it works Charge up the Fuel Micro Charger from the supplied cable or any AC micro-usb wall plug. Then just put it in your pocket, on your key chain or in your car and forget about it. To Use: Turn the power switch on and plug into your phone, the same as you would your charger. Your phone will start to recharge straight away. A more in depth look at the Fuel Micro Charger Component selection Part of our background is in component sourcing. So we spent months searching, testing and evaluating the smallest and most efficient parts to use with the Fuel Micro Charger. The components we use are the smallest available, and we have used innovative features like flexible-PCBs to shrink component size, in order to make Fuel as small as possible, and to have as big an internal battery as we can. However, the electronics are controlled by a premium Texas Instruments platform, and we have included multiple safety redundancy features, such as a PCM on the battery and a battery management IC on the PCB to make no compromises on the safety of Fuel.Housing The body of the product is pure die-cast aluminium. This means it is incredibly strong but still light weight. The aluminium is painted, lacquered and then baked to give a semi-gloss finish. The housing weighs around half an ounce.InternalBattery The majority of the space inside the Fuel Micro Charger is taken up by an energy dense lithium-ion rechargeable battery. This battery is a 5C battery, rated at 220 milliamp hours. This should provide around 20 30 minutes extra talk time, or a few hours on standby, although that is dependent on what type of phone you have and how you use it.Battery safety The battery itself has an integrated PCM and there is a battery management IC on the PCB, so the fuel micro charger is extra safe.PCB The PCB itself is very small, using specially sourced low-profile components, to keep its volume down to an absolute minimum, allowing us more space for a bigger battery inside the Fuel Micro Charger. However, it is a fully functioning PCB, with regulated inputs and outputs by micro-usb. We also use a Flex-PCB, which is even smaller than a regular PCB to connect the micro-usb male to the main board, again to cut down on internal space, so we have more room for the biggest battery we can use.LEDs and Switch On the outside of the case, you will see three LEDs. These help tell you if the Fuel is turned on, fully charged, or charging. Each of the Three LEDs will Light up to tell you different information about your Micro Charger: Red: Charging Green: Fully Charged Blue: Power On There is a switch to turn the Fuel Micro Charger on and off, keeping the battery from needlessly discharging when not in use. Micro-USB Micro-USB is the standard charging connector for all phones apart from iPhone. We use specially sourced low profile components, which while being the smallest on the market, are also certified to work with any existing micro-usb connector- so you can charge almost any Android, Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola, Nokia or Blackberry phone. Charging the Fuel The Devotec Fuel Micro Charger has a rechargeable battery inside that is recharged via its female micro-usb port at the bottom of the device. Any standard micro-usb cable, or AC wall charger you have at home can recharge the Fuel Micro Charger, and the battery inside is rated for a minimum of 500 cycles. Let us tell you about who we are We are a dedicated team of entrepreneurs and industry professionals, including Phd scientists, MIT graduates, Harvard MBAs and ex Motorola employees. We work at Devotec Industries, where our day jobs are to design Solar Powered Bluetooth speakers and Solar Chargers for cell phones. So we have plenty of experience in designing charging circuits, and have shipped thousands of units over the last 7 years. The Fuel Micro Charger is an off shoot of our main work, and we are looking to launch it into the market pretty soon after our Kickstarter funding ends, if we are successful.Where are we? As you can see from the working sample, we have all the PCB design finished, with schematics and Gerber files ready. The CAD drawings are fully finished and we are ready to go into production. Through our other work, we have strong links with manufacturing in China, and have agreed pricing and lead times with an aluminium molder for the housing tooling who we have previously worked with. We have been testing the samples for several months now, and it is based on a mature design we have been using for some time with our existing products. Why do we need Funding? Where we need you to come in is to help us raise funds to put the Devotec Fuel Micro Charger into production. We need to buy the aluminium toolings, pay for the first production run, and pay for all the certification like CE, RoHS, and WEEE. Action! We think this is an awesome product and we are really excited about it, but we need your help to turn it into a reality. We have lots of exciting discounts and offers available to our early backers, and we hope that we can turn this product into a something special that you are going to love!
166`NEW STRETCH GOAL! Light is important - it defines a space, creates atmosphere, & effects how we feel. For something so important, shouldn't it do more than just turn on and off? We're creating a series of intelligent and tunable LED lights that are bright, simple, and open a world of amazing lighting experiences. You're going to like the way your light looks, we guarantee it. You know that feeling of getting into bed and then realizing you left the light on in the hallway? Or flipping through a bank of light switches and dimmers to try and create the perfect mood? Or stubbing your toe as you get out of bed to go to the bathroom? Yea, we hate that too so we're making ilumi to create better lighting experiences. ilumi works like a regular light bulb in the sense that it just screws into a normal socket. The kicker is that through the ilumi app, you can conveniently control your lights remotely, tune the color & brightness, or even program your lights to create lighting magic. The key for ilumi is that it's bright, simple, and is all about experience. We need your support to finish up development and manufacturing, & in turn we want you to be some of the first to enjoy it! What are you going to do in your living room over the next 20 years? Visualize all the festive holidays, birthday parties, or sporting events? Picture that morning cup of coffee on the couch, curling up with a movie at night, or having friends over for a party. What type of lighting did you picture in each of those scenarios? The truth is that different scenarios require different types of lighting. With ilumi, you have complete flexibility to adjust your lighting to any variation of both bright white lights as well as rich colors, at any brightness, any time. Plus, our patent-pending HyperLux LED technology makes ilumi the brightest and most efficient multicolor light bulbs in its class. Essentially, we pack more brightness per watt than any other multicolor light. That s important, because it s nice to have flexibility, but we also wanted to ensure ilumi would give you the functionality for everyday as well. We love lighting control systems but hate that they are expensive and complicated. With ilumi, you get the convenience of a scalable and customizable lighting control system with the ease of just screwing in a light bulb. The great part is that it s super simple. So turn off all your lights before you go to bed, set your bedroom lights to a romantic scene, or just set that one ilumi in the hall on. Completely personalize and control your lighting just the way you want it. Also, everything is built inside the bulb, so you don t have to worry about connecting to WiFi routers or other complications and headaches. ilumi uses Bluetooth 4.0 technology, which is now in nearly every iOS and Android device. With ilumi, we're also building Bluetooth 4.0 meshing, so each ilumi can communicate with each other. Each ilumi has a 100 foot plus range, and multiple ilumi can communicate with one another through the wireless mesh to pass on commands and extend the signal range. ilumi prototypes with control boards You can also share access with family and friends who download the ilumi app on their own devices. Again, no boxes, routers, master-slave configurations or dependencies -- just screw ilumi in and it just works that simply. Plus if you don't have your phone handy, you can always use an old fashioned light switch to turn your ilumi off and on to a personalized default setting. Check out how easy it is to set-up your ilumi: It's all about experience with ilumi. From the aesthetics of the bulb, to the UX of the app, to the amazing things you can do with your ilumi. Here's an idea of what's possible: Check out the ilumi music sync experience! Right now we are building out two sizes of ilumi that with your help we'll introduce to the world. Both sizes of ilumi work great by themselves or as a team. SMALL A21 - The flexible A21 ilumi rises like the sun over the horizon spreading bright light in all directions. The A21 ilumi is great for lamps, fan lighting, and most anywhere else in the home. The A21 produces about 800+ lumens while only consuming 10 watts. That's about 7x less energy than an equivalent 75 watt incandescent. LARGE PAR30 - The powerful PAR30 ilumi shines down like bright light from the heavens (or your ceiling). The PAR30 ilumi is a flood light best for overhead, recessed, or track lighting. The PAR30 produces about 1100+ lumens while only consuming about 15 watts. That's about 7x less energy than an equivalent 100 watt incandescent. Since inception, ilumi has evolved quite a bit while still retaining our focus on brightness, simplicity, and experience. We've developed two iterations of working prototypes and now have the final design for both the A21 and PAR30 ready to go. Check out the photos below to see the evolution of ilumi... Behind ilumi is the ilumi app, which will be available as a free download in the App Store or Google Play. Like the lamps, the ilumi app has similarly evolved quite a bit as we've been working on it and with your feedback, we'll surely continue to refine it. Ilumi is compatible with Android Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) phones and tablets plus iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPad 3 (Retina Display), and iPad mini. If you re not sure if your Android device supports BLE, check this website here. Android just launched BLE support this summer, and while we re working on the Android app, the iOS app might ship first. We're also working on a software development kit (SDK) so others can come up with creative ways to use ilumi and share them with the ilumi nation. Receive the ilumi SDK first by contributing to a 'Light Hacker Kit' perk. some screen shots of the ilumi app in progress Yes, ilumi is super cool, but it's also responsible. Switching out your old light bulbs for ilumi will save you money on your electric bill, which is good for you and mother earth. Home lighting comprises about 1/4 of one's electric bill so it pays to practice energy efficiency. By combining our advanced HyperLux LED technology's efficiency with programming and automation functionality, ilumi is the most energy efficient light bulb in its class. And every ilumi lasts up to 20 years. That means every ilumi pays for itself multiple times over through the course of its life. Changing out your old incandescent light bulb for a large 15 watt ilumi can save you about $265. Switching out your small 10 watt ilumi for a 75 watt incandescent you can save about $190. From day one, our focus has been on making ilumi functional, flexible, and simple with a world class experience. This ethos is apparent in everything from our HyperLux LED technology to our automatic set-up process. We believe that this focus will not only ensure that ilumi will be a great product, but one that you ll have and enjoy for a long time. shades that come with the BLINDED BY THE LIGHT reward tee that comes with the LIGHT HACKER reward We've put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into ilumi...well figuratively, and we are so close to turning our dream into a bright reality. It takes a lot to manufacture a quality product, and while we are close, we need your help to get us over the last hump. There's tooling expenditures, cost of components, and manufacturing costs ahead, but also we need your help to build a community around ilumi - the ilumi nation. In addition to your very helpful contribution, we're going to ask you for your advice and opinion before and after we ship ilumi. When you receive your ilumi, we are going to ask for your feedback. What bugs are you seeing, what do you like, & what don't you like? Further, we've only touched the surface of what ilumi can do. With your support you can use the ilumi SDK to come up with even more amazing lighting experiences. This is just the beginning, and together with your help we'll not only create a great product that we hope you'll love, but one that you've been a part of as a member of the ilumi nation. To give you an idea on where we are in our process and next steps, here's an overview of our timeline: The ilumi team is a combination of entrepreneurs, hackers, designers, and technologists. The team is led by co-founders Corey Egan and Swapnil Bora out of Dallas, Texas. Swapnil and Corey met as classmates at UT Dallas where they came up with the idea in the fall of 2010 and won the UTD Business Idea competition. ilumi at the lab Corey & Swapnil at the Tech Fort Worth Impact Awards Partners: We've been fortunate to have the help of a number of different great partners both large and small. To name a few Novation Mobile has done a fantastic job helping us with developing the ilumi app, Avnet Electronics has helped us from day 1 to source the right components, and Osram Opto has been a great partner providing not only excellent LED components but expertise and access to world class testing facilities. team awards: Finalist - Tech Fort Worth Impact Awards, May 2013 Most Promising Company - Rice Alliance IT & Web Venture Showcase, December 2012 Semi-finalist - SxSw Eco Start-up Showcase, October 2012 Most Promising Company Rice Alliance CleanTech and Energy Venture Showcase, September 2012 Semi-finalist - CleanTech Open Accelerator and Competition, June 2012 Grand Prize - Carnegie Mellon McGinnis Venture Competition, March 2011 First Place Graduate Level - University of Texas at Dallas Business Idea Competition, November 2010 FCC certified Bluetooth Low Energy interface with 100+ foot range with 3.5mS connection time Extremely fast 16bit, 256KB FLASH processor Control for 100+ ilumi bulbs via Bluetooth mesh network with a range extension to tens of thousands of square feet Extremely bright and efficient high power LEDs - Red, Green, Blue, & White.

169`THE KICKSTARTER IS OVER, BUT YOU CAN STILL GET THE METAGAME! To order your copy, visit our website: www.metaga.me. You can also find information there about the latest Metagame products and editions. Thanks to our amazing Kickstarter supporters, we reached our goal. And then doubled it! Thanks to our supporters for your passion and support.We also reached two of our stretch goals, which means we are printing two expansion sets. Based on votes from our supporters, the SCIENCE FICTION and FILM 101 expansion sets will soon be made real. The Metagame is a card game about everything: comics and literature, fine art and tv, architecture and videogames. It s a way to show off your cultural smarts and get into ridiculous arguments with your friends. Arguments like: Which feels like first love: Pride and Prejudice or Hungry Hungry Hippos? Which is responsible for the fraying of our moral fabric: Tupperware or Das Kapital? Which should be required in schools: Dungeons and Dragons or the Bible? Sample Metagame cards. We re asking for your support to print our game. Each Metagame box includes a whopping 250 cards - covering your favorite cultural artifacts - from the Mona Lisa to the Mullet and everything in-between. Now that the basic set is funded (yeah!) we would like to hit stretch goals that will let us print awesome expansion sets as a free reward. Each expansion set will include 40 illustrated culture cards and 10 discussion cards, in a snazzy thumb-tuck box.First expansion - FREE - at $40,000. Our first expansion set will go out as a FREE reward to everyone who supported the Metagame at levels of $20 or more. Second expansion at $50,000. At $10,000 more, we'll print a SECOND expansion set! Anyone who supported the Metagame at the $40 level or higher will get BOTH expansion sets for free. (For each $15,000 beyond that, we'll print another expansion set - up to 5.)Help us choose! All Kickstarter supporters of $20 or more get to vote on their favorite expansion set. The expansion set with the most votes will be the one we print first! (We'll print up to five of them.) Take a look at your options... The voting has just begun! Here are the results so far:242 VOTES - Classic Games: a nostalgic deck of old-school videogames and tabletop games 246 VOTES - Film 101: for the cinema buffs out there - a 100-year survey of the very best movies 308 VOTES - Science Fiction: a far-out mix of books, television, comics and films from the future 124 VOTES - Snob Essentials: a heady selection of literature, art, and other pretentious fare 70 VOTES - Talk About (Pop) Music: all of your guilty pleasure bubble-gum music singles A couple years ago, we successfully kickstarted the Videogame Edition - a version of the game that focused just on videogames. But our players wanted more. So we're expanding the Metagame to include all kinds of culture! We have spent the last few years playing the Metagame with people of all ages. And our players love the game! Here is what a few of them have said: I love The Metagame, it's a great tool for talking about games and art. -- Max Temkin, co-creator of Cards Against Humanity Finally, I can use my rhetorical wiles to dazzle and confound all my friends! -- Naomi Clark, Game Designer & Culture Guru The Metagame was a huge hit with our readers, and one of the best contributions we've ever included in the magazine. -- Tod Lippy, Editor, Esopus Since we started the campaign, we've already gotten some good press. The cool kids at Attract Mode wrote a super-nice review of the Metagame. And Sean Duncan, Professor of Education and Metagame fan, wrote this smart piece about the history of the Metagame and its potential for good in the world.Why are we Kickstarting? We're currently in the middle of developing the new edition. The design of the gameplay and rules is finished. Illustrations and card captions are complete for about a third of the deck. Funds we raise will be used to pay our illustrator, print the cards and rule booklet, design and manufacture the game box, and ship all of the games from our printer. The Metagame includes 250 high-quality, smooth-finish, poker-sized cards in a beautifully packaged box. There are two kinds of cards: culture cards and discussion cards. Each culture card has a different work of art, pop culture, or entertainment: MAUS to the Big Mac; Pong to Playboy; the Sistine Chapel to Sexting. Discussion cards ask questions like Which is responsible for the fraying of our Moral Fabric? or Which best represents America? Want to see more sample cards? Take a look at this PDF. UPDATE: We have now made a 50-card prototype deck available as a "print and play" PDF! It only has a fraction of the final game's 250 cards - but you can now try out the Metagame RIGHT NOW at home! Click here for the cards, rules, and cutting instructions.So how do you play? Below, Colleen explains how to play the basic game. WARNING: We were trying to keep the video brief and focused on the rules, so we made really short and stupid arguments! In a typical game, we're much smarter. Honest. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Here's one more below. Eric leads us through a full game of Head to Head. (And it doesn't end well for him.) You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 But the Metagame isn't just one game. It is a deck of cards that can be played in a variety of ways. The box comes with rules for four of our favorite games - listed below. But we know our players will invent more. Debate Club. (4 or more players) A chatty game of elimination: a "critic" player draws a discussion card each round and you play the best matching culture card from your hand. One by one, players reveal their cards, explaining and defending their choices. The top player gets bonus cards - but the bottom is knocked out and joins the critics. The last player left standing wins. Critics Circle. (3 or more players) The twist in this version is that you re not allowed to debate or discuss: the critic has to pick the best card for each comparison without knowing who played which one. The role of the critic rotates each turn and the first player to win four rounds wins the game. Head to Head. (3 players) In this strategic game, five discussion cards are placed on the table face-up. You and your opponent have to carefully deploy content cards from your hand, putting one on each comparison. The critic decides the winner of each head-to-head matchup, without knowing who played what. Check out our second update for a video of a full Head-to-Head match! Massively Multiplayer Metagame. (10-1000 players) Great for big parties and events. Everyone gets a small hand of cards, and you challenge other players to a quick match - any nearby bystanders act as judges! The winner takes a card from the loser and the goal is to have the most cards at the end of the game. Winning the Metagame requires a crazy mix of geeky cultural smarts, strategic thinking, and the ability to sweet-talk your friends. Journalist Heather Chaplin wrote about one of our playtest sessions for Filmmaker Magazine. You can read the whole piece on the Filmmaker website, but here's a quick excerpt about what it's like to play:"Things get interesting right away.... When Zimmerman puts out What would Freud want? my 22-year-old cousin from Nashville cries, Who s Freud? and then avoids elimination by playing The Bikini and saying nothing. The art historian takes her full two minutes every time, delivering dissertation-worthy, deadly serious monologues about why Levittown is a better tool for dictators and why Charles and Ray Eames Lounge Wood Chair is more pedestrian. The poet wins by playing The Macarena to Which is more dangerous? and saying just a few words." Thanks for chipping in!

170`Darcy James Argue's Secret Society is about to record Brooklyn Babylon, the much-anticipated followup to our Grammy-nominated debut. This album will include all of the music from the acclaimed multimedia performance Brooklyn Babylon, co-created by visual artist Danijel Zezelj and yours truly, Darcy James Argue. The recording sessions will take place from June 19-21, 2012 and the album will be released in April 2013 on New Amsterdam Records.Brooklyn Babylon tells the story of a future Brooklyn in which plans are afoot to construct an immense tower the tallest in the world right in the heart of the city. Lev, a master carpenter, finds himself torn between ambition and and devotion to the neighborhood he loves when he is commissioned to build the carousel that will crown the Tower of Brooklyn.The multimedia production, produced by Beth Morrison Projects, premiered at the 2011 BAM Next Wave Festival to overwhelming acclaim. "Fantastic a massive, brass-heavy, sax-buoyant sound moves out of the group like a living wall" said Time Out New York. "Slashing fury and awesome full-ensemble precision" raved The New York City Jazz Record. And WNYC's Studio 360 proclaimed it "a masterpiece a work of originality, power, and beauty that left an audience slack-jawed."The music I created for this show, brought vividly to life by my Secret Society co-conspirators, is the culmination of everything we've been working towards since our first gig at (the late, lamented) CBGB seven years ago. I tried to draw on everything I love about Brooklyn's musical culture, filtered through my own personal sensibilities. It's rooted in contemporary jazz, but infused with dance-punk, post-rock, hip hop, doom metal, postminimalism, Balkan-inspired brass bands... reaching all the way back to 19th-century fairground music, waltzes, and marches. Despite these varied influences, everything is connected: musical ideas are introduced, transformed, and completely re-imagined over the course of the hour-long piece. It's a novelistic approach to long-form composition. It's music that tells one big story.Recording sessions for Brooklyn Babylon will take place over three days in June at the legendary Avatar Studios. Since the initial run at BAM, we have continued to perform this music at home and on the road. It gets stronger every time we play it. We'll be hitting the recording studio immediately after we get back from our first-ever Brazilian tour.As you might imagine, with a group this size, it's a challenge to get everyone in the same room at the same time for three consecutive days, but this recording includes all of my regular Secret Society co-conspirators. These are some of the finest musicians you'll find anywhere -- they've toured and recorded with artists like Ron Carter, Kurt Rosenwinkel, Sufjan Stevens, Anthony Braxton, John Scofield, Maria Schneider, Wynton Marsalis, Mos Def, Charlie Haden, and Esperanza Spalding. You've seen them on TV playing in the Saturday Night Live Band and heard them in the pit for Broadway's Porgy and Bess. Most play multiple instruments, and on this album, they are called upon to play everything from piccolo to contrabass clarinet to melodica to tapan. They are:FLUTES, CLARINETS & SAXOPHONES: Erica von Kleist, Rob Wilkerson, Sam Sadigursky, John Ellis, Josh SintonTRUMPETS & FLUEGELHORNS: Seneca Black, Tom Goehring, Matt Holman, Nadje Noordhuis, Ingrid JensenTROMBONES & TUBAS: Mike Fahie, Ryan Keberle, James Hirschfeld, Jennifer WhartonRHTYHM: Sebastian Noelle (guitar), Gordon Webster (piano/keyboards), Matt Clohesy (bass), Jon Wikan (drums and percussion)Let's get real: this isn't the kind of record you can make in an afternoon in someone's basement with a pair of microphones and a laptop computer. It's expansive, epic music and it needs a big, high-ceilinged studio with great acoustics, vintage ribbon and tube mics, a massive mixing console, and enough time to do it right. Every note matters, and we want you to hear it all, in vivid detail. That costs money: for the musicians, for the studio, for the engineers, for the producer, for mixing and mastering, and for designing and manufacturing a beautiful CD package, something you'll want to hold in your hands as you listen. None of this happens without your help. We have several ways of thanking you for your support... but first, a couple of important notes:ALL REWARD PACKAGES INCLUDE SHIPPING. Yes, anywhere in the world.ALL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FULLY TAX-DEDUCTIBLE. Our fiscal sponsor for this fundraiser is Beth Morrsion Projects, creative producer of the live multimedia incarnation of Brooklyn Babylon.

This work contains over 100 pages of brand new black and white illustrations, bringing the story of Brooklyn Babylon to a new medium. I'd love for everyone to experience listening to the album with graphic novel in hand. This package not only includes a signed copy of the graphic novel, it also features a limited edition 24"x36" Brooklyn Babylon poster print, also illustrated and signed by Zezelj, and of course a signed CD copy of Brooklyn Babylon.COCKTAIL PACKAGE: Ever since I inherited my granddad's beautiful vintage cocktail shaker, I've been an avid amateur mixologist. I love the way the classic cocktail proportions establish an ideal that allows for almost infinite variation. I also love to create cocktails that are tailored towards specific individuals, so tell me what kinds of beverages or flavors you enjoy, and I will devise an original cocktail recipe tailored to your personal proclivities. In this package, you'll also receive two tickets to the Secret Society performance of your choice. (Of course, if you don't live in NYC we can't guarantee we'll be coming to a city near you anytime soon, but if and when we do, rest assured that you and your concert companion of choice will be on the guest list!) Finally, you'll get a prominent shout-out in the CD liner notes. This package also includes the graphic novel, poster print, and a signed CD copy of Brooklyn Babylon.CO-CONSPIRATOR PACKAGE: Here is where you can help underwrite the participation of the Secret Society musician of your choice. In the album liner notes, you'll get credit as follows: "[SPONSORED MUSICIAN] appears courtesy of [YOUR NAME]." You'll also receive a signed exclusive photo of the sponsored musician, taken at the recording sessions, along with a personalized thank-you card. Additionally, you'll receive the custom cocktail recipe, two tickets to a Secret Society show, the graphic novel, poster print, and signed CD copy of Brooklyn Babylon. IMPORTANT: please indicate which musician you would like to sponsor! (See personnel above.) Only one sponsor per musician, assigned on a first-come basis. MUSICIANS SPONSORED TO DATE: Ingrid Jensen, Jennifer Wharton.EXECUTIVE PRODUCER PACKAGE: If you've always dreamed of leading the romantic life of an Executive Producer, now is your chance to make those dreams a reality. Of course, you'll be listed as the Executive Producer of the Brooklyn Babylon album. In that capacity, we will invite you to attend the recording sessions at Avatar Studios in New York City, from June 19-21, 2012. You'll get a glimpse behind the scenes and get to experience the recording process for yourself. You'll also get two complimentary lifetime tickets to any and all Secret Society shows. Additionally, you'll receive a portfolio of one-of-a-kind large-format gicl e prints, containing a selection of the incredible images Danijel Zezelj painted for the multimedia performance of Brooklyn Babylon. Finally: in addition to inventing an original cocktail just for you, I will mix and serve it for you and a small group of guests at a cocktail party hosted by you.

172`Before the world guffawed at Portlandia, generations were charmed and inspired by Beverly Cleary's stories. As children, we raptly read the adventures of Ramona, Beezus, Henry, Ribsy, Ellen, and Austine as they grew up in a then-working class Portland neighborhood in the 1950s the same one where Beverly Cleary spent ages 6 through 18 in the 1920s and 1930s.Now, longtime Portland guidebook writer Laura O. Foster brings that history alive, leading you through a walk down the Klickitat Street that was, and in many ways, still is. Walking with Ramona unlocks a fascinating chapter of Portland's history, and introduces you to the sights, sounds, smells, games, and social fabric of mid-century Portland. Like the Ramona books themselves, this tour and the history around it can be enjoyed by all ages and generations. Visit the real and fictional Klicktat Streets on the Walking with Ramona tour! Why this book?Several years ago, Portland guidebook writer Laura O. Foster was asked by the Multnomah County Library to develop and lead a series of walking tours which she called "Walking with Ramona." These tours were so popular (with as many as 200 people showing up for them!) that Laura decided to write a book so that anyone can discover Beverly Cleary's Portland for themselves. The book is intended as a practical guidebook for both locals and visitors, even those who aren't able to physically visit Portland. Laura giving a Ramona tour Here are some nice things people are saying about Walking with Ramona:"I don t like to brag, but I can hum and whistle at the same time. Also, I've lived near Beverly Cleary s childhood home for many years. And yet even I found Laura O. Foster s Walking with Ramona to be hugely impressive, absolutely enriching, and downright inspiring. Kudos to Laura for writing a book that would make Ramona proud!" Bart King, The Big Book of Boy Stuff, The Big Book of Girl Stuff, and An Architectural Guidebook to Portland"Ramona would be amazed by this book! I love seeing where she lived and learned." Ginnie Cooper, former Multnomah County Librarian and resident of Klickitat Street The rewardsOf course, first and foremost, there's the book itself! The book! Walking with Ramona: Exploring Beverly Cleary's Portland is Laura O. Foster's lovingly detailed history and guide to the sidewalks, houses, schools, and neighborhood that Mrs. Cleary lived, learned, played, and later wrote about.The book's 128 pages are packed with history, delightful facts, and photos taken along the route. At 5 and a half by 7 inches, it's small enough to slip into a purse or pocket while you stroll along looking for sidewalk horse rings or plan your walk over breakfast at a Hollywood eatery. Once you've walked (or biked) along the 3.2 mile route, turn to the rest of the book to find places to eat, drink, and shop in the neighborhood, learn more about the neighborhood and Mrs. Cleary's history, and explore other places around Portland and Oregon where Beverly and her family lived, spent time, or visited. Far more than just a guidebook, Walking with Ramona paints a fascinating picture of a young girl s life in Depression-era Portland, and it also takes the reader further afield, beyond Portland to discover other places from Beverly Cleary s life, along with their stories. Close to the tour route, you can visit one of the city s last drugstore soda fountains, take in a movie at the theater where Beverly watched silent movies, and shop for antiques in a classic mid-century department store. Farther away, you can visit the Pudding River, where Beverly and her best friend Claudine would spend time in the summer, or Beverly's first home, a farmhouse in Yamhill, Oregon. Horse rings like these were once used to tether real horses that pulled delivery carts to every home in Portland More Microcosm Travel BooksWe're experienced at publishing cute little guide books and travel stories. In various rewards, we offer a selection of travel books that we think you'll like particularly.

Dream Whip 15 A bicycle powered travelogue by Bill Brown, who made a documentary about the US-Mexico border and took it on a screening tour, by bike, across the US Midwest. Other Guidebooks by Laura O. FosterLaura has written a number of wonderful guides; we're still confirming details about which ones will be included in these reward levels, and we'll update you here as soon as we sort it out! These books could include The Portland Stairs Book, Portland Hill Walks, or Portland City Walks.Gorgeous Oregon and a special rewardWhen we first proposed this project to author Laura O. Foster, she let us know that she is also Kickstarting another guidebook Columbia Gorge Getaways will be the first comprehensive guide to visiting what is arguably one of the most beautiful destinations in Oregon or perhaps the country (and with the best food and wine, we might add!). Laura kindly agreed to let the two projects overlap, and to provide a special reward for backers who support both which we strongly encourage you to do through the end of the Gorge project on March 4th!Anyone who backs both Walking with Ramona and Columbia Gorge Getaways will receive an invitation to a unique, one-time-only walking tour around one of Laura's favorite parts of Portland. Details to be determined! Back Laura's Gorge guide book here! See you on the sidewalk! Note: To get invited to this walk, all you need to do is back both projects and choose any reward level. We'll compare our lists of backers at the end, and email everyone who's a match with details!Happy birthday, Mrs. Cleary!Beverly Cleary lives in California, and this April 12th, 2016 is her 100th birthday! (The day is perhaps better known as "Drop Everything And Read" or "D.E.A.R." Day, after a fictional school program Ramona participates in.)We would love to be able to publish this book early in time for Mrs. Cleary's birthday. So we're announcing a stretch goal right off the bat: If this project raises $10,000 (or if we can sell over 1,000 copies), then we'll drop everything and go to print early. Beverly and Clarence Cleary at the dedication of the Ramona statue in Grant Park About the AuthorLaura O. Foster writes about Portland and the Pacific Northwest. Her books take readers on explorations of a city or region s geology, architecture, neighborhoods, parklands, and human and natural history. For several years, Laura has occasionally led her "Walking with Ramona" tour for public school field trips and most recently for OPB s Oregon Art Beat when it celebrated Mrs. Cleary s 100th birthday in April 2016. This book is a much expanded version of that tour, meant to make it accessible to everybody.In the 1990s, Laura lived in Beverly Cleary's neighborhood, on Northeast 48th Avenue in a 1909 Craftsman bungalow. She walked her dog to Grant Park most days with her two daughters. There, where Beverly, Henry, Beezus and Ramona played, the girls climbed trees, swung on the swings, and swam in the Grant Pool. Today Laura lives in Northwest Portland s Skyline neighborhood. From the original Walking with Ramona illustrations by Meggyn Pomerleau Thank you!Thanks for being excited about Walking with Ramona. Here are some photos of sights you'll see along the route, and a few glimpses of Portland 100 years ago that you can enjoy in your imagination as you read and explore.

173`New Reward Alert! We've added a new prize at the $100 level: Receive the limited edition 11x17 poster created exclusively for this campaigned SIGNED by Marco Collins, director Marq Evans and composer/Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready!If you already pledged $100 or more you'll be automatically upgraded to this prize (unless otherwise notified) and if you have already pledged a lessor amount you can raise it by the remaining balance and be upgraded to the signed version.THE FILMBefore the Internet made sourcing new music and rising bands a simple matter of keystrokes and RSS feeds, there was the radio DJ. No one epitomized this role like Marco Collins. The Glamour & The Squalor is the story of Marco Collins, one of America's last great rock radio DJs and a musical tastemaker that changed our culture. He was the on-off switch for an artist s potential career and was the gatekeeper credited for helping break the likes of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Beck, Weezer, Garbage and countless others.The film features an original score by Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready and interviews with McCready, Kurt Cobain, Carrie Brownstein, Ben Gibbard, Shirley Manson, Patty Schemel, Matt Pinfield and many more of the most prolific artists of the twenty-first century!Marco s story is inspiring and universal. He turned his passion for music into a significant lifetime of work and battled some seriously determined demons along the way. And he s still standing. SO WHAT'S UP? We have been making The Glamour & The Squalor since 2012 and are beyond thrilled about its World Premiere at the Seattle International Film Festival to a SOLD OUT audience on June 3. The film is a labor of love and its completion has involved so many friends, family members, fans and supporters. We feel so lucky and honored to have been able to make this film, but we still need a little help to ensure that the film is seen by the widest audience possible.In order to distribute the film throughout the world, we need to raise some additional funds for things like marketing, public relations, festival travel and licensing the final music rights in perpetuity.You - our community, our team - have helped carry this project so far, and we're hoping you're able to step up to the plate one more time so we can release the film beyond Seattle and throughout the world! THE CAMPAIGN Our first Kickstarter campaign was a success. We raised over $50,000 to bring the film to life. This time around, we're trying something different. Our approach is definitely an experiment and, to our knowledge, one that has never been taken on Kickstarter, but we believe so much in our supporters and think it's the best way to launch the campaign.This time, every dollar counts. And we mean it. To prove it, we've set the campaign goal at just $1. Every dollar raised gets us that much closer to our dream of releasing the film worldwide and making sure as many people as possible can see it.Beyond that, we are offering just one reward - an 11x17 limited edition poster of The Glamour & The Squalor EXCLUSIVE to this Kickstarter campaign - at a minimum pledge of $1.Yeah, that's right. $1. The limited edition poster EXCLUSIVE to this campaign. "So how much do you actually need?" you're probably asking. While every single dollar pledged sincerely helps get us into distribution, we'd really like to raise at least $30,000 to pay for the expenditures referenced above. Any amount raised over that allows us to reach an even wider audience for our film. Let's see how high we can take this together!Pledge what you want, pledge what you can. We are so grateful and appreciate any amount pledged. Just know that every dollar helps. Whether you're donating $1 or $1,000, we appreciate your contribution! We want anybody and everybody to be part of our team to help release this movie. You're part of our story when you make a pledge. We've made it this far together and are so close to being able to show this movie to the world. Please support our campaign to raise funds to distribute THE GLAMOUR & THE SQUALOR!

When a big spill ruined an important computer of ours, we set out to create a better, smarter mug - a mug that would stand up to accidental knocks and bumps. After years of development, we came up with Mighty Mug, the world's only mug powered by our patented Smartgrip Technology. When you knock into other mugs they fall over and spill on your computer, papers, phone, pants and basically ruin your day. Mighty Mug is different as it grips to your desk when knocked into, but lifts naturally like any other mug. The magic is in Mighty Mug's patented Smartgrip base. Mighty Mug creates a super powerful airlock once placed down, but automatically releases when you need a sip.There are no buttons to push or levers to pull to get Mighty Mug to work. Mighty Mug is not a suction cup nor is it a magnet, but rather something entirely new.Mighty Mug will grip to any smooth, flat, solid surface like most desks and tables. The most amazing part about Mighty Mug is that when you go in for a sip it lifts 100% naturally. Grips when hit but lifts when you need a sip. We are a team of mechanical engineers and industrial designers who have spent the last 3 years developing Mighty Mug and it's patented Smartgrip technology. We hope that you love Mighty Mug and it's innovative solution. Mighty Mug Prototype Grip Tricks We believe that once you try Mighty Mug you are going to be blown away. Thank you for take the time to check out Mighty Mug and please share with anyone that hates mugs that fall and spill. Be Mighty, Jayme-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Last year we launched our first Mighty Mug travel mug and are now seeking to expand with new models. The tooling for production on each of these items has recently been completed and backers will receive their Mighty Mug as soon as September/October of this year. With your help, we hope to offset some of these production costs and get the first run onto the desks of Kickstarter Backers.

We launched a successful crowdfunding campaign in April 2015. We surpassed our goal by 180%, which helped us open our online store to reach the online market. It has been an amazing journey and we're committed to the evolution of this product! We received amazing feedback from our backers last year for our small and large Cloops. But we've heard your requests to develop an even larger Cloop for those even larger cables you have around the house. Cloop is Patent Pending and International PCT registered.
177`Why Sideclick? None of the popular streaming remotes have the ability to power on and off your TV or control volume. A 2nd or sometimes 3rd remote is always needed. Sideclick is a universal remote attachment that snaps onto your streaming remote, allowing you to control the basic functions of your TV and your streaming device all-in-one. Sideclick is available in Black or Silver and compatible with the following streaming devices. Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Google Nexus Player, and Apple TV. REWARDS Features The following animation demonstrates how the same Sideclick can be snapped onto multiple streaming remotes using different adapter clips. This is beneficial because if you decide to upgrade or change your streaming device, you can still use your Sideclick, you just need a new adapter clip for your new streaming remote. From Amazon Fire TV Stick to Google Nexus Player: Available Adapter ClipsRoku - All 2014 and 2015 Models Supported Apple TV Amazon Fire TV Stick Amazon Fire TV Google Nexus Player How Sideclick worksSideclick uses infrared learning technology to program each button. Programming is as easy as pointing your device's remote at Sideclick and pressing a few buttons. The entire process takes less than a minute. Any device using IR technology can be programmed as a button on Sideclick. So say you want to use the POWER button to power on and off your TV but you want to program Sideclick's volume controls to work your sound bar or reciever, you can easily do so. If you don't need the channel up/down option, you could program the up arrow to be your MENU option and the down arrow to MUTE. We give you 8 buttons, program them however you want. Each Sideclick model takes 2 AAA batteries.A streaming accessory for everyone Having Sideclick attached to your streaming remote makes navigating the TV easy for anyone. Especially kids, grandparents, and guests. Schedule About the CreatorSideclick was invented and designed by mechanical engineer, Brett Epstein. Brett has always had a passion for product design and has over 10 years of engineering design experience ranging from consumer products to jet engines. Brett's family recently cut the cord, eliminated their cable provider, and purchased a Roku. While Brett loved the device and the sleekness of the remote, he hated the fact that in order to sit down and watch TV, he needed 2 remotes in his hand: one to control the Roku and one to control the volume. After some research, he realized that this basic functionality was lacking in all streaming TV devices and he knew that if he could design something for each of the top selling streaming devices, it would become a must-have accessory for streamers.The first Sideclick Prototype Work in Progress Also on the Sideclick team is Brett's wife, Jenn, handling everything from customer service, social media, and marketing. Daughters, Brenna and Lily, serve as quality control testers.
178`Good olive oil is like good wine. The specific variety of the fruit matters. The terroir the land and environment where it is grown matters. The production process matters. They all work in concert to create a unique taste and experience. Just as you enjoy exploring the depth and individuality of fine wine, we hope to introduce you to a similar experience with Auzoud extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).OUR STORYI was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud means olive in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud Waterfalls in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco Ouzoud s waters contribute to the region s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation. It has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping other family members and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma.After moving to the U.S. several years ago, I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region.THE HISTORY OF OLIVES IN THE OUZOUD REGIONAmazingly, the Ouzoud region has some of the oldest olive groves in the world. The ancient Romans were the first connoisseurs of Moroccan olive oil. They established the trading city of Volubilis in the 1st Century A.D. in northern Morocco, from which they could oversee their olive harvest. Old Olive Tree in Ouzoud Region Our olive oil is produced from the Picholine cultivar of olive. Picholines were originally grown in the south of France, but they have found a natural second home in Morocco s shared Mediterranean climate, where they are the dominant variety. The small farmers in Ouzoud have harvested it for generations.Olive oil made from the Picholine variety is recognized for its beautiful light golden color and fresh aroma. It will win you over with its soft, right, fruity and slightly peppery taste. WE OFFER THE HIGHEST QUALITY EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL You ve probably noticed that there are an overwhelming number of olive oils to choose from in the store, but did you know that a 2010 study by the University of California, Davis found that two-thirds of the biggest imported brands failed to meet the requirements to actually label their olive oil as extra virgin ? These companies often source their olive oil in massive quantities without knowing where it comes from, how it was grown or how it was processed. They often mix different varieties of olive oil to create a homogenous flavor that loses any sense of the individual profile and personality of the olives it was grown from. In some cases the oil is also diluted with cheap vegetable oils, like peanut or sunflower. Some producers also use stale olive oil, which may taste rancid. Not only are these practices fraudulent for consumers but they are also setting the tone for a general acceptance of low-quality oil and open the door to other major concerns, such as food allergies/sensitivities. In order to receive U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) classification as an extra virgin olive oil, the oil must be pressed mechanically without the use of any alteration methods. The acidity level must be 0.8 or less for every 100 grams. During the pressing stage, when the oil is squeezed from the olive fruit, the temperature must remain constant at 80 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). At Auzoud we make sure to meet these requirements during our process and with lab testing. The result is a fantastic olive oil with very low acidity and a full, rich flavor. We want to change the way people think about and experience extra virgin olive oil, a staple in so many of our diets. I have participated in every stage of the process from hand picking, pressing and bottling. Auzoud Extra Virgin Olive Oil PROUDLY PARTNERED WITH MOROCCO S SMALL FARMERS In addition to offering only the finest extra virgin olive oil, Auzoud is committed to working with low-income farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Auzoud is proud to partner with the Ben Youssef Farmers Cooperative, which was founded in 2010 to support better social conditions for women, youth and agricultural workers in the region. Partnering With Ben Youssef Cooperative The co-op helps empower local farmers obtain higher prices for their olives and a more sustainable livelihood for them and their families. All of the olives we use are sourced directly from this group. There are currently over a hundred co-op members and many more farmers are working with the organization to participate in the next harvest. One of the co-op s missions is to educate members about sustainable olive farming. To this end, Auzoud and the co-op are working together to obtain organic certification for all members. The money raised through this campaign will help Auzoud expand the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. MORE THAN JUST OLIVE OIL In addition to our oil, we sell batches of pitted green and black olives cured in olive oil. They are delicious! Oil Cured Picholine Black Olives Picholine Green Olives Pitted USE OF FUNDSCustomers and staff of the specialty stores and retailers where we sell our products say they love the unique taste and that we ve changed the way they experience and think about olives and olive oil.Auzoud has already partnered with several retail outlets, and is sold in a number of specialty and natural stores. Many more stores plan to carry Auzoud products but only if we can bring in a new shipment this fall. Demand is high but we have to be able to meet the minimum quantities at which many stores will only agree to deal with us. This will require a significant expansion from the product numbers we were able to bring to market in the past.Funds from this campaign will be used to purchase olives from the Ben Youssef Farmers Co-op. We will also be working with the co-op in its modern facility to press and bottle the oil for shipment to the U.S. Savings and proceeds from previous sales will be used to finance shipping costs. Any funds in excess of our goal will be used to prepare the olives for retail sale, which includes packaging in glass jars and labeling. As with our oil, we already have a waitlist for these. Additional funds will also be used to grow our online presence and online sales capabilities, so that we can continue to grow our company and the pool of farmers we work with.Of course, we will keep you informed about the progress of the project. SPREAD THE WORD Thank you for taking the time to learn about our project. We appreciate your interest and hope you will join us! If you know of anyone who loves quality food, sustainable and natural agricultural production, fair trade, or who might otherwise be interested in our work, please share this campaign with them.

Just use the buttons below the video to post.We'd also love for you to stay in touch: Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. Sign up for our Newsletter. Thank you!Wow! We reached our minimum funding goal and are well on our way to getting girls (and boys!) building! Let's keep going, because the more people who pledge and pre-order Build & Imagine StoryWalls play-sets, the bigger impact we'll have on girls in STEM.So let's get StoryWalls into the hands of as many kids as we can!Meet Build & Imagine StoryWalls Recommended for ages 4-10. Each Build & Imagine play-set is composed of painted wooden panels, called StoryWalls, and accompanying wooden dolls. Children can combine the StoryWalls into any structural design they choose, and they magnetically snap together. The illustrations on each wall artfully combine to create scenes that act as a launching pad for the child s imagination. Play testing with an early prototype at the Children's Creativity Museum. Sisters build together. The InspirationIn the spring of 2013 Laurie Peterson founded Build & Imagine after noticing that the kind of play experiences she loved as a child (building, problem solving, designing and experimenting) were not reflected in the girls section of the toy store. She aims to create construction toys that her daughter -- and your daughters and sons -- will love. This campaign is raising support for Build & Imagine's first product line. Laurie's daughter plays with an early prototype. Why construction toys designed for girls?What we play with matters. Construction toys (also known as building toys) are the hottest category in the toy industry, yet historically 90% of these toys have targeted boys. Girls are missing out because construction toys help to develop important spatial reasoning and design skills that are prerequisites to succeed in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). These are fields in which women make up only 24% of the workforce, leading to what the President has termed a gender gap in innovation . Toys can make a difference.The design principle Laurie uses to get girls excited about construction is simple: building should facilitate imaginative play. Rather than designing with abstract bricks and shapes, children construct scenes that are as rich and beautiful as a storybook. We re launching with three play-sets Each Build & Imagine StoryWalls play-set comes with illustrated dolls and magnetic panels that children can combine into any configuration they choose. The first three play-sets work together in a coastal theme. Malia s Beach House Front Door to Malia's House Best friends Emily and Malia love hanging out in Malia s modern beach front eco-house after school. When they are not playing with her pets or goofing off in the pool, these friends enjoy learning about the environment and recently convinced Malia s parents to allow them plant a veggie garden.

Play testing at the Children's Creativity Museum It s better than [other building toys] because there are pictures. I like pictures better than plain things. - 7 year old play tester That is a perfect summary of what makes our play-sets special. Rather than building with abstract bricks or shapes, you re creating a detailed scene that has tons of jumping off points for storytelling with the included dolls.

182`THE WEATHERNECK WHAT IS IT?The Weatherneck is a modern bandana that utilizes powerful magnets and technical fabrics to offer a face shield/neck cuff that adjusts to your environment.It is designed specifically for demanding performance outdoors. 9 Styles of The Weatherneck THE STORYInnovation through frustration continues in the third stall.A few years ago I saw a photo of a euro pro cyclist in spring training wearing a neck warmer. I made one myself and found that a little fabric around the neck goes a very long way to stay warm.Since then, I've always had one thought, "These things are great, right up until they aren't." I like being protected from the wind, breathing warm air and getting heated up, but once I'm warmed up, I sometimes overheat. Then the ONLY thing I want to do was get the neck warmer off! I needed to remove my neck warmer quickly without stopping. I needed it to fit loose in some conditions and tight in others. I needed to reduce the moisture around my face and mouth. I needed to breathe through it easily (even at race pace). I had a PROBLEM so I created a SOLUTION. Wear it tight in the COLD, or just loose if it's chilly. The Weatherneck design improves face shields and neck cuffs by utilizing powerful magnets and superior USA made fabrics to: Allow for immediate removal (magnets) Provide a superior one-size-fits-all design (see diagram below), this also allows a loose or tight fit depending on conditions. Manage moisture build up, allow easy ventilation and block wind without excessive bulk Allow quiet removal/application in noise sensitive environments* My passion is cycling so I designed The Weatherneck based around riding. I am 100% confident that it will improve your comfort in cold, windy conditions. Looking at my other gear, I have many types of gloves, vests, jackets and hats for all different temperatures and weather conditions, but I don't have that flexibility for my face and neck. The magnets give you the choice to wear it tight or loose.Fabric choice was critical and I selected a double knit spandex material typically used in team sports due to its toughness, stretch and feel. The thick fabric on the sides block the wind, expel moisture and stay formed around your face without pressure. It also hangs perfectly when it is slung loosely around your neck. The mesh center section allows for full breath in and out.There are 9 design choices - 5 hex patterns and 4 camo patterns. As development of The Weatherneck evolved, it became clear that this design suited many sports -- not just cycling. Skiing Snowboarding Hunting* Military* Law Enforcement* Running Fishing (its not overly thermal, so excellent sun blocker) Mountaineering/Hiking Workwear The Weatherneck combines technical features and field-tested designs to bring you a superior bandana, facemark, and neck cuff. 9 styles total (pink photos coming soon) Pink rendering The WHERE and the WHAT?Where - The Weatherneck is made from technical fabrics sourced in the USA. Sewing will be done by a professional sewing factory in Wisconsin.What - The materials is a double knit stretch made from micro polyester and spandex which creates a very comfortable touch and feel while performing at a high level in outdoor activities. The colors will not run or fade. The Why? Kickstarter? $7,000?Luckily, the risk on this product is minimal as there are no major tooling costs, so my goal can remain very low, ensuring the production will happen. I do need to place larger orders for magnets, sewing and fabrics in the future and this campaign will help with that while also confirming demand. I need to know if anyone in the world agrees with my solution first. Finally, I'm very interested in hearing feedback from backers. What could be improved? What colors/designs would you prefer to see? I am eager to hear about how we can make it better as a community. My past projects were made much better through the Kickstarter community and I hope the same occurs here. The Weatherneck THE REWARDS - Can you deliver?YES! I have before and I will again.I have created two brands using Kickstarter three times in the past- those campaigns delivered on time www.fixitsticks.com and www.backbottle.com.I will be putting in an order PRIOR to the end of the campaign based on the momentum. My factory can turn the order in 4-6 weeks. That should allow plenty of time for shipping about a month after the conclusion of the campaign. It will be plenty chilly in March and that's my target ship timeline. The reward levels are extremely simple, only 4 choices. The Weatherneck rewards are based on shipping 1, 2, 4 or 9 units. You may pick any color(s) you like based on how many you ordered, so if you order 9, you could take The Weatherneck in pink 9 times. It's up to you! And, I have no gimmicks, t-shirts, baseball hats or other junk. It's just The Weatherneck, cleanandsimple. *Note to Hunters/Law Enforcement/MilitaryThe Weatherneck is dead silent. When removing clothing to manage your temperature, you don t want to alert the world around you with the familiar RIIIPPP of hook and loop fasteners or wrestling gear to remove your helmet, glasses, headphones ect. 4 camo styles for style or function Questions?Machine washable? Please hand wash and hang dry only. The magnets stick to washing machines and it damages the fabric much quicker, it will survive but limits the life of the product. I use hand soap in the sink and let it air dry in less than 1 minute of effort.Will the magnets hurt my phone/electronics? No! The fear of magnets and credit cards/phones/electronics is outdated.http://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-magnets-really-affect-phones-hard-drives/Will magnets hurt my body? Only if you use a pacemaker. If you do, seriously don't buy The Weatherneck. For real.Will magnets effect my inner chi? It only enhances your chi. I worked hard on finding chi friendly magnets.Are the magnets safe? They are as long as they are sewn in place. If the product fails and the magnets escape PLEASE THROW THE MAGNETS AWAY ASAP IF YOU HAVE KIDS AROUND. Do the magnets wear out? Yes, after about 400 years.Why not use hook and loop? Hook and loop was less than ideal for me. It gets messy, doesn't work well after it gets dirty and is abrasive to other gear. Magnets have their own personality but in the end they offer a host of advantages that cannot be realized in any other attachment method.Does it protect against contaminants and pollution? I've not specifically tested The Weatherneck as a environmental aid, but it certainly does keep dirt and dust out of your mouth. Can you explain the "one size fits all" process? Here is a diagram to explain the process of tightening The Weatherneck. The non-folded side stays against your body, the folded side is on the outside. The magnets POWER through an extra layer of fabric to grab the tighter position and it easily stays in position through normal movement. Fold, don't roll. Ya dig! Quotes from early product testers "packs up small, breathes well""best feature was how easy it was to put on and pull off.""Facial coverage that could be raised and lowered as needed.""I thought it was great for the "in between" temps, as well as windy conditions. I found I had to still use my balaclava in temps below 28 degrees. I liked how quickly it dried.""I liked how easy it was to take on and off.

184`WELCOME We're very excited to announce that 12 O'Clock Boys will have its World Premiere at SXSW 2013 in Competition! We are one of eight films selected for the competition section out of 905 submissions! I began this project in 2008. Since then, so many great people have contributed and supported the project. We now have a movie on our hands that is bigger than I could have ever imagined. The amount of interest in the film is really staggering, and i'm grateful to everyone who has reached out. But despite all of that, we have about a month until premiere and the production is broke. WHY WE ARE FUNDRAISING (AGAIN): In 2010 we raised a little over 12K on Kickstarter for what I thought would be the end of filming. Instead, the story grew, as did interest in the film. We stretched that money and it launched the film forward into a new place. It hasn't been easy, but with that support, and a little more help along the way, we've managed to come this far on a really small budget. So it goes. I actually think that the scraping by we've had to do up until now has allowed the film to maintain its rawness that people love. At this stage of the game though, we have unavoidable costs for finishing that have to be met. This is what we need your help with. We have to pay for Color Correction, online, printing to HDCAM, Sound design & mix, licensing, some music costs, and getting to the festival. With such a perfect platform to premiere, we can't fudge this part, we can't show the movie in a theater without taking on these costs. ABOUT THE FILM: Pug, a thirteen year old boy living on a dangerous Westside block, has one goal in mind: to join the 12 O Clock Boys; the notorious urban dirt-bike gang of Baltimore. Converging from all parts of the inner city, they invade the streets and clash with police, who are forbidden to chase the bikes for fear of endangering the public. Pug looks to the pack for mentorship, spurred by their dangerous lifestyle. He narrates their world as if explaining a dreamscape, complemented with unprecedented, action-packed coverage of the riders in their element, guided by the riders themselves as they take to the streets and clash with Police. The film presents the pivotal years of change in a boy s life growing up in one of the most dangerous and economically depressed cities in the United States. HOW KICKSTARTER WORKS: If you make a pledge, we get closer to making our goal. If we make the goal within the time limit set, we get the money. If we don't make the goal in the time limit, we don't get anything, and you don't get charged anything, either. THANK YOU If you like the film, we would be grateful for your support, and we'll make it count. If you can't pledge, please share the page with anyone you can. Thank you for reading and I hope you will join the effort.

185`Before the world guffawed at Portlandia, generations were charmed and inspired by Beverly Cleary's stories. As children, we raptly read the adventures of Ramona, Beezus, Henry, Ribsy, Ellen, and Austine as they grew up in a then-working class Portland neighborhood in the 1950s the same one where Beverly Cleary spent ages 6 through 18 in the 1920s and 1930s.Now, longtime Portland guidebook writer Laura O. Foster brings that history alive, leading you through a walk down the Klickitat Street that was, and in many ways, still is. Walking with Ramona unlocks a fascinating chapter of Portland's history, and introduces you to the sights, sounds, smells, games, and social fabric of mid-century Portland. Like the Ramona books themselves, this tour and the history around it can be enjoyed by all ages and generations. Visit the real and fictional Klicktat Streets on the Walking with Ramona tour! Why this book?Several years ago, Portland guidebook writer Laura O. Foster was asked by the Multnomah County Library to develop and lead a series of walking tours which she called "Walking with Ramona." These tours were so popular (with as many as 200 people showing up for them!) that Laura decided to write a book so that anyone can discover Beverly Cleary's Portland for themselves. The book is intended as a practical guidebook for both locals and visitors, even those who aren't able to physically visit Portland. Laura giving a Ramona tour Here are some nice things people are saying about Walking with Ramona:"I don t like to brag, but I can hum and whistle at the same time. Also, I've lived near Beverly Cleary s childhood home for many years. And yet even I found Laura O. Foster s Walking with Ramona to be hugely impressive, absolutely enriching, and downright inspiring. Kudos to Laura for writing a book that would make Ramona proud!" Bart King, The Big Book of Boy Stuff, The Big Book of Girl Stuff, and An Architectural Guidebook to Portland"Ramona would be amazed by this book! I love seeing where she lived and learned." Ginnie Cooper, former Multnomah County Librarian and resident of Klickitat Street The rewardsOf course, first and foremost, there's the book itself! The book! Walking with Ramona: Exploring Beverly Cleary's Portland is Laura O. Foster's lovingly detailed history and guide to the sidewalks, houses, schools, and neighborhood that Mrs. Cleary lived, learned, played, and later wrote about.The book's 128 pages are packed with history, delightful facts, and photos taken along the route. At 5 and a half by 7 inches, it's small enough to slip into a purse or pocket while you stroll along looking for sidewalk horse rings or plan your walk over breakfast at a Hollywood eatery. Once you've walked (or biked) along the 3.2 mile route, turn to the rest of the book to find places to eat, drink, and shop in the neighborhood, learn more about the neighborhood and Mrs. Cleary's history, and explore other places around Portland and Oregon where Beverly and her family lived, spent time, or visited. Far more than just a guidebook, Walking with Ramona paints a fascinating picture of a young girl s life in Depression-era Portland, and it also takes the reader further afield, beyond Portland to discover other places from Beverly Cleary s life, along with their stories. Close to the tour route, you can visit one of the city s last drugstore soda fountains, take in a movie at the theater where Beverly watched silent movies, and shop for antiques in a classic mid-century department store. Farther away, you can visit the Pudding River, where Beverly and her best friend Claudine would spend time in the summer, or Beverly's first home, a farmhouse in Yamhill, Oregon. Horse rings like these were once used to tether real horses that pulled delivery carts to every home in Portland More Microcosm Travel BooksWe're experienced at publishing cute little guide books and travel stories. In various rewards, we offer a selection of travel books that we think you'll like particularly.

These books could include The Portland Stairs Book, Portland Hill Walks, or Portland City Walks.Gorgeous Oregon and a special rewardWhen we first proposed this project to author Laura O. Foster, she let us know that she is also Kickstarting another guidebook Columbia Gorge Getaways will be the first comprehensive guide to visiting what is arguably one of the most beautiful destinations in Oregon or perhaps the country (and with the best food and wine, we might add!). Laura kindly agreed to let the two projects overlap, and to provide a special reward for backers who support both which we strongly encourage you to do through the end of the Gorge project on March 4th!Anyone who backs both Walking with Ramona and Columbia Gorge Getaways will receive an invitation to a unique, one-time-only walking tour around one of Laura's favorite parts of Portland. Details to be determined! Back Laura's Gorge guide book here! See you on the sidewalk! Note: To get invited to this walk, all you need to do is back both projects and choose any reward level. We'll compare our lists of backers at the end, and email everyone who's a match with details!Happy birthday, Mrs. Cleary!Beverly Cleary lives in California, and this April 12th, 2016 is her 100th birthday! (The day is perhaps better known as "Drop Everything And Read" or "D.E.A.R." Day, after a fictional school program Ramona participates in.)We would love to be able to publish this book early in time for Mrs. Cleary's birthday. So we're announcing a stretch goal right off the bat: If this project raises $10,000 (or if we can sell over 1,000 copies), then we'll drop everything and go to print early. Beverly and Clarence Cleary at the dedication of the Ramona statue in Grant Park About the AuthorLaura O. Foster writes about Portland and the Pacific Northwest. Her books take readers on explorations of a city or region s geology, architecture, neighborhoods, parklands, and human and natural history. For several years, Laura has occasionally led her "Walking with Ramona" tour for public school field trips and most recently for OPB s Oregon Art Beat when it celebrated Mrs. Cleary s 100th birthday in April 2016. This book is a much expanded version of that tour, meant to make it accessible to everybody.In the 1990s, Laura lived in Beverly Cleary's neighborhood, on Northeast 48th Avenue in a 1909 Craftsman bungalow. She walked her dog to Grant Park most days with her two daughters. There, where Beverly, Henry, Beezus and Ramona played, the girls climbed trees, swung on the swings, and swam in the Grant Pool. Today Laura lives in Northwest Portland s Skyline neighborhood. From the original Walking with Ramona illustrations by Meggyn Pomerleau Thank you!Thanks for being excited about Walking with Ramona. Here are some photos of sights you'll see along the route, and a few glimpses of Portland 100 years ago that you can enjoy in your imagination as you read and explore.

186`|Greetings and Love. I'm Cody ChesnuTT.I'm releasing a new album. The title of this album is Landing On A Hundred.Landing on a hundred. What does that mean?Landing on something truthful. Landing on something purposeful...something meaningful.This body of work is extremely meaningful to me because it represents the journey I have been on since I last released an album. To give you a little history about this record, it was recorded in Memphis, TN at Al Green's old studio, Royal Studios. It was also recorded in Cologne, Germany at a studio by the name of SuPow which is owned and run by a great friend of mine, the co- producer of the album, Patrice Bart-Williams.Words cannot describe or express how excited I am about this music and I am doing this Kickstarter project so that you can participate in getting the music to you - getting the music out to the people.In exchange for joining me on this journey, I would like to share with you some exclusive personalized items.Behind The Scenes In-Studio Sneak Peek: Additional Package Info:***PLEASE NOTE: All Landing On A Hundred vinyl LP packages also come with a digital download of the album.******All $50 pledges and above have the choice between the Landing On A Hundred vinyl LP package or CD.***Black Skin No Value EP: Black Skin No Value is a bridge body of work that speaks to an issue that is still very prevalent in our society - the value that is placed on black life.Custom Eco-Friendly T-Shirt: Sustainability is important to me - sustainability of people and the sustainability of communities. When we speak about being eco-friendly, we are addressing the preservation of life itself. T-shirt design will be inspired from the Landing On A Hundred song, "I've Been Life."

187`Why Sideclick? None of the popular streaming remotes have the ability to power on and off your TV or control volume. A 2nd or sometimes 3rd remote is always needed. Sideclick is a universal remote attachment that snaps onto your streaming remote, allowing you to control the basic functions of your TV and your streaming device all-in-one. Sideclick is available in Black or Silver and compatible with the following streaming devices. Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick, Google Nexus Player, and Apple TV. REWARDS Features The following animation demonstrates how the same Sideclick can be snapped onto multiple streaming remotes using different adapter clips. This is beneficial because if you decide to upgrade or change your streaming device, you can still use your Sideclick, you just need a new adapter clip for your new streaming remote. From Amazon Fire TV Stick to Google Nexus Player: Available Adapter ClipsRoku - All 2014 and 2015 Models Supported Apple TV Amazon Fire TV Stick Amazon Fire TV Google Nexus Player How Sideclick worksSideclick uses infrared learning technology to program each button. Programming is as easy as pointing your device's remote at Sideclick and pressing a few buttons. The entire process takes less than a minute. Any device using IR technology can be programmed as a button on Sideclick. So say you want to use the POWER button to power on and off your TV but you want to program Sideclick's volume controls to work your sound bar or reciever, you can easily do so. If you don't need the channel up/down option, you could program the up arrow to be your MENU option and the down arrow to MUTE. We give you 8 buttons, program them however you want. Each Sideclick model takes 2 AAA batteries.A streaming accessory for everyone Having Sideclick attached to your streaming remote makes navigating the TV easy for anyone. Especially kids, grandparents, and guests. Schedule About the CreatorSideclick was invented and designed by mechanical engineer, Brett Epstein. Brett has always had a passion for product design and has over 10 years of engineering design experience ranging from consumer products to jet engines. Brett's family recently cut the cord, eliminated their cable provider, and purchased a Roku. While Brett loved the device and the sleekness of the remote, he hated the fact that in order to sit down and watch TV, he needed 2 remotes in his hand: one to control the Roku and one to control the volume. After some research, he realized that this basic functionality was lacking in all streaming TV devices and he knew that if he could design something for each of the top selling streaming devices, it would become a must-have accessory for streamers.The first Sideclick Prototype Work in Progress Also on the Sideclick team is Brett's wife, Jenn, handling everything from customer service, social media, and marketing. Daughters, Brenna and Lily, serve as quality control testers.
188`You can still pre-order and buy AirDog here: www.airdog.com AIRDOG ON REUTERSWatch latest BBC TECH NEWS episode about AirDogBloomberg TV Taking Stock interview with AirDog CEOCNET's Daily Tomorrow take on AirDog AirDog is a small, agile, foldable quadcopter, especially designed for filmmakers and action sports enthusiasts who use GoPro cameras.Like its canine namesake, AirDog automatically follows you wherever you go, whatever you do. It s not bothered by pelting rain, freezing temps, massive waves, or freaking insane places. AirDog doesn t say no. It just follows, flying right along. AirDog is your sidekick, just in case you can t rent a helicopter plus professional photographer to take a video of your black diamond run. AirDog is your personal training assistant, allowing you to review what you re doing right, and where you need to improve. AirDog can transport you to views that you never thought possible. AirDog can persuade others to join you in your extremes.Just strap the AirLeash (tracker device) on your wrist or helmet, and the AirDog is ready to follow you. Smartphone is only for adjusting advanced settings. GoPro App provides live video stream to your phone. Inside, AirDog is really complex technology. But using and controlling AirDog is really simple.Here s the basic ideaAirDog follows a signal from the programmable tracker - AirLeash. We could use a smartphone, but you need more precise tracking for actions sports. So we designed AirLeash.The AirLeash is a small waterproof computerized tracker with clever software and sensors inside. It sends signals to the AirDog, indicating exact movement trajectory.It may look bulky now, but as soon as we start production it will be half the size and with multiple attachment opportunities (helmet, snow-googles, wrist, bike handle-bar, etc) AirLeash shown in this picture is current working prototype. It is going to be two times smaller when we launch production. The drone performs inflight calculations to correct its flying pattern, and points the camera at the user wearing AirLeash.Takeoff and landing is completely autonomous, freeing you to focus on your performance. It will land at the end of your track, or return to the takeoff spot when the battery begins to run low. An alarm on the AirLeash tells you when AirDog s battery is too low to continue.We spent countless caffeine-fueled hours, hacking intelligent flight code algorithms. The result is functionality that allows AirDog to follow you while you re riding down the slope or flipping around on a halfpipe. You don t have to worry about controlling the camera.Strap it on, cue it up, and do epic things. There are six Follow modes that you can configure and control with your AirLeash and smartphone app. Each one is a great choice and will deliver stunning results, regardless of your sport. You ll probably want to use all six. 1. Auto-follow. Will work with almost any sports. In this mode AirDog will follow you repeating exactly your movement trajectory while maintaining its position in preset distance and altitude from you. It will follow you at speeds up to 40 mph.2. Relative position follow. In this mode AirDog will maintain constant offset relative to magnetic north from the rider. For example, you can set it to keep a 10 meter distance at 4 meters high to the east from your position. Even when you change your direction, the AirDog will stay at the same preset angle from you. We suggest this mode for straight line wakeboard cable parks, surfing, and some other sports.3. Follow track. This is the safest way to operate AirDog. Simply go for one lap with AirLeash and it will record your track. Then adjust AirDogs trajectory to your liking in smartphone app. AirDog will repeatedly fly over the exact set trajectory and the camera will be continually adjusted to aim at the rider.This is the most creative mode where you can become a true director of your movie. Adjust AirDog's trajectory to avoid obstacles like buildings or trees. You can even make it to shoot you from different angle on different spots/kickers in the track. It might sound complicated, but its a simple few tap process in AirDog smartphone app.4. Hover and Aim. The Hover and Aim setting allows AirDog to stay in one position above the ground, but constantly directing the camera at the AirLeash. This setting is perfect for tight places such as smaller skateparks, narrow forest trails, or for activities such as bungee jumping or base jumping, where clearance from equipment is important. 5. Circle. In this setting, AirDog makes circular rotations on a set radius and altitude, keeping the camera aimed at the AirLeash. This for slow speed or static shots to show impressive view around you.6. Look down. The most simple mode but can produce very stunning results. Simply "walk" your AirDog above a ramp or kicker where you are about to throw some epic tricks and with push of a button it will freeze its position and aim camera straight down. Now make sure you don't go too high.Not satisfied with all these amazing options? No worries.We ll always be adding new flight modes through firmware and app updates. We depend on user feedback to continually develop Airdog into something that s jaw-dropping and awe-inspiring.The AirDog is designed to go farther and higher than you thought possible. If you ve ever wanted to shoot an edgy music video from off a cliff, the AirDog is your solution. If you re shooting an indie movie, and want some clutch aerial shots for the car chase scene, the AirDog is happy to oblige.Obstacle Avoidance Our team of engineers has started development of a software based and community driven obstacle avoidance solution. It means that you will be able to define a 3 dimensional "no-fly zones" using our AirDog app. This will enable use of AirDog even in places where simple following wouldn't be possible or would be dangerous. AirDog community generated "no-fly zone" maps of your favorite wakeboarding cable parks, MX tracks, bike trails, snow-parks and ski resorts and other unimaginable places will be stored in a Cloud and available for download to all AirDog community members. So whenever you come to a place where someone has made a "no-fly zone" map - you simply download it, sync it with your AirDog and you are ready for a safe flight.There can't be too much safety when we are talking about drones. We are really excited to be able to implement this safety feature already in the first version of AirDog. And this is just the beginning. We have plenty of rad ideas and concepts on our roadmap and by becoming the owner of the AirDog you are putting a bet on the most advanced personal drone out there. Here is little longer story about why we created AirLeash The AirDog uses a unique dedicated tracker called AirLeash that guides and controls the AirDog in flight. Why did we invent a new device? Why not just use a smartphone app? A year ago when we started developing the AirDog, we thought it would be a great idea to make AirDog follow a smartphone. We abandoned this idea really quickly. Here s why. 1. Smarphone's Poor Usability in Many Sports Have you ever tried to use your smartphone while surfing a huge wave? Yeah, the water might be a problem. How about using it while executing a cab 5 double grab? Those gloves would kind of get in the way. What about emergency situations, where terminating flight and landing the AirDog is important? A smartphone was simply not an option if we wanted to maintain safety or efficiency. 2. Lack of Vital Sensors for Precise Auto-follow In testing, we discovered that average smartphone GPS accuracy in a horizontal plane is about 5-10 meters. The margin of error doubles when measuring altitude.We realized that if we wanted a precise flight tracker, we needed extremely high level sensors. In addition, we would have to develop complicated sensor fusion algorithms to calculate and predict movement trajectory while keeping the camera aimed at rider all the time.Technologically, no smartphone has such capabilities. 3. Limited WiFi and Bluetooth range Different smartphones have different ranges, but it was clear that anything beyond 30-50 meters was not possible. This can be problem when you re surfing out in the ocean 350 meters from the drone, and want it to launch and come to you. Or, let s say you re riding downhill at 30 mph, and the drone just loses signal. You could potentially lose your drone forever! The stringent standards of AirDog required something with long range power. As amazing as smartphones are, they simply can t meet the high demands of many action sports. In true innovation style, we ditched our idea, went back to the drawing board, and created a solution. The result is better than we hoped. It s an easy-to-use, sturdy, reliable, long range wireless transmission and custom-developed tracker. It s called AirLeash. What do you get when you throw aviation experts, entrepreneurs, programmers, developers, and extreme sports fanatics into a box, and shake it up?You get us. We re kind of a quirky group. Our team at all its glory We love doing something fanatical like MX, wakeboarding, snowboarding, kitesurfing, skating, surfing, or other daredevil stunts. But when we get sort of serious, we re cooking up technology that s just as extreme as the action sports we love.AirDog is the product of years of development, the pinnacle of drone technology, the apex of sports videography. (And it took a heck of a lot of coffee.)Now, we re ready to introduce this mind-blowing technology to extreme sports fans all over the world. This invention is a dream come true. If you re already an experienced remote control (RC) pilot, you ll love Airdog s manual flight features. Although AirDog boasts fully autonomous flight modes, you can also use it for FPV (First Person View) or indoor video shooting with your RC transmitter. Simply connect any TX module that supports PPM mode and has more than 6 channels, and fly AirDog completely manually.But there s more! You can combine AirDog s auto-follow feature with manual control. Simply attach the AirLeash tracker to the object you want to shoot car, boat, animal, whatever and manually turn follow mode on or off whenever you want to switch to or from manual mode. This way, you can use the auto-follow tracker with enhanced RC maneuvers to make circular fly-around moves at the precise radius and speed. With this amazing combination of auto-follow and manual control, AirDog is a total game changer in aerial video shooting. You won t believe the creative possibilities. So you want to make videos that look drop dead awesome, professional, and really top-notch. We get that.We designed AirDog, while chanting the mantra stable, stable, stable. Okay, maybe it wasn t exactly like that, but you get the idea. We think stability is important, and we obsessed over it. AirDog uses 2 axis gyro-stabilized gimbal with the following features to make sure that your aerial videos are as stable as a tripod on a granite slab. Here s what we engineered:- Auto pitch and yaw - camera will always be pointed to the tracker;- Horizon alignment (roll stabilization);- Vibration isolation;- AirDog is the only drone that carries GoPro in its protective casing, your camera will be happy for that. In other words, your GoPro footage is stable as anything, even while airborne, even while flying at 40 mph, and even while tracking your progress on the slalom.To use AirDog, simply attach your GoPro to the drone s gimbal and you re ready for stable action shots. Early gimbal prototype test demonstrates camera stability. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 AirDog has its own app (iOS & Android), giving you full control of the device. AirDog can operate with AirLeash only, but app let's you control more advanced features.With the app, you can control the distance, height, and angle. You can create custom flight paths of your favorite tracks and map out shooting presets. Smartphone integration means that total flight control is just a tap away.

191`Do you want a smart jumprope? I don t know, but after seeing the video below, you probably will this thing displays your workout stats right in front of your eyes. - Digital TrendsSmart Rope: The Evolution of a Classic Smart Rope is an LED-embedded jump rope that works with your smartphone, creating an anywhere, anytime fitness experience. We ve created a true active fitness wearable that brings the best in new tech to a tried-and-true workout, consistently recommended by the health and wellness community. Tangram is bringing the jump rope into the 21st century. - Crunch TheoryAs featured in: Why the jump rope? The humble jump rope has been hailed as one of the most efficient exercise tools in existence, yet it often takes a back seat to more advanced equipment. Tangram Factory is hoping to change this by upgrading its handles with sensors and adding LEDs to the rope itself. - Cool Hunting We re all looking to make our health a priority - eating right and being active. We re living longer and healthcare continues to be a huge expense for society at large. We know we need to work out more, but the time and money required don t always make it easy. Unfortunately, many workouts that look to fill that need are here today, gone tomorrow - just look at any Made for TV gadget or that huge setup in the basement that s being used for a coat hanger, collecting dust in our basement. The jump rope may be the most portable and convenient cardio tool available. Relearn how to use it and you ll be lean, spry, and well conditioned for life. - Men s FitnessJumping rope can be done just about anywhere, anytime. Think of all the reasons we don t work out - it s raining, we re too busy today, we don t want to add yet another monthly expense to the budget. If you have a few square feet and a few minutes, you can get an incredibly rewarding workout: 30 minutes of jump rope (10 x 3 min sessions) burns 480 calories at a moderate pace Works out the calves and leg muscles, shoulders and rear delts, abs, quads, hamstrings - just about every major muscle group Strong cardiovascular benefits but lower-impact than jogging Good for bone health Improves coordination, breathing efficiency You d have to run an eight-minute mile to work off more calories than you d burn jumping rope. - WebMDWhile the benefits of jumping rope are universally well-established, so are some of the drawbacks. It s easy to learn, but challenging to master. It s not easy to know how you re progressing, since people jump at different paces and we re all built differently. It s also a pretty solitary activity, so it can be a challenge to stay motivated. And with many recommended interval sessions requiring jumps in the thousands, it s almost impossible to keep an accurate count. How do we evolve the jump rope experience? We tackle the jump rope s fundamental challenges, and then empower our workout with technology and smart data. With each jump, Smart Rope displays jump data right before your eyes, creating a truly immersive workout experience that s fun - and just as important, provides information you ll actually use to get healthier."Although wearable devices have received significant attention for their ability to track an individual s physical activity, most smartphone applications are just as accurate." - Journal of the American Medical AssociationWhile there are plenty of wearable devices out there that can be used in fitness, nearly all of them are passive monitoring devices. The sensors in wearables are the same sensors that you already have in your smartphone - accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS. Smart Rope makes the actual workout smarter - not just a passive monitoring wearable, but an active fitness device. Rather than simply monitoring movement like most passive wearables, the smart rope incorporates the natural motion of skipping rope to accurately count jumps, track and recommend workout interval sessions, and calculate calories burned based on your body mass index (BMI). - DesignboomBecause Smart Rope works with your smartphone, we ll be able to upgrade functionality over time. To start, we ll focus on delivering these core features: Counting. It s simple enough to track how long you ve been jumping, and it s a good start. But everyone jumps at a different pace, and you can be sure that an elite boxer is going to be jumping a lot faster than someone just starting out. Keeping an accurate count of your jumps is important, but it s very difficult when you re counting into the hundreds and thousands - especially when you re concentrating on a strenuous workout. Smart Rope displays an accurate count at all times and keeps track of each workout with your smartphone. Calories. Burning fat and building muscle is central to many workouts. By entering your height and weight into the smartphone app, Smart Rope calculates your calories burned, using your BMI (body mass index) and jumps counted. In calorie mode, you ll see how many calories you re burning with each jump. Interval Training. We all know how helpful it can be to encourage each other while we re working out. Based on your BMI and jump rope ability, Smart Rope will provide you with goals and interval training recommendations. Our initial release will allow you to easily post your progress on Facebook, as well as challenge your other Smart Rope friends to workout goals. We ll be baking more social integration into Smart Rope with future software releases. What is Smart Rope? What really sets this new wearable apart from everything else that has been offered is the ability to show the user's stats in real-time on thin air. - Tech TimesProduct Design Our previous design work has won nearly every major accolade in the industry - if you ve ever used a Samsung TV recently, chances are you ve seen what we can do. Inspired by the natural flow and motion of the circular revolutions of jumping rope, we ve created a sleek, ultra-modern design that s simple and elegant. Instead of just showing a small jump counter on the handles, the Smart Rope uses 23 LED lights that actually display your jump count in mid-air while you re in motion. The display can show up to four digits, and can also be toggled to show how many calories you re burning, if you prefer a different sort of motivation. - TechCrunchWe ve embedded 23 high-quality LEDs into a proprietary, patent-pending FPCB (flexible printed circuit board) design. These LEDs can display up to four digits with clear visibility even in bright rooms, and eventually we ll be able to display things like icons and emojis with upcoming software releases. As you jump, the LEDs display your progress right before your eyes. They ll also illuminate as you power on and off the Smart Rope, and provide information about battery life. The sensor technology is housed in the Smart Rope handle. Instead of using a simple gyroscopic sensor like the ones in your smartphone or other passive monitoring wearables, we ve developed a proprietary magnetic sensor that precisely registers actual revolutions of the rope, or one complete jump. The Bluetooth 4.0 transmitter is also housed here, used to communicate with your smartphone. A single button is used to turn the Smart Rope on and off, pair the Smart Rope with your smartphone, and reset the device. Removing the button s rubber cover reveals the mini USB port, used for charging the Smart Rope with your smartphone charger or your computer s powered USB port. Aside from all the digital technology involved, we ve also elevated the physical design of the jump rope in a variety of ways. The rope is positioned at a 45 degree angle to the handle to encourage effortless, natural motion. Ball bearings are used to ensure fast, smooth revolutions. All materials are of premium quality and finish, with meticulous attention to detail. At launch, Smart Rope will be available in three sizes: Small (rope length 8 ft / 243 cm): best for jumpers 5 ft - 5 ft 4 in tall (152 - 163 cm tall) Medium (rope length 8 ft 6 in / 258 cm): best for jumpers 5 ft 5 in - 5 ft 9 in tall (165 - 175 cm tall) Large (rope length 9 ft / 274 cm): best for jumpers 5 ft 10 in - 6 ft 2 in tall (178 - 188 cm tall) X-Large (rope length 9 ft 5 in / 287 cm): best for jumpers 6 ft 3 in tall - 6 ft 7 in tall (191 - 201 cm tall) User Experience (UX) Our Smart Gym app works seamlessly with Smart Rope with two-way communication. Jumps counted and workout times are broadcast to the app for tracking and monitoring, while BMI data and workout goals entered into the app are broadcast to Smart Rope to craft your custom workout. Smart Gym works with multiple Smart Rope devices, although Bluetooth won t allow simultaneous pairing of multiple devices. This means your family (or your CrossFit team) can use different Smart Rope devices with a single smartphone. Keep accurate, detailed data of each workout. You ll see how many jumps you re taking with each interval session and how you re improving over time. In this mode, the LEDs will display each jump counted. By entering your height and weight, Smart Gym uses your BMI (body mass index) and each jump tracked by Smart Rope to calculate calories burned. Monitor calories burned by workout and totals per day and week. In this mode, the LEDs will display calories burned as you jump. Smart Gym takes your BMI and jump rope ability and recommends interval training workouts, based on published guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). You can easily post your progress on your Facebook page, and challenge your Smart Rope friends to workout goals. With future software upgrades, we ll be building in more and more functionality into Smart Gym. With your support, our long-term vision is to build out a robust platform that connects to a variety of active fitness wearables and provides a holistic view of health and wellness. We re already working hard on integration with Apple Health, Google Fit, and plan to develop integration with Apple Watch as soon as it s released. With your support It s been a long road getting to this point, but we re now at a place where we feel confident in securing support for the final steps in releasing Smart Rope to the public. We ve produced a working prototype - the handles perform beautifully, the LEDs display accurately and clearly, and we ve reduced the thickness of the rope itself to ensure the safe housing of the FPCB system and an ideal weight for efficient jumping. The prototype also pairs seamlessly via Bluetooth to our Smart Gym app and registers each count accurately. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Your funds will go directly to the final development of the Smart Rope and Smart Gym app, and the initial production run. We are continuing to fine tune the rope itself, ensuring flexibility and ideal thickness while protecting against impact and maintaining clear visibility. This is perhaps the most intricate part of the physical development process and our electrical engineers, product designers, and software developers are all hands on deck. The Smart Gym mobile platform has been wireframed and initial design is complete. We ll be completing software development as well as continuing rigorous testing to ensure seamless integration with Smart Rope hardware. We will also provide stand-alone functionality into Smart Rope, so the basic counting features can be used without a smartphone (and single workout sessions can be tracked and monitored into Smart Rope s memory, so it can be transferred to Smart Gym later). Portability is a great asset for Smart Rope, so we ll also be creating a compact, easy to use package for each Smart Rope. Project Timeline Smart Rope working prototype: Complete!

192`Out of print for decades, Visual Design in Action is one of the most beautiful books on modern graphic design. Written and designed by Ladislav Sutnar and published in 1961, it has been called a lost milestone" and a "treasure." With your help, we're going to create a perfect reprint of this iconic book and make it available again to the creative community. Sutnar is the most under-appreciated giant in design. Putting Visual Design in Action back into print will make that right. Stefan Sagmeister, graphic designer, Sagmeister & Walsh "Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action" (1961) While other 20th-century graphic designers are better known today, few have contributed in a more profound way to the literature of graphic design than the Czech migr Ladislav Sutnar (1897 1976). When he came to the United States in 1939, Sutnar brought with him a love for communicating information and he created an entire discipline that we now call information graphics, or data visualization. As a designer, he was ahead of his time. The book in which he laid out his graphic design principles grounded in rationality, with a focus on type and a sharply edited palette is Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action. Published in 1961 to accompany an exhibition of the same name, the book was was precisely designed by Sutnar himself and illustrated using his own work. The result was a publication that was not only rational but beautiful. Visual Design in Action has long been out of print, but it has never been forgotten by those who appreciate the way that ideas, design, and print production enduringly complement one another. "Spread from Visual Design in Action" illustrating the Addo-X identity campaign To create a new facsimile edition an exact reprint we have assembled a world-class team. The team includes, as editors, the renowned graphic design authority Steven Heller and the award-winning designer and filmmaker Reto Caduff, with printing and production guidance from the distinguished publisher Lars M ller, known for his expertise in facsimile reprints. The facsimile will be accompanied by a supplementary booklet featuring new writing on Sutnar by the editors as well as archival photographs and ephemera. If the project is funded, the facsimile and the booklet will be produced in fall 2015 by Lars M ller Publishers.Both the facsimile edition and supplementary booklet are authorized and supported by Radoslav Sutnar, a son of Ladislav Sutnar, who is dedicated to preserving his father's legacy. The project is coordinated by Designers & Books, as part of its new initiative to bring back into the public eye important out-of-print design books and to introduce them to new audiences.Who is Ladislav Sutnar? Ladislav Sutnar (1897-1976) at Sweet's Catalog Service, with the company logo he redesigned in the background, ca. 1960 As we move further away from the twentieth century, it would be a grave mistake to forget the great oak trees that we are all indebted to. The great oak trees that designed the roots, the branches, and the leaves of visual design in the twenty-first century. Ladislav Sutnar is such a tree. Richard Saul WurmanA native of Pilsen, Czech Republic, Ladislav Sutnar (1897-1976) gained fame in his homeland for his modern typography and exhibition design. He was also an industrial designer, creating glass- and tableware and even toys, as well as a noted design teacher at the State School of Graphic Arts in Prague. Following the Nazi occupation of his country, he immigrated to the United States in 1939, where he had come to design the Czech Pavilion for the New York World's Fair.In New York, he re-made himself primarily as a graphic designer. He was hired in 1941 as an art director by Knud L nberg-Holm at Sweet's Catalog Service, a leading distributor of trade and manufacturing catalogues, where he began the work for which he would become known in the United States during the 1940s and '50s. Detail from a spread in "Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action" In a 1994 article on the designer for Eye magazine, Steven Heller wrote:"Ladislav Sutnar was a progenitor of the current practice of information graphics, the lighter of a torch that is carried today by Edward Tufte and Richard Saul Wurman, among others. For a wide range of American businesses, Sutnar developed graphic systems that clarified vast amounts of complex information, transforming business data into digestible units. "He was the man responsible for putting the parentheses around American telephone area-code numbers when they were first introduced [by Bell]. As impersonal as the area-code design might appear, the parentheses were actually among Sutnar's signature devices, one of many he used to distinguish and highlight information. . . . Sutnar developed various typographic and iconographic navigational devices that allowed users to efficiently traverse seas of data. His icons are analogous to the friendly computer symbols used today."His work was so clearly organized and structured that he was able to communicate them to a U.S clientele despite the fact that English was not his first language. Spread from "Ladislav Sutnar" Visual Design in Action" illustrating branding for "Vera" scarves Until 1961, Sutnar worked at Sweet's mornings and free-lanced in the afternoons, creating advertising and identity campaigns for companies that ranged from Addo-X, a Swedish manufacturer of business machines, to the popular "Vera" scarves and Carr's, a shopping plaza. Spread from "Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action: showing identity campaign for Carr's shopping plaza "A designer's aim is always to intensify comprehension." Ladislav SutnarIn Sutnar, European avant-garde graphic design ideas met the needs of modern American life, raising graphic standards for business and industry. "Without efficient typography," he once commented, "the jet plane pilot cannot read his instrument panel fast enough to survive." Sutnar used grids, tabs, and geometric forms in his designs and he was enamored of the function and aesthetics of American punctuation marks. He is also credited with being among the first to use the double-page spread in publications to convey meaning across pages. Spread from "Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action" By the beginning of the 1960s, Sutnar was no longer working for Sweet's and he began to recede into the background of graphic design history. According to Steven Heller, "Sutnar s friends banded together to inform the business community about his work. The result was the traveling exhibition Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action, which was curated by Allon Schoener but meticulously designed by Sutnar himself." The exhibition was the basis for the book of the same name in which lies the legacy of a master designer.Sutnar was the recipient of many awards internationally and in the U.S. during his lifetime. For his influence on American graphic design, he was awarded an AIGA Medal in 1995, after his death in 1976. Today his work and his publications, including Visual Design in Action, are held by major institutions such as the Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum and The Museum of Modern Art, New York.The Original Visual Design in Action Spread from original "Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action" (1961) Sutnar did a huge service to designers by publishing Visual Design in Action. Today, the book retains its power as a practical manifesto and a guide to universal design principles. It is also a window into one of the great design minds of the twentieth century. Ellen Lupton, Senior Curator of Contemporary Design, Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design MuseumSutnar wrote and designed all aspects of the remarkable catalogue that accompanied the 1961 traveling exhibition of his work, "Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action."An exploration of his American information design work and theoretical ideas, the book was organized into three main sections: "Principles and Attributes," "US Information Design Progress," and Early Modern Design Concept." Spread from "Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action" Included is a preface by Mildred Constantine, then an associate curator at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, who wrote of the all-encompassing quality of Sutnar's design: "There is a force and meaningful consistency in Sutnar s entire body of work, which permits him to express himself with a rich diversity in exhibition design and the broad variations of graphic design. Sutnar has the assured stature of the integrated designer.

He called for elaborate specifications, including changes in paper, textures, and inks throughout the book. Spread from "Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action" His standards were so exacting that if Kickstarter had existed at the time he surely would have used it. When he could find no publisher willing to pay the high printing and production costs the book demanded, Sutnar paid Hastings House out of his own pocket for a limited edition of 3,000 copies. The book did not sell particularly well but the few rare copies that can be found today are highly prized. Why Reprint This Book? Cover of original "Visual Design in Action" We think the time is right (overdue, in fact) for reprinting the most important book by the "thinking person's designer." "It is the simple fact that what really makes a designer is using that other tool: the brain. Thinking has usually been underrated, overshadowed by style and noise. Ladislav Sutnar approached wicked design problems by thinking about them first, isolating the real issue: what needed to be communicated and to whom. Then he applied a visual style that is both illuminating and entertaining. Sutnar s approach and the ensuing visual style have all the trappings to make a serious comeback, so reprinting this fantastic book is a timely exercise." Erik Spiekermann, graphic and type designer, Edenspiekermann Steven Heller has said that Visual Design in Action is "arguably the most intellectually stimulating Modern design book since Jan Tschichold's Die Neue Typographie."And there is the simple fact that Sutnar's book is not only rational but beautiful. "Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action" (1961) The Facsimile Edition and New Supplementary BookletOur facsimile edition of Ladislav Sutnar: Visual Design in Action will replicate exactly the specifications, materials, and visual and tactile qualities of the original book, under the guidance of Lars M ller. Printing in eleven colors (10 Pantone colors plus black), our aim is to produce a "perfect reprint" one that Sutnar would have been proud of.Accompanying the facsimile will be a supplementary booklet that will set Sutnar in context and shed new light on the designer through archival photographs, correspondence, and other materials. It will feature an introduction by Reto Caduff and a new essay by Steven Heller that explores Sutnar as a great "philosopher, maker, and critic of design." The booklet will be 32 pages, saddle-stitched, and the same dimensions as the facsimile. A copy of booklet will be included with each copy of the facsimile edition.

193`New Reward Alert! We've added a new prize at the $100 level: Receive the limited edition 11x17 poster created exclusively for this campaigned SIGNED by Marco Collins, director Marq Evans and composer/Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready!If you already pledged $100 or more you'll be automatically upgraded to this prize (unless otherwise notified) and if you have already pledged a lessor amount you can raise it by the remaining balance and be upgraded to the signed version.THE FILMBefore the Internet made sourcing new music and rising bands a simple matter of keystrokes and RSS feeds, there was the radio DJ. No one epitomized this role like Marco Collins. The Glamour & The Squalor is the story of Marco Collins, one of America's last great rock radio DJs and a musical tastemaker that changed our culture. He was the on-off switch for an artist s potential career and was the gatekeeper credited for helping break the likes of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Beck, Weezer, Garbage and countless others.The film features an original score by Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready and interviews with McCready, Kurt Cobain, Carrie Brownstein, Ben Gibbard, Shirley Manson, Patty Schemel, Matt Pinfield and many more of the most prolific artists of the twenty-first century!Marco s story is inspiring and universal. He turned his passion for music into a significant lifetime of work and battled some seriously determined demons along the way. And he s still standing. SO WHAT'S UP? We have been making The Glamour & The Squalor since 2012 and are beyond thrilled about its World Premiere at the Seattle International Film Festival to a SOLD OUT audience on June 3. The film is a labor of love and its completion has involved so many friends, family members, fans and supporters. We feel so lucky and honored to have been able to make this film, but we still need a little help to ensure that the film is seen by the widest audience possible.In order to distribute the film throughout the world, we need to raise some additional funds for things like marketing, public relations, festival travel and licensing the final music rights in perpetuity.You - our community, our team - have helped carry this project so far, and we're hoping you're able to step up to the plate one more time so we can release the film beyond Seattle and throughout the world! THE CAMPAIGN Our first Kickstarter campaign was a success. We raised over $50,000 to bring the film to life. This time around, we're trying something different. Our approach is definitely an experiment and, to our knowledge, one that has never been taken on Kickstarter, but we believe so much in our supporters and think it's the best way to launch the campaign.This time, every dollar counts. And we mean it. To prove it, we've set the campaign goal at just $1. Every dollar raised gets us that much closer to our dream of releasing the film worldwide and making sure as many people as possible can see it.Beyond that, we are offering just one reward - an 11x17 limited edition poster of The Glamour & The Squalor EXCLUSIVE to this Kickstarter campaign - at a minimum pledge of $1.Yeah, that's right. $1. The limited edition poster EXCLUSIVE to this campaign. "So how much do you actually need?" you're probably asking. While every single dollar pledged sincerely helps get us into distribution, we'd really like to raise at least $30,000 to pay for the expenditures referenced above. Any amount raised over that allows us to reach an even wider audience for our film. Let's see how high we can take this together!Pledge what you want, pledge what you can. We are so grateful and appreciate any amount pledged. Just know that every dollar helps. Whether you're donating $1 or $1,000, we appreciate your contribution! We want anybody and everybody to be part of our team to help release this movie. You're part of our story when you make a pledge. We've made it this far together and are so close to being able to show this movie to the world. Please support our campaign to raise funds to distribute THE GLAMOUR & THE SQUALOR!

Just use the buttons below the video to post.We'd also love for you to stay in touch: Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. Sign up for our Newsletter. Thank you!Wow! We reached our minimum funding goal and are well on our way to getting girls (and boys!) building! Let's keep going, because the more people who pledge and pre-order Build & Imagine StoryWalls play-sets, the bigger impact we'll have on girls in STEM.So let's get StoryWalls into the hands of as many kids as we can!Meet Build & Imagine StoryWalls Recommended for ages 4-10. Each Build & Imagine play-set is composed of painted wooden panels, called StoryWalls, and accompanying wooden dolls. Children can combine the StoryWalls into any structural design they choose, and they magnetically snap together. The illustrations on each wall artfully combine to create scenes that act as a launching pad for the child s imagination. Play testing with an early prototype at the Children's Creativity Museum. Sisters build together. The InspirationIn the spring of 2013 Laurie Peterson founded Build & Imagine after noticing that the kind of play experiences she loved as a child (building, problem solving, designing and experimenting) were not reflected in the girls section of the toy store. She aims to create construction toys that her daughter -- and your daughters and sons -- will love. This campaign is raising support for Build & Imagine's first product line. Laurie's daughter plays with an early prototype. Why construction toys designed for girls?What we play with matters. Construction toys (also known as building toys) are the hottest category in the toy industry, yet historically 90% of these toys have targeted boys. Girls are missing out because construction toys help to develop important spatial reasoning and design skills that are prerequisites to succeed in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). These are fields in which women make up only 24% of the workforce, leading to what the President has termed a gender gap in innovation . Toys can make a difference.The design principle Laurie uses to get girls excited about construction is simple: building should facilitate imaginative play. Rather than designing with abstract bricks and shapes, children construct scenes that are as rich and beautiful as a storybook. We re launching with three play-sets Each Build & Imagine StoryWalls play-set comes with illustrated dolls and magnetic panels that children can combine into any configuration they choose. The first three play-sets work together in a coastal theme. Malia s Beach House Front Door to Malia's House Best friends Emily and Malia love hanging out in Malia s modern beach front eco-house after school.

196`Good olive oil is like good wine. The specific variety of the fruit matters. The terroir the land and environment where it is grown matters. The production process matters. They all work in concert to create a unique taste and experience. Just as you enjoy exploring the depth and individuality of fine wine, we hope to introduce you to a similar experience with Auzoud extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).OUR STORYI was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud means olive in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud Waterfalls in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco Ouzoud s waters contribute to the region s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation. It has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping other family members and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma.After moving to the U.S. several years ago, I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region.THE HISTORY OF OLIVES IN THE OUZOUD REGIONAmazingly, the Ouzoud region has some of the oldest olive groves in the world. The ancient Romans were the first connoisseurs of Moroccan olive oil. They established the trading city of Volubilis in the 1st Century A.D. in northern Morocco, from which they could oversee their olive harvest. Old Olive Tree in Ouzoud Region Our olive oil is produced from the Picholine cultivar of olive. Picholines were originally grown in the south of France, but they have found a natural second home in Morocco s shared Mediterranean climate, where they are the dominant variety. The small farmers in Ouzoud have harvested it for generations.Olive oil made from the Picholine variety is recognized for its beautiful light golden color and fresh aroma. It will win you over with its soft, right, fruity and slightly peppery taste. WE OFFER THE HIGHEST QUALITY EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL You ve probably noticed that there are an overwhelming number of olive oils to choose from in the store, but did you know that a 2010 study by the University of California, Davis found that two-thirds of the biggest imported brands failed to meet the requirements to actually label their olive oil as extra virgin ? These companies often source their olive oil in massive quantities without knowing where it comes from, how it was grown or how it was processed. They often mix different varieties of olive oil to create a homogenous flavor that loses any sense of the individual profile and personality of the olives it was grown from. In some cases the oil is also diluted with cheap vegetable oils, like peanut or sunflower. Some producers also use stale olive oil, which may taste rancid. Not only are these practices fraudulent for consumers but they are also setting the tone for a general acceptance of low-quality oil and open the door to other major concerns, such as food allergies/sensitivities. In order to receive U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) classification as an extra virgin olive oil, the oil must be pressed mechanically without the use of any alteration methods. The acidity level must be 0.8 or less for every 100 grams. During the pressing stage, when the oil is squeezed from the olive fruit, the temperature must remain constant at 80 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). At Auzoud we make sure to meet these requirements during our process and with lab testing. The result is a fantastic olive oil with very low acidity and a full, rich flavor. We want to change the way people think about and experience extra virgin olive oil, a staple in so many of our diets. I have participated in every stage of the process from hand picking, pressing and bottling. Auzoud Extra Virgin Olive Oil PROUDLY PARTNERED WITH MOROCCO S SMALL FARMERS In addition to offering only the finest extra virgin olive oil, Auzoud is committed to working with low-income farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Auzoud is proud to partner with the Ben Youssef Farmers Cooperative, which was founded in 2010 to support better social conditions for women, youth and agricultural workers in the region. Partnering With Ben Youssef Cooperative The co-op helps empower local farmers obtain higher prices for their olives and a more sustainable livelihood for them and their families. All of the olives we use are sourced directly from this group. There are currently over a hundred co-op members and many more farmers are working with the organization to participate in the next harvest. One of the co-op s missions is to educate members about sustainable olive farming. To this end, Auzoud and the co-op are working together to obtain organic certification for all members. The money raised through this campaign will help Auzoud expand the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. MORE THAN JUST OLIVE OIL In addition to our oil, we sell batches of pitted green and black olives cured in olive oil. They are delicious! Oil Cured Picholine Black Olives Picholine Green Olives Pitted USE OF FUNDSCustomers and staff of the specialty stores and retailers where we sell our products say they love the unique taste and that we ve changed the way they experience and think about olives and olive oil.Auzoud has already partnered with several retail outlets, and is sold in a number of specialty and natural stores. Many more stores plan to carry Auzoud products but only if we can bring in a new shipment this fall. Demand is high but we have to be able to meet the minimum quantities at which many stores will only agree to deal with us. This will require a significant expansion from the product numbers we were able to bring to market in the past.Funds from this campaign will be used to purchase olives from the Ben Youssef Farmers Co-op. We will also be working with the co-op in its modern facility to press and bottle the oil for shipment to the U.S. Savings and proceeds from previous sales will be used to finance shipping costs. Any funds in excess of our goal will be used to prepare the olives for retail sale, which includes packaging in glass jars and labeling. As with our oil, we already have a waitlist for these. Additional funds will also be used to grow our online presence and online sales capabilities, so that we can continue to grow our company and the pool of farmers we work with.Of course, we will keep you informed about the progress of the project. SPREAD THE WORD Thank you for taking the time to learn about our project. We appreciate your interest and hope you will join us! If you know of anyone who loves quality food, sustainable and natural agricultural production, fair trade, or who might otherwise be interested in our work, please share this campaign with them. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

When a big spill ruined an important computer of ours, we set out to create a better, smarter mug - a mug that would stand up to accidental knocks and bumps. After years of development, we came up with Mighty Mug, the world's only mug powered by our patented Smartgrip Technology. When you knock into other mugs they fall over and spill on your computer, papers, phone, pants and basically ruin your day. Mighty Mug is different as it grips to your desk when knocked into, but lifts naturally like any other mug. The magic is in Mighty Mug's patented Smartgrip base. Mighty Mug creates a super powerful airlock once placed down, but automatically releases when you need a sip.There are no buttons to push or levers to pull to get Mighty Mug to work. Mighty Mug is not a suction cup nor is it a magnet, but rather something entirely new.Mighty Mug will grip to any smooth, flat, solid surface like most desks and tables. The most amazing part about Mighty Mug is that when you go in for a sip it lifts 100% naturally. Grips when hit but lifts when you need a sip. We are a team of mechanical engineers and industrial designers who have spent the last 3 years developing Mighty Mug and it's patented Smartgrip technology. We hope that you love Mighty Mug and it's innovative solution. Mighty Mug Prototype Grip Tricks We believe that once you try Mighty Mug you are going to be blown away. Thank you for take the time to check out Mighty Mug and please share with anyone that hates mugs that fall and spill. Be Mighty, Jayme-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Last year we launched our first Mighty Mug travel mug and are now seeking to expand with new models. The tooling for production on each of these items has recently been completed and backers will receive their Mighty Mug as soon as September/October of this year. With your help, we hope to offset some of these production costs and get the first run onto the desks of Kickstarter Backers.

198`It begins!!!!As many of you may know, we at Murder By Death put out all of our own vinyl records. And you have always supported us with this endeavor. Thank you! Now, some people might think vinyl records are an outdated technology but we feel very strongly, and we think you do too that vinyl not only delivers the highest quality sound experience, but can also be a thing of beauty. Presenting the art in glorious large format makes each record a keepsake and a treasure. OK, I'll get to the point. We want to continue to manufacture the best and most beautiful vinyl records out there and that ain't cheap. We have... a few years under our belts, so we have a lot of releases to keep in production. $$$$! We are particularly proud of our latest recorded album "Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon" (Produced by John "Faberg Eggs" Congleton) and we are teaming up with the fine folks at Bloodshot Records to release the CD and Digital THIS SEPTEMBER 25th... but we are still putting out the vinyl ourselves. And this time, we want to do it BIG!!! We really can't wait for you to hear it, and we really want you to check out the vinyl. Lets not forget the art. The art is freaking great. You're going to want this beauty in your hands.We understand that music itself is becoming less of a commodity. We don't feel like getting upset about this, we feel like making music that we think is missing from the world and we want to share it with people who give a care. We still need to make enough money to support 5 musicians ("We've got five mouths to feed!"-Total Recall) so we decided to get creative. What is and will always be a commodity is EXPERIENCES. Real, live memories. A show. A trip. An adventure. We are often asked to play weddings, parties, funerals. We would love to - really. Let's try to make it work. Often we are asked "why don't you cover this or that song?" OK, dare us. Want to head out with us on an adventure? Yep. So this is it! We found (we think) the perfect outlet to address this need we all have to EXPERIENCE each other and MUSIC, right here. LET'S DO THIS!!!! Oh look. It's us. WHAT DO YOU GET FROM SUPPORTING THIS KICKSTARTER?In addition to our intense gratitude and your new-found superior feeling of godliness ANY contributions will receive a DL SENT TO YOU IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS FROM THE NEW ALBUM. You will get an email with a link to download. You'll also get free downloads of any of the "MBD WILL COVER ANY SONG YOU WANT" covers assuming people buy those. Every physical order will come with a knick-knack from the band: a poster, a thank you letter, a comic book, stickers, whatever. Lastly, you will also have the knowledge that you are a superior person who supports the arts and saved the world. Oh, and if you donate over $100 you get this bitchin' patch!Patch image coming soon!WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHO WE ARE?Known for their uniquely brooding sound that frequently conjures desolate imagery, on Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon Murder By Death capture a familiar tone but also explore new territory, adding a further refined sophistication and even richer, full-bodied sound. The varied album ranges musically from the spooky and spare opener My Hill , to the rough, rousing sing-along Hard World , to the booming, aching waltz of Ghost Fields. Songs like the cinematic Lost River start hushed before rising to a lush crescendo, while No Oath, No Spell maintains a dramatic, bluesy swing, and first single I Came Around rumbles and rollicks with a hard-charging, barroom flair. Singer Adam Turla s cavernous baritone tells shadowy small-town stories throughout, the songs oftentimes-upbeat veneer belying a sordid undercurrent. Across Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon Sarah Balliet s sonorous cello and Scott Brackett s multiple instruments (backing vocals, piano, trumpet, and accordion, to name a few) weave irreplaceable accents, and Dagan Thogerson s robust drums and Matt Armstrong s inventive bass lines create a resounding low end. Murder By Death wrote Bitter Drink, Bitter Moon their first album featuring contributions from Brackett (formerly of Okkervil River and Shearwater) throughout most of 2011, testing and reworking the songs in Turla s basement-turned-practice-space. In January, they traveled to Dallas, TX to record with producer John Congleton (Explosions In The Sky, St. Vincent, Black Mountain) over three weeks. DAYTROTTER puts it "The stories that Turla writes and that the group brings to life - with a ruckus and the sound of a rambling train - are loaded with times and people that are the makings for the things that you get tattooed on your arms and shoulders, knowing that they're going to be the ones that stick with you until they are pale green and barely legible, as old age creeps onto the weathered skin. They are the fights that you lost that still taste salty at the corners of your mouth. They are the divorces and the foreclosures. They are the times when you feel like the only thing that's going to make anything feel better is to finish off that 12-pack yourself. They are the times that are your dark meanings, your true meanings."WHAT COMES WITH THE NEW SPECIAL EDITION OF THE VINYL? Wait til you see the final. We will add a picture of the exact product later... DIE-CUT COVER, SO YOU CAN SEE THROUGH TO THE TRANSLUCENT VELLUM INTERIOR SLEEVE. THE RECORD ITSELF IS 180 GRAM AND COLORED TO LOOK LIKE A MOON.

Sometimes the songs you don't expect to work turn out even better. OK ONE ADDENDUM- IT SHOULD BE A SONG THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY RELEASED, PLEASE DON"T ASK US TO RECORD YOUR SONG, AS THAT KIND OF GOES AGAINST THE IDEA WE ARE TRYING TO GET ACROSS HERE. TELL ME MORE ABOUT THESE HOUSE SHOWS YOU WILL PLAY...Ok. We think this one is gonna rule. Some basic answers. WHAT AM I BUYING WITH ALL THIS BIG MONIES? Well, you kinda choose. Adam and Sarah can come and do a show just the two of them. Or maybe you want all 5 band members. We play for an hour or so, a set list you choose in advance (you pick 12 songs, and we will pick the rest). It will most likely be an acoustic show to avoid police/ noise complaints. But if you have a spot that we aren't concerned about that, maybe it's a full electric rock show. We will hang out and party, but obviously, depending on the day, we eventually gotta take off at some point to get to the next show etc etc etc. It's probably regular show length. Like 3-4 hours. YES YOU CAN POOL YOUR MONEY TOGETHER WITH A BUNCH OF FRIENDS/ FAMILY. But please don't charge for the show. Ok, maybe you can pass around the hat or take donations or whatever. Maybe this is a gift for a couple. Or maybe the timing works out that we could play your wedding. Worth a shot. WHY SO EXPENSIVE? First of all, lets not forget kickstarter fees, transportation, accommodations, travel costs, crew, etc etc etc. We know a lot of you have asked us to play your events, and ask how much. We also know this is a lot of money, but this is what it will take to make a general price that includes anywhere in North America. If you are from somewhere other than North America, feel free to contact us, as we are totally open to playing your fine city in a far off land. YOU DON'T AUTOMATICALLY HAVE TO PAY MORE IF YOU ARE FROM FAR AWAY. IN FACT, WE LOVE TRAVELLING TO DISTANT LANDS. It just might take a moment to get us all there. Maybe you wanna do a destination show. That could be awesome. Email us at mbdband@gmail.com to discuss any serious inquiries. WE WILL ROCK YOU. PROBABLY ACOUSTICALLY. I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE CEDAR POINT TRIP...We will arrange a time that works for both you and us. It will happen either this fall or next spring depending on what we can work out together. We book you and a friend flights/transportation to arrive in Cleveland/Sandusky, Ohio. The band picks you up in our tour van "The Pork Chop Express 5". We check you into your hotel in Cleveland. Then we sally forth to Cedar Point. Don't bother bringing cash- that's what your donation covers. We take you around the best roller coaster park in the world http://www.cedarpoint.com/ like kids in a candy shop. Play your heart out at silly games, ski ball, ring toss, video games, whatever! We dish out the cash and tokens. Ride 20 roller coasters. Eat junk food 'till you get sick, then ride 20 more roller coasters and get sick again. Gonna rule. A photographer will come along and document the whole day and will print up a hardcover book for you. 1 of a kind (OK, maybe we will get one too). Grab some dinner at a nice joint, and then we drop you off at your hotel, all tuckered out from your big day. Contact mbdband@gmail.com if you have any concerns/serious inquiries.HEAR OUR PLEA! WE MUST RIDE ROLLER-COASTERS WITH YOU! RIDE ROLLER COASTERS WITH US! I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE KENTUCKY BOURBON TRAIL BLOWOUT TRIP...First of all, you and your companion need to be 21+. We fly/ arrange transport for you and a friend to Louisville, KY. You'll be picked up in a limo with MBD inside and will do a tour of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail http://kybourbontrail.com/index.php . Basically you visit distilleries with us all day and get wasted and hang. We check you into your fancy-ass hotel at http://www.21cmuseumhotels.com/louisville/ and then eat at their amazing restaurant. We'll try not to stink up the joint, but hey, I said we'll TRY. Let's see where the night takes us. Like the Cedar Point trip, we arrange the date of this trip with you and your companion- something that works for all of us. But we feel sooner is better than later, as you might die of anticipation, and we don't want that. This would be a rad gift for a wedding couple or something. Email mbdband@gmail.com with any serious inquiries/concerns. AND YEA, WE SHALL DRINK BOURBON EAT A FANCY DINNER WITH US AND THIS WALRUS LASTLY, WE PICKED SOME ODD ADVENTURES THAT SOUNDED FUN TO US.

199`UPDATE: Our 1st Behind the Scenes! Join us to get a year of this content! Zach? What is this?I was about to sign a typical financing deal in order to get the money to make "Wish I Was Here," my follow up to Garden State. It would have involved making a lot of sacrifices I think would have ultimately hurt the film. I ve been a backer for several projects on Kickstarter and thought the concept was fascinating and revolutionary for artists and innovators of all kinds. But I didn't imagine it could work on larger-scale projects. I was wrong. After I saw the incredible way Veronica Mars fans rallied around Kristen Bell and her show s creator Rob Thomas, I couldn t help but think (like I'm sure so many other independent filmmakers did) maybe there is a new way to finance smaller, personal films that didn t involve signing away all your artistic control.Financing an independent film the traditional way often means having to give away your right to the final cut, casting choices, location choices and cutting down your script to make it shoot-able on the cheapest budget possible. What if there is a different way?"If you don't like how things are, change it! You're not a tree." - Jim Rohn Ok, I'm intrigued. What's the story? Page 1... "Wish I Was Here" is the story of Aidan Bloom (played by me), a struggling actor, father and husband, who at 35 is still trying to find his identity; a purpose for his life. He and his wife are barely getting by financially and Aidan passes his time by fantasizing about being the great futuristic Space-Knight he'd always dreamed he'd be as a little kid.When his ailing father can no longer afford to pay for private school for his two kids (ages 5 and 12) and the only available public school is on its last legs, Aidan reluctantly agrees to attempt to home-school them.The result is some funny chaos, until Aidan decides to scrap the traditional academic curriculum and come up with his own. Through teaching them about life his way, Aidan gradually discovers some of the parts of himself he couldn't find. It was written by my brother, Adam, and me last summer. Adam and me. The Soundtrack:The Soundtrack to "Garden State" was more popular than I could have ever imagined. The album went platinum and won a Grammy. Music and score are very important to me, and I'll be using them in the same way in "Wish I Was Here." One of the cool things about being a backer is that you can get access to weekly song picks by me, and be the first group to stream the soundtrack. I don't have the rights to put any cool music on here, but here's me doing a fairly decent beat-box: Pre-visualization:I am lucky enough to be friends and collaborators with one of the greatest pre-visualization artists in the business, Colin Fix. Artists like Colin help filmmakers establish the look and tone of the locations and characters before going into production. "Wish I Was Here" has some very unique characters, and mine in particular has elaborate fantasies that I want to try to bring to life in a very specific way. When operating on a tight budget, it's super helpful to be able to gather around the art Colin and I have come up with in order to make sure the entire creative team is on the same page. A doodle of the Bloom Family I made for Colin: *Note: The film is NOT ANIMATED. These are character design sketches. Character Design Lineup by Colin Fix Colin painted these two frames as research for the look of Aidan's opening fantasy sequence. Aidan's fantasy-self has a flying robotic-squire: EXT. FANTASY-FOREST SEQUENCE - NIGHT by Colin Fix EXT. FANTASY-FOREST SEQUENCE - NIGHT by Colin Fix Since he's the only crew member that's already working, I put all my direction into Colin: Cinematography:Larry Sher has agreed to shoot the film. Larry shot "Garden State" and has since gone on to shoot all the "Hangover" movies, along with many other big comedies. Larry and I have very similar taste and together we established the look of GS. The amazing cinematographer Larry Sher and me: We were able to shoot Super 35 millimeter film on GS. In today's digital age, it's become harder and harder, and more expensive, to shoot film. If the budget permitted, I would shoot "Wish I Was Here" on film as well. There are several amazing digital systems we'd use if we couldn't afford film, but as a camera geek who went to film school, I'm sad film is going away. Only the biggest directors these days get a chance to shoot it.Production Design: A Production Designer is in charge of the overall look of the movie. They collaborate closely with the Costume Designer to ensure the film has a cohesive tone. They oversee all sets, set decoration, locations, props etc. If all goes as planned, "Wish I Was Here" will be designed by Judy Becker. Judy is one of the most amazing designers in the business. Here are some of her most recent production design credits: Silver Linings Playbook Girls (Pilot) Shame The Fighter Brokeback Mountain Garden State ;) Ok... Why Kickstarter? The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results." - Albert EinsteinI want you to be my financiers and my audience so I can make a movie for you with no compromises. I know it's risky, and I don't know if it's going to work, but here are a few reasons why I think it's worth it to fund via Kickstarter. Final Cut: "Final Cut" is the industry term for who has the final say on how the movie will be edited. A lot of financing deals require that the final cut go to the money people, NOT the director. Most films these days are tested in front of test audiences to see how an audience likes what you ve made. This is sometimes very helpful, as you can get a sense of when the pace is too slow or when certain jokes aren t as funny as you thought they were. However, it can also be destructive, as a financier with final cut may use a note from the test audience to force you to make changes to the film that go against your gut. You ultimately have no right to fight against these changes because you have signed away those rights in order to get your money. As a film-lover myself, I always want to see exactly what the filmmaker intended.Casting Choices:Traditionally, in order to procure your financing, a filmmaker will often have to choose from a list of pre-approved actors with whom the financier is willing to make the movie. Although there are often many wonderful actors on these lists, you may not see the actors you had in your mind to play those parts. The lists are compiled of actors who ve been in films that have had large successes overseas. Their names are put into an algorithm, and a computer calculates how much money the financier will be able to pre-sell the foreign distribution of the film for based on that actor s past successes. Bored yet? Basically, you have to cast who they want, not who you want.Location Choices:This film is set in Hollywood. Bizarrely, it is very expensive to shoot in Los Angeles. So unless I have the budget to afford to shoot here (where it takes place), I ll have to shoot the film in Vancouver or Georgia or Louisiana and fake it to look like LA. I was told we d just roll a few palm trees around. This happens all the time, and we could make it work... and no offense to all those places, but wouldn t it be amazing to be able to shoot the film where it takes place?Cuts for Budget:Every film makes cuts to trim the budget; that s completely sensible. But there are always places where, with a little extra money, the film could be better. In Wish I Was Here, my character's elaborate fantasy sequences are one place that extra money would strengthen what shows up on the screen, as I could shoot those in the amazing and surreal locations I picture in my mind.Wrap it up, Braff, I have stuff to do...I look at it like this: Come join this little club. Join for whatever you can. And then, together, this lil club's gonna make a really cool movie, and you'll have made it happen. If you've liked the stuff I've made so far, I know you're going to love this. Whether you end up with a rad t-shirt (soft as a kitten's taint) or an invite to a special preview screening, you'll know that without you, this movie never would have gotten made. (*Yes, there will be a secret handshake and code word for the club.) (No, it's won't be "Eagle" or "C-bear".)"You had me at Hello," what do I do?To become one of our backers, just click on the big green button to the right of our video.

203`What is it?Have you ever just wished you could lift your pen off the paper and see your drawing become a real three dimensional object? Well now you can! 3Doodler is the world s first and only 3D Printing Pen. Using ABS plastic (the material used by many 3D printers), 3Doodler draws in the air or on surfaces. It s compact and easy to use, and requires no software or computers. You just plug it into a power socket and can start drawing anything within minutes. The latest model 3Doodler Oh, and it s also the most affordable way to 3D print by a looong way! With 3Doodler we re making fun 3D creation accessible to everyone.How does it work?If you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler. 3Doodler in action As 3Doodler draws, it extrudes heated plastic, which quickly cools and solidifies into a strong stable structure. This allows you to build an infinite variety of shapes and items with ease! Most people will instantly be able to trace objects on paper, and after only a few hours of practice you will be able to make far more intricate objects.3Doodler is a brand new way of creating objects and artistic works. Whether you are an artist, hobbyist or 3D printing fanatic, we can t wait to see what you 3Doodle! Six little men and the other one said... 3Doodler! 3Doodler! What can I make with 3Doodler? There are many ways 3Doodler can be used. 3Doodles can be created as flat forms and peeled off a piece of paper, as freestyle 3D objects, or in separate parts, ready to be joined together using the 3Doodler. The creative opportunities are endless, including: Basic 3D shapes and 3D models Jewellery, pendants and hanging ornaments Decorative art and fridge magnets Personalization of everyday objects (iPhone cases, laptops, pens, etc.) A mini Eiffel Tower or a soccer pitch for your Lego men And much much more 3Doodler works on almost any surface, including plastic, allowing users to personalize items such as iPhone cases, or anything else they feel like 3Doodling on. 3Doodler can even be used for minor repair work. 3Doodler "stencils" We re particularly excited about 3Doodler "stencils" - sophisticated print-out stencil kits to help you create awesome objects (like our Eiffel Tower). We'll be making these available online for everyone. Simply print it out, 3Doodle each part according to the stencil and then join them with your 3Doodler. As time goes by we, and the 3Doodler community, will be able to create hundreds (maybe thousands) of stencil kits that can easily be emailed and shared with friends. We ll be hosting these on our website, the3Doodler.com, for anyone to download and use for free. 2 ft Eiffel Tower Stencil We re looking forward to seeing what people create and supporting 3Doodler communities everywhere. The Sellers of Etsy Special We're collaborating with some fantastic sellers on Etsy, all wire artists, to showcase how 3Doodler can be used to create beautiful objects and pieces of art. We're thrilled to be working with Bud Bullivant, Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight), Nakisha and Ele McKay to bring our vision to life. Wire Art by Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight) - sparkflight.etsy.com Wire Art by Bud Bullivant (wiredbybud.etsy.com) Bud and Ruth will be creating a limited edition run of the first professional 3Doodles (see the Seller on Etsy Special Reward above). The ideas are already flowing, and we'll be working together to bring you a truly unique 3Doodle creation from these top artists. The expected size of the 3Doodle is approximately 4 x 2 inches. It will be beautifully boxed and shipped by August.Nakisha will be producing an exclusive template for anyone ordering a 3Doodler. Created especially for you, the template will showcase 3Doodler's capabilities and allow you to make your very own artist-designed 3Doodles. And we'll be announcing a special collaboration with Ele shortly. Wire Art by Ele McKay (elemckay.etsy.com) Wire Art by Nakisha (wireanimals.etsy.com) More to come on all of this in an Update! Bud, Ruth, Nakisha, Ele, we're truly grateful for your support! 3Doodler Components & Accessories: The pen: The 3Doodler pen is 180mm by 24mm. The pen weighs less than 200 grams or 7 ounces (the weight of a typical apple), although the exact weight will depend on the final shell specifications once in production. And we are using a universal power supply, so provided you have the correct adapter for your country, 3Doodler will work just fine on 110v or 240v. The evolution of 3Doodler 3Doodler is not a toy for children (it's recommended for ages 12+). While the plastic extruded from 3Doodler is safe to touch once it has left the pen, the pen itself has a metal tip that can get as hot as 270C. There is no reason for any user to touch the tip while in use, but safety comes first, and we are creating a video series that will explain how to use the 3Doodler, covering off the different techniques and safety precautions necessary. The Ink (i.e. ABS/PLA plastic): The 3Doodler uses 3mm ABS or PLA plastic as its "ink" - just like a 3D printer. Each 3Doodler backed on Kickstarter comes with at least one bag of plastic; each bag will contain ten 1ft strands of plastic; and each 1 ft strand produces approximately 11 ft of 3Doodling fun... yes, you read that right, a foot of plastic goes a very long way in the 3Doodler. Some suitably attractive photos of ABS plastic ABS is one of the most common plastics around. It's used in most of the plastic stuff around you. PLA is what we call a "bioplastic". It's made from corn, is biodegradable and has a lower melting temperature than ABS. We are offering both choices as each has its own advantages and disadvantages. We plan to offer plastic sold in strands (making it easy to switch colours and create different styles), but 3Doodler-compatible plastic is also available in 1kg spools from between $30 to $55 from a variety of sources... such as here, here, here, here, and here. And for some stunning PLA have a look here. This is no ink cartridge model! Fun Fact: The average 1kg spool of 3mm ABS contains approximately 360-370 feet of plastic. That's approximately 3,960-4,070 feet of 3Doodling, or 3 Empire State Buildings with enough to spare for several more weeks of doodling. The Future of 3Doodling: We have a ton of ideas for add-ons and accessories that will make 3Doodler even cooler, more useful, fun, and generally awesomer (is that a word?). We hope that the 3Doodler will be a big success so that we can share all our ideas and offer you even more 3Doodling fun... Pete & Max, Inventors of 3Doodler We have a lot we want to tell you about 3Doodler, so we ve created an extensive FAQ to answer all of your questions. And we re on standby to respond to any other queries you may have! *The 3Doodler was created at the Artisans Asylum in Boston. The whole team would like to thank the Artisans Asylum for their help and support. Without hacker-spaces like this, projects such as 3Doodler could not happen.

204`I m Axelle, the founder and creator of Tulipe Noire Watches for Women. Tulipe Noire is a rare deep purple tulip, and is my inspiration for a unique women s watch collection that s mechanical, limited, and always sprinkled with genuine diamonds. I m a watch designer and gemologist with a dream. While I have created many collections for famous brands and fashion houses, I ve always wanted to design a collection, truly feminine, that doesn t look like a copy, a piece of dainty jewelry doubling as a watch, or a takedown of a men s timepiece. With Tulipe Noire, I created every piece in the collection to ensure each detail was exactly what I wanted in a watch. I have completed all my design work. I have reviewed the samples, and paid for them. All models are set for production with trusted and proven factories who are ready to begin producing. Thanks to your support in achieving the funding goal, the first production run of Tulipe Noire watches for women has started.

205`Thanks to everyone who helped successfully fund this crazy project. For those of you who missed out, feel free to hop on over to www.PennyPortrait.com where Penny Portraits will be on sale until supplies run out.------------------------------------------------------------ Hi, I'm Maury thanks for swinging on by!I created a portrait of Abe Lincoln out of pennies. It turned out really well, and I've since created a kit so you can do-the same. Penny Portrait Kit includes everything you see here! The pennies on the poster are actual size, so it's easy for anyone to take an old jar of pennies, match and glue them to the four shades of pennies on the print, and have their own amazing copper creation! (It's like color by numbers with coins.) Kit + Pennies & Glue = ART! I did a trial print run and created a website selling them for $24 and the response has been great. I'm nearly sold out! PennyPortrait.com My goal now is to do be able to do a much larger print run, which combined with quantity discounts on tubes and other materials will allow me to reach a price point that opens up all sorts of new opportunities! I'll be able to make these affordable for teachers, get them in catalogs, and hopefully even retail stores. (Does anyone have friends at Michael's?)Not to mention, I can get them in the hands of the patriotic, money loving Americans who funded me (along with other fun goodies)! Now the print looks great as is, but when you add ACTUAL pennies, it is a real head turner. The dark/light combined with shiny/dull make for an eye popping effect. It looks particularly stunning at the end of a hall way or the far side of a room.But wait, there's more!Each Penny Portrait Kit is going to include : 18 x 24 Penny Portrait Poster Genuine 1943 Steel Penny Assembly tips & tricks handout I will also include a booklet with each kit that has facts and info about: Abraham Lincoln Lincoln Pennies & Coin Collecting Chemistry Experiments with Pennies Impressionist Art & Optical Illusions & Much, Much, More! FAQs 1: Who is this product for? A: This product is for people who love money and who love America. If you meet either of these qualifications, you should probably buy two just so people don't suspect you of being a communist. (The NSA is watching...) 2: How many pennies does it take to complete a penny portrait? A: There are 846 pennies in the 18x24 Penny Portrait. Those are divided as follows: 349 - Shiny new pennies 112 - Lightly used pennies 97 - Well used pennies 288 - Old as dirt pennies On the plus side, you know your finished work of art will be worth at least $8.46. 2: That is a lot of pennies! How much will this thing weigh? A: That's a great math question for the kids! A modern penny weighs exactly 2.5 grams, so 846 pennies will weigh a total of 2,115 grams. One thousand grams = one kilogram, and one kilogram just happens to be the weight of 1 liter of water. (Those metric folks are pretty clever!) With that in mind, the penny portrait weighs about the same as a very full 2 liter of soda. In English units,(and who are we kidding, we're American's dammit!) that equals a little more than 4.5 pounds. Keep in mind, if you want to frame your penny portrait behind glass, that will add some additional weight, but overall, it won't be too heavy and will hang on a wall just fine. (Part of the reason we didn't make a 36" x 24" poster!) 3: Why are some pennies darker than others? As pennies age and are exposed to the elements, they tarnish and get a thin coating called a "patina" that is darker than the original color. Unlike rust, which actually destroys the metal underneath, a patina serves as a protective coating. Tarnished pennies and dirty pennies aren't the same thing. You can wash away dirt, but a tarnished penny will remain that way unless a chemical reaction takes place. (To see an example, combine a tarnished penny with ketchup or vinegar.) 4: Are there really four shades of pennies? Actually, there are many, many different shades of pennies. I chose to use four shades because I felt it gave a significant amount of detail to the picture without the need to spend all your time sorting pennies. To sort pennies, simply split them into two piles (light and dark) and then take each of those piles and do the same thing again. 5: Will the shades of the pennies I have exactly match the poster? We made every effort to select colors for the poster that are as close to the pennies you will find in circulation. That said, it is not important that the shades of pennies you own exactly match the colors printed on the poster. In fact, if you can only sort pennies into dark and light you will still get a very effective illusion. 6: I'm lazy, do I need to glue pennies to this thing? A: Not at all, the poster is a unique work of art as is! Penny Portraits are printed on extremely high quality poster material and are suitable for framing right out of the tube. 7: What are the age recommendations for completing a Penny Portrait? If your kids can work with Elmer's Glue and pennies, (and you trust them not to eat either ) then they are old enough to complete a Penny Portrait! A little bit of hand-eye coordination is involved, but no more so than doing a jigsaw puzzle. If you decide to frame your Penny Portrait, they might want a little help from an adult. It would take some pretty strong magnets to put a penny portrait on the fridge. 8: How long will this take to complete? Once you have your pennies sorted into four shades, it will take one person 5 to 8 hours to glue all the pennies to the poster. The more people involved, the faster it will go! 9: Are there any tips or tricks to finishing a penny portrait? Start collecting those dark pennies when you find them. You need quite a few and while you can always make pennies shinier with a little chemistry (explained in the included materials) making dark pennies is best done by Mother Nature and time. The Penny Portrait Kit includes a two-page handout with a number of tips and tricks for sorting pennies as well as putting the final poster together. Don't worry though. At the end of the day, it is as simple as 1. Put glue on penny 2. Put penny on poster. 10: Will the poster look as good as the pics on this site? It will look even better! A completed penny portrait will shimmer and reflect light making the illusion even more pronounced. A photograph really doesn't do it justice. One neat quality of a finished portrait is that in a dark room with just a little bit of light, the shiny new pennies will make the picture appear to glow! 11: What is the best place to get pennies? A: Grandparents! - If that doesn't work, you can always dive in a fountain... Seriously though, your neighborhood bank will be happy to sell you some. Pennies can be bought in 50 cent rolls. 12: How did you create the Penny Portrait? A: The Penny Portrait image was painstakingly created using historical photos of Abraham Lincoln and countless hours of tinkering at the computer. The final image itself is made up of 846 individual pennies, all of which are the exact same size as pennies from the U.S. mint. Numerous versions were created including a much larger poster, posters with various shades of pennies, pennies lined up in a straight grid and pennies aligned vertically instead of horizontally. I worked hard to create an image that is both easy to assemble and a convincing optical illusion. Thanks for taking the time to learn about my fun little side project. I'd love to get one in your hands so that you can enjoy it as much as I have.All the best, Maury Update: We are also involved with "Kicking it Forward". A cool concept where those projects that are funded pledge 5% of the profits to help out other Kickstarter projects: http://kickingitforward.org

While traveling across the United States on business, Adam Badawy and his wife were constantly on the road and frustrated that hotels, airports and most offices were so outdated and limited with plugs. They could never charge all their devices quickly enough. Somewhere between San Francisco and San Diego, CHARLIE was conceived with the idea that an intelligent design can look stylish and functional. Original Concept Sketch in 2014 CHARLIE soon became an obsession. Long nights and many design drafts and the first 3D blue prints started coming to life. The first 3D Image The excitement was building to see how small we can build this powerhouse! Preliminary 3D Expanded Blueprint And then in 2015 the First Prototype was made in White 1st CHARLIE Prototype in early 2015 Continuous Testing 24/7 Though it was beautiful, Adam Badawy wanted it to be smaller and went back to the drawing board and worked closer with engineers to get CHARLIE smaller, lighter and more narrow. Non-Stop Design Meetings with Engineers Another 6 months of constant all-nighters and a few dozen prototypes with different features. Our first prototype was a UNIVERSAL adapter/converter that we hope to introduce Late September-October to our KICKSTARTER backers. For this introductory debut, we opted with the smallest possible design for our domestic North American (US & CANADA) market. That is why we kept working with engineers to get CHARLIE as small as possible. We knew CHARLIE had to be Hand-size and Handsome, if we may so ourselves! More Prototypes in Various Colors Fits in your Palm, Your Purse & Suitcase And then? The breakthrough in technology and design! Aesthetic Design with Intelligent Efficiency Where we are now and what's nextAfter 2 years worth of engineering development and testing we now have a highly functional and performing lab prototype. currently we're working closely with the factory manufacturers to prepare the production setup, and finalize materials and components for the mass manufacturing.

207`OBVIOUS CHILD is an honest comedy about what happens when Brooklyn comedian Donna Stern (Jenny Slate) gets dumped, fired and pregnant just in time for the worst/best Valentine's Day of her life. Forever nudged by her parents to make better choices, Donna's forced to do just that when a one-night stand leads to a difficult decision that does and does not define the rest of her life. Though confident in her choice, Donna must gain the confidence to believe in her talent, herself, and the best in those around her, especially one surprisingly decent guy (Jake Lacy) who just might make this the worst/best Valentine's Day ever. Jenny Slate + Jake Lacy in OBVIOUS CHILD Alongside Jenny and Jake, our movie stars some of my all-time favorite New York performers Gaby Hoffmann, Gabe Liedman, Richard Kind, Polly Draper, and David Cross. We shot all over Brooklyn and Manhattan for 18 days in the Spring of 2013, mostly in our friends' apartments and on the streets where we live (a mix of favors and blessings and happy and less-than-happy accidents!). We edited all Summer and Fall, and are now headed to Park City for our World Premiere at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. on the set of OBVIOUS CHILD @ Trash Bar in Brooklyn, NY, photo by Danielle Lurie I first made the "Obvious Child" short film in the Winter of 2009 with my friends Anna Bean and Karen Maine. We were frustrated by the limited representations of young women's experience with pregnancy, let alone growing up. We were waiting to see a more honest film, or at least, a story that was closer to many of the stories we knew. We weren t sure how long that wait was going to be, so we decided to tell the story ourselves. The short starred Jenny Slate and had a pretty nice festival run. When we shared it on the Internet it was really exciting to see that people were actually watching it. But what was even cooler were the conversations the movie ignited. That truly encouraged and inspired me to expand to feature-length, to share this film and these conversations with even more people around the world. In developing the feature we've been lucky enough to be supported by some heroic film organizations like IFP, Rooftop Films, Tribeca Film Institute, and the San Francisco Film Society. A lot has evolved and changed since the short, but the heart of it's the same. I'm really thrilled and honored to be premiering this feature at Sundance next month, and I can't wait to share it with all of you.

208`If you didn't get a chance to pre-order through Kickstarter, you can still order HERE! Please join us, and enjoy grit free press coffee. Thanks, from the whole Espro team!"A Sludge-Free French Press" - Florence Fabricant, New York Times"It definitely achieves its goal to bring a press-pot cup of coffee without the grit" - Dan Nosowitz, Popular Science"ESPRO Press, a French Press That Works." - Charlie Sorrel, Wired"A Cleaner, Tastier Cup of French Press Coffee in the Morning" - Leslie Horn, GizmodoGOOD MORNING!I love mornings. Up at 9, relaxing with a beautiful cup of aromatic coffee or tea. I usually sit on the porch with a croissant, thinking of life and love Yeah, that s not my typical morning either - let s start again with that early morning alarm.Twenty five minutes to get out the door and on the run. Between the clock, packed bags, packed trains, and interruptions, there s a lot in the way of that perfect morning cup. INTRODUCING THE ESPRO TRAVEL PRESS When life takes you on the road, you should be able to lean forward into that next adventure with a fantastic cup of coffee or tea in hand. That first cup of coffee or tea sets the tone for your entire day. For the most creative and productive day possible, it should be mind-blowing! So we created the definitive travel brewer for both coffee and tea, with three filter options. 1. A DOUBLE FILTER FOR GRIT-FREE COFFEE The Espro travel press uses the same double-filter mesh technology as the table top press, for aromatic, grit-free, and flavorful coffee. They filter coffee twice, with filters 9 and 12 times finer than a common French Press. And once pressed down, they block extraction so the last sip tastes like the first. We also introduce a brand new twist-lock system that makes the separation and assembly of the two micro-filters easier than ever. 2. AN ADDED PAPER FILTER FOR EVEN CLEANER COFFEE If you want even cleaner coffee, you can add a third paper filter between the two metal filters. This can highlight the fruitier and floral flavors in your coffee. 3. A NEW TEA FILTER JUST FOR TEA LOVERS Tea is important enough to get its own new filter design. The unique seal at the lower end of the filter sweeps loose leaf tea to the bottom, then folds upward and seals the tea leaves under the filter to stop extraction. You get the full flavors of loose leaf tea. BACK TO OUR HERO Coffee or tea made, you are ready to leave the house. The clock is still ticking, and there's a lot between you and nirvana. SIZED TO TRAVEL Books, papers, lunch, computer there isn t much space left in that bag. The Espro Travel Press is the perfect 12 oz size, and fits comfortably in your bag, cup holder, or bike bottle cage. NO SPILLS TO RUIN YOUR DAY We ve all had a mug leak in our bag Beyond the tragic loss of coffee, that wet report won t get the same respect. A double lid with silicone seals keeps your drink safe while you navigate the urban-jungle (or jungle-jungle, if life takes you off the beaten path). HARD TO LET GO OF We want you thinking about your next great idea, not how to hold your travel press as you wind your way through crowded subways, sidewalks and busses. So, we made your Travel Press easy to grip and hold onto, by gently curving the outer walls. EYE CATCHING, STATEMENT MAKING Your style says what you stand for. So we re starting with three colors Bright White, Blue Glass and Matte Black. We'll use the Kickstarter survey to let you choose your color after the campaign ends. COMFORTABLE TO DRINK FROM The ESPRO Travel Press sips like your favorite mug. The shape of the lid is comfortably molded to your lip, and the press rod neatly disappears out of the way for comfortable drinking. STAYS HOT FOR HOURS And when the moment finally arrives for that first sublime sip, only to be torn from your hands by someone who needs something, faint nor fret not! Your drink will still be hot when you are ready. The stainless steel vacuum insulated double walls keep the outside cool and the inside hot (or the other way around for iced tea and cold brew coffee). AND IT'S EASY TO CLEAN We expect the Espro Travel Press to get used a lot. We made the components dishwasher safe, so you can wake up to clean gear and repeat. But this time, it won t be the same old grind!

209`Great for ages 5-5000! More than just a novelty: This is not the dinky potato clock or lemon battery. With MudWatt, kids design their own experiments, and learn electronics, engineering, biology, and green energy, all-the-while building creative confidence! Get kids outside and excited about science and the natural world! Long-term engagement: The MudWatt is a living battery that kids nurture and monitor over the course of weeks or even months. Use the MudWatt Explorer App to track your MudWatt's growth over time, analyze data, and unlock a comic book! Build advanced bioenergy technology (currently being researched at Stanford, Harvard and many other prestigious labs around the world), right in your kitchen! Connect multiple MudWatts to power more stuff! Completely safe and reuseable! Did you know that pretty much all of the world s mud has little organisms in it that produce electricity when they eat? Pretty sweet, right? Well that s not the magic of MudWatt (that s the awesome science behind it!).The magic comes in when a kid gets a hold of a MudWatt. Eyes and minds expand. Curiosity is stimulated. Creativity is activated. The natural world suddenly looks more complex and exciting. The future looks a little brighter. That s the magic of MudWatt. The MudWatt kit empowers kids (and kids at heart) to become scientists and engineers, teaching them important STEM skills while engaging their curiosity, their creativity, and their appreciation for the natural world around them. It merges topics like energy, biology, physics, chemistry, and engineering to generate the spark (<--Pun!) in STEM learning. The MudWatt is not a "build it and forget it" kit; it encourages kids to get creative with science and offers long-term engagement over weeks, or even months, through the MudWatt Explorer App. Colonies of special bacteria (called shewanella and geobacter) generate the electricity in a MudWatt. This means that the electricity output is proportional to the health & activity of that bacterial colony. By maintaining these colonies in different ways, you can use MudWatt to run all kinds of great experiments to maximize your power! Within a few days of building your MudWatt, the LED will start to blink using the electricity generated by your bacteria! This blinking rate will increase over time as your bacteria population grows. The MudWatt Explorer App detects that blinking rate and (using our super special algorithm) tells you how much power your MudWatt is producing AND an estimate for how many electric bacteria you've grown! Use the App to track your MudWatt's growth over time, analyze your data, and unlock a comic book! This offers long-term engagement with the MudWatt, spanning weeks to months! (Available for iPhones, iPads and Android devices.) We've gone through several iterations of the MudWatt, and the response has been incredible. Now we want to take this to the next level, refine the product, and reach more kids because kids really do dig it. (<--Pun!) What s amazing about MudWatt is how many different elements there are to get a young learner interested. We often get letters from parents describing how much fun they had, along with their child. They often say that it was a great bonding experience, and that they felt really smart in front of their kids.At the end of the MudWatt experience, your kid will understand: What is electricity? What is renewable energy? How do you design an experiment? What is soil made of? What are bacteria? What do bacteria like to eat? How does a biobattery work? What is bioenergy? How does energy flow through nature? And much much much much more... Besides parents, teachers are some of our biggest fans, and they are one of the major reasons we are running this campaign. MudWatt is an amazing tool for classroom use for a few great reasons: it s hands on, affordable, reusable, and it can be used to teach a number of topics throughout the school year. Even better: With the funds from this campaign, we will develop additional curriculum suitable for use in classrooms tied to the Next Generation Science Standards! In a recent study, less than one-third of 8th graders in the U.S. were deemed proficient in science. Today, 70% of the fastest growing careers are in STEM fields. The supply of STEM education is not meeting the demand.There are some great kits out there that give kids something to do or make -- but the outcomes are already well prescribed and there is no sense of creativity or adventure, which are inherent to science and engineering! We wanted to go beyond the standard and give kids a tool where the outcome is unknown -- a genuine experiment that requires creativity and critical thinking. MudWatt is the scientific method in action: you and your kids can design and run real experiments together right at home! We are engineers who ve made everything from potato guns to giant space stations lurking ominously above the earth s surface! (OK, not so much the space stations. But we ve made some great stuff.) Check out this video about the genesis of MudWatt: This campaign is the first offering of our new MudWatt core kit - check out these awesome configurations!
210`20% of your ingredients account for 80% of your measuring requirements. So why not dedicate a measuring tool to those 20%? We want to make it easier to prepare whole grains and other dry goods. Staples like rice, beans, oatmeal, quinoa, and lentils. Pretty much anything you can find in the bulk food aisle. Those foods you know you should eat more. So we looked at the process. We realized we could remove several steps through a simple concept, combining the measuring cup with the storage container. We put the measuring cup on top of the container, where it should be. The word is out! "It's convenient, well designed and will probably make kitchen life a lot easier." - Cool Hunting"If you put your loose food items into the Made, then you can measure out a perfect serving every time you serve yourself." - Gear Diary"The not-so-secret secret is in the twist cap which doubles as a measuring cup. So simple it makes you wonder why this hasn t been thought of before!" - Yanko Design"...the handsome and useful storage containers look to be an everyday item overlooked no more." - Cnet "Aesthetically this product is just stunning and I for one know I would like to see The Made in my kitchen." - Trend MonitorClick here if you want to see me on tv. Listen to what Ritchie T. Steadman, the MC of A&E's "Project Startup Live" event had to say the day after on Salt Lake's X96 "Radio from Hell" morning show: Madcaps is happy to "Kick it forward"Reasons to love The measuring tool is right where you need it. You'll never have this mental conversation again:"I know it s in that drawer over there usually, but did the kids grab it? Maybe the significant other? Hopefully it s not dirty in the sink .darn it! now I have to waste time trying to track it down!" - experienced by everyone.Simple to use. Just rotate the cap, gently shake, and flip the lid to dispense the perfect amount of content into your using container. Conveniently measures and dispenses up to half a cup at a time. The Measuring compartment is exactly cup. Just shake until the compartment is full and you know you have a half cup. You can do it with your eyes closed (or in the dark, at the campsite, or after your workout when you re still shaky).The product being measured never leaves the container, removing the chance of a spill. Since the measuring tool is specific to the container, the need to clean it is reduced. When I make rice, I measure the water, then I measure the rice, which requires manually drying out the measuring cup, or I ll forget and have to clean out all the rice stuck to the side. On my smarter days I ll measure the rice first and move it to a temporary storage, then measure the water, which is still inefficient! Priced right: There is no product on the market that combines a storage canister with a measuring and dispensing cap. So check out the Amazon page for OXO's regular, non measuring POP storage container's for comparison: http://www.amazon.com/OXO-Square-0-9-Quart-Storage-Container/dp/B000UI0KA2. When you include the cost of shipping, The Made is priced very competitively. This is Kickstarter only pricing! We won't be offering this price once we're up and running. The right size. At 3.5 inches wide (the width of a standard coffee cup), by 9.5 inches tall, the dispenser holds 4.5 cups or 1.125 quarts. The perfect size to hold that plastic bag full of that new type of lentil you've been wanting to try, or for those who buy one pound bags of rice, or as an intermediary for those who buy their dry goods on a larger scale. Protects your product. The innovative, air tight design and cutting edge materials block out light, moisture, and oxygen, which keeps your product from staling.It's now easier to make stuff like this: Black Beluga Lentil Salad with Goat Cheese Its been a fun journey putting this project together! Be among the first in the world to use the coolest rice and whole grains dispenser on the planet! (And it's great for coffee too)THANKS for taking a look The evolution Production PlanWe're starting the tooling process in conjunction with the campaign. We've been quoted a lead time of 30 days to complete the tooling, and we re planning 21 more for revisions. The factory also quoted 18 days for production, and we feel this is a solid estimate. Shipping to our fulfillment center is estimated to take 30 days. Once at our fulfillment center, we'll be conducting final quality control, packaging, and shipping to you, our backer, Basically we are going to do our very best to get you your Made('s) 100 days after the end of the campaign.

Aquor s patented twist-lock design automatically turns the water on as soon as the connector is inserted. Stop wasting your time at the tap, and enjoy instant water access in less than a second.Features: Garden hoses connect with a simple twist Water turns on/off automatically when connected Reliable, leak-proof design Freeze-proof to -30 F Food-grade, lead-free stainless steel construction JUST PUSH AND TURN TO CONNECT Connect garden hoses in less than a second. All it takes is a simple push and turn to engage the Aquor House Hydrant. Three grooves guide the connector into the right position, so it can be inserted blindly in any direction. Forget the hassle of scraping your knees and knuckles trying to thread on garden hoses - with Aquor, you can plug into your water outlet instantly. WATER AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON Instant water access. As soon as you insert the Aquor connector, water begins flowing. The patented bayonet-lock design and high-performance Viton O-rings provide a watertight connection, every time. UNPLUG AND WALK AWAY Water automatically turns off. No more pesky and wasteful leaks; the hydrant uses water pressure to keep the valve closed, guaranteeing a drip-free outlet. It'll never freeze, either. Stainless steel provides significantly less heat loss than typical brass hose bibs, so the hydrant does not need to be covered any further, even when temperatures reach -30 F. A PERMANENT FIX Quality craftsmanship. Aquor House Hydrants install exactly like conventional faucets, and are designed to last the lifetime of the home. High-performance copolymer connectors and DuPont Viton O-rings are rated for 10+ years, and replacements can be performed in minutes. The House Hydrant is the only outdoor faucet in the world that installs like a typical sillcock, but can be cleaned, maintained, or replaced in minutes if needed from the exterior of the home. MATCH YOUR HOME & STYLE No more protruding hose bibs. Add a modern touch to your home s style. The UV-resistant debris cover neatly hides the polished stainless steel faceplate when not in use. When open, a smooth friction hinge holds the cover in any position. Choose from Aquor Blue or Slate Gray (we will contact you after the campaign is over for your color selection, stretch goals may include more colors). NOT READY TO INSTALL? Try our Hose Adapter instead! If you're not ready to replace your outdoor faucet, our Hose Adapter allows you to try the ease and convenience of Aquor right out of the box. Pair with one of our super lightweight and flexible WaterRight hoses for maximum ease of use. Awards & Mentions: 2015 International Builders' Show: Best Outdoor Living Product The Aquor Hose Adapter turns any hose end or existing tap into an Aquor quick connect outlet.

Easily chain together garden hoses to make longer ones. INSTANT WATER-STOP VALVE No more trips to the tap. Now you can hot-swap nozzles, hoses, and accessories under full pressure, without turning the water off in between. EXTEND HOSES Join hoses together in seconds. Stop lugging around long, heavy garden hoses if you're not going far. Whenever you need a longer hose, simply add on another in seconds. VERSATILE Easily create quick connect outlets. Attach it to the end of a hose, or directly to your existing tap. Use the connectors to quickly swap between hoses, nozzles, or sprinklers. DRIP-FREE Bring it inside, it won't leak. Stop waiting to drain your garden hose before bringing it inside. With Aquor, water stops as soon as you unplug. DURABLE Made to last. Built with the same food-grade, lead-free stainless steel as our House Hydrants, Aquor Hose Adapters are designed to withstand many years of use. It's the best garden hose you've ever used. As a Kickstarter exclusive, we're bundling these ultralight yet extremely durable 25 foot WaterRight garden hoses. Easy to use, easy to carry, and made to last - they're the perfect sidekick to Aquor House Hydrants and Hose Adapters. Their light weight and flexibility make them exceptionally easy to engage with the Aquor twist-lock connection. SUPER LIGHT, SUPER CONVENIENT Each hose weighs just over 2 pounds. Quit lugging around heavy reels of garden hose, and easily carry around just the length you need. With Aquor, you can effortlessly connect additional hoses on the go, even under full water pressure. The special polyurethane composite is what allows these hoses to be so slim and light, yet durable. SOFT, FLEXIBLE, & EFFORTLESS High-performance polyether-based polyurethane. Designed for long-term water use, these hoses outclass even the most expensive vinyl or premium rubber garden hoses available at big hardware stores. Made from top-quality materials from Bayer Material Sciences, they're 100% free from toxic chemicals such as lead, BPA and phthalates often found in other hoses. Soft and flexible in all weather conditions, from extreme heat to freezing cold. NO KINKS, NO LEAKY CONNECTIONS A true zero-hassle hose. Specially engineered strain reliefs on both hose ends to prevent hose kink at the hydrant or nozzle end of the hose. Solid machined brass fittings are chrome-plated for durability, and allow for superior leak-free seals. DISTINCTIVE DESIGN No more boring garden tools. From the premium chrome fittings to the handsome polyurethane tubing, this is a designer garden hose you won't want to stop using. NOTE: The Kickstarter exclusive WaterRight garden hoses will come in a beautiful Graphite Gray color. Designed to look great with both our blue and gray House Hydrants and Connectors. Hose examples pictured above are olive green. Graphite below: WaterRight Garden Hose in Graphite with Aquor Quick Connect Kit attached. OUR STORYAquor Water Systems was created with a vision to re-invent the way people access their water. Our most precious resource, fresh water, is becoming increasingly scarce. With unprecedented droughts occurring worldwide, regions such as California are scrambling to enact emergency water conservation laws to protect their dwindling supply. While plumbing has vastly improved over the last few decades with the adoption of plastic-based tubing, the most common source of leaks (the outdoor tap) has remained unchanged for over 100 years. We set out to create a device that was not only more efficient, but also easier to use and more durable too.How was it invented?Originally designed for marine vessels, the Aquor House Hydrant was adapted from a patented deck wash outlet on boats. After seeing the outlet in operation on vessels worldwide from sailboats to superyachts for years, we knew it was a reliable, proven product that could withstand the harsh environments of fresh and saltwater. There are currently tens of thousands of these outlets in use, without a single reported failure or leak to date. We've been working nonstop for the last year on engineering the outlet for homes. Many of the design features, such as the flush-mount faceplate and stainless steel body, were originally implemented out of necessity for the marine world. After consulting with dozens of plumbers, homebuilders, and engineers, we've transferred over the best elements and perfected a water access point that performs unlike any other.How does it work? The beauty of Aquor is simplicity. When inserted, the connector pushes a stainless steel rod that opens the valve at the rear of the hydrant. There are no screws or moving parts that will wear out like in conventional spigots, just a single valve that is held closed via water pressure. And unlike typical sillcocks, any internal part or O-ring can be cleaned or replaced in seconds from the exterior of the home. In the event of a loss of water pressure, the stainless steel spring prevents backflow by keeping the valve closed.How will it save water?Conventional hose bibs have multiple points of failure, all of which gradually wear out over time and begin leaking. The Aquor House Hydrant uses water pressure to stay closed, ensuring a leak-proof seal every time. After consulting with plumbers, we've learned that many homeowners don't want to go through the effort of replacing their leaking outdoor faucet, because they expect the new one to start leaking again after a short while. With Aquor, you'll be leak-proof for life. The entire system can be cleaned or repaired in minutes, from the exterior of the home. In their recent Smarter Planet report on water, IBM revealed that our rate of water usage is increasing at twice the rate of population growth in the last century. An average of 700 water main breaks occur every single day, in just the United States alone. And a leaking outdoor tap that drips just once per second wastes 2,700 gallons of water per year. America needs to change the way we transport and access our most precious resource. With Aquor, we have an easy and effective way to eliminate the most common source of leaks in our homes today. Where are Aquor products designed and made?All Aquor products are designed and engineered in Seattle, Washington.Aquor manufactures its products at our family-owned and operated factory in Fujian Zhangzhou, Southern China. Having control of the entire manufacturing process, from design to delivery, allows us to offer unparalleled quality and attention to detail without the prohibitive costs. Our team has decades of combined experience in stainless steel vacuum casting. With a complete equipment upgrade in 2011, our state of the art vacuum casting machines produce stainless steel hydrants so beautiful you won't want to hide them inside your walls. How do I contact Aquor?We want to hear from you! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or questions, feel free to reach to explore our website and reach out to us at www.aquorwatersystems.com. For press/media inquiries, contact us directly at contact@aquorwatersystems.com. We realize that not everyone owns a home, or is ready to replace their hose bib right now. If you believe in our vision of a leak-free world, please consider sharing our Kickstarter campaign with your friends, family, or favorite homebuilder. We chose Kickstarter as our pre-order campaign platform because they make things easy, convenient, and fast - just like Aquor.To pre-order Aquor products:1. Select your Aquor package. The bundles (shown below) feature different quantities of House Hydrants, Hose Adapters, and garden hoses depending on your needs. Hydrants replace your existing faucet, while Hose Adapters simply screw on to your garden hose or existing tap. 2. Click "Select This Reward" from sidebar. On the right side, you'll see the bundles and required pledge amounts for each. After selecting your shipping destination, click Continue to Next Step. If you'd like extra connectors, just manually add $10 for each one you'd like to your pledge.3. Create your Kickstarter account. It only takes a few seconds, and will allow you to track your order status, receive production updates from us, and post questions. 4. Submit your order. Enter your payment details, and you're all set! You'll receive an email confirmation shortly after. If you ordered a House Hydrant, we'll ask for your color and size selections directly prior to shipping.5. Share! The more funding our Kickstarter campaign gets, the better our products will get. Stretch goals will include more color options, and more information about our upcoming products (we have a few secret projects in the works). We will contact you for your color and size selections if the Kickstarter campaign is successfully funded on 6/22, right before shipping. Please note that hydrant sizing refers to stem length; at least 2" of additional clearance is needed to fit the rear housing and your water supply line. Please consult a plumber if you are unsure about what size will fit your home. Connectors are universal and will work with any Aquor hydrant or hose adapter. See below for installation tips. The Aquor House Hydrant follows the exact same installation process as any conventional sillcock, and can be installed by any plumber or experienced DIYer. There are many detailed how-to guides available on the web, and each House Hydrant will come with an installation guide as well. We are currently working on an in-depth installation video that will be posted online. If you own an older home, the unfortunate reality is that many were built without an easy way to access the rear of your existing hose bib, and may require slightly more effort. Fortunately, in many cases it's not as big of a hassle as it may seem. Removing the existing bib, enlarging the hole, and then using a hose bib mounting block (available in many styles at any hardware store) will provide permanent access to the water supply line, while still keeping a pleasing aesthetic. Please consult a plumber if you are unsure about any step of the process. Plumber rates vary nationwide, but from our research most hose bib replacements run about $125-250 for labor.The good news is, you'll be applying a lifetime fix to your faucet troubles - rather than just replacing with one that will start leaking again in a few years. The Aquor House Hydrant is the only outdoor faucet on the market that is easily user-serviceable. Conventional sillcock designs cannot be easily repaired or maintained from the exterior of the home, and usually must be completely replaced after excessive wear or hard water buildup. Every part inside the House Hydrant can be accessed in seconds from the exterior of the home. Unlike typical spigots, a screw isn't used to form the watertight seal -- water pressure itself holds the House Hydrant closed. The DuPont Viton O-ring seals have been tested to last 10+ years, are commonly available, and can be swapped without a plumber when necessary. The stainless steel internal rod can be quickly removed to clean out hard water buildup inside the faucet, a feature unique to the House Hydrant.
212`|"A marvel of compact choreography" Fast Company THE ORU KAYAKThe Oru Kayak is an incredible, high-performance boat that folds out of a compact case. Inspired by origami, this innovative kayak transform quickly, easily and almost magically. Stash it in a trunk, check it on a plane, stow it aboard a sailboat, or hike it in to remote waters. It s full size (12' long), super light (25 lbs), and quick to assemble (5 min). On the water it s fast, stable, and handles incredibly well.The Oru Kayak makes the wonder and discovery of the great outdoors accessible: easy foldability transforms boating from a special occasion to anytime, anywhere. Each Oru Kayak is engineered of a single sheet of double-layered plastic. The single seam is sealed with a watertight rubber gasket. Solid ribs offer strength and rigidity.The corrugated plastic skin is extremely tough and durable.PERFORMANCE "A marvel of compact choreography." Fast Company"The Oru Kayak design is revolutionary. The boats are sturdy and incredibly light. They are as comfortable as any other sea or whitewater boat I've paddled. They track really well and turn on a dime. The maneuverability makes forward progress into a crushing headwind almost easy. The implications for urban paddlers and for remote expeditionary paddling are truly exciting." Greg Miller, Outdoor Filmmaker & former NOLS instructor"It accelerates like a rocket, and carves a turn like a dream." Bill Vonnegut, Neptune's Rangers, professional kayak guide/instructor"Finally, city dwellers can own a kayak that stores in a closet and travels on transit, AND still handles burly waters; plus, it's gorgeous." Lisa Fisher, San Francisco"It was wonderful! The Oru Kayak design felt fast and comfortable. You completely forget that it's a neatly folded piece of plastic. After kayaking around the marina and the larger waves of the San Francisco Bay, I was still completely dry without a drop of water inside the vessel." David Lang, Make Magazine, CoFounder, OpenROVWhile the Oru Kayak is designed to be beginner-friendly, it s also great fun for experts!

The manufacturer rates the skin material for 20,000 fold cycles. We've done a lot of hardcore user testing, and never punched a leak. Will it come with a warranty? We're offering an one-year warranty for all Kickstarter purchases.How much gear can it carry? The Oru Kayak has a capacity of 260 lbs. There's enough storage space inside to support short camping trips. SAFETY & DISCLAIMER We've designed the Oru Kayak to be as strong and safe as possible with normal use, but it's still a boat. That means you can capsize or get hurt. Please wear a Personal Flotation Device (life jacket) at all times, and use a spare paddle, bilge pump, spray skirt and float bags if you're going in open water. Stay aware of currents, weather, submerged obstacles, and other boats and swimmers. Use common sense, and don't go beyond your experience level. All of the prototypes shown in the photos and video are fully functional and tested, but details shown may change in the final product development and manufacturing.ABOUT USWe re a small, dedicated team of designers, makers, and manufacturing experts. We ve been working on the Oru Kayak for more than four years. Together, we re thrilled to launch Oru Kayaks into the world. We strongly believe that spending time outdoors makes people happier, healthier, and more productive. We see our kayaks as a way to explore and connect with the natural world, even in cities. We hope your Oru Kayak journeys are as fun and inspiring as ours have been.THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

Songwriting becomes her way forward, leading her to the City where she meets James and Cassie, two musicians each at crossroads of their own. What follows is a story of renaissance over a long, dream-like Summer. Inspirations for the film come from all over, the French New Wave of Truffaut and Godard, the early post-punk movement in music, pop musical movies of the 70's and 80s, classics by John Hughes, the great British comedies of Bruce Robinson and Bill Forsythe and just the city of Glasgow itself. And yet this will inevitably be its own film, one that started with a song. Seven years ago, Stuart was out for a run and a tune came into his head which didn't sound like Belle & Sebastian. It was sung by a girl, and soon, one tune led to another. Then Eve started to talk, James came along, then Cassie, and as all of their thoughts evolved, so did a girl group sound and a sense that it wanted to be a film, a musical. Faced with the daunting task, Stuart started with what he knew best, the songs, and began looking for girls to sing them. In Spring, 2007, producer Barry Mendel (Rushmore, The Sixth Sense, The Royal Tenenbaums, Munich, Bridesmaids) ran across an ad Stuart posted online, "Singers wanted for Autumnal recording project." The fine print hinted at a film. He wrote the Belle & Sebastian fan site offering to lend a hand, Stuart got in touch and Barry has assumed the mantle of Producer ever since, working with Stuart on the script and preparing to make the film. In 2009, Stuart found the girls and recorded a God Help The Girl LP, an EP, Stillsand took the singers on a small tour. Finally, we're gearing up, casting, putting the team together. Now we need your help. We'd love you to be a part of this film happening and have offered a range of prizes to inspire you, from as little as $5 up to signed posters and t-shirts, on screen credit, even a walk-on part in the film! Hopefully there's something for you. If you'd like to contribute but don't fancy any of our prizes, feel free to make suggestions here and we'll do our best. And whatever you can offer is just great, we appreciate it. Not only are we raising money, we're also building a community behind the film -- your participation is meaningful. As Barry put it, "If we can reach the Kickstarter goal, this movie will get made. If we can't, it won't. We need the money and also to show the powers that be that there's grassroots support for our project." All backers who pledge $150 or more in total to the campaign will now receive a credit in the end roller of the film automatically - in addition to your specific reward. We'll keep giving you updates as we go, too, like this one about Stuart and Barry's recent trip to London: We'll also keep adding prizes, so please keep in touch. And check out www.godhelpthegirl.com for more background on the film, the team, to listen to the songs and watch video clips about the film's development or to learn about opportunities to invest in and own a piece of the project.Here's a sneak preview of what our God Help The Girl Cast and Crew enamel pin badges will look like - Stuart has been working with a designer on them and they look lovely. See the $25 reward to pledge to receive one. By hook or by crook this film WILL start shooting in Glasgow this summer, ready for a 2013 release. Please join us for the ride.Follow us on twitter to keep up to date with the project, too.Thanks! The God Help The Girl Gang
214`Purchase the Smart Letters on www.marbotic.fr Have you noticed that kids love to play with tablets? We have! So we designed an awesome educative tool that combines apps and wooden toys to help them prepare to learn to read and write. For kids aged 3-7. AlphamonsterWho has eaten all the letters? This app lets children explore the letters, the sound they make and their shapes with the fearful, letter-eating Monstromachine. This app was inspired by cognitive studies stating that the association between letters and phonics is the key to reading. VocabubbleDid you know that the extent of a kid's vocabulary can predict the speed he or she will learn to read? In our Vocabubble app, kids discover hundreds of words in a quirky and fun universe. Each letter of the alphabet pops out to disclose gorgeous old engravings, poetically animated. The illustrated word is then read out loud. My words (available in January 2016) Ok! So...What do you do with letters now? You write words of course! Kids stamp letters and hear the words being read out loud. You can even make out your own bizarre words like "pliz suppoart uz". These 3 beautiful iPads apps can be downloaded for free with the wooden toy. Should we let kids use tablets? Our educative values : Veronique teaches 3-year-olds in her classroom in Paris and she tested our prototype of Smart Letters. Here is what she has to say about it : From 3 years old, this smart toy will help your child as they learn to read and write This alphabet is made of wood, conductive plastic and metal, and it respects US and Europe children toys regulations No battery, wifi or bluetooth needed, it works with the static electricity of your body Is your device compatible? The Smart Letters are compatible with all iPad generations, excluding first generation iPads The letters and the apps can also be played with independently. You can use the letters as shape toys on a piece of paper Smart letters and the related apps are available in 5 languages

216`The American Bystander is a new all-star print humor magazine edited by the legendary Brian McConnachie (National Lampoon, Saturday Night Live, SCTV). It's just like the classic humor magazines you remember only better. At Bystander, the writers and artists call the shots, not the advertisers. And we'll give our readers real substance, the comedy equivalent of "slow food." Help us launch our tiny revolution. Large format (8.5x11), full-color, 130+ pages, this one-of-a-kind collection is only available through this Kickstarter.Twenty-five years in comedy and publishing has taught me that readers still love humor and cartoons, but changes in the business make it impossible to start a new National Lampoon or Spy the old-fashioned way. So we're trying something new: a softcover book, sold directly to readers. This project combines digital efficiency with the immersiveness and beautiful design of classic print humor. In other words... In this great and glorious country of ours, bursting with products to buy, there s surely room in the marketplace for a really great print humor magazine, right? Right but we need your help. We need you to pledge over there ---->, and even go a little crazy with it. Trust me, you won t be sorry if you do. We ve got a whole bunch of stretch goals, which you can see down below. A front-of-book spread We've studied the great humor magazines of the past, figured out what worked and what put them out of business. The American Bystander updates and improves the old classic humor magazine: Total editorial freedom no advertiser interference; Fair to the contributors they get paid in dollars, not exposure, and retain the rights to their work; More diverse new names and established talents; and The base of a whole institution first, a magazine, then a podcast, a website, and whatever else the staff wants to explore. After several years, and thousands of hours of work, we re finally ready for prime time. Issue #1 is ready to go on press. Issue #2 is in the planning stages. It s time to see if people will buy this thing. Another spread. It just keeps GOING like this Michael Gerber (Publisher): I've spent 25 years as a writer, editor, and magazine consultant specializing in humor. I've written for The New Yorker, SNL, and many other places; my books have sold 1.25 million copies in 25 languages. Barry Trotter and the Shameless Parody is one of the most successful print parodies ever, probably because it introduced a whole generation of English tweens to the concept of a sex dungeon. Brian McConnachie (Editor-in-Chief): Brian began his comedy career as an editor at National Lampoon and the Lampoon's Radio Hour. From there, he went to Saturday Night Live, and SCTV, completing the Holy Trinity of Seventies Comedy. In the 80s and 90s, Brian amassed the coolest bunch of cameos in the history of cinema. In more recent years, he has written for The Simpsons and recorded pieces for NPR. Alan Goldberg (Editor & Producer) has been making non-fiction television and radio for more than 35 years. His work includes biographies ranging from Fidel Castro to the Beatles; science programs with Dr. Richard Leakey; programs on drugs and epidemic diseases; histories of American railroads, diners, The Forbidden City and the Golden Gate Bridge -- and even live rock and roll and gospel concerts. Alan will be overseeing The Bystander's podcasts and live-event programming. $25,000 = If there aren t 1,000 people out there who want this thing, we might as well take up cribbage. $35,000 = We ll add a cover illustration. Anyone can submit. Illustrators, sharpen your pencils.$40,000 = We ll add a National Lampoon-style Letters section. Anyone can submit. Attention Twitterati: opportunity knocks! $50,000 = We ll add The Dracula Letters by Brian and Jack Handey. It s a funny piece, you should try to make this happen. I believe in you.$55,000 = I, Mike, will bike down to Venice, CA, and break into Chris Miller s house. While there, I will steal a short story or something and we ll publish it. (Nobody tell Chris.) $60,000 = We ll print the Madeline parody Sean Kelly sent me. $65,000 = Secret Mystery Contributor #1 will be added. $70,000 = Secret Mystery Contributor #2 will be added. $75,000 = We will do six episodes of our new podcast, Big Ship Radio, sent exclusively to all backers. (Brian explains: "The premise is, we bought a WWII battleship and have converted it into a cruise ship. Mostly. Shortcuts were taken. The destination is Bermuda but the Captain can t seem to find it on any of his maps. So like the Flying Dutchman, it wanders the seas. Go listen to the pilot here.") $80,000 = We will do six more episodes of Big Ship Radio, and send them to backers. $90,000 = We will send a copy of Issue #1 to 100 schools and university libraries. If you would like your school to be on the list, have your teacher/professor contact Mike at Publisher@americanbystander.org.$100,000 = www.americanbystander.org will change from a mild-mannered informational node into a website featuring paid humor/cartoons M-F for a year. This will give people another place to sell their stuff. $150,000 = Just in time for the holidays, everybody gets a copy of Mike's A Christmas Peril, which spills the beans on what happened next to old Ebenezer Scrooge.

We ve shipped tens of thousands of the original ilumi Smartbulbs since launching our first crowdfunding campaign in 2013, and have received amazing feedback from you, the ilumi nation. But we also saw an opportunity to make ilumi better and and we did. So, we re coming back to the amazing crowd who gave ilumi that first spark to give you the best light bulb in the universe at an unbelievable price. It s beautiful, powerful, simple, and comes with a steal of a price tag. ilumi A19 by humdinger on Sketchfab ilumi_br30_3 by humdinger on Sketchfab To go along with your new Smartbulbs, we are also completely revamping the ilumi app to make it even easier to achieve good lighting.

220`If you didn't get a chance to pre-order through Kickstarter, you can still order HERE! Please join us, and enjoy grit free press coffee. Thanks, from the whole Espro team!"A Sludge-Free French Press" - Florence Fabricant, New York Times"It definitely achieves its goal to bring a press-pot cup of coffee without the grit" - Dan Nosowitz, Popular Science"ESPRO Press, a French Press That Works." - Charlie Sorrel, Wired"A Cleaner, Tastier Cup of French Press Coffee in the Morning" - Leslie Horn, GizmodoGOOD MORNING!I love mornings. Up at 9, relaxing with a beautiful cup of aromatic coffee or tea. I usually sit on the porch with a croissant, thinking of life and love Yeah, that s not my typical morning either - let s start again with that early morning alarm.Twenty five minutes to get out the door and on the run. Between the clock, packed bags, packed trains, and interruptions, there s a lot in the way of that perfect morning cup. INTRODUCING THE ESPRO TRAVEL PRESS When life takes you on the road, you should be able to lean forward into that next adventure with a fantastic cup of coffee or tea in hand. That first cup of coffee or tea sets the tone for your entire day. For the most creative and productive day possible, it should be mind-blowing! So we created the definitive travel brewer for both coffee and tea, with three filter options. 1. A DOUBLE FILTER FOR GRIT-FREE COFFEE The Espro travel press uses the same double-filter mesh technology as the table top press, for aromatic, grit-free, and flavorful coffee. They filter coffee twice, with filters 9 and 12 times finer than a common French Press. And once pressed down, they block extraction so the last sip tastes like the first. We also introduce a brand new twist-lock system that makes the separation and assembly of the two micro-filters easier than ever. 2. AN ADDED PAPER FILTER FOR EVEN CLEANER COFFEE If you want even cleaner coffee, you can add a third paper filter between the two metal filters. This can highlight the fruitier and floral flavors in your coffee. 3. A NEW TEA FILTER JUST FOR TEA LOVERS Tea is important enough to get its own new filter design. The unique seal at the lower end of the filter sweeps loose leaf tea to the bottom, then folds upward and seals the tea leaves under the filter to stop extraction. You get the full flavors of loose leaf tea. BACK TO OUR HERO Coffee or tea made, you are ready to leave the house. The clock is still ticking, and there's a lot between you and nirvana. SIZED TO TRAVEL Books, papers, lunch, computer there isn t much space left in that bag. The Espro Travel Press is the perfect 12 oz size, and fits comfortably in your bag, cup holder, or bike bottle cage. NO SPILLS TO RUIN YOUR DAY We ve all had a mug leak in our bag Beyond the tragic loss of coffee, that wet report won t get the same respect. A double lid with silicone seals keeps your drink safe while you navigate the urban-jungle (or jungle-jungle, if life takes you off the beaten path). HARD TO LET GO OF We want you thinking about your next great idea, not how to hold your travel press as you wind your way through crowded subways, sidewalks and busses. So, we made your Travel Press easy to grip and hold onto, by gently curving the outer walls. EYE CATCHING, STATEMENT MAKING Your style says what you stand for. So we re starting with three colors Bright White, Blue Glass and Matte Black. We'll use the Kickstarter survey to let you choose your color after the campaign ends. COMFORTABLE TO DRINK FROM The ESPRO Travel Press sips like your favorite mug. The shape of the lid is comfortably molded to your lip, and the press rod neatly disappears out of the way for comfortable drinking. STAYS HOT FOR HOURS And when the moment finally arrives for that first sublime sip, only to be torn from your hands by someone who needs something, faint nor fret not! Your drink will still be hot when you are ready. The stainless steel vacuum insulated double walls keep the outside cool and the inside hot (or the other way around for iced tea and cold brew coffee). AND IT'S EASY TO CLEAN We expect the Espro Travel Press to get used a lot. We made the components dishwasher safe, so you can wake up to clean gear and repeat. But this time, it won t be the same old grind! REWARD YOURSELF WITH GREAT TASTE WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP For months we ve been designing, testing and refining the technology behind the ESPRO Travel Press. We have world-class production partners standing by and ready to go. Your support will assist with the cost of tooling, manufacturing and large-scale production. In order to bring the ESPRO Travel Press to life, we need your support! Please pledge and help us get the word out about this project to your busy caffeinated friends on Facebook and Twitter. PROJECT SCHEDULE November December 2014: Kickstarter and tooling for production January 2015: receive and review first production sample February 2015: large-scale production March 2015: shipping the ESPRO Travel Press
221`If you love coffee as much as we do, we're sure you would LOVE to be able to drink it anytime anywhere. And so would we! That is why we decided to make a coffee mug that is practical and sustainable, but is also a fashion accessory and tells the primeval story of coffee. Its most obvious feature is definitely its shape which resembles the goat s horns but it also helps you drink that last sip of your coffee and makes you look good. We designed a special holder with leather touch which simply turns into a coffee mug stand so you can easily keep the Goat mug on your desk. Also, Goat mug comes with a set of two straps (short and longer part combine in to one), so you can simply attach it to your bag or just let it fall across your shoulder. This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around. Goat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE. Since you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand. Here's a look inside the Goat mug. It's shape makes it simple to clean. We designed a beautiful packaging to deliver your Goat mug in style. It can then become a perfect storage place for your fresh coffee beans. We would love for more coffee lovers to learn the real story about coffee as much as we would love all of them to be stylish and eco-friendly while drinking their coffee wherever and whenever. That is why we would appreciate you backing our project. Surely, there will be more coffees enjoyed if we manage to make our dream come true.Help us share our project among other coffee lover out there Awards structure: The first stretch goal is an idea we got from our backer Tamara. If we manage to raise $60,000 we will offer everyone a new colour option of the Goat mug - the PANTONE COLOUR OF THE YEAR: MARSALA. Let's do it! The second stretch goal is out! If we manage to raise $250,000 we will offer a new reward: HEMP EDITION Goat mug - for all those on the relaxed side of fashion. Never. Enough. Coffee. You asked for big, we're giving you GRANDE. Third streth goal is set to $350,000! Can we do this together? If all goes according to our plans, we will be shipping out products already in second half of February. Let's do this together! Design of the GOAT STORY Coffee mug was done by design studio Desnahemisfera in cooperation with MyEqua.
222`Our Story: Mia Melon is a women's clothing label based in Vancouver, BC. In the Fall of 2011, we launched our weatherproof coats. Since then, demand has been growing 300% each season. Now is the time to listen to our customer and focus on what we do best! We have wholesale orders coming from some of the most influential boutiques across North America...however we need the financial resources to go into production and to start developing the next collection. Your pledge will ensure that Mia Melon's vision will become a reality. Pledges over and above the requested amount will go towards hiring more staff, and allowing our designer more resources to grow our dream. If all goes well, next season we will be able to expand our offerings and launch a men's fashion weatherproof coat collection. Our Product:What is a fashion weatherproof jacket??We specialize in waterproof, wind proof and breathable coats which are highly functional, yet fashion forward. We pay close attention to the details in design and the quality fabrics used in each piece. How do we make the fabric waterproof?After sourcing fashionably appealing exterior shell fabrics, we use a cozy micro fleece on the interior shell of the coat. Bonded in between the two fabric layers is a poly membrane that functions similar to your skin. The membrane is both waterproof and wind proof. How do we get water to bead off of cotton fabric?We use a heat process treatment known as DWR, which is sprayed onto the fabric and then baked under a massive oven. Although it helps with water resistance, this process is not wind proof. That function comes from the special membrane that we use. How do we keep the water from penetrating the seams?When the coats are sewn together, we bind the seams inside, so that the water stays out, and you stay dry. You will stay dry 99.9% of the time.Lab tests done in Hong Kong and through the US Customs and Border Patrol have certified that our fabrics have waterproof and windproof capabilities. No more worrying about the elements...we've got you covered. A closer look at the details behind the Provocateur Jacket Fashion Forward Designs - We all know that functionality matters when it comes to weatherproof outerwear...but looking great never hurts! The designers have all come from design specific backgrounds, rather than sports-centric. Lots of time, effort and research goes into the theme and mood of each season. We want you to choose Mia Melon coats because they look good, not just because they work so well in any all types of weather.

Just use the buttons below the video to post.We'd also love for you to stay in touch: Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. Sign up for our Newsletter. Thank you!Wow! We reached our minimum funding goal and are well on our way to getting girls (and boys!) building! Let's keep going, because the more people who pledge and pre-order Build & Imagine StoryWalls play-sets, the bigger impact we'll have on girls in STEM.So let's get StoryWalls into the hands of as many kids as we can!Meet Build & Imagine StoryWalls Recommended for ages 4-10. Each Build & Imagine play-set is composed of painted wooden panels, called StoryWalls, and accompanying wooden dolls. Children can combine the StoryWalls into any structural design they choose, and they magnetically snap together. The illustrations on each wall artfully combine to create scenes that act as a launching pad for the child s imagination. Play testing with an early prototype at the Children's Creativity Museum. Sisters build together. The InspirationIn the spring of 2013 Laurie Peterson founded Build & Imagine after noticing that the kind of play experiences she loved as a child (building, problem solving, designing and experimenting) were not reflected in the girls section of the toy store. She aims to create construction toys that her daughter -- and your daughters and sons -- will love. This campaign is raising support for Build & Imagine's first product line. Laurie's daughter plays with an early prototype. Why construction toys designed for girls?What we play with matters. Construction toys (also known as building toys) are the hottest category in the toy industry, yet historically 90% of these toys have targeted boys. Girls are missing out because construction toys help to develop important spatial reasoning and design skills that are prerequisites to succeed in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). These are fields in which women make up only 24% of the workforce, leading to what the President has termed a gender gap in innovation . Toys can make a difference.The design principle Laurie uses to get girls excited about construction is simple: building should facilitate imaginative play. Rather than designing with abstract bricks and shapes, children construct scenes that are as rich and beautiful as a storybook. We re launching with three play-sets Each Build & Imagine StoryWalls play-set comes with illustrated dolls and magnetic panels that children can combine into any configuration they choose. The first three play-sets work together in a coastal theme. Malia s Beach House Front Door to Malia's House Best friends Emily and Malia love hanging out in Malia s modern beach front eco-house after school.

Play testing at the Children's Creativity Museum It s better than [other building toys] because there are pictures. I like pictures better than plain things. - 7 year old play tester That is a perfect summary of what makes our play-sets special. Rather than building with abstract bricks or shapes, you re creating a detailed scene that has tons of jumping off points for storytelling with the included dolls.

224`IT'S ABOUT A BEACH BUM, whose quiet life is upended by dreadful news. He sets off for his childhood home to carry out an act of vengeance but proves an inept assassin and finds himself in a brutal fight to protect his estranged family. OUR 'CAUSE'? Just a great story. We greatly appreciate your support, but we're no more deserving than any other artists on Kickstarter. We hope you'll pitch in simply because you want to see our film... ...BUT THERE'S A TWIST. And we don't want to give it away by outlining the entire plot of our film. Like all those evil Hollywood trailers... This IS NOT A TRAILER, but it's a darn cool BLUE RUIN CAMERA TEST! (music courtesy of Wye Oak) WE PROMISE ACTION! GORE! LAUGHS! And with your help, we'll even crash a stretch limousine into a ditch! But at our story's core, and what will set this film apart from standard genre fare, is a deeply human story about a haunted man confronting his past and the fleeting moments he shares with his big sister before hurtling towards a nightmarish fate. WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR: The absolute bare minimum we need to make this film a reality. As for ourselves, we're going all-in. Maxing out credit cards, refinancing homes and cashing in retirement accounts. But we need $35K-$50K in cash to cover expenses we can't swipe, barter for, or defer. WHO'S ASKING? FILMSCIENCE, the award-winning producers of critically acclaimed art house films (Wendy and Lucy, Meek's Cutoff), is teaming up with Jeremy Saulnier, helmer of the genre collective THE LAB OF MADNESS (Murder Party) and respected indie cinematographer (Hamilton, Putty Hill, Septien), to bridge the gap between cerebral cinema and gut-punch exploitation!DIRECTOR'S STATEMENTBLUE RUIN is an engaging procedural account of a violent act and its aftermath. It'll have the depth of an intimate character study and the velocity of an action flick. Amidst tragedy, subtle moments of humor and hope will shine through. Like plucking a character from a Hal Ashby film and tossing them into No Country for Old Men. Or if Wendy and Lucy got caught in the crossfire of Taxi Driver. The violence portrayed in the film is brutal and graphic. It is by no means glorified and its futility resonates as a major theme throughout the story. But it would be disingenuous of me to pretend I wasn t attracted to cinematic bloodshed. It s an art form unto itself, visually arresting and universally compelling.If you were expecting something more profound, I offer you this truth: the screenplay is a deeply personal exploration of parental mortality and the emotional toll it takes on surviving family members. But heartfelt motivations should not be of concern to you or to my audience; such things don t make it to the big screen. Stories need to stand on their own. So do directors. I m hands-on. I ve led large crews on commercial sets, I ve shot award-winning films on shoestring budgets, I ve sculpted prosthetic makeup appliances and trained dogs to perform stunts. What I ve never done is use my broad skill set to realize something great. To that end, I humbly ask for your support. Put your faith in my team and we will come through. I ll happily stake my career on it. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!!PSSSST! Why support creativity when you could EXPLOIT IT? FOR INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, CONTACT US.

We launched a successful crowdfunding campaign in April 2015. We surpassed our goal by 180%, which helped us open our online store to reach the online market. It has been an amazing journey and we're committed to the evolution of this product! We received amazing feedback from our backers last year for our small and large Cloops. But we've heard your requests to develop an even larger Cloop for those even larger cables you have around the house. Cloop is Patent Pending and International PCT registered.
226`Hi Kickstarter community, Thanks to you, our first project, the GO! Hammock, was recently funded and all rewards have been fulfilled. With the popularity of hammock camping soaring in recent years, many of our backers have requested us to design a hammock camping tarp. We listened and then set out to design a versatile, multi-purpose hammock camping tarp that can also be used as a general purpose camping tarp or shade canopy, even if you don't have a hammock. Featured on: New Color: Coyote Brown has been added!Our backers have voted to unlock the Coyote Brown color option. The photo below is a rendering of the new color.

This mode is also great for winter camping! Storm Mode with Partially Closed Ends: The short panel tie out points allow the tarp to be partially closed to add extra weather protection at the ends of the hammock. 2 Pole Tarp Camping Mode: By using found sticks or your hiking poles, the Apex can be pitched as a camping tarp with excellent coverage. 1 Pole Tarp Camping Mode: This mode allows a tarp camping setup with only one pole.

230`WE DID IT! 100% FUNDED Thank you, PB Backers! PINK! - I know we don't have much time, but if we make it past $30,000 I am adding a bright pink PopcornBall. My daughter Marley's favorite color! Popcorn! It's the world's #1 snack food! Americans eat enough popcorn every year to fill the Empire State Building, TWICE. It is the go-to favorite for family movie nights or watching the latest blockbuster at the movies. The problem is how do you quickly and easily mix up popcorn, especially at the movie theater. Never easy and always a mess. The answer is the PopcornBall. It is the world's only portable, reusable, mixing container for popcorn and other foods too! I guarantee once you use the PopcornBall, you'll never go back to a bowl, bag, or bucket. Buy one now and be the first person in your family and at your local movie theater to have a PopcornBall! Join the PopcornBall Club. See rewards and below. The PopcornBall is a 7.5inch sphere container for mixing It can hold up to 120oz or 15 cups of popcorn, a little less if used for mixing purposes. A typical bag of microwave popcorn is 10 cups. Most small movie popcorns are between 6 to 11 cups. The digital 4x6 Christmas card that comes with every reward level can be used as a $5 off coupon on our website when that launches after the Kickstarter. Valid one coupon per Backer.

It s not too late to PREORDER the game, visit http://godhatescharades.comGod Hates Charades is an awesome party game that will have you and your friends acting like "God auditioning for the role of a dead body on Law And Order","Bill Cosby eating shrooms", or maybe "Jeff Goldblume complaining that MTV doesn't play music videos."Whatever the scene, we promise you'll be laughing so hard your face will melt off like those jerk Nazi's in Raiders Of The Lost Ark. It's so simple, even you, can learn to play in 46 seconds. Check out our interview on the game theory blog. Just in case you don't have an attention span of 46 seconds here is the only rule for God Hates Charades: While acting you can talk, yell, dance, or pantomime fellatio all you want, but say any of the words printed on your cards and its no points for you.The game comes with two decks of cards, the actor cards and the scenario cards. The actor cards feature both fictional and real characters from pop culture. While the scenario cards are absurd events, situations, or actions. Pairing the two cards together makes a scene. As a player your job is to act out scenes and guess other players scenes. These button designs are a work in progress but guaranteed to feature Damien Weighill's awesome artwork. You can vote right now which sketch will become a limited edition art print. Support us so your friends get to be the idiots acting out scenes instead of ours. GHC comes with 100% more fun than actually talking to your friends guarantee. The primary role is that of the actor. Oh lucky you! When you're not acting you are guessing.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 We're heading into the final week of the campaign to fund Pioneers of African-American Cinema -- and we need your help to reach our stretch goal of $60,000. This will enable us to expand the collection from five discs to six -- from eight features to twelve -- and increase the amount of interviews, shorts and fragments in the collection. We are already discussing the possibility of organizing a touring package of films for repertory theaters and festivals. But as our ambitions grow -- so do the costs. Please continue to spread the word about the campaign -- and consider increasing your donation to help us meet our new goal.Campaign Update: March 2, 2015 You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 $60,000 Stretch Goal!Due to the overwhelming response to its current Kickstarter campaign, Kino Lorber has decided to expand its landmark Blu-ray/DVD collection Pioneers of African-American Cinema. Originally announced as a four-disc set, comprised of eight feature films (plus shorts, fragments, and new interviews), Pioneers will be expanded to five discs and will include twelve features, and even more bonus content.To support the additional cost of archival access, mastering, and scoring, Kino Lorber has announced a "stretch goal" for its Kickstarter campaign, and will now aim to reach $60,000 before the campaign ends on March 21. That's less than three weeks from now -- so we need your help with contributions and spreading the word!New Films Announced! Among the films selected by series curators Charles Musser and Jacqueline Stewart are:FEATURE FILMS The Blood of Jesus (1941) Spencer Williams's directorial debut -- a surreal religious parable, selected to the National Film Registry in 1991. The film was restored by the Tyler, Texas Black Film Collection of Southern Methodist University, with funding from the National Film Preservation Foundation Dirty Gertie from Harlem, U.S.A. (1946), Spencer Williams's musical adaptation of W.S. Maugham's "Miss Sadie Thompson." The film was preserved by Southern Methodist University from materials conserved by the George Eastman House, with funding from the Women s Film Preservation Fund (New York Women in Film and Television). The Girl from Chicago (1932) Oscar Micheaux's crime/romance/musical, in which a Mississippi woman becomes involved with an undercover agent and moves with him to Harlem (Library of Congress) The Symbol of the Unconquered (1920) Perhaps the boldest film of the early African-American cinema was this film by Oscar Micheaux, that dared to confront the Ku Klux Klan. Previously unavailable on DVD, this edition will be mastered in HD from a 35mm film element preserved by the Museum of Modern Art and the Cin math que Royale de Belgique. It features a musical score by legendary jazz drummer Max Roach, courtesy of Turner Classic Movies. SHORT FILMS / FRAGMENTS Regeneration (1923) The single surviving reel of Richard Norman's heavily-censored South Seas drama. Preserved by the Library of Congress. Birthright (1939) Only three reels exist of one of Oscar Micheaux's last films (a remake of his own 1924 silent film). Preserved by the Library of Congress. By Right of Birth (1921) This fragment is the only film that survives from the Lincoln Motion Picture Company, one of the first and foremost producers of African-American films, co-founded by Hollywood actor Noble Johnson. (Announced titles are pending restoration and subject to change.) Original Campaign Information Among the most fascinating chapters of film history is that of the so-called race films that flourished in the 1920s - 40s. Unlike the black cast films produced within the Hollywood studio (such as Stormy Weather or Green Pastures), these films not only starred African Americans but were funded, written, produced, directed, distributed, and often exhibited by people of color. Entrepreneurial filmmakers such as Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams, and Richard D. Maurice not only built an industry apart from the Hollywood establishment, they also cultivated visual and narrative styles that were uniquely their own. Defying convention and operating outside the studio system, these filmmakers were the forefathers (and -mothers) of the French New Wave, the L.A. Rebellion, and the entirety of American indie cinema. Anything but imitative, these Pioneers of African-American Cinema were purely innovative. Renowned for its deluxe editions of masterpieces of world cinema, Kino Lorber will now pay tribute to the Pioneers of African-American Cinema with an ambitious four-disc collection. If the campaign achieves its primary goal, the series will include eight feature films and a variety of short films and fragments, a color booklet of photos and essays, and will be offered on Bluray and DVD. All films will be newly mastered in high definition from film elements preserved by the country s leading film archives, including The Library of Congress, the National Archives, and the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Silent films will be accompanied by a variety of original music scores. Some soundtracks will have a more contemporary sound, encouraging the viewer to watch these films with a fresh perspective. For the sake of historical accuracy, each silent film will also include a traditional score intended to replicate the 1920s moviegoing experience. Curated by film historians Charles Musser and Jacqueline Najuma Stewart, and presented by executive producer DJ Spooky, Pioneers of African-American Cinema will showcase not only the works of MIcheaux and Williams, but lesser-known filmmakers such as James and Eloyce Gist, as well as rarely-seen footage shot by writer Zora Neale Hurston. It will also include selections of race films made by white directors, such as Richard E. Norman and Frank Peregini. Without a doubt, it will be the most comprehensive collection of early African-American cinema ever assembled. The handsomely packaged collection will be released in February, 2016, to coincide with the celebration of Black History Month. But such an ambitious undertaking cannot be achieved without your help. Your donation will support the composing and recording of music scores; the production of videotaped interviews with leading film and culture historians; and the publication of a booklet of artwork and newly-commissioned essays on the films. The campaign has a variety of participation levels, allowing you to take an active role in bringing this long-overdue project to life. Even the smallest donation sends a message of encouragement that lets us know you value the cultural significance of these often neglected films, and will allow the voices of these overlooked artists to be heard. As the campaign progresses, we will reveal more details of the collection, release more behind-the-scenes videos, introduce other collaborators in the project, and, if we reach our initial target, announce stretch goals that will enable us to expand the project with exciting new features. So make a donation now to become a part of film history!ABOUT THE FILMS (partial listing) COMMANDMENT KEEPER CHURCH: Later known for her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, Zora Neale Hurston used a 16mm movie camera to document the social conventions and working conditions of African Americans in the deep South. Commandment Keeper Church, Beaufort, South Carolina, May 1940 is a 42-minute film that observes worship services among the Gullah people of Beaufort, South Carolina, in May, 1940. Selected for the National Film Registry in 2005, the footage will be synchronized with previously unreleased field recordings made by Hurston during her travels. ELEVEN P.M.: A truly bizarre mixture of sentimentality, spirituality and the supernatural, Eleven P.M. follows an impoverished violinist who tries to protect a young girl from straying into a life of sin -- and features one of the most mind-boggling endings ever (the poster above provides a hint). Produced by the Maurice Film Company of Detroit, Michigan. Previously unavailable on video. THE FLYING ACE: Conceived as an adventure serial for the "colored cast" market, The Flying Ace is an aviation-themed romance produced by the Florida-based Norman Film Manufacturing Company. This edition will be mastered in HD from 35mm elements preserved by the Library of Congress. Previously unavailable on video.HELLBOUND TRAIN (see update #1)VERDICT NOT GUILTY: This stylized, allegorical film was intended to be shown in churches prior to a sermon, and has the distinction of being the first film (co)directed by an African-American woman, being made by the husband-and-wife team of James and Eloyce Gist. Previously unavailable on video. THE SCAR OF SHAME: Produced by the Colored Players Film Corporation and released in 1929, The Scar of Shame dramatizes issues of class within African-American society. This new edition will include the newly rediscovered wedding sequence, missing from the version previously released on DVD. WITHIN OUR GATES: Considered the most influential of the early African-American filmmakers, Oscar Micheaux fearlessly confronted social issues of the day, unafraid of offending the sensibilities of the audience -- both white and black. Within Our Gates (1919) is Micheaux's masterpiece, a response to the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 and a purgative to the lingering aftertaste of D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation. We will showcase the Library of Congress's acclaimed 1993 restoration, newly remastered in HD.Additional titles will be announced over the course of the Kickstarter campaign.THE NEED FOR FUNDING In the past, Kino Lorber has not used crowd funding to produce its classic releases. However, Pioneers of African-American Cinema is the most ambitious archival release we ve ever undertaken, and we can only pursue the project, on the scale of production it deserves, if we raise funds from the audience. Some examples of where your money will go: Archival Access - In exchange for access to the original film elements, Kino Lorber will make donations to the preservation funds of the archives at which the films are stored. These donations range from $1,000 to $4,000 per film. The more money we raise, the more films we ll include in the collection. Since we plan to release at least eight features and a selection of shorts, the archival donations alone will total an estimated $20,000. Mastering Costs - Each film will be newly transferred in HD or 2K from the original 35mm and 16mm elements. Once the films are all digitized, they each undergo a thorough mastering process, including scene-by-scene color correction (to balance the brightness and contrast), digital dirt/debris removal, image stabilization, and, in the case of silent films, conversion to a historically accurate projection speed. Musical Scores - One of the most costly stages of production is the creation of new musical scores for the silent films. Kino Lorber will commission a variety of scores to complement the films. Contemporary cores will reawaken these archival rarities and challenge our preconceptions of these motion pictures as antiquities. We will also provide more traditional scores, crafted to approximate the style of music that would have been heard at a screening in the 1920s. Booklet - The specially packaged four-disc set will include a 40-page booklet with introductions by the series curators, background information on the films and filmmakers, photos, and notes from the producers. ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTORS Paul Miller, aka DJ Spooky (executive producer) has had an abiding interest in historical film. His remix of D.W. Griffith's infamous The Birth of a Nation paved the way for how we think about applying DJ technique to cinema. As Executive Producer, Miller brings a sensibility that looks at film history and contemporary production as a seamless transition between the history of film and our modern digital media era. Charles Musser (curator) is Professor of Film & Media Studies at Yale University. He has written extensively on Paul Robeson and co-curated Robeson film retrospectives at the UCLA Film and Television Archive and the Museum of Modern Art. He also co-edited Oscar Micheaux and His Circle: African-American Filmmaking and Race Cinema of the Silent Era (2001). His many books on American silent film include the award-winning The Emergence of Cinema: The American Screen to 1907 (1990) and Edison Motion Pictures, 1890-1900 (1997). Charlie's documentary Errol Morris: A Lightning Sketch (2014) premiered at the Big Sky Documentary FIlm Festival. Jacqueline Najuma Stewart (curator) is Professor of Cinema and Media Studies at the University of Chicago. She is the author of Migrating to the Movies: Cinema and Black Urban Modernity (2005) and co-curator and co-editor of L.A. Rebellion: Creating a New Black Cinema (2015) with Allyson Field and Jan-Christopher. Stewart is completing a study of the life and work of African American actor/writer/director Spencer Williams. Bret Wood (producer) has designed and produced numerous award-winning editions of silent and classic for Kino Lorber, including Edison: The Invention of the Movies, The Erich von Stroheim Collection, Gaumont Treasures, Griffith Masterworks, Stanley Kubrick s Fear and Desire, Orson Welles s The Stranger, and collections devoted to Ernst Lubitsch, F.W. Murnau, and Mario Bava, among others. His films as director include The Unwanted and the documentary Hell's Highway: The True Story of Highway Safety Films. S. Torriano Berry (restoration consultant) is an award-winning independent filmmaker who created and executive produced the anthology series "Black Independent Showcase" and "Black Visions/Silver Screen: Howard University Film Showcase" for WHUT-TV 32, in Washington, D.C. His feature-length horror film Embalmer is available on Netflix home video. As a writer, Berry co-authored the film resource books, The 50 Most Influential Black Films and Historical Dictionary of African American Cinema. Berry is an associate professor at Howard University s Department of Media, Journalism, and Film.
234`As seen on: Our new wind meter Wind is an important factor for a wide range of activities, but the greatest places in the great outdoors are far away from any weather station. In order to give you precise and sharable wind readings on the spot, we created the first Vaavud wind meter and launched it here on Kickstarter. People loved it!Now we are back to launch the world's first handheld wind meter that actually measures wind direction, as well as of course wind speed. This is made possible by our unique asymmetrical rotor design (for further details scroll down to the technical stuff).We have gone through countless iterations on the rotor design and we have obsessed about every little line and detail, to make sure that both performance and looks are second to none. The Vaavud app The new device will work with the popular Vaavud app, which features the world's first real-time graph on a handheld wind meter; a global live map; your personal measurement history and much more to come. Device compatibility Currently we have confirmed the new device to work with the following phones and tablets, and the list keeps growing! *iPods do not have a compass, so on those the app will show wind speed, but not wind directionTimeline We are working towards a shipping date in November 2014, and so far all is set to achieve that target Rewards Stretch goals Colour choice: The third colour will be the one that gets the most votes from all backers, once the campaign is over. More info on this will follow when we get thereMount + data export: The mount will be printable on most common 3D printers, and will be designed to work with a standard jack-stick extender cable. The design files will be made available, so you can do all the modifications you want to. The data export feature will upload a time series for each measurement as a CSV file to a dropbox folder of your choiceSpecial carry case: This will be a neoprene hard case similar to the ones known from Oakley sunglasses etc. but tailor made to the Vaavud wind meter. We are quite happy with the current neoprene bags, but this will be something special; a snug fitting, robust, exclusive case made just for your Vaavud V2.0 Welcome on board! Our Kickstarter legacy Comments from backers and press about our first Kickstarter campaign The technical stuffWe are using an optical sensor that measures 40.000 times per second, so we can detect even the slightest variation in rotation speed. By making the rotor of the wind meter slightly asymmetrical we get it to accelerate a bit when the largest part is hit by the wind. We can then compare the point with the highest speed to the compass direction and derive the wind direction. At the same time, data from the highly accurate sensor can be used to derive the average rotation speed and thereby the wind speed.The graph below shows the change in velocity during one full rotation for one of our prototypes. For this one the difference in speed is a bit more than 3%, and the maximum speed is reached at about 45 degrees from start.

Guatemala Ecoestufas and Prototypes You reserve a Candle Charger at retail price and we'll install one of our chargers into a clean cookstove for a family in Guatemala. Buy one, give one - excited to try this exclusively on Kickstarter and see what we can do! Stower is a leader in personal energy product engineering and design. Together with our manufacturing partner PCH, Stower makes smart, reliable energy products that 1) do their job and 2) do it well.The Candle Charger contains two core pieces of technology: A thermoelectric module, also known as a Peltier cooler. Thermoelectric modules are semiconductor devices that convert temperature gradients one side hot, one side cold into electricity. The Candle Charger uses nontoxic bismuth telluride-based modules, which have been in mass production for over twenty years for scientific, refrigeration, and automotive industries. The Stower smart circuit that conditions the power coming from the module to match power requirements of the device being charged (e.g. a smartphone). What makes the Candle Charger an important innovation is the conversion efficiency of the device, its electrical strategy, and the focus on design for indoor use. Conversion EfficiencyThe Candle Charger achieves class-leading power output from thermoelectric modules, providing reliable USB power over extended periods of operation. We do this through a combination of patented mechanical engineering steps to optimize heat transfer from the candle, to the thermoelectric module, and into the water bath; careful control over thermal interfaces; and spatial design to position the Candle Charger relative to a heat source (i.e. the candle). Electrical Strategy To increase cost savings and overall efficiency, Stower directly charges your electronic devices rather than charge an intermediate battery. We re able to do this through circuitry developed exclusively for Stower products that continually monitors the power output from the thermoelectric generator, boosts the voltage to USB standard 5V, conditions the power from the generator so it matches internal charging requirements of smartphones, switching between bands of acceptable current levels and gradually dropping the voltage so phones don t drop the charge, provides LED indicator sequences to clearly show power availability a flashing light means power is available, while a stead light means steady power is achieved and the power output is iPhone ready. Designed for Indoor UseWe began with energy - the candle - and built the Candle Charger from there. The Candle Charger is sturdy enough to work outdoors, but its sleek design fits in with other beautiful shelf items for in-home storage and use. The handle and locking mechanism are necessary features that provide safe interface with the water bath during operation and collapsability for anywhere storage. The all-aluminum exterior - designed for maximum thermal efficiency - lends a modern look while being durable enough to take outdoors. Stower's been a hard charging machine since our birth in 2012. Stower is led by Andy, Adam, and Jason. Andy and Adam met in grad school studying materials science. Both were obsessed with solar technologies and nanomaterials - so much so that Adam once illicitly snuck Andy into the campus nanofab, bunny suits and all, to help characterize sapphire wafers. STOWER GONE WILD! We're also lucky enough to work with some extremely talented advisors and partners that help make Stower a reality, including: Dr. Reza Kassayan - our world-class electrical engineer and advisor PCH - our supply chain, design, and manufacturing partners REI, Sportsman's Warehouse, FGL Sports in Canada, and other retail partners who've helped deliver our first product nationwide. Stanford, StartX, and Orange Fab - hundreds of folks who support and help us make new energy innovations. Stower builds energy products for individuals, making it easier and more efficient to generate and control our own electricity. Smartphones are amazing machines: Stower chargers keep these powered when the grid can't. With this technology, Stower is also introducing electricity to thousands of homes in emerging markets.

Tulipe Noire is a rare deep purple tulip, and is my inspiration for a unique women s watch collection that s mechanical, limited, and always sprinkled with genuine diamonds. I m a watch designer and gemologist with a dream. While I have created many collections for famous brands and fashion houses, I ve always wanted to design a collection, truly feminine, that doesn t look like a copy, a piece of dainty jewelry doubling as a watch, or a takedown of a men s timepiece. With Tulipe Noire, I created every piece in the collection to ensure each detail was exactly what I wanted in a watch. I have completed all my design work. I have reviewed the samples, and paid for them. All models are set for production with trusted and proven factories who are ready to begin producing. Thanks to your support in achieving the funding goal, the first production run of Tulipe Noire watches for women has started.

238`WASTE NOT NUT (WNN) is the only inverted bottle system on the planet that effortlessly gets you every last drop every time.A bottle s innate design makes gravity work against the user, leaving unused product at the bottom. As more product is used, the further the separation from the spout and the more difficult to squeeze or shake it out. Even pump bottles invariably leave the last few ounces as un-pump able waste. We wanted to create a cool tool that would work against throw-away consumerism and encourage responsible habits for our children and the world. It was really driving us nuts that our family was constantly wasting the shampoo, conditioners, and lotions that got stuck at the bottom of bottles. We finally came up with the idea for the WASTE NOT NUT, an inverted bottle system that gets every last drop every time. No more hoarding 30oz bottles of conditioner just to save the last 3oz that are stuck at the bottom!Not only is WASTE NOT NUT important for saving money on beauty products it is the missing link for the bottle recycling process. All recycling programs reject bottles that still have even the slightest bit of product left in them. However, when it comes to bottles with thick liquids, without WASTE NOT NUT, it is exceedingly time consuming and difficult to get all of the product from bottles before recycling (especially for those with limited hand strength like children and the elderly). WASTE NOT NUT encourages good recycling habits, making the choice to be consistently green easy, fun and rewarding. Now we're ready for the next step. Let's get WASTE NOT NUT out there where it belongs, in your hands! We've compiled this list of what we consider to be the most wasteful spending habits to shed some light on how much these habits might really be costing: Here's a FREE e-book with the Dirty Dozen List of our costliest & most wasteful habits!

Budget. Your Waste Not Nut Rewards. About the team.EveMy strong creative streak and passion for design led me to spend a year of college studying in Paris, where I met my husband and business partner, Vincent. While I was there, I discovered that even common household products were not only practical, but also creatively designed. I loved the idea of creating tools that are both aesthetically beautiful and practical in the US. After a long career as a paralegal specializing in Entertainment and Intellectual Property my creativity and passion for design was reawakened and I became an inventor with the Waste Not Nut as my first project.Vincent In 1993, I moved from France to the United States with Eve, my wife and business partner. After completing an MBA from the University of Southern California (USC), I pursued a career in Business Management Consulting. I've been supporting Eve in her endeavors from the very beginning. The combination of Eve's knack for design and my strong project management experience built on 20+ years of bringing projects to life, make this the perfect partnership to bring this project to fruition. We ve done our research and learned from exemplary companies with ecological and earth-conscious business philosophies. We are dedicated to keeping the same core values with this venture. WASTE NOT NUT is a simple solution that encourages consumers to act responsibly and make better earth and wallet conscious decisions.Thanks for your support! Share WNN on FacebookShare WNN on Twitter
239`At DroneRafts, we have developed an accessory for the DJI Phantom 4 and Phantom 3 quadcopter. Like all-terrain suspension for your drone, WaterStrider enables perfect footage and fearless landings anywhere. WaterStrider on Phantom 3 taking a splash in the stream. Water strider insects glide naturally over water, inspiring the function and design of the WaterStrider, our patent-pending landing gear. It is elegantly designed to maximize flight performance, landing stability, buoyancy on water, and is ruggedly engineered and tested. With the funding from this campaign, our plan is to go into full production and share this amazing product, allowing you to #DroneAnywhere. We originally envisioned an accessory which allows drones to land on water. The more we flew the prototypes, the more benefits we discovered: added stability, visibility, and undaunted landings. And we've only scratched the surface. Already we have received ideas for other innovative ways to use WaterStrider. Did you ever find the perfect spot to capture some amazing aerial footage with your drone, only to find that there is no good place to take off and land? Maybe you've tried the dangerous practice of hand-catching and hand-launching your drone, or maybe you just didn t get the shot. Unfortunately, some of the most beautiful places to film have the worst options for takeoff and landing. With WaterStrider, landings on almost any surface are worry-free, allowing you to focus on getting the perfect shot. Don't let this happen to your drone. Use WaterStrider for fearless landings on any surface. #DroneAnywhere with confidence using WaterStrider on your Phantom 4. Featured Media Our Commitment and GuaranteeWe are committed to the WaterStrider as well as the experience of our customers using it. We're happy to offer the following guarantee to the backers of this campaign. Engineered DesignWe've considered every possible design detail we could manage. Before starting our design work, we developed a thorough product requirements document. For each requirement, we also developed a plan for testing it to be sure it would work as expected. We're proud to say that WaterStrider now meets or exceeds these requirements. Some of the best design elements that came from this process are highlighted in the animation and further discussion below. We landed on this rock field with the Phantom 4 to show how WaterStrider provides amazing stability and protection to the drone. Other landing gear extensions and gimbal guards on the market come nowhere close to this level of stability and protection. Another key design feature is the ability to get clear footage without any obstructions in the camera's Field Of View (FOV). In fact, most of the campaign video footage was filmed using two WaterStrider equipped drones. The WaterStrider is designed to be extremely durable. Of course we did some initial rapid prototyping and proof of concept work using 3D printing. However, 3D printed parts are definitely not strong enough to meet our requirements to provide long-term durability (with sun and water exposure), remain lightweight, and permit freedom to land anywhere without worry. Our parts are fully engineered from the ground up and use carbon fiber as well as injection molded and thermoformed high impact plastics. The WaterStrider is designed to protect the drone by absorbing the maximum descent velocity impact of the Phantom on any terrain, including water, with no damage. A 3D printed version of comparable weight to our final solution only survived about 33% of the requirement. The production WaterStrider meets the full 100% and more. We've tested the design to prove it. One of the common questions we receive is: How does WaterStrider affect the drone handling and performance in windy conditions. The video below shows how the WaterStrider handles very windy and gusty conditions on both the Phantom 3 and Phantom 4. Design & Development After doing some research and analysis of the rapidly expanding drone industry, we looked to users for their stories, and we heard you: "We want easier, safer landings anywhere." So we set out to develop a solution for every possible earthly terrain.We knew we had a ton of considerations: weight, balance, buoyancy, durability, aerodynamics, hard landings, and compatibility with the camera and sensors. What materials would look good and provide the kind of features we need? How can we keep the cost low? How will the finished product connect to the drone? As soon as we had a good concept, we started prototyping in earnest. It turns out that we changed almost every design feature as a result of several rounds of testing. With each prototype, the product got better and better. Like a good songwriter or artist, we know that at some point, it's time to put the pencil down. The resulting WaterStrider is a light, lean, production-ready reality. WaterStrider on Phantom 3 ready to continue exploring. This comparison chart shows how the WaterStrider compares to other drone products with some similar characteristics. The WaterStrider combined with DJI Phantom provides great value and capability compared to the other options.

240`Do you want a smart jumprope? I don t know, but after seeing the video below, you probably will this thing displays your workout stats right in front of your eyes. - Digital TrendsSmart Rope: The Evolution of a Classic Smart Rope is an LED-embedded jump rope that works with your smartphone, creating an anywhere, anytime fitness experience. We ve created a true active fitness wearable that brings the best in new tech to a tried-and-true workout, consistently recommended by the health and wellness community. Tangram is bringing the jump rope into the 21st century. - Crunch TheoryAs featured in: Why the jump rope? The humble jump rope has been hailed as one of the most efficient exercise tools in existence, yet it often takes a back seat to more advanced equipment. Tangram Factory is hoping to change this by upgrading its handles with sensors and adding LEDs to the rope itself. - Cool Hunting We re all looking to make our health a priority - eating right and being active. We re living longer and healthcare continues to be a huge expense for society at large. We know we need to work out more, but the time and money required don t always make it easy. Unfortunately, many workouts that look to fill that need are here today, gone tomorrow - just look at any Made for TV gadget or that huge setup in the basement that s being used for a coat hanger, collecting dust in our basement. The jump rope may be the most portable and convenient cardio tool available. Relearn how to use it and you ll be lean, spry, and well conditioned for life. - Men s FitnessJumping rope can be done just about anywhere, anytime. Think of all the reasons we don t work out - it s raining, we re too busy today, we don t want to add yet another monthly expense to the budget. If you have a few square feet and a few minutes, you can get an incredibly rewarding workout: 30 minutes of jump rope (10 x 3 min sessions) burns 480 calories at a moderate pace Works out the calves and leg muscles, shoulders and rear delts, abs, quads, hamstrings - just about every major muscle group Strong cardiovascular benefits but lower-impact than jogging Good for bone health Improves coordination, breathing efficiency You d have to run an eight-minute mile to work off more calories than you d burn jumping rope. - WebMDWhile the benefits of jumping rope are universally well-established, so are some of the drawbacks. It s easy to learn, but challenging to master. It s not easy to know how you re progressing, since people jump at different paces and we re all built differently. It s also a pretty solitary activity, so it can be a challenge to stay motivated. And with many recommended interval sessions requiring jumps in the thousands, it s almost impossible to keep an accurate count. How do we evolve the jump rope experience? We tackle the jump rope s fundamental challenges, and then empower our workout with technology and smart data. With each jump, Smart Rope displays jump data right before your eyes, creating a truly immersive workout experience that s fun - and just as important, provides information you ll actually use to get healthier."Although wearable devices have received significant attention for their ability to track an individual s physical activity, most smartphone applications are just as accurate." - Journal of the American Medical AssociationWhile there are plenty of wearable devices out there that can be used in fitness, nearly all of them are passive monitoring devices. The sensors in wearables are the same sensors that you already have in your smartphone - accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS. Smart Rope makes the actual workout smarter - not just a passive monitoring wearable, but an active fitness device. Rather than simply monitoring movement like most passive wearables, the smart rope incorporates the natural motion of skipping rope to accurately count jumps, track and recommend workout interval sessions, and calculate calories burned based on your body mass index (BMI). - DesignboomBecause Smart Rope works with your smartphone, we ll be able to upgrade functionality over time. To start, we ll focus on delivering these core features: Counting. It s simple enough to track how long you ve been jumping, and it s a good start. But everyone jumps at a different pace, and you can be sure that an elite boxer is going to be jumping a lot faster than someone just starting out. Keeping an accurate count of your jumps is important, but it s very difficult when you re counting into the hundreds and thousands - especially when you re concentrating on a strenuous workout. Smart Rope displays an accurate count at all times and keeps track of each workout with your smartphone. Calories. Burning fat and building muscle is central to many workouts. By entering your height and weight into the smartphone app, Smart Rope calculates your calories burned, using your BMI (body mass index) and jumps counted. In calorie mode, you ll see how many calories you re burning with each jump. Interval Training. We all know how helpful it can be to encourage each other while we re working out. Based on your BMI and jump rope ability, Smart Rope will provide you with goals and interval training recommendations. Our initial release will allow you to easily post your progress on Facebook, as well as challenge your other Smart Rope friends to workout goals. We ll be baking more social integration into Smart Rope with future software releases. What is Smart Rope? What really sets this new wearable apart from everything else that has been offered is the ability to show the user's stats in real-time on thin air. - Tech TimesProduct Design Our previous design work has won nearly every major accolade in the industry - if you ve ever used a Samsung TV recently, chances are you ve seen what we can do. Inspired by the natural flow and motion of the circular revolutions of jumping rope, we ve created a sleek, ultra-modern design that s simple and elegant. Instead of just showing a small jump counter on the handles, the Smart Rope uses 23 LED lights that actually display your jump count in mid-air while you re in motion. The display can show up to four digits, and can also be toggled to show how many calories you re burning, if you prefer a different sort of motivation. - TechCrunchWe ve embedded 23 high-quality LEDs into a proprietary, patent-pending FPCB (flexible printed circuit board) design. These LEDs can display up to four digits with clear visibility even in bright rooms, and eventually we ll be able to display things like icons and emojis with upcoming software releases. As you jump, the LEDs display your progress right before your eyes. They ll also illuminate as you power on and off the Smart Rope, and provide information about battery life. The sensor technology is housed in the Smart Rope handle. Instead of using a simple gyroscopic sensor like the ones in your smartphone or other passive monitoring wearables, we ve developed a proprietary magnetic sensor that precisely registers actual revolutions of the rope, or one complete jump. The Bluetooth 4.0 transmitter is also housed here, used to communicate with your smartphone. A single button is used to turn the Smart Rope on and off, pair the Smart Rope with your smartphone, and reset the device. Removing the button s rubber cover reveals the mini USB port, used for charging the Smart Rope with your smartphone charger or your computer s powered USB port. Aside from all the digital technology involved, we ve also elevated the physical design of the jump rope in a variety of ways. The rope is positioned at a 45 degree angle to the handle to encourage effortless, natural motion. Ball bearings are used to ensure fast, smooth revolutions. All materials are of premium quality and finish, with meticulous attention to detail. At launch, Smart Rope will be available in three sizes: Small (rope length 8 ft / 243 cm): best for jumpers 5 ft - 5 ft 4 in tall (152 - 163 cm tall) Medium (rope length 8 ft 6 in / 258 cm): best for jumpers 5 ft 5 in - 5 ft 9 in tall (165 - 175 cm tall) Large (rope length 9 ft / 274 cm): best for jumpers 5 ft 10 in - 6 ft 2 in tall (178 - 188 cm tall) X-Large (rope length 9 ft 5 in / 287 cm): best for jumpers 6 ft 3 in tall - 6 ft 7 in tall (191 - 201 cm tall) User Experience (UX) Our Smart Gym app works seamlessly with Smart Rope with two-way communication. Jumps counted and workout times are broadcast to the app for tracking and monitoring, while BMI data and workout goals entered into the app are broadcast to Smart Rope to craft your custom workout. Smart Gym works with multiple Smart Rope devices, although Bluetooth won t allow simultaneous pairing of multiple devices. This means your family (or your CrossFit team) can use different Smart Rope devices with a single smartphone. Keep accurate, detailed data of each workout. You ll see how many jumps you re taking with each interval session and how you re improving over time. In this mode, the LEDs will display each jump counted. By entering your height and weight, Smart Gym uses your BMI (body mass index) and each jump tracked by Smart Rope to calculate calories burned. Monitor calories burned by workout and totals per day and week. In this mode, the LEDs will display calories burned as you jump. Smart Gym takes your BMI and jump rope ability and recommends interval training workouts, based on published guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). You can easily post your progress on your Facebook page, and challenge your Smart Rope friends to workout goals. With future software upgrades, we ll be building in more and more functionality into Smart Gym. With your support, our long-term vision is to build out a robust platform that connects to a variety of active fitness wearables and provides a holistic view of health and wellness. We re already working hard on integration with Apple Health, Google Fit, and plan to develop integration with Apple Watch as soon as it s released. With your support It s been a long road getting to this point, but we re now at a place where we feel confident in securing support for the final steps in releasing Smart Rope to the public. We ve produced a working prototype - the handles perform beautifully, the LEDs display accurately and clearly, and we ve reduced the thickness of the rope itself to ensure the safe housing of the FPCB system and an ideal weight for efficient jumping. The prototype also pairs seamlessly via Bluetooth to our Smart Gym app and registers each count accurately. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Your funds will go directly to the final development of the Smart Rope and Smart Gym app, and the initial production run. We are continuing to fine tune the rope itself, ensuring flexibility and ideal thickness while protecting against impact and maintaining clear visibility. This is perhaps the most intricate part of the physical development process and our electrical engineers, product designers, and software developers are all hands on deck. The Smart Gym mobile platform has been wireframed and initial design is complete. We ll be completing software development as well as continuing rigorous testing to ensure seamless integration with Smart Rope hardware. We will also provide stand-alone functionality into Smart Rope, so the basic counting features can be used without a smartphone (and single workout sessions can be tracked and monitored into Smart Rope s memory, so it can be transferred to Smart Gym later). Portability is a great asset for Smart Rope, so we ll also be creating a compact, easy to use package for each Smart Rope. Project Timeline Smart Rope working prototype: Complete! Smart Gym UX wireframes and design: Mar 2015 Unveiling at Mobile World Congress, Barcelona: Mar 2-5, 2015 Smart Rope and Smart Gym development and testing: Mar - Jun 2015 Smart Rope initial production (5K units): Jul - Aug 2015 Smart Gym app, iOS release: Aug 2015 Smart Rope final delivery to backers: Aug - Sep 2015 Smart Gym app, Android release: Oct 2015 With our deep expertise in each major discipline - product design, electrical and mechanical engineering, UX design and development - we estimate delivery of the finished Smart Rope in 5-6 months, by August of this year.

241`The only rational thing to do is get the hell out of town. If only it were that easy..... THE LAST STRETCH GOALS$111k - A new 6-8 page supplemental story that will be PDF/digital delivery only; every backer $9-PDF level and above will receive this exclusively. And everyone receiving a physical copy of the book gets a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS bookmark.$120k - Either a second 6-8 page supplemental story, or the first supplement will be expanded to 12-16 pages. PDF/digital delivery only; every backer $9-PDF level and above will receive this exclusively. And everyone receiving a physical copy of the book will get a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS postcard and a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS bookmark.$150k - Jim will shave his head. (Pretty sure we're not making this one, --I hope-- but if we do, it will be filmed and put up for viewing.) (PS: There's no allowance here for back-outs and denied credit cards; if my hair is going, it's at 150k for real)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------ONE LAST REWARDIt's the final days of the campaign, and we've come up with a high-end unique pledge reward to -hopefully- give us a significant boost towards our final stretch goal. We're offering a one of a kind edition of Jim Calafiore's script notes and layouts. "When I begin a new book, I print out the script one script-page to an 8 1/2 x 11 page. On these I make my notes to myself, and questions to ask the writer. I also do a pen thumbnail of how I'll lay out the page. The next step is a rough pencil sketch on layout paper about half the size of the final art board, which -for the final penciling- is blown up and transferred to the full size art board using a light box." This is an opportunity to own all of Jim's script pages with notes and thumbnails, and all the original layout roughs for the whole main story of LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS. The volume will be over 160 pages (more if we exceed the 105k stretch goal), more than 80 pages of Jim's original pencil layouts, showing his creative process. Also included will be Jim's original layouts for both the regular and alternate covers for the graphic novel, as well as a selection of the original character pencil roughs. This will be bound in a single hardcover volume, a little larger than 8 1/2 x 11. The cover will feature the same art as the regular graphic novel. There will be a foreword by Jim, and an afterword by Gail, and the book will be signed by both Gail and Jim. Being all original art, this will of course be a single edition. The pledge level will be $4,000. We are limiting this to CONTINENTAL US ONLY because, to be honest, it scares the willies out of us to think about shipping a one-of-a-kind out of the country. If you are outside the continental US, but plan to attend a convention in the US that Jim or Gail will be attending, you can pledge for the book and pick it up there. (Jim's website jimcalafiore.com lists his con schedule, and he usually does at least the same shows each year. And both Gail and Jim definitely do San Diego Comic Con.) As an additional bonus, for any backer who pledges for this volume, if you are attending a convention that either Gail or Jim or both are attending, you can choose to receive the book personally at a lunch with the creator(s). ------------------------------------------------------112 PAGE STRETCH GOALWe exceeded $92k!Onward and upward. Our next goal is more pages. The stretch goal to increase the page count to 112 pages is $105k. These would be story pages, not filler. We'd love the opportunity to put even more into the story. And we think we have a serious chance of reaching the next goal.The support has been amazing; and just looking at the number we've reached already is extremely gratifying. Shows not only what the fans can do, but what Kickstarter can be for so many creators. Direct connection with no middlemen. ThanksSTRETCH GOALS$86k unlocks the Comixology digital comic. We're contracting with Comixology to help fulfill our digital rewards commitment. They will take our book and convert it to a digital comic that works with their app, and feature all the functionality like double-tap zoom. (All backers at the PDF level and above will get a code to use at Comixology to download the digital comic for free. We will still be sending the PDF to all those backers.) Comixology will also host a small preview of the book for free download when it's ready.$92k As mentioned below, we've been hoping to reunite the Secret Six team, and bring the excellent colorist Jason Wright on board. We definitely had a great working rapport with him, and he brought so much to the series. Jason won't have any personal stake in the book, so he'd be hired basically as an independent contractor. And in this same goal, we'll be looking to bring on a separate letterer who will also be handling our pre-press file handling, getting it ready for the printer, freeing us up creatively.(Folded into both of those is also an accommodation for the fact that we've happily exceeded our 3,000 book print run estimate, and are into the next level of printing costs.)We're looking into the goal after that, and hoping to expand to 112 pages which will let us open and deepen the story even more. We're looking into budget and pricing for that (besides printing, there's the added freight and shipping costs because of increased weight). We figure that will be somewhere over 100k; we'd be beyond thrilled if we can get that far, but don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're grateful for how far you've gotten us already. ---------------------------------------As of the $81k goal, the book is now hardcover; all copies shipped will be hardcover. -----------------------------------We are also offering a signed bookplate to be included with the book. If you'd like that, you have to add $10 to your pledge (to cover our printing, shipping and inserting of the book plates). A few of the rewards have it listed, but it applies to all rewards. Any reward pledge that includes the actual book increased by that $10 will get the bookplate included. (The $10 does not apply to the two 10-book bulk rewards; those backers add $25) There's more explanation in the FAQ and UPDATES.LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS is a thrilling, original 80 page graphic novel of suspense and terror in a superhero universe gone horribly wrong, where a small band of survivors face the horror of both their formerly beloved protectors, and the dark secrets within themselves. Featuring the creative talents of writer Gail Simone and artist Jim Calafiore this is a story of violence, fear, hope and --if they're lucky-- survival. LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS will be brought to you by the team behind DC Comics' critical smash, SECRET SIX. IGN.COM called the final issue of Secret Six, "the best single comic issue of 2011," and in this dark ride of a story, we go even wilder! LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS is a journey, by two professional creators, with no holds barred and no limits imposed. Our groundbreaking work on SECRET SIX was only the beginning. If you thought that was dark... LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS will be a new and complete story in a single 80 page volume. Bonus materials will include development sketches, single page illustrations by some of the biggest names in comics, a forward by industry legend MARK WAID, and a short prose story in the LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS universe by Gail Simone. Initial plans are for the graphic novel to be available only through this Kickstarter drive. We're handling everything, including shipping of the individual books to pledges of $15 or above. There's additional goodies to be had with higher pledge incentives, listed down the right side of the page. The rewards will ship at different times. Some incentives, like the print or commission art, will ship within months; the graphic novel will ship in early 2013. This an example of the 9x12 commission This is an example of the 11x17 commission Plans are to keep the printing in the US, (the same printer and specs as the last Secret Six trade, THE DARKEST HOUSE), and if possible to reunite with another of the SIX team, colorist Jason Wright. And if we're lucky, and the funding goal is exceeded enough to afford it, we hope to expand the page count. We're working on the book now, so please check back for more preview art as it's done. Thanks so much for considering our project.ABOUT THE CREATORSGAIL SIMONE is the multiple award winning writer of WONDER WOMAN, BIRDS OF PREY, DEADPOOL, THE SIMPSONS, and many other classic runs of some of the world's most popular comics.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 My Dear GrandFam: When we started this campaign three weeks ago, we had a goal to make just enough to produce this album. But you've made it clear that the sky is the limit. I've been reading your comments on the Kickstarter page. You've challenged me to see how far we can go, to use every dollar now to promote this message to an even bigger audience, to make our voices heard on a global stage -- and to come to your hometown and see you on tour! Well, I want you to know I've heard you loud and clear!Your love and support are overwhelming. Because of YOU, we're almost in the top 5 music projects in Kickstarter's history -- and you're not done yet. In fact, it's getting hard to come up with words to adequately express my thanks. So I thought the best way to show you how grateful I am is to take you behind the scenes to see how your generosity is paying off.This video update comes to you from Harmony Studios in Los Angeles, where I'm spending my days and nights making the best record I can for YOU. The bass and drum clips in this video update were recorded at Sage and Sound Recording Studios--also in LA.I can't wait to share with you the music that YOU made possible!While words aren't enough, still I've gotta say, "Thank you. Thank you. Thank you." I can never say that enough. I love you all!There are 9 days left.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 My Beloved GrandFam: Wow! What can I say?YOU are making history again. YOU have officially made this project one of the top 10 most funded music projects in Kickstarter s history and we re not done yet!This milestone is just the latest example of the determination YOU have shown right from the start. Check out the stats: Just 17 hours after launch, YOU busted through the original $81,000 goal. Within 24 hours, YOU shared the project roughly 9,000 times on Facebook. In under 2 days, YOU made this one of only 32 out of 27,000+ music projects in Kickstarter s history to be successfully funded at $100,000 or more. Within 5 days, YOU pledged double our original funding goal. Within 9 days, on March 6, the project became one of the top 10 most funded music projects in Kickstarter s history and counting. Now, with 17 days left, YOU are unstoppable. We re at 2,700+ backers pledging $182,000+ -- and counting.I am totally blown away by what YOU are doing. This is no longer just an album. Because of YOU, it s truly a grassroots movement. YOU are proving that that all of us working together can be just as effective as a record label. And together, we can keep the music pure.YOU weren t satisfied with giving just enough to get this record produced. YOU seem determined to put this album on the same playing field with artists who are backed by major labels. YOUR message is clear: The sky is the limit. Let s see how far we can go! Every dollar now means we can market and promote this album to an even wider audience and make our voices heard on an international scale.Because you have inspired me, I ve been doing some research on what it takes to make a hit. This article lays it all out. How Much Does It Cost to Make a Hit Song? NPR article.Bottom line: The bare-bones cost is $80K just to produce a song, let alone a whole album. Another $1 million gets it heard.Radio promotion itself can cost a quarter of a million dollars just to compete with releases from major label artists. There are only a certain number of spots for new artists on radio playlists and we re competing with the biggest names out there.Check out this list below of what it takes to make a hit record. It s enough to make your head spin!Album production including producer mix engineer mastering engineer A&R executive (artists and repertoire) session musicians studio rental rehearsal rooms recording equipment cartage per diems rental gear lodging touring musicians hotel rooms gas vehicle rental flights tour manager Internet promotional materials online, print, TV and radio advertising radio promotion executives independent radio promotion staff to compete with releases from major label artists radio trade magazine advertising promotional CD manufacturing costs CD mailing costs digital distribution costs T&E for promotion staff, manufacturing costs for CDs UPC codes ISRC codes graphic designer distribution fees legal fees for all agreements licensing/syncs to partner with movies, TV and radio campaigns branding partnerships label operating costs marketing executives social media executive graphic design and video editing for promotional items and videos online and offline advertising art designers for album packaging website design and maintenance publicist to make sure our message gets heard press release distribution photo shoots video producer video promotion, including viral videos and web content to bring our message to the widest possible audience video director camera operators location fees wardrobe makeup artists editing distribution to make sure the album is available across the country production of online content to keep fans connected Some people might be daunted by this list but not GrandFam!Look what we ve already done so far! Most of the contributions are gifts of $10, $15 or $25. All we need now are a few more of those.It's because of YOUR continued support that we will be able not only to complete the album, but to support the release in the face of competition from the major labels who usually dominate the radio airwaves.Because of YOU, we will be able to go on tour and play live for you guys in your hometowns. Because of YOU, we will continue to make our videos and our music and, in the end, to share our vision for a world that looks beyond our differences and embraces the belief that we're all worthy of love, that all of our voices are valid.THANKS for all you are doing. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.There are 17 days left. Please invite your friends to join the movement by sharing this link:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/stevegrand/all-american-boy-the-album?ref=live Update after 40 HoursWow! It s late in the evening on February 27th about 40 hours since I launched my Kickstarter campaign and you guys have already pledged more than $125,000! It only took 17 hours for you to break through the original goal of $81,000. I m very moved and humbled by your confidence in me and grateful for your generosity. THANK YOU! I knew you guys would do it but I m AMAZED at how quickly you did it!I just got back from a full day in the studio with Aaron Johnson, where we began working on the second set of songs that will be on the album twelve in all. I can t wait until it s done and ready to be put out into the world and shared with all of you. When that day comes it will be because YOU made it possible!Now that you have fully funded the production of the All-American Boy record, I hope we can keep this momentum going! As I mentioned in the Kickstarter project video, Record companies often spend hundreds of thousands of dollars millions for the bigger artists producing and promoting an album. Now that we ve reached our original goal, we can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that this album is definitely going to be made. But there s really no limit on how high we can fly, if we have the money to market and promote the album properly.I ve already stepped out in faith and hired some of the best music marketing people in the industry to promote the album, so that our stories and our voices can be heard around the world! So rest assured, I ve got good people around me advising me on how to spend YOUR money wisely, so that together we can have the greatest impact.As I ve said before, A good love song is a good love song. I believe we are not far away from the day when the world will be singing along--whenever a man sings openly about his love for his man, or a woman sings openly about her love for another woman. With your help, I m committed to being the next in a long line of runners who have carried that torch and brought us so far already. Help me continue to add our voice to all of theirs. I really believe that the world is ready for this!So, please, keep on giving. There are 29 days left in this campaign. And, with Kickstarter, there s no limit on to how much money we can raise together. The total will be whatever all of you, acting together, decide it will be. During the past eight months, you ve amazed me countless times already. And I can t wait to see what you re gonna do next! I m excited and energized...but mostly I m moved and humbled by what you have done. So, from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU for making all of this possible! Let s keep supporting each other as the world continues to change all around us.THANK YOU LARRY KING for Being the First to Support My Kickstarter Project! I'm honored that Larry King stepped up to be the first supporter of my Kickstarter project by writing me a check in the middle of the interview! Click to watch the full episode of Larry King Now. Our Amazing JourneyIt s been an amazing journey since I released All-American Boy on YouTube last July. I made the video using my own money (and maxing out my credit card) independently and without a label or management. Without any money left to do promotion of any kind, I uploaded the video to YouTube and clicked "Share" on Facebook. Thanks to all of YOU who shared the videos with your friends and on social media, the video went viral almost overnight, landing me spots on major news outlets like Good Morning America, CNN and major print publications. We now have over 2.75 million views! With your help, we released a second video, STAY. I got to meet amazing people like Elton John, Mariah Carey, and Edie Windsor. And best of all, I got to meet so many of YOU, my beloved GrandFam, as I toured around the country. I got to hear your amazing stories. Your hopes and fears. Your triumphs and heartaches. And how in some small way, my music made you feel a little less lonely in the world.Connecting with those of you who have reached out to me through social media and those of you I've been fortunate enough to meet in person (and hug) has been the most amazing part of all of this! It is those of you who have inspired me to keep going: to continue to express my experiences, reflections, and feelings through music and videos and art.Now, with your help, I am ready to complete my first full-length album and share it with all of you!Thanks to all of you who have bought my music or have come out to see me perform, I've been able to make the first four songs of my record. I've teamed up with Aaron Johnson, who is responsible for creating and shaping many of the sounds you hear on the records from Secondhand Serenade, Katie Herzig and Eve 6. He is best known for producing the first records from The Fray [ Over My Head (Cable Car), How to Save a Life, You Found Me ]. He is producing, sound engineering, and mixing my entire album, and he's doing an amazing job! To get a taste of what we have been creating in the studio together, check out Back to California. If you like the song, you can download it for free from Bandcamp or iTunes.Recording and producing an album can be an expensive undertaking. Record companies often spend hundreds of thousands of dollars millions for the bigger artists producing and promoting an album. My goal is $81,000. That will allow me just enough to finish my record, create album art, package it, and film my next music video, which I plan to release on the same day as the album. If we can raise this money together, you can count on my album being out sometime in May. And then I ll see you on tour!We're utilizing the very best studios and musicians to make this record everything you guys deserve it to be. I've already had the chance to record piano on the same instrument, with the same equipment, that you hear on Adele's Someone Like You. It is all being mixed on a real console at The Studio at The Palms in Las Vegas, where artists like Lady Gaga, The Killers, Usher, and Imagine Dragons have recorded and mixed their music in the recent past.RewardsThe rewards you'll see at the right reflect my desire to bring us closer together and have you guys be a part of this project as much as possible, so check them out! I can't wait to see which ones you guys pick :)What if We Exceed the Goal?Only a small amount of the $81,000 goal has been allocated for marketing and promotion. For the greatest impact, we'll need to raise more!If we exceed the goal, the additional funds will be used to promote and market the record, so it can reach as many people as possible. Getting songs in rotation on radio is difficult and expensive, but with your help, we can make it happen!Rest assured, we have some of the very best independent music marketing people in the industry standing by to open doors and advise us on spending the money intelligently once YOU make it possible!About the AlbumThis record will include twelve tracks, all written by me. I've been writing music for a long time, so I had a large catalog to pull from. The music is all about the roller-coaster ride of being human: love and loss, hope and regret, triumph and the struggles of growing up all through the lens of my own experiences. I believe the best songs are those that are written from a very personal point of view. And from that personal place, universal truths about what it means to be human are revealed. That is what I always strive for in my writing, so this album is very personal to me. But there are universal themes to be found in every song.The Vision Shaping Our FutureCall me optimistic, but I truly believe that the world is ready for this! I believe that a good love song is a good love song. That the ways we love, the ways we ache and hurt, are far more the same than the world might acknowledge. And I refuse to believe that the universal nature of any expression of love in music or art can be trumped by a damn pronoun.I believe that a song in which a man sings openly about his love for his man, or where a woman sings openly about her love for another woman, will have the world singing along one day. It might not be tomorrow. But it will happen.I want to make this record without a record label so that I can honor my promise to you to keep making honest music. I want to make this record because OUR voices DESERVE to be heard. Our stories deserve to be told.
243`During our first Kickstarter campaign, our backers generous support helped us raise enough funds to launch iblazr s production and ultimately bring this wireless flash to a wide audience. Our first backers all 2,633 of them! became the first among many to own iblazr. Now, Instagrammers, party people, techno geeks, photographers, cinematographers, professional journalists and so many others use iblazr flashes every day to take photos, shoot video and lighten their daily lives. Since launching iblazr, more than 20,000 users in 195 countries snapped over 150,000 photos with the help of our flash. iblazr is currently available in more than 45 countries, in hundred of shops, including Apple Stores and Best Buy, and online. Today every iblazr user is an essential part of our team, project and history. iblazr 2, the second generation in the iblazr flash series, is the most advanced light source for smartphones and tablets available in the consumer market. This flash designed for smartphones also comes in handy when taking photos with tablets or DSLR cameras, lighting analogue photography, brightening nighttime video calls, or simply functioning as a small but powerful flashlight. In creating iblazr 2, we not only optimized the physical design of the device but also made significant improvements to its electronic components. The result is an iblazr with more functions that remains as easy to use as it was before. iblazr 2 is the only flash that works with native camera apps on your iPhone, iPad and Android smartphones! You simply use Bluetooth to connect iblazr 2 to your smartphone, then launch the native camera app. By tapping the iblazr device twice, it will beam a powerful 300 LUX on 1m flash synchronically with your camera s shutter! That's absolutely magical. iblazr 2 uses Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy technology that transforms the iblazr into a remote flash with a range of up to 80 feet (25 meters). We added a touch sensor to iblazr 2 for a more comfortable and intuitive user experience. This sensor lets you adjust the light color temperature from 3200K to 5600K to help you take better photographs in every situation. Want to get up close for a fancy portrait? Choose your warm light setting. Need a powerful cold flash, instead? Change the setting to 5600K mode. This flexibility will allow you to shoot photos that look more natural, professional and creative. Only measuring 40mm x 28mm x 10mm (1.57" x 1.1" x 1.57"), iblazr is compact in addition to being smart and extremely multifunctional. Check out all its features below: We knew that a brilliant, new hardware solution could compromise software improvements. This prompted us to invent Shotlight the alternative camera app that allows users to make adjustments manually. Shotlight App is already available at App Store (click the picture). Android app is coming later this month Most photo apps provide plenty of post-photography filters that might improve the look of pictures, but sacrifice their quality in the process. Our team decided to go in a different direction by offering a new and innovative way to improve pictures before they are even snapped. By taping on the Shotlight display you will gain access to every manual parameter you need to take one perfect shot after another. Now you can choose the lowest ISO and the right exposure so every picture you take will appear not as your smartphone sees the world, but as you see the world. This same manual flexibility applies when shooting in video mode. For example, you can adjust your camera s focus while recording a classic trick cinematographers employ to shoot the movies you see at the cinema. The auto sync feature automatically connects the iblazr 2 to your device when you open the app. No matter how many iblazr 2 units you want to use simultaneously, they can all connect at once to your smartphone or other device. The new app is designed to provide a better experience using its primary options, including adjusting the brightness of iblazr s LEDs, changing the light color temperature, and adding more flashes to an array of units. What is more, each individual unit can be single-tuned within the Shotlight app. And because we care about our existing users, Shotlight was also designed to support first-generation iblazr units. Using this app will help maximize what is already the most versatile light system available adjust the temperature, power output or number of units you need with ease to achieve the best lighting possible. Shotlight app for iOS will go live later in July Shotlight app for Android will be released in August 2015. We love light! And we love trying to shine a 75 degree spread spot as brightly and evenly as possible. To do so, we ve tested hundreds of LEDs and made dozens of optics tests.iblazr 2 provides 300 Lux on 1m in Flash mode (2X more than a smartphone flash) and 150 Lux in Constant light mode (up to 10X more than a smartphone video light). Portrait scene on iPhone 6. Shooting portraits without a flash, with the smartphone flash, and with the iblazr flash. Using iblazr 2 as a video light gives your DSLR camera the ability to shoot small videos well at night. (Great for shooting interviews, video blog posts, etc.) You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 iblazr uses Bluetooth to replicate the effect of a camera shutter. This allows you take highly creative shots by pointing the light in any direction or simply outside the shot, using it as a remote! For accessories that come FREE with each iblazr 2 unit, see below: MOUNT CLIP. We designed a new mounting system for iblazr 2 a clip with a silicon coating that works with any mobile device that is 0.24" to 0.37" (6 mm to 9.5 mm) wide. It clips to both the lower edge of an iPad Air 2 and the upper edge of an iPhone 4.With multiple clips you can use an array of units to enlarge the total amount of light you require. Each unit multiplies the amount of illumination you receive. For example, 3 iblazr units = 3 times more light. 3 Iblazr units = 3 times more light. The clip is specially designed to attach the iblazr flash to a large number of mobile devices, displays and other surfaces. COLD SHOE. We know that your DSLR needs a small, powerful video light. We also know that iblazr 2, just as in iblazr s first generation, will help you shoot great content by adding an extra light when necessary. To make adding light easier, we made a simple and efficient Cold Shoe Mount. If you take your most compact light companion with you to your next filming, you will be both surprised and delighted by how useful it proves to be! While shooting a brief interview in an urban environment. DIFFUSER. Pros say that the best light is a soft light. We say the best light is the one that is with you! That's why we made a silicon diffuser with a small hole to fit on your key ring, so now you will never forget your iblazr at home. Diffuser + Key Clasp. Keep the iblazr 2 with you always simply by clipping it to your key chain or belt. FLEXIBLE CHARGER (Sold Separately). Not only does the flexible charger charge the flash, it also functions as a lamp stand allowing iblazr 2 to provide illumination in a variety of situations even when your not taking photographs. The new flexible charger is now 15.75 inches (400 mm) long and able to hold not just an iblazr flash, but a heavy smartphone as well. We believe iblazr 2 will prove to be even more useful and handy than our already highly functional first generation flash. We worked as hard as possible between our previous campaign and now to further realise iblazr s awesome potential. Now we again seek support from our Kickstarter backers to help us launch the mass production of iblazr 2. The money you help us raise will allow us to manufacture molds, purchase electronics, organise the mass production and delivery of new units, meet certification standards, and complete other tasks necessary to make this product work even better than you expect it to. (Similar to our previous Kickstarter campaign, these funds will also help us design and implement new features based on our backers ideas for improving this flash.) We believe that with help of creative people our product can be more multifunctional and useful. Similar to our previous campaign, we are offering you the opportunity to sync the iblazr 2 flash with apps you create. SDK will allow iOS and Android developers to play with the following settings: flash timing, LED brightness, LED color temperature, strobe mode, among many others settings. Now we have made it even simpler for you to implement the code and control the flash. Moreover, our support team is always near to help you use instructions and create awesome photo/video apps absolutely FREE. Estimated release: Aug 2015. Our jobs are our passion. We are a small team that is truly passionate about what we do. That is why we never accepted outside investments and why we remain 100% focused on product development and expansion. Thanks mainly to the support of our Kickstarter backers, following our first campaign we were able to undertake an enormous effort to bring iblazr to people all over the world. Each person of our team does whatever is necessary to realise this collective dream of ours. It is just one of many reasons we do not call the work that we do work. To us, this project is so much more.

244`We have spent the last 12 months listening to our backers and the community to understand how to build on the success of the Ice Baller and create another truly innovative and essential tool for any home or commercial bar. Today we are very excited to announce the Ice Chest!The Ice Chest is an easy-to-use device that will make four 60mm (2.36") diameter crystal clear ice spheres (or cubes with additional mold) at once from tap water in your home freezer- plus it features a unique modular design to accommodate additional ice shapes and sizes in the future. One of the reasons we are so excited about the Ice Chest is that we were able to incorporate a lot of feedback from our customers into the design. Specifically, we increased the output to four ice balls, made it modular to support other ice shapes, reduced the height, and made it super easy to use.Key Features: Slim form (length and width are less than a standard ice cube tray) Measures approx. 6 7/8"H x 4 7/8"W x 12 3/4"L Built-to-last with lightweight materials: Silicone rubber, BPA-free plastic, & EPE foam Easy ice ball removal Modular design to accommodate future mold shapes/sizes What do all of the best bars in the world have in common? Their bartenders carefully consider the four components of a great cocktail: liquid, glassware, garnish, and ice. Excellent bartenders have a great appreciation for ice. Charles Joly was the 2013 American Bartender of the Year and is the Beverage Director at one of the top rated bars in the country- Aviary in Chicago. He says... The best bars actually have formal "Ice Programs" to create clear ice blocks that they can cut it into the right shapes for cocktails. The machines to make these blocks can cost $5,000+ so they are limited to high volume commercial bars and not suited for home use- plus carving up all that ice is a lot of work!Do you want to go through all of the trouble concocting the perfect drink only to serve it up in a plastic cup with a dried out lime slice and a few half-melted shards of ice? Me neither. The surface area to volume ratio of an ice sphere is less than a cube of the same volume, which means that the outside of the sphere comes into contact with less of your drink and significantly reduces the rate of melting/dilution while keeping it ultra cold. In addition, by removing the air bubbles from the ice sphere we have eliminated the risk of it cracking apart in your drink and melting fast.In our testing, the above benefits result in a single Wintersmiths' ice ball lasting you multiple drinks whereas standard ice cubes of the same volume will often disappear before you are even done your first drink.You have probably seen other products on the market but rest assured we have tried a lot of the other ice sphere molds out there and have never been able to get a clear result. Here is the outcome of a couple of the more popular models- they are too small or misshapen, and definitely not clear: Wintersmiths was born out of a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013 where we introduced the Ice Baller- a simple device to make large crystal clear ice spheres from tap water in a home freezer. After a business trip to Tokyo we realized that although there were many ice ball presses and molds on the market, there was nothing that could produce clear ice and form a perfect spherical shape at the same time. The first phase of our journey to develop an affordable solution to create a single clear ice sphere is complete and now we are excited to be unveiling another useful tool for your home bar.The reviews for the Ice Baller have been very positive and we are very grateful to the backers of our first project. Here are just a few of the testimonials:"If you're a keen home-bar enthusiast, one of these devices really will change your life, it's that excellent."- Master of Malt, 2012 Whiskey Retailer of the Year"Wintersmiths Ice Baller is the only contraption of it s kind that makes perfectly clear, perfectly spherical ice balls."- The Manual"There is something immensely satisfying about drinking a cocktail over a perfectly clear spherical ice ball."- The Cocktail Geek"If your dad is a fan of bourbon, scotch, or any other spirit that s best enjoyed on the rocks, he needs an ice baller. But not just any ice baller he needs the best damn ice baller there is."-Digital Trends"My new Ice Baller from @Wintersmiths is simply epic. Perhaps my favorite cocktail accessory ever."- Jon from California"This thing rocks! Crystal clear and costs a fraction of what other devices do."- Nicholas from Illinois"I just got my two Ice Ballers yesterday. They work 100% as advertised. Beautiful ice spheres! Fit perfectly in my rocks glasses. Great product."- Andy from Texas We ve just completed extensive product development and testing, and we are now ready for production. As in all consumer products there is a big upfront investment required to create the molds. We need your help to bring the Ice Chest to market!Estimated Cost breakdown: $38k - Mold Tooling Costs $15k - First Production Run Cost $10k - Estimated Shipping & Fulfillment Cost
245`Hi, my name is Chris Flynn, and I'm the creator of the Nori Lights Bike Illumination system.I got the idea about 2 years ago when I was riding my bike home at around 8 pm and a car almost hit me because even though I had a front facing light, the driver could not see me from the side. This gave me the idea that if we could light up the wheels, the bike would be instantly recognizable. For the original design, I took a couple sets of computer case black lights, mounted them to the front and rear forks, and rewired them to run off of a 12 volt scooter battery. The black lights activated a glow-in-the-dark paint that I had sprayed on the rims of my wheels.Except for being a bit bulky, the original design worked great. I was so impressed with how cool it looked, I uploaded a video to youtube. It didn't take long for the video to become more and more popular and I started getting tons of requests and messages from viewers that wanted a Nori lighting system for their bike. (To see the full original youtube video click here)I was thrilled, but there were some improvements that had to be made in order to make this something that could be packaged for the public. I saw that I had 5 key goals that had to be reached. 1 I needed to make this easy to apply to any bike. 2 The design needed to be physically smaller and lighter. 3 It had to be much more energy efficient (longer run times on less power). 4 No compromise of brightness or effectiveness of the lighting system. 5 Final product needs to be affordable so it will be accessible to everyone. After extensive product testing, and several design revisions later, I am very pleased with the results. 1 Easy to apply to any bike - Instead of using paint, the glowing surface is now a high phosphorescent material that is available in two forms. For bicycles that don t use a rim braking system, we offer a flexible band with an adhesive backing that can be applied to each side of the bikes rims. And for bicycles that use a rim braking system (where pads make contact with the sides of the rims to slow or stop), we offer the Nori Lights system featuring the C-rings". The C-rings act as extensions of the rim, providing more surface area for illumination. They are made up of 4 semi-circle segments wrapped and sealed with our high-phosphorescent material. To install, simply place each segment between the spokes so that they rest snug towards the rim to form the inner contour of the bicycle wheel (see our projects updates for photos of the C-rings, how they fit on various wheel sizes and types, and a brief video demonstrating installation). They connect by overlapping where a small but strong magnet is embedded into the tip and holds snug against the side of neighboring C-ring segments, allowing them to cascade in or out adjusting to your specific wheel size. They glow bright, are light weight, very durable, and make installation fast and easy. 2 Smaller and lighter - The bulky black light tubes have been replaced with 4 pods. Each pod contains two high intensity UV LEDs, and each pod mounts easily onto the frame next to the rim. 3 Energy efficient - Because of the energy efficiency of LEDs, now the whole system is powered by just 2 AA lithium batteries that will provide over 150 hours of run-time. 4 No compromise of brightness - The results of maintaining a high standard while testing materials for the new design has actually made this version brighter than the original system. 5 Accessible to everyone -The final goal remains, but in order to reach it, I need your support. The overall costs of each unit drops considerably when manufactured in bulk. Even a small quantity of pre-orders (100) will enable this system to be offered at a very reasonable price. If you are interested in the Nori Lights - bike illumination system, please consider making a pledge. And if you have friends that ride and could benefit from this, please share this project page with them. I have named this project Nori, after my Grandfather. He always told me If something s worth doing, it s worth doing right . I believe this is worth doing, and with your support, we can get this done right. Thank you for your time and interest.As you can see, in the video and photos, the Nori Lights look really cool. But, even with how effective the system appears in the video, that is nothing compared to how electric and vibrant they are when you see them in person. I wish I could be there to see the look on each of our backers faces when they fire up their Nori Lights for the first time. If you are able to, please take a quick video of your reaction, or if it's a gift, capture it on video and upload it on youtube! I can't imagine ever getting tired of the initial reaction it causes.NOTE: NORI LIGHTS ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROPER FRONT AND REAR LIGHTING ON YOUR BIKE. THIS SHOULD BE USED IN ADDITION TO A FRONT HEADLIGHT AND REAR FACING LIGHT. PLEASE ALWAYS BE CAREFUL WHILE RIDING A BICYCLE AT NIGHT AND NEVER ASSUME THE DRIVERS ON THE ROAD CAN SEE YOU.

With the launch of the iPhone 6, the interest-list for a new case has been huge. To handle the anticipated growth, we are moving to a factory in Downtown Los Angeles, where we have done two successful test runs. To order the materials needed and fund the first iPhone 6 factory production run, we need the help of our fans and the Kickstarter community.

Built-To-Last.MISSION: AMERICAN JOBS Our simple design concept allows us to manufacture right here in the USA, and we are able to utilize chronically underemployed populations. MISSION: ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITYThe lasting durability of our products minimizes waste and our simple consolidated manufacturing process reduces our carbon footprint. MISSION: SCALABILITY Simplicity enhances the scalability of our mission, allowing us to manufacture our products on a large scale and spread our mission to the world.A WALLET THAT IS BUILT-TO-LAST Wallets take a beating with everyday use. They fall apart because they are made of multiple pieces of leather that are stitched together at the seams. We eliminated thread stitching and made our wallets from a single piece of premium leather held together with metal rivets. (Patent Pending). SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE The Hammer Riveted Wallet is a slim minimalist design with plenty of room to hold the essentials. It is made from premium vegetable-tanned leather that gives it a luxurious feel with dependable strength and durability. WALLET CAPACITYThis wallet is a minimalist design that holds A LOT of stuff --- See Video Below TESTING -- PROVEN DURABILITY Our team consists of current military members who understand that Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines live and operate in some of the harshest environments in the world. Therefore, we sent prototypes of our products overseas to test their durability and so far they've held up great!SO HOW AMERICAN ARE WE? Our leather is made from U.S native steer hide and it is tanned in Pennsylvania Our leather is die-cut in Massachusetts Our products are handcrafted in Massachusetts Our packaging is made in Massachusetts. Our products are packaged in Massachusetts Our Rivets come from an American supplier BUT they are made overseas --- we have been trying to find American-made rivets in the size and style that we need, but so far we have been unsuccessful. If anyone knows of an American manufacturer that makes small double cap rivets, please let us know! REWARDSTHE SCRAP BRACELET In the spirit of sustainability, we are minimizing waste by using as much of our materials as possible; even our scrap leather.

They will be delivered June 2014 (1 month earlier than the scheduled July 2014 delivery date). *** You will be contacted at the end of the Kickstarter Campaign for your Reward color option choices.OUR TEAM Our team consists of a determined group of professionals committed to bringing this vision to life. The team is headed up by two brothers: Jason and Chris Angelini. Jason has a degree in mechanical engineering. He is a soldier in the Army National Guard and he is leading the design efforts for this unique product line. His brother Chris, has a very different background with experience in marketing, search engine optimization and business management. Together, their skills set a strong foundation for building this company into a trusted and recognized brand. WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP"Movements are not started by leaders, they are started by the first followers."We need your support to prove that people are ready to demand a higher standard for the products they use and carry everyday. Your support will bring affirmation to our vision and your orders will allow us to fulfill minimum order quantities for our first line of production. If we meet our goal, we will be able to put our first product, the wallet, into production. Help us exceed our goal and we will be able to bring a whole product line to the market with a variety of products that hold true to our unique concept of design. We have several other ideas and prototypes that we are excited to introduce to the world. A Sneak Peak at Some of Our Working Prototypes OUR PRODUCTION PLANWe have established relationships with all our manufacturing and supply partners and we have worked hard to understand their capabilities and ensure that they can meet our production needs. Upon the successful completion of our Kickstarter campaign, we will immediately place the order for materials and get the first line of production underway. Predicted Timeline Wait 20 days for funds to clear 3 weeks to order tools and materials 6 weeks for production and Quality Assurance checks 2 weeks for packaging and shipment Send Off! We expect to start shipping in July 2014 TORTURE TESTING (Added At The Request Of Our Backers) I put peanut butter inside a Hammer Riveted Wallet and gave it to my Rhodesian Ridge Back puppy to chew on for an hour. When she was done with it, the wallet did not look pretty (as you can see in the picture), but it is important to note that she was not able to rip it apart. The wallet still holds its shape and is entirely functional. Also notice that her teeth never punctured the leather. This leather really is as tough as it gets. I do not however recommend giving your wallet to your dog as a chew toy.
248`Help us get The Smith Tapes out into the world! Between 1969 1972, Howard Smith recorded interviews with scores of rock stars and cultural icons. As a Village Voice columnist and radio personality on WPLJ FM, Smith sat down for revealing, personal conversations with Eric Clapton, Andy Warhol, Jim Morrison, Buckminster Fuller, Janis Joplin, Jerry Garcia and Hugh Hefner, to name just a few. He interviewed John Lennon and Yoko Ono no less than five times, and called in live dispatches from his Winnebago parked stage-side at Woodstock. Smith was at the center of culture during an era of extraordinary transformation. Smith kept the original interview reels, hundreds of them, buried in a crate in the back of his New York City loft, and they haven t seen the light of day in over 40 years. We re launching this Kickstarter campaign to produce a limited edition, hand numbered box set with more than 12 CDs of the cream-of-the-crop interviews. Out of more than 150 interviews that we found, we ve selected 18 incredible conversations for this boxed collection. The Smith Tapes will also be a larger project. After the release of this box set, we will independently release 100 Howard Smith interviews on iTunes. These will be available in themed collections, downloadable as albums or as individual tracks. So, what's left to do? We ve already digitized everything, so the heavy lifting is done. What once were boxes of reel-to-reel tapes stacked in the back of a West Village loft are now thousands of files on hard drives. Sifting through them was a forensic process, like an enormous audio jigsaw puzzle. We listened for clues in the conversations to chronologically piece together hundreds of disorganized and sometimes unlabeled reels. Then, often using online archives and a multitude of fan blogs, we determined the recording dates It s been a tedious blast. We're asking for your help to raise funds for the cost of producing the box set. As you can imagine, the audio editing, restoration and mastering on this project is intense. The tapes are 40 years old and were not stored with preservation in mind. Remarkably, most are in great shape, but the audio conditions do vary. Some reels have experienced magnetic tape degradation, and some had technical issues in the original recordings. We already have two incredible audio engineers hard at work on their restoration and mastering. They sound great. This box set is going to be beautiful. We ve teamed up with Art Director Masaki Koike at Phyx Design (winner of the 2007 Grammy Award: Limited Edition Box Set Category) to design it. The set will contain: 12 CDs of interviews A USB drive shaped like a vintage cassette tape A booklet featuring Howard describing each interview Identically reproduced photos and memorabilia from the original collection to recreate the feel of digging through the boxes of reels yourself! Here are a few examples of the CD jacket graphics: 2012 Masaki Koike & The Smith Tapes 2012 Masaki Koike & The Smith Tapes 2012 Masaki Koike & The Smith Tapes 2012 Masaki Koike & The Smith Tapes In the Box Set: Track Listing Disc 1 Mick Jagger 10/20/1969 & Eric Clapton 10/24/1970 Disc 2 Jim Morrison 11/6/1969 Disc 3 James Taylor 3/1970 & Lou Reed 3/26/1969 Disc 4 Frank Zappa 6/6/1971 Disc 5 Pete Townshend 6/8/1970 Disc 6 John Lennon and Yoko Ono 2/5/1972 Disc 7 Jerry Garcia 9/19/1970 & Janis Joplin 9/30/1970 Disc 8 George Harrison Spring/1969 & Joe Cocker 6/1969 Disc 9 James Rado and Gerome Ragni, HAIR 9/2/1969 & Abbie Hoffman 6/25/1970 Disc 10 Jane Fonda 3/1971 Disc 11 Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda, Easy Rider 6/1969 Disc 12 John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Bed-In Montreal 5/29/1969 Cassette tape USB drive Hugh Hefner 4/1968 & Live phoned-in broadcast reports from Woodstock 8/15-17/1969 & 1 hour of Howard wandering around Woodstock with a handheld tape recorder 8/15-16/1969 More about the Interviews Smith had a knack for meeting with artists at seminal moments in their careers. He talked with Mick Jagger on tour a few weeks before Altamont; Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda directly after the Cannes Film Festival, in advance of Easy Rider s release; Pete Townshend during the two night run of Tommy at the Metropolitan Opera; and Andy Warhol after he was shot. He even taped Janis Joplin s last interview, just a few days before her death. The Smith Tapes are time capsules, portals through which we meet each interviewee in his or her prime, uncensored, unedited and uninhibited. These tapes have an immediacy and an intimacy that is astounding. Got another minute? Give a listen!

The more people that back our project, the more cards and features we can afford to include in the game. Once the Kickstarter ends, we'll finalize the cards that are in the game, illustrate any characters that we unlocked and print the game.The card design, package design and character artwork is subject to change, but what won't change is the high-quality design and overall illustration style that you see above. In other words, you're going to get a high-quality game in the mail.This timeline shows what you can expect if we unlock all of the stretch goals. Our goal is to deliver your game earlier than this schedule states, but we don't want to promise an earlier date and make everyone upset if there is an unexpected delayed during the process.

With our deepest gratitude and admiration,Tia & Carl____________________________ Watch the "Citizen Koch" trailer now: Please help ensure that our film and the voices in it are not silenced.Money has long played a starring role in politics, but things really got out of control after the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United, engineered by corporate and far-right interest groups to super-enfrancise the wealthiest and disenfranchise ordinary Americans."Citizen Koch" tells that story -- from the political influence wielded by billionaire industrialists and conservative activists David and Charles Koch, and others like them, to the real-life struggles of ordinary Republicans and Democrats as they collide with the big money juggernaut.We were thrilled last spring when "Citizen Koch" was greenlit for funding by public television. That meant that not only could we finish shooting and editing the film, but it would be headed to free TV broadcast next fall for the largest audience in the U.S. -- PBS, and all of you. Then everything changed. Last fall, fearing that our story might displease a particular PBS donor -- David Koch himself -- public television dropped its financial support for "Citizen Koch". Journalist Jane Mayer exposed this self-censorship in the New Yorker magazine. (New Yorker Illustration by Daniel Hertzberg) It turns out that David Koch is a donor to PBS flagship stations WNET and WGBH and on their board of trustees. And without lifting a finger or even taking out his checkbook, Koch was able to influence funding and programming decisions at public television. And our film was effectively censored. Not only did we lose $150,000 in funding, but millions of viewers lost their chance to see "Citizen Koch" on public television. All because of David Koch's money. The process that led to "Citizen Koch" being pulled from the airwaves illustrates exactly the point that Lessin and Deal's film makes: Money can not only buy action in our democracy, it can also buy silence. - Michael Keegan, President, People for the American Way We aren't giving in to this censorship or the power of David Koch, and we intend to release the film in the coming months. But we can't do it without your help. Kickstart "Citizen Koch" so we can bridge the funding gap and distribute the film! What happened to "Citizen Koch" provides a rare behind-the-scenes look at how big money from high dollar donors has massive influence on one of our most beloved public institutions, and on the public discourse. Ironically, that s exactly what our film is about -- how the money of the wealthiest drowns out the voices of the rest of us. We believe that your voice can be louder than David Koch's money.Film can be a powerful tool for change, but only when it has an audience, and only when it has an advocate. That's why we need YOUR help! We believe that our politicians, and our public airwaves, should not be compromised by big money. So do the ordinary Americans -- Republicans and Democrats -- who share their stories in our film. They deserve to be heard. You can make sure they will be.We need your help now to release "Citizen Koch." If you can give, please do. Any amount will help. Those trying to keep you from seeing the film are banking on the cynical belief that you don't care. We are convinced that you do. Your pledge will go toward delivering the film for distribution paying for the sound mix, the color correct, archival footage and music licensing costs, and other distribution expenses, and then engaging the widest audience possible. We are very grateful for any amount you can give. Thank you.--Carl Deal & Tia Lessin
252`1. Attach THE O to your most important belongings that you cannot afford to lose or to forget. 2. The moment you are about to leave something behind the app immediately alerts you (unlike other devices that only help you to locate an item once it is lost). 3. THE O also checks and alerts you if you leave your house without something essential for the day. THE O is the first smart accessory that acts as a comprehensive virtual personal assistant through its mobile app. THE O proactively alerts you when you re about to leave something behind. Never again worry about your belongings. Be more carefree! Designed to blend seamlessly into your life One of us, Rose, is an expert in jewelry and luxury fashion design and our industrial designer learnt how to combine form and function in the Swiss watch industry. We wanted to to make THE O as beautiful and versatile as possible. Based on feedback from backers, we gave it a replaceable battery while still keeping it waterproof! To use THE O for keys, bags, briefcases and other items, we developed a special key chain accessory. It is cast in brass and plated in gunmetal rhodium with a mirror finish. We kept the organic feel of the device and made it sophisticated, gender-neutral and cool. The manufacturing quality competes with the most beautiful accessories in the fashion world. On Kickstarter, we are also offering a luxury version that will be plated in 14 karat gold. And for those who prefer a sporty, nearly weightless solution to attach THE O onto something, we are offering a light rubber version. Made to be yoursWe believe wearables are about you. And we want to make them feel individual. We are starting with three different key chains. Each one with a different personality. And we would like to make more for you in the future!And colors of course! We know that some of you want to keep it as minimal as possible while others want to make a vibrant splash with THE O. So we had our early backers choose two mulit-color packs to offer to you. See what they decided on below! For every 4 O's you order, you can choose your style at the end of the campaign. A mobile app that understands your needsIt was our goal to create an app that you never needed to open. One that just works, by itself. And we made every effort possible, so THE O only alerts you when it actually should. The basics are simple: always get an alert when you lose something or forget something at home, at the office or at a friends place.But there are a lot of small smart tweaks that you will only realize when you use it. At home, everything is safe, so no alerts. Once you leave THE O automatically watches over all the things you take with you (no need to manually activate). It knows what is essential and what is not, so will not remind you of the things you don't need.When you are at a friend's BBQ, THE O let's you enjoy the party without any alerts. Once you leave, however, it will silently check if you are taking everything back that you brought. Same if you leave something at a coat check. THE O will consider your jacket or bag temporarily safe. But once you leave the vicinity, it will remind you if you are leaving something behind. Artificial Intelligence - so much more coming in 2016!THE O never stops learning how to improve your life. We are working on additional features that will be fully automated, without user interaction. We want to keep things simple and elegant, so please help us to prioritise what additional features you want most. As a backer you will be able to suggest what we include first. Below are some examples. There were a couple of tricky challenges when we went from design on the drawing board to functional production design. It was a real priority to minimize size, make the device waterproof and prevent the battery from starting to drain before a customer starts using the product. Our PCBs (printed circuit boards) are custom-made to perfectly fit our case and take up as little space as possible. For the casing, we use ABS, the highly durable plastic used for Lego bricks. Our devices consist of two plastic parts that are assembled with a technique called ultrasonic welding to achieve a totally flush, waterproof finish. Finally, we use a small PET slip that needs to be pulled out for the battery to connect to the circuit. A highly pressurized silicon rubber fills the tiny gap so it stays waterproof afterwards. It s a neat and an extremely resource-efficient solution.If you are interested to see more of how the app behaves, we have made some short demo videos for you to check out (with our ugly prototype app):1. Connect devices (make a 'virtual leash') and get loss alerts You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 2. Define safe zones and get no more alerts while safe You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 3. Mark item as essential and get reminder when leaving without it You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 We are asking for your help here on Kickstarter! The funds we raise will be used to: Perform more stress testing and refine our firmware Get the required product certifications such as FCC, CE, CPSIA Design and production of branded packaging Procure production supplies in large quantities to minimize cost Produce, assemble and ship the devices to you In return for bringing THE O to life, we have a broad variety of rewards you can pick from. Having reached our minimal funding goal, you can now choose from two multi-color options and add from three different key chain accessories. For members of BackerClub check out our exclusives there. We already have a finished product that is ready for production. But there are still some things left to do. Thank you!Great things are built with the support of a lot of great people. We are endlessly grateful to our dedicated volunteers who helped us while we were testing our products, collecting and summarising feedback, spreading the word and providing the emotional support when we needed it most.And if you made it until this point on this site, THANK YOU! We hope you, too, will become part of this story with us.

SILICONE LIDS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN BEFOREAn eco-friendly alternative to plastic wrap and foil, these lids are made from heavy-duty silicone that can be used in the freezer, fridge, oven, and microwave (and of course, they're dishwasher safe). Their patent pending design is one part rocket scientist, two parts supermodel. Each of these lids can fit on bowls of any size (smaller than its own diameter, of course). 12.5 (318mm) - Built for larger bowls and pots, as of launch this will be the largest-available circular silicone lid on the market. It's large and in charge, and looks gorgeous on the tabletop. 10 (254mm) - Great for covering food at outdoor picnics and barbecues, preventing stovetop splatters, or taking your Thanksgiving casserole from oven to buffet. 8 (203mm) - Sized for the most frequently used serving dishes and storage containers, the 203mm lid is the go-to size for everyday serving, picnics, and storage. 6 (152mm) - The cereal bowl size. Our favorite for microwave reheating, simmering saucepans, and storing single-portion leftovers. 4 (102mm) - Keep the steam in your mug and the bugs out of your wine glass. We also love these for keeping mise en place fresh while we prep our ingredients, and we think you will too. We ve spent a lot of time working with silicone. Some of our products are groundbreaking the Ultimate Spatula that helped us launch our brand was the first unibody silicone spatula of its kind, combining a fiberglass matrix core with a heat resistant silicone body that made it nearly indestructible. Some are long overdue like Scraper 001, a bench and bowl scraper all in one. And some - ahem, the GIR Lids - are just plain GORGEOUS. We absolutely love silicone lids. They re eco-friendly, and useful in more ways than we can count (though we give it a shot below). But none of them looked beautiful enough that we wanted to show them off in our kitchens. We took that as a little challenge, and this summer got to work on the following question: how do we hot-rod a lid? We re pretty proud of the results. These silicone lids rest on any flat bowl rim, forming a partial vacuum that seals the lid to the bowl when you tug on its handle. Thanks to atmospheric pressure, this seal is quite strong - so strong, in fact, that you can often get the whole combo to lift right off the countertop! Each GIR lid will create a moisture proof, airtight seal on almost any container. And a moisture proof, airtight seal is just the thing for food storage, whether on the countertop or in the fridge. These lids will last a lifetime in your kitchen; they re an economical and eco-friendly alternative to plastic wrap, foil, paper towels, and the like. Our pharmaceutical grade, FDA approved silicone is free of PVC, BPA, and other plasticizers that are commonly used to give plastic wraps their stickiness - when you use a GIR lid, you get strong surface adherence without any of the bad actors. The wonderful thing about using silicone is that you can take the lids from an application like countertop/fridge storage or picnic protection, and go straight to something a little more active like reheating leftovers or steaming fresh veggies in the microwave, or baking a casserole in the oven. They re also safe on the stovetop, so you can use them as multi-pot steamer lids or splatter guards while you re saut ing over a hot flame.

254`We thank the community for their love and confidence in making us the 3rd most funded project in Kickstarter history.For more information and PonoMusic pre-orders (coming soon!), go to www.ponomusic.com.FOLLOW us on Twitter. LIKE us on Facebook. ...Thank You from Neil Young.Pono means righteous. It is a Hawaiian word, the one, the pureness. On behalf of Pono, we thank you for helping us give music a voice. You have helped to set the stage for a revolution in music listening. Finally, quality enters the listening space so that we can all hear and feel what the artists created, the way they heard and felt it.This is done when the artist makes the best available, wanting to share it with you. It happens when the artist lets you hear and feel more than what is on your CD or MP3 of any song. CDs and MP3s are derived from the original masters, and now, with the PonoPlayer, you can finally feel the master in all its glory, in its native resolution, CD quality or higher, the way the artist made it, exactly. That s the beauty of Pono.It s been a long time coming. It was not easy getting this far, but you made it happen by supporting Pono s vision for better listening. We have been working with the labels, with the artists and producers, and we will continue to do that. We go to the source to find the best and bring it to you. Pono wants to preserve the history of music, in all of its beauty and expression, for all time. Forever.There is a way to do this right, and we are going to do it. We will be sharing how we will do this with you over the next few months, while we build your first ever PonoPlayers. We are going to do some revolutionary things. We will make music available in a way that has never been done, a way that allows for constantly attaining the best listening experience.Thank you to the artists, the recording companies, big and small, and most of all, thanks to you music lovers for making this happen with your amazing support.Thanks for listening, Neil Young & the PonoMusic TeamA message to Artists: First, we say thanks to all of you artists who have been here with Pono since the beginning. We are deeply grateful for your encouragement and support. When you and your recording team go into a studio or recording environment to create your latest music, there are many choices for you to make. Besides the studios, songs, players, singers, producers, engineers, microphones, and other equipment, you have the ability to choose from the numerous digital resolutions at your disposal to capture your sound. This is where Pono can make a giant difference.Now, whatever resolution you choose to employ for your recording process, your masters can be heard by your listeners exactly as you created them. You no longer have to be satisfied with MP3 or CD being what your fans hear. Pono plays back anything you can create, just as you made it, in the digital domain.Even if you record in analog, when you mix your songs and record them to an analog 2 track, you can copy that to the digital resolution you choose (preferably the highest) and have your listeners hear that exact recording. If you are an artist who has been recording for years and this has been your life and always will be, your original creations in analog can be transferred to the highest quality digital and heard anew with Pono. No longer do your original recordings have to be the compressed sound of CDs and MP3s. It s all up to you. It is in your power to rescue your art and bring it into the 21st Century, preserved for generations to hear and enjoy. You can talk to your producer or record company and learn how to make that available to your listeners on Pono. If you are a new artist, always released on MP3s and CDs, then your horizon has just been radically expanded. You can now record in whatever resolution you choose and your fans will hear the same quality you heard in the studio. You no longer have to lose part of your sound when it goes to the people. You probably know what I mean, having heard your creation when you mixed it, feeling that rush, only to be let down by the end product, the product your audience has had to accept. You probably know it was better when you first heard it than what they got. That is over. You are no longer limited by a format. Now your audience can hear what you hear. Go back to your digital masters and see what they sounded like compared to what was released. Now, if you want to, they can all be released in their original glory. If you elect to, you can make the higher-resolution sources of your CDs and MP3s available to your listeners on Pono. It doesn t matter what resolution you originally employed; if it is higher than what was released, and you can hear the difference, your fans can hear it. They deserve the best and Pono delivers it for you. Pono plays anything back just as you made it. In the studio, with your brand new creations, high resolution is a great option. Resolutions are all different in their depths and textures. These can be used, and mixed together. A hook can be recorded in a higher resolution than the track it sits on, further setting it apart in your creation. So can a vocal. Resolution is a new tool for you to use. As long as you mix in the highest resolution found in your creation, or higher, everything will be captured. Especially, real echo and acoustic instruments, like drums, benefit from higher resolutions. Don t take anyone s word for this. Listen for yourself. Make your own decision. It s an artistic right you have.Doing this does not mean you cannot still make CDs and MP3s. They can be derived from your original masters. Your choices matter now more than ever before because your fans will hear the difference. Thousands of documented Pono listens have proven that music lovers can tell the difference between what they had before with CDs and MP3s and what they can have now with Pono. Look at the videos on ponomusic.com and see the reactions. Those are your people. They feel more from the music with Pono. High quality digital is wonderful to hear and sense. It is the sound of the 21st Century. Almost no one has heard it outside the studio. As artists, with Ponomusic, we have renewed opportunities for expression that have long been lost. The Ponomusic player can bring new light to all of your creations through Ponomusic. Record companies, this is an opportunity to rescue the art of recorded sound. Why should a Frank Sinatra recording or an Adele recording or a Nirvana, Rolling Stones, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Who, or classical recording be limited to the CD format for the future? This music is world cultural history. All of this cultural history should be preserved for enjoyment of the people in its highest possible form forever. In the 21st Century, people, and art, deserve this technology. Bring it on. Now, as never before, it is possible. Our listeners should hear what we heard. Thanks for listening, Neil Young What is PonoMusic? "Pono" is Hawaiian for righteous. What righteous means to our founder Neil Young is honoring the artist s intention, and the soul of music. That s why he s been on a quest, for a few years now, to revive the magic that has been squeezed out of digital music. In the process of making music more convenient easier to download, and more portable we have sacrificed the emotional impact that only higher quality music can deliver. However, the world has changed in the last 10 years technology has solved some of the underlying problems that forced that tradeoff. You no longer have to choose between quality and convenience when listening to music you can have both. This is the fundamental idea behind PonoMusic. First Edition PonoPlayers: Black & Yellow Pono's mission is to provide the best possible listening experience of your favorite music. We want to be very clear that PonoMusic is not a new audio file format or standard. PonoMusic is an end-to-end ecosystem for music lovers to get access to and enjoy their favorite music exactly as the artist created it, at the recording resolution they chose in the studio. We offer PonoMusic customers the highest resolution digital music available. PonoMusic is more than just a high-resolution music store and player; it is a grassroots movement to keep the heart of music beating. PonoMusic aims to preserve the feeling, spirit, and emotion that the artists put in their original studio recordings. We are pursuing this vision by building a system for the entire music listening experience from the original master recordings to the PonoMusic.com Store to the portable PonoPlayer. So now you ll hear the nuances, the soft touches, and the ends on the echo the texture and the emotion of the music the artist worked so hard to create. Please see FAQ at the bottom of this page for answers to the most commonly asked questions.

The PonoPlayer is a purpose-built device, designed by world-renowned audio engineers, to do one thing and one thing exceedingly well - let you hear high quality PonoMusic as close to its original recorded resolution as possible, and therefore, the original musical experience. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Your PonoPlayer works in much the same way as most other portable music devices. The PonoMusic App (for Mac or Windows PC) provides you access to the PonoMusic.com Store, where you can browse, search, purchase and download high-resolution music to your computer. You then simply connect your PonoPlayer micro USB cable to your computer's USB port in order to sync your favorite music and playlists. Then you can enjoy your music on your PonoPlayer at the same quality level as the original recording. The touchscreen LCD allows for easy swipe navigation between songs, albums, artists, genres, and playlists. It also allows you to change the settings in the player to suit your personal taste. The PonoPlayer has two output jacks. The first is a normal mini-stereo output specially designed for headphones and is meant for personal listening. The second is a stereo mini-plug analog output specifically designed for listening on your home audio system, in your car, or with your Sonos Connect so you can share the PonoMusic experience with your friends and family. The PonoPlayer ships with a total of 128GB. 64GB of memory is built into the player and another 64GB of memory on a removable microSD card. The expansion slot can accept microSD cards of up to 64GB or SDXC microSD cards of 128GB or higher. Unlike many other portable music players, the microSD cards are designed to be easily swappable. For example, you can build a library of various playlists or genres on different cards and simply swap them in and out, much like you'd swap game cards on a portable gaming console. So in reality you have infinite capacity on the PonoPlayer. How many songs can it hold? That depends on the quality of your music files: CD lossless quality recordings (44.1 kHz/16 bit): About 5000 tracks. High-resolution recordings (48 kHz/24 bit): About 3200 tracks. Higher-resolution recordings (96 kHz/24 bit): About 1600 tracks. Ultra-high resolution recordings (192 kHz/24 bit): About 800 tracks. This is a LOT of high-resolution music, and we say, the more the better . You ll get hooked on how good this music sounds. What do we consider to be high quality digital music? Generally speaking, mp3 files have a bit rate of 192kbps or 256kbps. These are highly compressed files and are much smaller in size than higher resolution music files. The good news is that you can keep a lot of mp3 files in a small amount of storage on a portable player or mobile device. The bad news is that they ve lost a lot of the musical information that often reveals the most pleasant and satisfying aspects of the music. It is mostly that sense of realism, dynamic range, and detail that higher resolution recordings typically capture in a way that restores the emotion in the song. On the low end of higher resolution music (CD lossless, 44.1kHz/16 bit), PonoMusic files have about 6 times more musical information than a typical mp3. With ultra-high resolution recordings (192kHz/24 bit), the difference between a PonoMusic digital file and an mp3 is about 30 times more data from which your player reconstructs the song . The PonoMusic.com Store uses FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) audio format as its standard, for compatibility, although the PonoPlayer can play most popular high-res music formats from other sources. PonoMusic has a quality spectrum, ranging from really good to really great, depending on the quality of the available master recordings: CD lossless quality recordings: 1411 kbps (44.1 kHz/16 bit) FLAC files High-resolution recordings: 2304 kbps (48 kHz/24 bit) FLAC files Higher-resolution recordings: 4608 kbps (96 kHz/24 bit) FLAC files Ultra-high resolution recordings: 9216 kbps (192 kHz/24 bit) FLAC files The Evolution of the PonoPlayer Design... Over the three years of PonoPlayer development, we considered many different designs and concepts. One of the early ideas was to make an accessory for a smartphone that contained storage for the music tracks along with advanced audio electronics. The phone s display would be used to navigate and play the songs, but with the songs would be stored in the accessory s memory. A Bluetooth connection would communicate between the phone and the accessory to select and play the desired song. This design was dismissed, for now, because it was very complicated to use and required two devices to play music. We talked a lot about making the player thin, to snap onto the back of a phone so it could be carried as one unit. But that meant you d need a different player design for each phone model, and we found that it was not possible to put some of the large audio components required for the best performance into a thin package. This led us to design the accessory in the shape of a triangular Toblerone shaped chocolate bar. It allowed us to use larger audio components and to separate them far enough apart to prevent electrical interference between the various subsystems. It also allowed us to use a large cylindrical battery that s much more efficient than a flat battery. It then became obvious that if we added a touch display, we could make the player completely self-contained. It wouldn t need to be tied to your phone and there would be no interruptions from an incoming call while you were enjoying your music. It would be the best playback device ever for listening to high quality digital music. We realized that music this good deserved a truly purpose built, dedicated device to enjoy it. There was no Swiss Army knife good enough for the music we wanted you to hear. This triangular shape also has additional benefits: it can be held upright for one-hand operation or it can sit flat on your desktop or home stereo system. The display automatically rotates depending on the orientation of the device. But the best thing about this shape is that we were able to include the best sounding audio components with absolutely no compromises. The PonoPlayer will certainly be recognizable on your desk as the unique product it is the world s best sounding portable digital music player. Check out more rewards...

255`** Hammer Ridge is now AMERICAN BENCH CRAFT ** OUR MISSION --- ACHIEVED THROUGH SIMPLICITY MISSION: QUALITY AND DURABILITY Simple products are more durable. Less parts equals less susceptibility to failure. Our wallet is made from a single piece of leather and held together with metal fasteners. No thread stitching. Built-To-Last.MISSION: AMERICAN JOBS Our simple design concept allows us to manufacture right here in the USA, and we are able to utilize chronically underemployed populations. MISSION: ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITYThe lasting durability of our products minimizes waste and our simple consolidated manufacturing process reduces our carbon footprint. MISSION: SCALABILITY Simplicity enhances the scalability of our mission, allowing us to manufacture our products on a large scale and spread our mission to the world.A WALLET THAT IS BUILT-TO-LAST Wallets take a beating with everyday use. They fall apart because they are made of multiple pieces of leather that are stitched together at the seams. We eliminated thread stitching and made our wallets from a single piece of premium leather held together with metal rivets. (Patent Pending). SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE The Hammer Riveted Wallet is a slim minimalist design with plenty of room to hold the essentials. It is made from premium vegetable-tanned leather that gives it a luxurious feel with dependable strength and durability. WALLET CAPACITYThis wallet is a minimalist design that holds A LOT of stuff --- See Video Below TESTING -- PROVEN DURABILITY Our team consists of current military members who understand that Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines live and operate in some of the harshest environments in the world. Therefore, we sent prototypes of our products overseas to test their durability and so far they've held up great!SO HOW AMERICAN ARE WE? Our leather is made from U.S native steer hide and it is tanned in Pennsylvania Our leather is die-cut in Massachusetts Our products are handcrafted in Massachusetts Our packaging is made in Massachusetts. Our products are packaged in Massachusetts Our Rivets come from an American supplier BUT they are made overseas --- we have been trying to find American-made rivets in the size and style that we need, but so far we have been unsuccessful. If anyone knows of an American manufacturer that makes small double cap rivets, please let us know! REWARDSTHE SCRAP BRACELET In the spirit of sustainability, we are minimizing waste by using as much of our materials as possible; even our scrap leather. The Scrap Leather Bracelet has a signature center rivet and holes punched all the way around so that it is adjustable to any wrist size. It is a simple product that makes a bold statement. Wear this bracelet to support our mission and our efforts towards environmental sustainability. (Color Option: black, brown, or red leather; silver, black or gold rivets)THE WALLET Handcrafted from the finest vegetable-tanned leather. (Color Options: black, brown, or red leather; silver, black, or gold rivets). Each wallet will come with a certificate of authenticity identifying it as a first production run Hammer Riveted Wallet. THE WOMEN'S RIVETED CARDHOLDER Two Pockets that Easily Fit 3-5 Cards and Cash This elegant yet durable cardholder is the perfect accessory for carrying a few cards and cash wherever you go. It is made with the same concept of design: a single piece of premium leather, secured with metal rivets, no thread stitching. (Color Options: Red, Black, or Brown Leather; Silver, Black, or Gold Rivets)SPECIAL EDITION WALLET We would like to recognize our extra-generous supporters with special edition wallets. These wallets will be the first wallets made. They will be hand-numbered and they will include a personalized stamp on the inside of the wallet. They will be delivered June 2014 (1 month earlier than the scheduled July 2014 delivery date). *** You will be contacted at the end of the Kickstarter Campaign for your Reward color option choices.OUR TEAM Our team consists of a determined group of professionals committed to bringing this vision to life. The team is headed up by two brothers: Jason and Chris Angelini. Jason has a degree in mechanical engineering. He is a soldier in the Army National Guard and he is leading the design efforts for this unique product line. His brother Chris, has a very different background with experience in marketing, search engine optimization and business management. Together, their skills set a strong foundation for building this company into a trusted and recognized brand. WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP"Movements are not started by leaders, they are started by the first followers."We need your support to prove that people are ready to demand a higher standard for the products they use and carry everyday. Your support will bring affirmation to our vision and your orders will allow us to fulfill minimum order quantities for our first line of production. If we meet our goal, we will be able to put our first product, the wallet, into production. Help us exceed our goal and we will be able to bring a whole product line to the market with a variety of products that hold true to our unique concept of design. We have several other ideas and prototypes that we are excited to introduce to the world. A Sneak Peak at Some of Our Working Prototypes OUR PRODUCTION PLANWe have established relationships with all our manufacturing and supply partners and we have worked hard to understand their capabilities and ensure that they can meet our production needs. Upon the successful completion of our Kickstarter campaign, we will immediately place the order for materials and get the first line of production underway. Predicted Timeline Wait 20 days for funds to clear 3 weeks to order tools and materials 6 weeks for production and Quality Assurance checks 2 weeks for packaging and shipment Send Off! We expect to start shipping in July 2014 TORTURE TESTING (Added At The Request Of Our Backers) I put peanut butter inside a Hammer Riveted Wallet and gave it to my Rhodesian Ridge Back puppy to chew on for an hour. When she was done with it, the wallet did not look pretty (as you can see in the picture), but it is important to note that she was not able to rip it apart. The wallet still holds its shape and is entirely functional. Also notice that her teeth never punctured the leather. This leather really is as tough as it gets. I do not however recommend giving your wallet to your dog as a chew toy.
256`Our Kickstarter campaign is over now, thanks to everyone who backed the project! If you missed it, you can still get more info about Urbanized and support the film at our official site.Cheers! -Gary In 2005 I began work on my first documentary, Helvetica, which looked at the worlds of typography and graphic design through the eyes of one loved/hated/ubiquitous little font. I wasn't a designer, or even a filmmaker, just a design geek who really wanted to see a movie about fonts! After Helvetica was released in 2007, I had the idea for a second film, Objectified, which focused on industrial design and product design, and our relationship with the manufactured objects that surround us. But I realized there was more to explore, and had the initial ideas for a third film that would also examine how design affects our lives. So I began thinking of the films as a "design trilogy". The third documentary in this trilogy is about the design of cities. Urbanized looks at the issues and strategies behind urban design, featuring some of the world's foremost architects, planners, policymakers, builders, and thinkers. I've teamed up once again with cinematographer Luke Geissbuhler, and we've been traveling around the world interviewing people and filming specific urban design projects that represent the issues facing cities today. The world's population is in the midst of a massive migration to urban areas, and the design solutions our cities implement in the next 20 years will be critical. We've already spent over a year and some substantial production costs making Urbanized, with over 100 people involved in the film thus far. We're knee-deep in the editing process now with Helvetica editor Shelby Siegel, but we still have several more filming trips to make this spring, and then we tackle post-production tasks like sound editing, color correction, and other tech work before completing the film this summer. Urbanized is a totally independent project: we don't get government funding or grants. And while we've been honored to have PBS and the BBC broadcast our films, they don't produce them or help us make them, they license broadcast rights to the films after we finish them. So Urbanized is being funded mainly by revenue from my previous two films. Please join us in helping to finish Urbanized, and you'll get some nice goodies as a reward. I'm especially excited about The Design Trilogy limited-edition box set, which will include the debut of Helvetica Neue. It's the director's cut of Helvetica (this time Arial shoots first). Thanks to everyone who has supported these films, on behalf of all of the people who've worked on them. We really appreciate it. Cheers! -Gary PS: The soundtrack of the video above is our old friends El Ten Eleven, it's the song "Anxiety is Cheap" from their new album. PPS: As a special bonus for our Kickstarter backers, we'll be releasing exclusive video clips and soundtrack MP3s over the next few months as we're finishing Urbanized. These clips and songs will only be available to our backers. You're helping us finish this film, so you deserve an exclusive first look at the footage as we're shooting and editing it! The Design Trilogy limited-edition box set, designed by Build, only 1,000 copies. Definitive editions of the three films on all-region DVD or Blu-ray, in a slipcover case with a hardbound art book (and some extra surprise goodies). Each copy signed by director Gary Hustwit: The Urbanized limited-edition screenprints designed by Build, representing mobility, housing, public space, and infrastructure.

257`Quicky is the magnetic belt that latches itself. Infinitely adjustable and ridiculously quick to remove, the patent-pending design looks great in the office, on the trail, or in the air. With your support, we hope Quicky will become the next addition to the Carbon Tactics product line.Designed to be used and abused: Adjusts fast for a perfect fit and doesn't slip. Latches itself and stays latched until you're ready to drop your pants. Quickly releases for rapid pants extraction. Strong enough to lift a motorcycle, it's unquestionably overbuilt. Two ways to wear it: tail-less or classic A classic leather look with optional black BioThane strap Custom-tailored to fit. We'll survey for your exact size at the end of the campaign. not magic, just magnets How it WorksQuicky is precision CNC machined from aerospace-grade aluminum (6061-T6), and the belt strap is made from Biothane, a coated webbing product which looks like leather, but is stronger and incredibly durable. We're also making Quicky with standard nylon webbing as well as a rigid tactical webbing, for higher carrying capacity. You can easily adjust Quicky to the optimum snugness, and it doesn't slip. The sliding post grips tighter and tighter as tension increases, which means your pants stay put. Loose or tight, it's your choice. When you're tired of wearing pants, you can remove Quicky fast. Just pinch and twist to release. When failure isn't an option, Quicky gets you out of your pants. You can even do it with just one hand... You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Quicky is really strong. We tested it by making an extra long Quicky and hanging my Suzuki SV650 from it. Quicky is strong. Quicky never skips leg day. The strap held firm as expected (no slippage), and the buckle escaped unharmed and ready to fight again another day. NEW! Carbon Fiber and Black Magnets Carbon Fiber is now available! By popular request, we are now offering a Special Edition Carbon Fiber buckle. Please note: This option is not available for the Twosome or Threesome packs, unless you manually increase your pledge to add it on. Regardless of which buckle you choose, you now get your choice of a black or silver magnet. We're all familiar with the traditional leather belt that hasn't changed since dinosaurs roamed the earth. It's a good solution, but it's not the BEST solution. A few months ago, I decided that I don't have time for that ancient technology anymore. I just wanted a belt that would: Snap apart instantly the very moment I needed to escape my pants. Snap right back together without making me adjust the fit or snugness of the strap again. Look like a regular belt so that I coud wear it with anything. Adjust simply and discreetly should I eat too much at dinner or just feel like letting loose a bit. Is that asking so much? Also, I wanted it to be way overbuilt so that it would last a very long time. After sketching concepts for a couple days, I settled on a locking mechanism using neodymium magnets and an interlocking male/female buckle combination machined from aluminum. Buckle Assembly To get a slimmer, more streamlined rectangular profile, I incorporated a sliding-post adjustment mechanism which is permanently retained inside the male buckle. That sliding post makes for a super-smooth adjustment, and it just works. The greater the load on the strap, the tighter the post grips, so there is no slippage. CAD Models PrototypingIt took a few iterations of 3D printing and CNC machining to get the design just right, but it was worth the effort. The mechanical latching/unlatching action feels just oh-so-nice. The male side seats securely into a recess of the female side, locking the two pieces together so that Quicky can't release before you're ready. Making Prototypes CNC MachiningTo get a Quicky, you start with a block of aluminum and cut away everything that doesn't look like a Quicky. While this production method is relatively expensive, I feel it's worth it to get a quality part made from strong material. CNC Machining Undercuts The StrapLeather was not durable enough, and most synthetic leather straps just didn't look right. Then I found BioThane Coated Webbing here in the USA. Their product is made by encapsulating a strong woven polyester webbing within an elastomer. That coating makes the strap waterproof and cleanable, so it should stay looking good for a long time. You can read more about Biothane on their website. BioThane Strap A standard nylon strap also works great, and it's super comfortable. If you need to carry heavy gear on your belt such as a holster, then the stiffer Tactical Nylon might be the way to go.

The authentic BioThane webbing will be custom-made for us by BioThane Coated Webbing, an American company that was kind enough to provide the sample webbing for the prototype belts.We Need Your SupportCNC Machining is expensive. There are a lot of good reasons for that, but we want to make Quicky accessible to everyone. The only way to bring the cost down is to manufacture parts in large batches, and we hope your support on Kickstarter will enable us to ramp up for our first Quicky production run.

You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 The StorySvetlana and her sister, Ruslana, are avid cooks who love to experiment in the kitchen and entertain their family. One day, they finally got tired of dealing with a recurring problem in their cooking routine: the juggle of where to put the lid while stirring a pot or adding more ingredients. At first, they scoured stores in search of a device to solve this problem and were disappointed to find nothing useful. After many discussions between the sisters and Svetlana's best friend, Rebecca, they finally decided to make one. But nothing is ever really that easy! While working on the idea, they quickly realized that adding yet another tool to a space that is already cluttered with gadgets was solving one problem and creating another, a storage dilemma. So they set out to create a product that would not only be useful for holding lids but would also fold flat for storage and while they were at it, they added a few trivets to take the place of multiple tools. And that's how Trivae was born! While working with your friends isn't always easy, in some cases it can liven up the daily grind... Friends are always there to laugh at you and point out your mistakes. A Design Challenge We explored several different designs and made numerous prototypes while working through each functional consideration. We wanted to make a product that was sturdy enough to support a lot of weight without sacrificing aesthetics. Our earlier efforts can be seen below in the first generation prototype on the right. As you can see, Trivae has traveled a long road. With the help of several designers and many hours spent scrutinizing CAD models, we've gone over every detail countless times. At each stage throughout the design process, we have made it a point to test Trivae's weight-bearing abilities and select materials suitable for the product's function, such as appropriate heat resistance and durability. After two grueling years of testing, modifying, and re-testing, Trivae's final design and prototype are complete. Let us just say, we couldn t be happier with it! The end result is a simple and modern tool that can be used in the kitchen or on the dining table. The Final Product Though we tried our best to incorporate all changes during the prototyping stage, there will be a few slight differences between the prototype you see in the video and the final manufactured product. With these tweaks we strengthened the overall structure, made the curves more streamlined, and selected the most durable finish for the product's purpose. See the images below to visualize the differences. This is our final prototype (unfinished) showing Trivae's updated shape along with a snapshot of a finish sample from our manufacturer showing what the actual metal finish will look like. The finished product will look fantastic. We promise! The Rewards! We have a plethora of rewards for you to choose from! We've spent quite awhile trying to craft the rewards that we think you will like. However, if you can't find exactly what you're looking for, email us and we'll try to figure something out. Now that you have seen all of the reward options, we wanted to help you better picture your kitchen's newest addition. Here is an up-close look at our metal plating options and silicone color guide to help you in your selection process. The Stretch Goals!Now that you've had a chance to get to know us a little and learn all about Trivae, if you love it as much as we do and want to see it come to market, please help us hit it out of the park with this campaign! And to give you a little extra incentive, we've designed several exciting stretch goals to help reward all of your efforts! Check us out online!
259`NOTE TO NEW BACKERS: Be sure to log in & read Update #1! Greetings, internet friends. I'm Jamie Tanner - cartoonist, illustrator, author of The Aviary. At the end of last year, I launched a Kickstarter project to help me make a new graphic novel. The project was successful, the experience was amazing, and since early 2010 I've been pretty much living my dream, spending most of my time working on this new comic book, which has come to be called THE BLACK WELL. Since I started work on this project, I've gotten great responses from people, including many who missed the original Kickstart, but were still interested in seeing what I was working on. So now that my new comic is nearing completion, I'm re-opening the project for just a little while... Up to this point the only people who've been able to read THE BLACK WELL have been the wonderful backers of my first Kickstarter project - they've seen everything that's gone into the making of the book, from my initial ideas, influences and inspirations to research, sketching and writing to planning, penciling, and inking to the final finished comics product. It's been really rewarding to connect with readers new and old, and share the work I care most about with them. In hopes of finding some more people who might be interested in reading my comics, I'm launching this project as sort of an extension of that first one. So for 30 days, I'm re-opening the Kickstarter doors. I'm setting the funding goal of the project super-low: just 50 bucks. So if even one person pledges for a page of art, the project is a go. But that's just a random number, really - there is no specific financial goal for this project. It's just to open the project up for more backers to join, and to hopefully sell some art & comics. Where does the money go? Well, first it goes to the cost of making and / or shipping all your rewards. Then it goes to helping support me while I finish the book - so if you like what you see, please pledge! What's in it for you? Well, anyone who backs the project at any amount will get access to the private website where you can read THE BLACK WELL - the first two parts are already up, and the last part (in progress now) should be up sometime in November. The first update to this project will give you the info for that site, and you can go read the first 88 pages as soon as you like. All backers will also be given access to all the behind-the-scenes stuff. I'll be re-posting all the backers-only updates from my first project, so you can see how the book developed from its very earliest stages all the way to its finished form. And then, of course, there are all the nifty rewards for pledging, like original art, prints, signed copies of my first book, The Aviary, and more. Basically, this project is a mini-storefront for art & comics, and with anything you buy you can read my new book as it's being made. Sound good? I hope so! (I'll include some examples of the available rewards at the bottom of this description ) What's THE BLACK WELL about? It's a sort of horror / comedy / mystery hybrid. But the mystery has no real solution, it's not really scary, and there aren't really any jokes. It's a strange variation on some classic horror themes & archetypes, like werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. But in a, let's just say, idiosyncratic way. Here are some of the characters you'll meet if you care to come aboard: Want to see more? Click here for sample pages from the book. If it looks like your kinda thing, back this project - that's the only way to read it at the moment, and probably for quite a while. Whatever fate befalls the book, you can read it as soon as it's done. I'm hopeful the book will be published someday, but this project is about creation, not about publication. It's about finding the time to make the work I care about most, and finding & connecting with people who care about it too! Thanks so much for taking the time to consider this, Jamie Tanner ---- (NOTE TO BACKERS OF MY FIRST PROJECT: Don't worry, there won't be anything that you'll miss by not backing this second project. I'll make sure that backers of both projects get access to all the same updates and information. So there's no need to pledge again! Unless you wanted to get additional rewards or something. And speaking of rewards...)Examples of Rewards: (Note: if you'd like multiple rewards, just pledge for the combined amount of the ones you want and send me a message. Also, non-U.S. backers are welcome, but please pledge a little extra for shipping. Thanks!)

We reached our minimum funding goal and are well on our way to getting girls (and boys!) building! Let's keep going, because the more people who pledge and pre-order Build & Imagine StoryWalls play-sets, the bigger impact we'll have on girls in STEM.So let's get StoryWalls into the hands of as many kids as we can!Meet Build & Imagine StoryWalls Recommended for ages 4-10. Each Build & Imagine play-set is composed of painted wooden panels, called StoryWalls, and accompanying wooden dolls. Children can combine the StoryWalls into any structural design they choose, and they magnetically snap together. The illustrations on each wall artfully combine to create scenes that act as a launching pad for the child s imagination. Play testing with an early prototype at the Children's Creativity Museum. Sisters build together. The InspirationIn the spring of 2013 Laurie Peterson founded Build & Imagine after noticing that the kind of play experiences she loved as a child (building, problem solving, designing and experimenting) were not reflected in the girls section of the toy store. She aims to create construction toys that her daughter -- and your daughters and sons -- will love. This campaign is raising support for Build & Imagine's first product line. Laurie's daughter plays with an early prototype. Why construction toys designed for girls?What we play with matters. Construction toys (also known as building toys) are the hottest category in the toy industry, yet historically 90% of these toys have targeted boys. Girls are missing out because construction toys help to develop important spatial reasoning and design skills that are prerequisites to succeed in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). These are fields in which women make up only 24% of the workforce, leading to what the President has termed a gender gap in innovation . Toys can make a difference.The design principle Laurie uses to get girls excited about construction is simple: building should facilitate imaginative play. Rather than designing with abstract bricks and shapes, children construct scenes that are as rich and beautiful as a storybook. We re launching with three play-sets Each Build & Imagine StoryWalls play-set comes with illustrated dolls and magnetic panels that children can combine into any configuration they choose. The first three play-sets work together in a coastal theme. Malia s Beach House Front Door to Malia's House Best friends Emily and Malia love hanging out in Malia s modern beach front eco-house after school. When they are not playing with her pets or goofing off in the pool, these friends enjoy learning about the environment and recently convinced Malia s parents to allow them plant a veggie garden.

Walk-up caf window with functioning shutters Lifeguard stand Surf shop Beach scene Why do kids love Build & Imagine StoryWalls? Play testing at the Children's Creativity Museum It s better than [other building toys] because there are pictures. I like pictures better than plain things. - 7 year old play tester That is a perfect summary of what makes our play-sets special. Rather than building with abstract bricks or shapes, you re creating a detailed scene that has tons of jumping off points for storytelling with the included dolls. Emily and Malia Dolls Why do parents love StoryWalls? Daddy / daughter construction team with an early prototype. Build & Imagine StoryWalls exercise important skills including: Spatial reasoning Decision-making & experimentation Geometry & engineering Creativity & design Collaboration & planning Imaginative play StoryWalls play-sets are made from wood, easy to set up and clean up, look good in your home, explore aspirational STEM themes as well as familiar ones, and are appealing to both girls and boys.

263`http://www.brit.co/kickstarter-march/ 1 small + 1 large Snug FREEwith your reward for all New and Existing backers! Only few minutes left for campaign to end! Pledge now! So many problemsEveryone knows how agonizing it is to hold that untouchably hot metal utensil handle, how frustrating it is to see that wooden handle with scorch marks and how ugly your melted plastic utensil handle looks because its been resting on the edge of the pan that has been on the stove for too long. Not to mention the melted plastic from spatula heads getting into your food! Also, does the spoon slipping into the serving dish sound familiar? How about those messy drips when you move your spoon from the pot to the spoon rest? Arghh.. Metal cooking utensils get too hot. Burn marks on wooden spatulas. Melted plastic utensils look ugly and pose health risk. Spoons sliding into the serving dish is embarrassing and unhygienic. One single solution These problems are ubiquitous and have been existing in our kitchens for ages. Looking at these common problems, we conducted a survey and we were not at all surprised by the feedback. Every single person who took the survey faced the same exact problems and was eager for a solution. Snug Ideation Images Early Snug Prototypes This is when we started drawing the picture of a simple yet elegant gadget in our mind, this one single solution, that will take care of all the above problems. After months of brain storming, mechanical and industrial design, several iterations of prototypes, feedback from trial groups and intense testing, we came up with an optimally engineered, aesthetically seductive and Patent Pending innovation The Snug. Innovative, Cute and Flexible....No pun intended! Putting the Snug OnSnug comes in two sizes and can be instantly attached like a sleeve to the handle of almost any cooking or serving utensil out there, regardless of the material, shape or size. Snug comes in Small and Large sizes to fit most of the handles. To put on the Snug, just grab the utensil with its handle and insert it through the top slot of the Snug. Turn the handle inside the Snug for a tight fit. Once installed, you do not need to take it out to stir food. SNUG contact with food is no problem! The silicone material is FDA approved, just like other silicone spatula material in the market.When you wish to use the utensil for stirring food, just grab it in your hand, make it rest on the edge of the pot that you are cooking in using the notch at the bottom of the Snug, stir your food and put it back on the edge, without having to use a spoon rest and preventing messy drips. Also rest assured that the handle will always remain cool and the Snug won t melt or burn even if it is made to rest on the hot pan or pot for hours on straight! Hold metal handles without thinking twice - with Snug. [Small Sized Snug shown here] Snug makes melted plastic spatulas a thing of the past! [Large Sized Snug shown here] No need to throw away expensive plastic spatulas anymore! [Large Sized Snug shown here] Snugs in daily useWatch a casual video below to show the Snugs in daily use to paint a better picture of their use. Thermal imaging camera clearly shows the difference You can also install Snug on various types of serving spoons, whisks and even ice cream scoops (not kidding!), before serving so that it stops the utensils from sliding into the serving dish, mixing bowl or ice cream bucket even when sub-consciously left against the edge. Prevent spoons from sliding into the serving dish. [Small Sized Snug shown here] Pretty spoon savers! [Small Sized Snug shown here] No need for spoon rests. Snug on whisks keeps the mess where it belongs - in the pan. [Large Sized Snug shown here] Use Snug when you need the lid slightly open while cooking. Snug fits onto most of the utensils out there! Feel free to be creative with it. [Size of Snug used here from Left to Right - S,S,L,L,L,L,L] Snug is designed to work with pots and pans with or without a lip at the rim. ConstructionSnug is made of FDA approved, high temperature grade Silicone material, that is heat resistant up to 570 F (or 300 C), sufficiently more than what you would ever need in the kitchen. This helps thermally insulate the utensil handle and keeps it cool. Snug is optimally designed to provide adequate flexibility around the top slot so that it can easily accommodate most of the utensil handles and also provide just the right stiffness at the bottom notch to give that nice snug feel when placing on the pot. Key Features Easy to install and remove on almost any utensil in your home or in the market Available in a variety of enticing colors High temperature (heat resistant up to 570 F or 300 C), FDA approved food grade silicone material provides thermal insulation and prevents utensil handles from getting too hot Prevents messy drips Stops the servings spoons from sliding into food Made of anti-aging and anti-bacterial material Very easy to clean, Dishwasher safe Thoughtfully shaped so that there are no nooks, crannies, or edges where food can get stuck, thus preventing bacterial growth US Patent Pending You got to see it to believe it! Easy to wash by hand under running water. Scrub if needed. Snug is designed with washing and hygiene in mind. There are no nooks or crannies where food can get stuck. Snug is completely Dishwasher safe. You can even throw it in there installed on the spatulas. Endurance TestingSnug has already gone through (and is going through) a lot of endurance stress tests before making it to your kitchen: High temperature tests while cooking on the stove Flame tests (sitting in the flame) for 2 minutes just in case you drop it. See picture above for results. It did not melt or smoke : ) Cycle tests (Handle insertion and rotation) on the upper hole Cycle tests on the lower notch Dishwasher tests Hand wash and scrubbing tests Food color seepage tests Detailed Design Elements Design Features Funding needed for Injection Molding Tooling for both sizes (small and large) Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ) the manufacturer requires us to make for each size and color Packaging and Labor charges for MOQ Note about Retail PriceApproximate retail price would be ranging from $17 to $25 depending on the number of Snugs per pack.

264`Dear Backers, I am overwhelmed by your incredible support! Thanks to you we hit our initial goal in the first 10 days -- and LA CIUDAD will be preserved! To all of you who are finding out about our campaign for the first time, we welcome your support. Every new backer makes a difference! Our hope now is to raise funds to make the film available internationally. For those of you who have written from outside the US, we are offering a brand new reward of a digital download anywhere in the world -- the Walter Salles!For more updates about this project please follow us on facebook.comJoin us to help save this film! All funds from this campaign will go towards the costs of remastering LA CIUDAD and ensuring that it is available for new audiences -- on DVD and BLU-RAY, at community and educational screenings, and for the first time ever on digital platforms. Every contribution counts. Please help us spread the word!What is LA CIUDAD about?I m David Riker, the writer and director of LA CIUDAD. LA CIUDAD tells four stories about the lives of newly uprooted Latin American immigrants in New York City: a group of day laborers hired to clean bricks find themselves abandoned when tragedy strikes; a young man newly arrived from Mexico falls in love with a girl from his home village, only to lose her in the new and alien urban wilderness; a puppeteer, living with his daughter in a station wagon, dreams that she'll one day learn to read; and a seamstress, desperate to send money home to her sick daughter, is forced to finally confront the injustice in the sweatshop where she labors. What inspired me to make this film?I wanted to explore what it means to be an immigrant today -- uprooted, often alone, and largely invisible -- forced to live in the shadows of an alien world. I had long been inspired by the Italian neo-realist films, whose socially committed stories were rooted in everyday reality, but expressed in a lyrical visual language. LA CIUDAD was filmed over the course of six years, and was created through a unique and profound collaboration between the filmmakers and the immigrant community. All of the stories were developed in workshops with the immigrants later acting in the very roles they helped to create. Still image from the story "Bricks" Developing the story for 'Seamstress' with garment workers Making the film was a transformative experience for me, as well as for many of the immigrants involved, most of them undocumented, who chose to step out of the shadows of their lives and stand in front of the camera for the first time. Their reasons for participating were many, but all of them were determined that their stories should be heard. Working with garment workers during the filming of 'Seamstress' Because of the special way the film was made, it has a rare authenticity, expressing the essence of what it feels like to be an immigrant today. Above all, LA CIUDAD made the immigrant worker visible. What has happened with the film thus far?LA CIUDAD was released in theaters fifteen years ago to critical acclaim. Roger Ebert called the film 'A movie to treasure,' reminiscent of 'The Bicycle Thief.' Variety claimed, 'it can take its place beside such postwar neo-realist classics as Rossellini's 'Paisan' and Bu uel's 'Los Olvidados,' while The Washington Post wrote: 'It is very simply a great film.' Mariachis play at community premiere of film in New York City The film premiered at Toronto and won numerous international awards including the Open Palm Award from the Independent Feature Project, Best Narrative Feature at SXSW, the Nestor Alemendros Prize from the Human Rights Watch Festival, and Best Film by a Non-Latin American Director at the Havana Film Festival. Silvia Goiz, a garment worker, in the lead role in 'Seamstress' Why are we on Kickstarter?Today LA CIUDAD is virtually impossible to see. The DVD is out of print and the company that released it -- New Yorker Films -- has sadly closed. The few 35mm prints that still exist are old and battered, and there are fewer and fewer venues that are equipped to project film today. Most critically, the film was never mastered for digital platforms, and until now has not been available for online audiences.We are determined to ensure that the film remains available and can reach new audiences today and in the future. Cinema Conservancy, the Princess Grace Foundation, and the Sundance Collection at UCLA have already joined the effort, but we need your help.Thanks for visiting our Kickstarter page -- we can t wait to share LA CIUDAD with all of you! Please watch our Kickstarter video above to learn more!FAQ s and REWARDS INFORMATIONI m excited about LA CIUDAD -- aside from donating, how can I help?There are so many ways you can help!

Tulipe Noire is a rare deep purple tulip, and is my inspiration for a unique women s watch collection that s mechanical, limited, and always sprinkled with genuine diamonds. I m a watch designer and gemologist with a dream.

With Tulipe Noire, I created every piece in the collection to ensure each detail was exactly what I wanted in a watch. I have completed all my design work. I have reviewed the samples, and paid for them. All models are set for production with trusted and proven factories who are ready to begin producing.

I am only one person hoping to make a difference by creating a brand that thinks about women s tastes, differently. But, at the end of the day, our backers are our most valuable intangible asset, as only they will bring this dream to life. I m doing this because I passionately believe that in creating Tulipe Noire, we continue to think about everyone s needs and desires along the way. It s been a fun journey so far and I hope we can have some fun together along the way. Now, I ask you to join me in bringing this dream to life.

When a big spill ruined an important computer of ours, we set out to create a better, smarter mug - a mug that would stand up to accidental knocks and bumps. After years of development, we came up with Mighty Mug, the world's only mug powered by our patented Smartgrip Technology. When you knock into other mugs they fall over and spill on your computer, papers, phone, pants and basically ruin your day. Mighty Mug is different as it grips to your desk when knocked into, but lifts naturally like any other mug. The magic is in Mighty Mug's patented Smartgrip base. Mighty Mug creates a super powerful airlock once placed down, but automatically releases when you need a sip.There are no buttons to push or levers to pull to get Mighty Mug to work. Mighty Mug is not a suction cup nor is it a magnet, but rather something entirely new.Mighty Mug will grip to any smooth, flat, solid surface like most desks and tables. The most amazing part about Mighty Mug is that when you go in for a sip it lifts 100% naturally. Grips when hit but lifts when you need a sip. We are a team of mechanical engineers and industrial designers who have spent the last 3 years developing Mighty Mug and it's patented Smartgrip technology.

267`Backers - Like our Facebook page and become a fan at BGG to unlock additional cards for the game! Check out the stretch goals!2-5 Players, Ages 13+, 60-90 MinutesThe year is 1123. A new count has arrived to oversee the surrounding countryside. As word spreads, people have begun to flock to the settlement. The time is right for Blankenburg to expand into a flourishing town.In the Builders of Blankenburg, you are one of many people working to build up the town and earn prestige in the eyes of the count. Prestige is earned by building structures throughout the town, but to do so you ll need enough silver to purchase the proper resources with which to build. Pay attention to the citizens of the growing town. If you build what they re looking for, you ll have a steady stream of income. Builders of Blankenburg introduces the novel citizen track, an ever increasing populace who seek different places to live and work, while also serving to determine the length of the game. But beware, new events and visitors each turn can disrupt your best laid plans. Make your imprint on Blankenburg to become its most prestigious builder and earn the key to the town! We have taken to heart feedback from the first launch. The base game now features more visitor and event cards. Prices have been lowered for both the Master Builder limited edition and the Immortality packages. We have also added more variety in the stretch goals, including a double sided game board and upgraded silver coins. Who Dares to Build Forever?Enjoy this teaser video featuring a parody of Queen's "Who wants to live forever" that helps to promote the immortality packages that allow people to add their likeness to the game. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Builders of Blankenburg requires players to pay attention to both their income and prestige. While prestige determines the winner, maintaining a steady income stream is essential to continue building and earning prestige. There is no set number of turns to the game. Rather, the game ends when the town has either no room for additional structures, or no room for additional citizens.Each turn consists of four phases: Bidding, Building, Income, and the Marketplace. During the bidding phase, the first player is able to select some resources, then rolls the resource dice to add others. All players simultaneously bid silver for the available resources, with first choice going to the highest bidder.In the building phase players use their resources to build structures based on the plans in their hand or the current communal plans. Each structure fits into one of four districts in the town, each of which is limited in size. You can also demolish structures to make room in a full district, to harvest resources, or to simply delay the end of the game.During the income phase an event occurs, a visitor comes to the town, and the citizens all pay to stay somewhere. By building structures that are in demand by the town's citizens, you can guarantee yourself steady income. Fortunes can quickly shift based upon the events drawn or the visitors who come to town. Many offer opportunity and benefits to the players, but some like an earthquake or the assassin can be devastating.The marketplace phase occurs at the end of the turn. It allows players an opportunity to purchase resources at fixed prices, but stock is limited and prices are not cheap. Players can also purchase new plans during the marketplace phase. At the end of the turn, empty marketplace stalls are replenished, new communal plans replace any that were built, and a new citizen is added to the town for the following turn.Want the full rundown on game play?

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Print and PlayIn addition to the print and play available for purchase that will be continually updated to eventually include all the same art as the production copy of the game, we are also offering a text only print and play to all backers. Once funding concludes everyone will receive the same print and play copy that we used for months to test the game early on. While it's not the prettiest thing ever, it lets you focus on game play, uses very little ink to print out, and is formatted to easily print double sided on normal sized sheets of card stock at home. This will ensure you have had time to practice and are ready to beat your friends when your fancy copy of the game arrives later in the year. Enjoy!

However, we hope for even greater success. Part of the beauty of Kickstarter is the ability to offer a number of stretch goals to make the game even more exciting, including a number that are exclusive to this first Kickstarter printing. Browse below to see some of the goals we can reach, starting just a couple thousand dollars beyond base funding. Feeling generous? Don't worry, if we surpass all the current stretch goals, we got even more ideas on tap to make Builders of Blankenburg truly epic. Board Game Geek is the premier site for everything related to the hobby. Help raise the visibility of our project on the site by checking out the Builders of Blankenburg page and becoming a fan. If we reach just 50 fans we'll add two more visitor cards to every copy of the game.Board Game Geek Like the game? Then like its page on Facebook. If we get just 250 page likes from people spreading the word about Builders of Blankenburg, everybody gets two additional event cards in the game. Pass it on to your friends. The more people who get on board, the more everybody gets.Builders of Blankenburg Facebook page If we can manage a measly grand past our funding goal, the game gets an additional two event cards, This will feature the deadly plague, plus another surprise event that will benefit all players. These events will be exclusive to this printing of the game. Visitors add a lot of uncertainty to the game, along with opportunity to jockey for position. Meeting this stretch goal will add the dreaded tax collector (not much has changed in the past thousand years) and another surprise visitor sure to delight the players. These visitors will be exclusive to this printing of the game. Strategies shift depending on your character for the game. Meeting this stretch goal will add two new characters, including the mysterious fortune teller. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and these characters will not be included in later printings of the game. While the base game is being printed by a top flight manufacturer and utilizes high quality components, meeting this goal will upgrade all cards in the game to a linen finish. This added touch will give the game an even grander appearance. Meeting this stretch goal will enhance the game with a double sided game board. The reverse side of the board will feature new artwork and special dual purpose plots. These are spaces that allow you the option of building two different type of structures there, expanding strategies around capturing district majorities. Everyone likes a family friendly game, but sometimes you have the urge to really stick it to the other players. The cutthroat cards are an optional game mechanic that allows for greater player versus player interaction. Why hope for a fire to strike the town when you are holding the arson card? Is this bid extra important to you? Play the corruption card to get an added advantage. These cards aren't for everyone, but will definitely change the flavor of every game of Builders of Blankenburg. Another excellent component upgrade. Reach this goal and the cardboard first player key token will be replaced with a metal replica of a real antique skeleton key. More characters equals more game dynamics, so we're adding three more to the game. Will you draw the money changer, who can exchange silver for gold and vice versa? If not, there will be other worthy new characters to select from. With quality art, these coins look good even if made of cardboard, but this stretch goal will upgrade the gold coins in the game to actually be minted of gold toned metal instead. Ambitious? Yes. Awesome? Definitely! If backers sign up for only about 1,000 copies of the game, this can become a reality. Another upgrade exclusive to this printing of the game. We heard you loud and clear. The most requested upgrade was for the silver coins to be made of something other than cardboard. Since these are the most numerous component in the game, an upgrade won't be cheap, but if we reach this Kickstarter exclusive goal it will become a reality. Depending on total funds raised, cost, and weight, the silver coins will be upgraded to either metal or plastic. Want to pick up an added copy or two of the game? Simply increase your pledge amount according to the details below. When the Kickstarter ends, we will send out surveys to to all backers allowing you to note any add-on copies of the game you wish to have. Extra copies cost $30 each for backers of a physical copy of the game. Shipping is free in the US, $5 to Canada or the EU, and later determined for the rest of the world based on actual postage rates. One of the things that Makes Builders of Blankenburg unique is that this is a collaborative project between the game designer and artist. Most games on Kickstarter utilize freelance artists. While many of these artists are very good, they are not invested in the game to the same extent as when they are a 50/50 partner. Liz Stephanoff has produced excellent quality work for the project thus far, bringing the denizens of Blankenburg to life. By supporting our project, you have the ability to become part of the game as well, adding your likeness to all copies in the current and future print runs. You can view a bit more of her art style and technique in the video below. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 What about shipping?Shipping within the US is free for all game packages. Shipping to Canada is an additional $10 and shipping to Europe is an additional $15. We will be using Canadian and EU friendly fulfillment services to avoid any extra fees to backers in those areas. We will ship worldwide, but blanket shipping prices are difficult to determine, so other countries will be charged actual shipping after the campaign concludes. We will do everything in our power to limit customs and duty to other countries, but we cannot guarantee it. Shipping charges to the rest of the world will be reduced by $10 each, to reflect a credit equal to the value of free shipping in the US. Most other countries will see shipping around $20 and not more than $25. Add on shipping for additional game copies is the same as the first copy. Why support now?The Kickstarter pricing with free shipping is at least a 30% discount to standard retail pricing. In addition, many items available through this campaign will not be available later, including the limited deluxe edition. Your support at this stage can unlock additional characters, visitors and events, plus upgrade components that will all be Kickstarter exclusives. Finally, this is your only opportunity to earn board game immortality by having your likeness used in the game.Why Kickstarter?The reasons to fund through Kickstarter are twofold. First, this allows us to reach a worldwide audience who becomes invested in the success of the game along with us. Secondly, it involves the gaming community in the creation of Builders of Blankenburg. Not only will some people be able to have their likeness used in the game, this creates an open dialog between the designer, artist, and consumer to ensure the final game is the very best product possible.What's next?We have a number of ideas on tap to expand Builders of Blankenburg. The Farmers expansion would allow up to six people to play, by adding an extra agricultural district and increasing the citizen track. In addition, it adds a new dynamic to the game with auctions of different crop producing fields, which pay out during harvest times. For fantasy lovers, we are looking at a cards only expansion called Wizards of Blankenburg. This would add fantasy flair to the game with structures and inhabitants from popular mythology. Also, certain structures would allow players to generate magic, and each wizard character will have a unique set of spells they can cast. If you're looking for more variety, there are also plans for unrelated games dealing with everything from worker placement to viking battles.Other LanguagesWhile Builders of Blankenburg features as many symbols as possible to cut down on language dependence, we do realize it's always nicest to have the official rules in your native tongue. To this end, we will provide translated copies of the rules on Board Game Geek for any language that generates at least a dozen backers. If we have around a hundred backers who share another language, we will include a printed rule book in that language with the game as well. All translations will also include a reference sheet that serves to translate the text on the character, visitor and event cards.Avatars
268`Hello, my name is Alec Longstreth. Since 2002, I have been self-publishing the Ignatz Award-winning minicomic Phase 7. I have drawn 18 issues so far! From 2004-2011 I serialized my first graphic novel, Basewood in the pages of Phase 7. The goal of this Kickstarter is to raise enough money to get Basewood professionally printed as a hardback book. UPDATE: We reached the funding goal, so Basewood will be printed! We also reached the push goal, so a cool companion volume which comes with a rock opera version of Basewood will be sent out to all the backers at the $25 level or above! The Story Basewood is a classic amnesia story set in a fantastical forest. There is a young man trying to discover more about his mysterious past, an old hermit who lives in a treehouse with his loyal dog, a young woman who fights for what she believes in and a giant wolf-dragon who shows up in each of the five chapters of Basewood. It is a story of adventure, love, loss, friendship and growth. You can read the entirety of Basewood on my website right now, for free! A French-language edition of Basewood was published by L'employ du Moi in 2012. In Belgium, France and Quebec it is marketed as a YA graphic novel. Here's what some other cartoonists have said about Basewood: "Drawn with delicate precision, brimming with heart and adventure, Basewood is an exquisite gem of a work. It's a genuine miracle that a comic this beautifully unique exists at all." - James Kochalka, author of American Elf, Monkey Vs. Robot and Johnny Boo "Longstreth's deceptively simple drawings of this harsh world filled with axes, ropes, pulleys, and levers, a place where you must bend nature with your bare hands to survive, have a layered intricacy that looks like something that should be carved on a medieval cathedral. One of my favorite books to spend time with."- Jeff Smith, author of Bone and RASL "Alec Longstreth is the most generous and enthusiastic cartoonist I've ever met, and his work brims over with that same contagious energy. His greatest work to date, Basewood, is a full sensory immersion into a meticulously-crafted, warm-hearted, and most of all epic world." - Craig Thompson, author of Habibi, Blankets and Good-Bye, Chunky Rice The Effort It took me seven years to draw all 204 pages of Basewood. It was rendered in a highly detailed crosshatching style on 18" x 24" sheets of Bristol board. It was a lot of work! You may have seen my Basewood Beard project, in which I cut off all of my hair and then took a photo each time I finished penciling or inking a page for the last three chapters. If not, this video will give you a good idea of what those three and a half years of my life were like: The Book Because of all the work that went into the creation of Basewood, I really want the final book to be something I can be proud of. It's important to me that the art is reproduced at a big enough size so that readers can see all of the detail on every page. And, because of the larger page size, I want the book to have a hardback binding so that it is not flopping around in the reader's hands. My plan is to use the French edition of Basewood (pictured above) as a template for the English edition. The book will be approximately 9" x 12" with a full-color cover and one-color endpapers. If I raise my goal, I will print 2,000 copies of the book. The Extras I'm hoping to raise most of my goal amount through pre-orders of the book. However, I'm also offering a few exclusive extras for hardcore Basewood fans, which I will list below. The simplest is a signed copy of the book, which will feature a sketch of one of the five characters from Basewood along with a dedication and my signature. I'm also offering a Phase 7 "completist" set, which includes signed copies of the other three Phase 7 collections: Phase 7, Transition, B-Sides. Along with Basewood, it's 786 pages in all! You can learn more about these collections over on my website. Back in 2007 Jed McClure at Albatross Press made a letterpress print of a panel from Basewood. For this Kickstarter campaign I will take the remaining twenty-five prints and color them by hand with watercolors. Suitable for framing! In 2012 my extremely talented wife Claire Sanders designed a plush toy version of the wolf-dragon from Basewood, which is eighteen inches from nose to tail. She has agreed to make five more of these monsters for exclusive backer rewards. After Basewood This project surpassed the $16,000 push goal, so backers at the $25 level or above will also receive a very special issue of Phase 7 which will be a companion volume to Basewood. It will have two parts: 1) over 50 pages of concept drawings, character design sketches, building schematics, inking tests and Basewood pinups by other cartoonists and 2) a CD containing Songs From the Basewood, a rock opera version of Basewood composed by Andy Hentz and myself, as well as all of the lyrics. You can learn more about this bonus content and see (and listen to!) samples over in this update. Also, just so everyone knows, Chris Pitzer at AdHouse Books has agreed to help distribute Basewood if this Kickstarter is successful! That means that if I get enough money to self-publish the book, he will help me enter Basewood into the Diamond Comics Distribution system. Doing so would allow people to find Basewood at their local comics shop, and in bookstores and online. I've never done this step with one of my books before, so I really appreciate Chris's offer of help! I will still be selling the book through my website and at conventions.
269`Finally - A Pain Free Pump Head! R pido Pro Pump Head - Easy On! R pido - Easy Off! 5 Colors to Choose From The Current Problem With Pump Heads Let's face it, bicycle pump heads have not changed much in the past 100+ years. Every type of bike enthusiast is still settling for awkward, two handed and clumsy bike pump heads that are often leaky at best and painful at worst. WHY WE WENT FOR IT The R pido Pro Pump Head was born out of our own frustration with low quality solutions and silly designs and quite frankly we were tired of starting our weekend bike rides with bruised knuckles and questionably aired tires.After many months of research, development and prototyping, our accomplished team of engineers and product developers created a reliable pump head that is comfortable, easy to use, and allows anyone to pump up a tire with minimal effort regardless of age or ability.R pido's unique and one of a kind patent pending head attachment now means that connecting to a tire valve is a one hand operation. No more fussing with a two or three position head, clumsy / flimsy levers, switches and adapters that will get lost.. Simply push it on to start and pull it off when finished. BUILT TO LAST The R pido Pro Pump Head was designed from day 1 with an emphasis on reliability and durability. Our engineering team has worked tirelessly to develop a system that will ensure that the R pido Pro Pump Head will be the best floor pump head a bicyclist has ever used. Manufactured from high quality high impact Plastic and Stainless steel, there are no compromises in quality. EASY TO USE The R pido Pro Pump Head In Action Focusing on the natural geometry of the human hand and dominant muscle groups, we were able to study the best way to interact with the R pido Pro Pump Head. In the end, it was determined that designing the R pido Pro Pump Head to function somewhat like a syringe enabled the R pido Pro Pump Head to work with the largest variety of hand sizes and strengths.This one hand interface works effortlessly with Schrader or Presta bike valves creating a super seal that has been tested to maintain pressure up to 25 minutes or more at pressures in excess of 120 p.s.i. Don't forget that properly inflated tires result in faster times, increased efficiency, smoother rides, less flats and overall safer performance from beginning to end.Performance Specs of the R pido Pro Pump Head Pressure Testing The unit that we have been testing is technically a prototype, however we have tested it extensively with several types of floor pumps and even some battery powered pumps. The air tight seal holds pressure for > 25 minutes 120 P.S.I is our goal specification for maximum pressure and we have been happy with the performance so far. Rewards!! How we will use the money raised on KickstarterThe money that we raise on Kickstarter will be applied to production tooling, materials, assembly and fees. We need approximately $20,000 for the production tooling and $4,000 - $5,000 for materials and assembly to meet our minimum order quantity. About Production and Assembly:Our focus is to deliver a high quality product that you will own and use for years to come. The only way to achieve this level of quality is to use our own in-house engineers located in our facility in Taiwan. Taiwan is known for producing exceptionally high quality products and is also home of the largest and arguably best bicycle manufacturer in the world "Giant Bicycles".The pump that ships with the R pido Pro Pump Head has been sourced specifically because it is manufactured in Taiwan to exacting standards.What To ExpectAs a backer of the R pido Pro Pump Head project, you will be a critical part of R pido's success. We will be in constant communication with project updates, manufacturing, assembly schedules, and shipping details. We encourage all of you to use the comment section of the campaign to provide valuable feedback and to connect with the community supporting the project. We love hearing feedback, for better or for worse, it's how innovation happens.About The Pump R pido Pro Pump With Pro Pump Head R pido Pro Pump With Pro Pump Head Reinforced plastic barrel High mounted gauge Gauge measures up to 160 P.S.I. We chose this pump to mate with the R pido Pro Pump Head because of the quality build, all plastic design to reduce the overall weight to lower shipping costs to Kickstarter backers and for the 160 P.S.I. rating.Warranty and ServiceAs we have for the last 10 years, we stand behind our work. The floor pump unit and the R pido Pro Pump Head has a 1 year warranty from date of shipping.

270`If you love coffee as much as we do, we're sure you would LOVE to be able to drink it anytime anywhere. And so would we! That is why we decided to make a coffee mug that is practical and sustainable, but is also a fashion accessory and tells the primeval story of coffee. Its most obvious feature is definitely its shape which resembles the goat s horns but it also helps you drink that last sip of your coffee and makes you look good. We designed a special holder with leather touch which simply turns into a coffee mug stand so you can easily keep the Goat mug on your desk. Also, Goat mug comes with a set of two straps (short and longer part combine in to one), so you can simply attach it to your bag or just let it fall across your shoulder. This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around. Goat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE. Since you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand. Here's a look inside the Goat mug. It's shape makes it simple to clean. We designed a beautiful packaging to deliver your Goat mug in style. It can then become a perfect storage place for your fresh coffee beans. We would love for more coffee lovers to learn the real story about coffee as much as we would love all of them to be stylish and eco-friendly while drinking their coffee wherever and whenever. That is why we would appreciate you backing our project. Surely, there will be more coffees enjoyed if we manage to make our dream come true.Help us share our project among other coffee lover out there Awards structure: The first stretch goal is an idea we got from our backer Tamara. If we manage to raise $60,000 we will offer everyone a new colour option of the Goat mug - the PANTONE COLOUR OF THE YEAR: MARSALA. Let's do it! The second stretch goal is out! If we manage to raise $250,000 we will offer a new reward: HEMP EDITION Goat mug - for all those on the relaxed side of fashion. Never. Enough. Coffee. You asked for big, we're giving you GRANDE. Third streth goal is set to $350,000! Can we do this together? If all goes according to our plans, we will be shipping out products already in second half of February. Let's do this together! Design of the GOAT STORY Coffee mug was done by design studio Desnahemisfera in cooperation with MyEqua.
271`Our StoryWe've been making hot sauce for years due to dissatisfaction with the available products, a passion for growing strange and hot peppers, and as science types, an insatiable desire to learn how things work and to improve them. As we engineered better and better sauces, what started as a few mason jars come harvest time soon blossomed into an annual production run of hundreds of individually labelled bottles that were rationed out to friends, family, and the hopelessly hooked. We're now coming to Kickstarter to fund equipment and ingredient purchases, commercial kitchen rental and licensing fees to allow Sauce Science to scale up and be sold worldwide. This spring we partnered with Driftless Organics to grow the large amount of peppers needed for a scaled-up operation and with the harvest here, we are primed to hit the afterburner on the Sauce Science project. Grab on! Our MissionThe Sauce Science mission is to combine scientific rigor with a passion for peppers to yield handcrafted hot sauces that delight the palate. Our goal is to bring our high quality products to market and to give back to the scientific community by supporting STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) education efforts. Due to limitations on donations with Kickstarter campaign funding, no charitable contributions will be made from Kickstarter proceeds. However, our long term mission is that $0.50USD will be donated to benefit STEAM education for each 5 oz. bottle of Sauce Science sauces sold. Say that five times fast!The Science Behind the Sauces (TL;DR) Sauces, contained. Barely. The heat level of a food is typically reported as units on the Scoville scale, where the number represents the level of dilution with sugar water required to neutralize the heat taste. So a Scoville rating of 1000 means one drop of sauce in 1000 drops of sugar water. As scientists this is cringe-inducing because a test standard should be measurable and repeatable. However, the Scoville protocol's reliance on the subjective tasting of a panel of human meat sacks, rather than an impassive cold-hearted machine, means that reported Scoville numbers vary widely and are influenced by systematic factors such as who is tasting, what the tasters previously tasted, what side of the bed they woke up on, etc. Diluted sugar water? Hogwash.Sauce Science's core line up of numbered sauces (1-5) is designed to provide a range of heat levels with a common theme of backing spices and flavors that blend with the varying pepper constituents so that a consistent experience can be had by the heat neophyte or the chili connoisseur. We accomplish this by using different peppers and ingredient ratios in each recipe, then measuring the results using analytical methods such as HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) which reports the numerical level in ppm (parts per million) of the capsaicinoid chemicals that humans perceive as heat in the hot sauces. These chemicals include the familiar capsaicin (8-methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide) as well as the often ignored congener molecule dihydrocapsaicin which produces essentially the same nociceptor heat response (the burn) when eaten and is thus part of the perceived heat of a sauce. Whew! Make sense?With Kickstarter backing, each sauce will be analyzed and adjusted using this scientific approach, ensuring a consistent heat level in each batch and a smoothly increasing heat level in each recipe. From the entry-level #1 LUKE sauce with a designed 75ppm of capsaicinoids up to the earth shattering #5 !!!!!! sauce with a targeted 1200ppm, the consumer is well informed of what they are in for. None of these sauces are for the faint of heart, but an intrepid soul need not have a cast-iron mouth to enjoy them. There are a lot of hot sauces out there on the market, but our scientific methods, commitment to quality ingredients, and passion for flavor make Sauce Science concoctions stand out in a crowded field. Trust the numbers.A Peck of PeppersUp until this Kickstarter campaign we have grown our own peppers in lovely Minneapolis, starting seeds in the dead of winter and transplanting into larger cups as the sun begins to crack the horizon in March. In this way we have robust seedlings ready to transplant into custom-made grow containers (based on the InnTainer design) when the weather is warm enough come late May. The long grow season (>120 days) required of the kind of exotic peppers we crave necessitates these heroics and the results speak for themselves. In this way we have been able to manufacture around 500 bottles of sauce per year. Beginnings of Sauce in Darkest Winter Transplanted Peppers in Progress However, this does not yield enough peppers to scale up with and we have partnered with a local organic farming crew, Driftless Organics of Soldiers Grove WI, to provide peppers for this Kickstarter campaign and the subsequent roll out of our sauces into the commercial realm. The Driftless Organics Crew in their Element Driftless Organics grows food of unparalleled quality responsibly, organically, and sustainably using scientific and time-honored agricultural methods. Seeing the rows of peppers at their beautiful farm is amazing, driving home the fact that this is real, this is happening. We are as excited as a coronal mass ejection to bring these peppers to you. Pepper in Progress at Driftless. Woot! Heat Scale: Trust the Numbers The Sauce Science heat scale lets the user dial in their hot sauce experience. We scientifically measure and report the capsaicinoid content in ppm (parts per million) for our sauces. Design values are given for each sauce below and for those stuck in the past, we include a Scoville scale value as well below. For reference, the popular Sriracha sauce is rated around 133ppm (2000 Scoville) and original Tabasco at around 267ppm (4000 Scoville). 1: LUKE: 75ppm (1125 Scoville): LUKE as in lukewarm, this sauce is built around a blend of milder yellow Aji peppers originally from Peru and hotter Datil peppers originally from Chile. With the citrus flavor notes from these peppers and the accompanying blend of spices, this sauce is scientifically formulated to tantalize but can still pack a punch.2: GRIM: 150ppm (2250 Scoville): Moving up from LUKE requires GRIM determination that is rewarded by a more powerful buildup of heat. Built on the same peppers as LUKE, GRIM incorporates a greater proportion of the spicier Datil peppers and, while well rounded and delicious, can sneak up on the unwary.3: DIRE: 300ppm (4500 Scoville): Red Savina Habanero peppers form the backbone of this apex predator of a hot sauce. Their incredible flavor and forceful heat make DIRE the flagship sauce in our line-up and deserving of a spot on any table. Running out of this sauce is indeed a DIRE situation, as is accidental application to any of a number of sensitive body parts. Use with care.4: FATAL: 600ppm (9000 Scoville): Good laboratory procedure requires donning your PPE (personal protective equipment for you non-lab types) when FATAL sauce is open. A potent mixture of Red Savina Habanero and Bhut Jolokia (Ghost Pepper) from India give this sauce an incapacitating yet irresistible heat and flavor. Unwise usage can result in tears of joy, personal injury, or both.5: !!!!!!: 1200ppm (18000 Scoville): For the experienced hot sauce explorer only. Strictly Bhut Jolokia peppers. Use at your own risk. RewardsNaturally, the rewards for this campaign are centered around the sauces. Rather than detail each reward exhaustively, we've included some key notes for the various reward types. All reward levels include free US shipping (international orders will be subject to additional shipping costs) and can be combined to suit your needs.Stickers: Every backer gets a Sauce Science logo sticker as a thank you. The stickers are printed in white on a clear background. The logo is approximately 2" (50.8mm) high. 2" tall logo sticker reward for all backers 2 oz. Sauce Samples: These are small 2 oz. samples of our sauces that let you try the magic without committing to the larger bottles. Be warned that choosing the sample size will only hasten your need to order more sauce. Better to kick your support up a few levels to the baker's dozen. You'll thank us later.5 oz. Sauce Choices: When choosing rewards with 5 oz. sauces you can pick whichever sauce you want except where indicated. However, we have to limit the #5!!!!!! sauce to one 5 oz bottle per backer until the harvest is completely in and the backer reward choices made. The #5 !!!!!! sauce is difficult and expensive to produce due to the large quantity of peppers required to reach the upper thermosphere of heat levels. Once we know how many bottles of #5 !!!!!! we can make, we will accommodate those backers with a penchant for punishment.T-Shirt: The design for the T-Shirt is not completely finalized but it will likely take the form of a Sauce Science logo on the front and a heat scale info-graphic on the back. Here is an early mock up to give you an idea. Early mock-up of T-Shirt design Make Sauce: For the truly committed sauce aficionado we have created a special reward that allows you to get a food handler certification, your own hair net, and a chance to help us in our kitchen on a batch of sauce. You will be responsible for your own transportation but we will put you up for 2 nights in our lovely guest accommodations, put you to work mercilessly, regale you with stultifying tales of the sauce industry, and feed you meagerly. Join us!Combining rewards: Since we can't create infinite reward levels, we allow you to combine rewards. For example, if you wish to sign up for a baker's dozen sauce reward but also want a T-Shirt, select the more expensive reward and add to your contribution amount to include the cost of the additional reward you would like (i.e. $156USD for the Baker's Dozen + $25USD for a T-Shirt = $181USD contribution). When the campaign closes we will straighten out these combined reward choices on an individual basis.Stretch GoalsLike any good Kickstarter campaign, Sauce Science has stretch goals and rewards planned. However, we prefer to keep these plans under wraps until we get close to achieving them. Muhahahaha! ( <-- Mad scientist laugh) The first stretch goal is at $20k so get out the word and we'll let you in on the secret. Here's a hint, it is sauce related...Status Grow large quantities of peppers at Driftless Organics: Complete Locate commercial kitchen: Complete Design commercial-scale sauce process: Complete Sauce Science LLC registration and infrastructure: Complete Launch Kickstarter Campaign: Complete Harvest peppers: In process Acquire commercial scale equipment: Oct 2015 Food manager and handler training and certification: Oct 2015 Inspection and licensing with govt agencies: Oct-Nov 2015 Make and ship massive quantities of sauce: Nov 2015 Kickstarter rewards completely fulfilled: Nov-Dec 2015

273`If you love coffee as much as we do, we're sure you would LOVE to be able to drink it anytime anywhere. And so would we! That is why we decided to make a coffee mug that is practical and sustainable, but is also a fashion accessory and tells the primeval story of coffee. Its most obvious feature is definitely its shape which resembles the goat s horns but it also helps you drink that last sip of your coffee and makes you look good. We designed a special holder with leather touch which simply turns into a coffee mug stand so you can easily keep the Goat mug on your desk. Also, Goat mug comes with a set of two straps (short and longer part combine in to one), so you can simply attach it to your bag or just let it fall across your shoulder. This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around. Goat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE. Since you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand. Here's a look inside the Goat mug. It's shape makes it simple to clean. We designed a beautiful packaging to deliver your Goat mug in style. It can then become a perfect storage place for your fresh coffee beans. We would love for more coffee lovers to learn the real story about coffee as much as we would love all of them to be stylish and eco-friendly while drinking their coffee wherever and whenever. That is why we would appreciate you backing our project. Surely, there will be more coffees enjoyed if we manage to make our dream come true.Help us share our project among other coffee lover out there Awards structure: The first stretch goal is an idea we got from our backer Tamara. If we manage to raise $60,000 we will offer everyone a new colour option of the Goat mug - the PANTONE COLOUR OF THE YEAR: MARSALA. Let's do it! The second stretch goal is out! If we manage to raise $250,000 we will offer a new reward: HEMP EDITION Goat mug - for all those on the relaxed side of fashion. Never. Enough. Coffee. You asked for big, we're giving you GRANDE. Third streth goal is set to $350,000! Can we do this together? If all goes according to our plans, we will be shipping out products already in second half of February. Let's do this together! Design of the GOAT STORY Coffee mug was done by design studio Desnahemisfera in cooperation with MyEqua.
274`Follow us on Facebook, Twitter & InstagramDigital music is transforming our lives! The advent of smart devices, music streaming services and digital music files has made it more convenient to access limitless library of music everywhere we go.Left behind in this transformation are the traditional Hi-Fi sound systems, legacy stereo receivers and music docks that can be found in virtually every home.Even though the traditional audio systems deliver far superior sound quality, they don t allow access to the full range of music streaming options. Well not anymore!!! auris bluMe has been designed to transform your audio experience, seamlessly blending your current digital music technology with your classic audio equipment. It's a true high fidelity Bluetooth music receiver that streams high quality audio wirelessly from any Bluetooth enabled smartphone, computer or tablet to any music system or powered speakers. bluMe allows you to enjoy all of your high definition digital music with all the clarity, crispness and full emotional impact your legacy Hi-Fi audio system can deliver.It's a super high fidelity component that brings out the full sound quality potential that is hidden inside the Bluetooth protocol. With a reputation for poor sound quality and limited operating range, why would we chose Bluetooth over various other wireless audio options such as Airplay, Sonos, etc.? The answer is access and compatibility. Every modern smartphone, tablet and laptop comes Bluetooth equipped, providing instant compatibility for all. It doesn t need additional drivers, software, apps, or to be within the range of a wireless router. Bluetooth is a familiar technology to everyone and its ease of use and convenience is proven by the surging popularity of portable Bluetooth speakers today. bluMe is more than a Bluetooth music receiver; it s also a Digital to Analog Converter (DAC). Digital tracks are simple sequences of code. To turn this code into a signal that speakers can recognize, you need digital-to-analogue converters (DACs for short). Poor quality DACs can lose detail in the conversion process. We tested countless DACs over many months and in the end decided to work with the world-renowned 'Miracle DAC' AK4396 by AKM, a top of the line high fidelity DAC usually found only in top shelf audiophile home audio and home theater systems.It s a true 192kHz 24-bit upsampling DAC sporting a high SNR of 120dB and is well regarded for its impressive low noise and low distortion characteristics. in short, this means that the sound you hear is crystal clear, rich and retains a wonderfully full dynamic range. bluMe applies the latest in Bluetooth technology, the Bluetooth 4.1 to stream any format of music from your smart device, laptop or PC.Most devices use the basic SBC Bluetooth music codec. While this may be okay for some, but if you want great quality, it's simply not good enough. bluMe uses Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) and aptX , a superior performance digital audio codec. This combination of advanced hardware and firmware preserves all the musical detail, dynamic range and full bandwidth response, bringing out the best possible sound from your digital sources, for a sound that is far superior to standard Bluetooth streamed music. The delay between your TV and speakers is a common problem within many wireless audio solutions. With bluMe, enjoy great movies knowing that picture and sound will always sync perfectly. bluMe features the latest aptX Low Latency technology that reduces this latency down to less than 40 ms, eliminating lip-sync issues to give you the smoothest audio/visual experience available. Limited range and signal dropouts have traditionally plagued Bluetooth audio systems. To combat this issue, bluMe employs special circuitry and a precision-tuned external high gain antenna to extend the wireless range, ensuring consistent, stable, strong, and glitch-free performance for 30 meters (100 feet), providing much more versatility than other Bluetooth receivers. bluMe's cutting edge technology maintains a robust and balanced wireless sound experience that is unaffected by interference from surrounding wireless networks. This results in superior 24-bit, upsampled audio that will completely redefine your perception of wireless sound. bluMe has two high quality gold-plated RCA jacks that operate as analog outputs. Any audio system with a standard analog audio input can connect to bluMe with the supplied RCA-RCA signal cable. For systems that have 3.5mm mini jack input, use the supplied RCA-mini cable.bluMe also features a Digital Optical (SPIDF) Out so that you can connect to an outboard DAC or the digital input of a surround receiver, giving you a 100% pure high-res digital signal through to your sound system. Pairing any smart device to bluMe is a breeze. Simply push the control button on the front of the unit briefly and it automatically goes into pairing mode. Activate Bluetooth in your smart device, select "auris bluMe" from the list of available devices and you re ready to rock! bluMe can connect to one smart device at a time, but is capable of remembering up to 8 devices. When more than one device needs to stream through bluMe, just turn Bluetooth off in the first device, turn Bluetooth on in the second, and select "auris bluMe" as the device. There is no need to reset bluMe and press its control button a second time once the device is stored. Even powering bluMe is easy. Draw power from a wall socket, or from the included USB cable, which means you can power it directly from your PC, Laptop, and more recent TVs and sound systems. Result of an elaborate manufacturing process, the chassis is extruded out of aerospace grade aluminum and high quality anodizing provides optimum protection and finish. bluMe is a premium product in every sense which completely blends while sitting next to even the costliest and most attractive home audio components. Vast majority of us tend to hard wire our smart devices to an audio system by either using a dock that pulls analog out of the device or by hooking up to the headphone output jack. In both cases the digital signal is processed by cheap low fidelity DAC used in all smart devices. With bluMe the digital signal is processed by its high-end DAC and audio decoders. No wonder bluMe sounds better than wired hookups! bluMe can play any audio source a Bluetooth enabled device can access, opening up a virtually unlimited universe of music to enjoy through your Hi-Fi audio system. So you re always in control not just of the music that s stored on your device but also access music streaming services such as Pandora and Spotify, internet radio stations, podcasts and even music libraries connected to a wireless home network...all instantly, wirelessly in Hi-Fi quality. With a choice of either Black, Gold or Silver you re sure to find a bluMe that matches your stereo system. bluMe ships with a specially designed drawstring microfiber bag. You can now put bluMe in it's little microfiber bag, stick it in your coat pocket and take it with you anywhere there is power, a stereo amp or powered speakers and a Bluetooth device to provide the music. Made out of high quality microfiber, this pouch will protect bluMe from dust, scratches and is the perfect fabric for eliminating pesky fingerprints. With every Auris product, you receive our 1-year Limited Warranty. For more details, see the warranty section of our website. At Auris, our philosophy is about empowering our innovative creative streak to enhance user experience.

275`I m Axelle, the founder and creator of Tulipe Noire Watches for Women. Tulipe Noire is a rare deep purple tulip, and is my inspiration for a unique women s watch collection that s mechanical, limited, and always sprinkled with genuine diamonds. I m a watch designer and gemologist with a dream. While I have created many collections for famous brands and fashion houses, I ve always wanted to design a collection, truly feminine, that doesn t look like a copy, a piece of dainty jewelry doubling as a watch, or a takedown of a men s timepiece. With Tulipe Noire, I created every piece in the collection to ensure each detail was exactly what I wanted in a watch. I have completed all my design work. I have reviewed the samples, and paid for them. All models are set for production with trusted and proven factories who are ready to begin producing. Thanks to your support in achieving the funding goal, the first production run of Tulipe Noire watches for women has started.

So please visit our Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and web pages. Please share and tag us @tulipenoire.co, #tulipenoire on your social media platforms with your friends and family and tell them what we are trying to do with Tulipe Noire.

I am only one person hoping to make a difference by creating a brand that thinks about women s tastes, differently. But, at the end of the day, our backers are our most valuable intangible asset, as only they will bring this dream to life. I m doing this because I passionately believe that in creating Tulipe Noire, we continue to think about everyone s needs and desires along the way. It s been a fun journey so far and I hope we can have some fun together along the way. Now, I ask you to join me in bringing this dream to life.
276`After several years of intensive research, design, development, engineering and testing, we ve been able to turn an idea into a fully working prototype that we are extremely excited about. Now we need your help to bring the world s first wireless, waterproof, lightweight, press-on, wearable, BIKE BRAKE LIGHT into a product that will save lives all over the world!Do you (or people you love) ride bicycles? Do they ride them in traffic? Do they ride them in groups? LucidBrake 2.0 will make everyone safer when they ride.LucidBrake story: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 LucidBrake 2.0 is a second-generation, one-of-a-kind, acceleration-sensing, wireless, brake light intended for bicyclists everywhere to be seen from farther away and to let others around them know if they are slowing down or stopping. Lucid Brake is a bike brake light that doesn't need to be wired to your bike! You can even attach LucidBrake to your helmet or to a back pack. The higher the light is on your person, the farther away it can be seen in traffic. Mount it Anywhere You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Watch (above) as all 3 brake lights attached to the bike and its rider go off simultaneously as he brakes.LucidBrake has a flat back, so you can mount it on your seat post, fender, jacket, backpack, flag, basket or helmet. We consulted with the experts at 3-M company and discovered their dual-lock fasteners as the ideal way to mount LuciudBrakes to all these surfaces. Dual lock is strong enough to hold siding to buildings in Minnesota weather - it will hold your LucidBrake where you choose to mount it! Not just for bikes, this can be mounted ANYWHERE you need a brake light.We include several pieces of the dual-lock fasteners so that if you need to borrow a brake light from your bike to keep something else safer in traffic, you can do that too.LucidBrake is Self-AdjustingLucidBrake's patent-pending algorithms allow self-adjusting to any mounting angle, so even if it is mounted at a slight angle, it will figure it out automatically. LucidBrake also readjusts instantly for most hills, bumps and rotations - which means you can mount it on something that turns from side to side - like your helmet - and it will still work great! LucidBrake is Waterproof Encased in a special optically clear conformal coating - to protect the parts and prevent corrosion, even without the snap-on cover. LucidBrake can even run under water. This super-tough coating is used for solar energy projects, to protect against ultraviolet light, intense heat, and intense cold. There is no "on/off" switch - LucidBrake senses if it is parked / in motion / braking / in your backpack or on a shelf. If at rest, or facing up or down, the circuitry stays in ultra-low-power "sleep" mode. But wait... there is so much more! No other brake light has this next feature... but we think they all should!Two-speed brakingEveryone knows there is a difference between putting on your brakes and slamming on your brakes. LucidBrake has been designed to indicate these two quite different deceleration events. It will flash and then stay on for several seconds if you drastically reduce speed or stop suddenly. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Four Beacon ModesLucidBrake doubles as an awareness beacon. During night time road tests, LucidBrake s eight super bright LEDs could be seen flashing over half a mile away. There are 4 different beacon modes to choose from. You choose which one you want by mounting the LucidBrake at a 0, 90, 180, or 270 degree angle. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Brake light/deceleration light what s the difference? Well, quite a bit. Most people are used to brake lights only coming on when they press a pedal or squeeze a handle, but LucidBrake is different. It is smart enough to know you are slowing down or stopping without it having to be wired up to anything. It senses inertial (motion) changes, then flashes brightly if it senses deceleration. Low Total Mass We thought "way outside the box" during the design of LucidBrake. Avid bikers insisted on low total mass, so instead of encasing the board in a plastic case, subject to water retention, internal fogging, and other problems, we encased the board in a special optically clear conformal coating at the suggestion of engineers at Dow Corning. This super-tough coating is used for solar energy projects, where long term exposure to ultraviolet light, intense heat, and intense cold can take their toll. LucidBrake is very light weight. Testing and calculations on the new prototype show the batteries should now last more than a year with normal use. This Kickstarter Project is intended to pay for the injection mold for the first production run of Lucid Brake covers, and to make at least 150 of the new and improved LucidBrakes to begin selling to fund the next production run. Plastic cover mold and 500 covers made: The plastic cover has been designed and 3D versions prove they work beautifully. We have already lined up bids from 5 companies to make the mold and get us a run of the first 500 covers. Current customers will be updated with these optional covers right away, and they'll ship with all of the new version LucidBrakes. The following video shows one of our prototype 3D-printed snap-on covers. Note that the real covers will be clear with frosted interior, rather than the translucent but almost opaque white shown here. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Small Production Run: After the mold creation and pressing of the 500 covers, we will apply remaining proceeds towards a production run of new LucidBrakes. At least 150 are projected to be made, but we will make as many as we can with the funds available, and use the proceeds from these sales to bootstrap the next production run. LucidBrakes only use 2 AAA batteries to work. The new cover gives it a cool geodesic dome look. Our History: Our first production run was accomplished in 2013. We made 250 LucidBrakes - we used these customers as our focus group and upgraded both the hardware and the software for this next version of the LucidBrake. Big Improvements for LucidBrake 2.0: Better power management. We swapped out the power circuit used in the last LucidBrake because it didn't last the year in the garage that we promised. We've tested this prototype and it has great battery life. Instant turn-on, turn-off by changing the position of the unit. If you take the LucidBrake off your bike and put it in your backpack or purse or up on the shelf it will turn off. Just knowing that it is being stored in a 'flat' or 'primarily horizontal' position will automatically turn it off. We still have the 4-different beacon modes, but they align to the laws in the EU better than they did before. Support the LucidBrake project and BE MORE VISIBLE on the road! The LucidBrake team is still together and going strong. Let's meet the inventor and his wife! John and EJ Craig have been a successful husband and wife team now for 8 years. Perks: Our version 2.0 LucidBrake will be made with the proceeds of a successful campaign and should be available for shipping in early June of 2015. We have 25 for the early birds only, at a special price. LucidBrake version 2.0 with cover Another fun perk is the personalized cyclist's water bottle. "KEEP CALM and CYCLE ON" for $25. We will print your name (or whatever you choose) on the back of this fun water bottle! We have some great media coverage: Thank you! Please share this project on social media and with any friends you know who are cyclists! Thank you again!

It s a punch in the gut and a kick in the ass, an incitement to pay attention and to be astonished, and then to get up and act out. World War 3 is an invitation to a revolution. Bill Ayers, activist, educator, co-founder of the Weather Underground and author of Public Enemy: Confessions of an American Dissident, from his introduction. "World War 3 has been at the barricades for decades. There is no better place to see how drawings and politics can mesh effectively than in this gigantic and fabulous collection. Joe Sacco World War 3 Illustrated 1979 2014: 35 Years, 52 Artists, 1 Anthology Founded in 1979 by Seth Tobocman and Peter Kuper, World War 3 Illustrated magazine is a labor of love run by a collective of artists (both first-timers and established professionals) and political activists working with the unified goal of creating a home for political comics, graphics, and stirring personal stories. The confrontational comics published in WW3 Illustrated shine a little reality on the fantasy world of the American kleptocracy and have inspired the developing popularity and recognition of comics as a respected art form. With PM Press, we re publishing a full-color retrospective exhibition of the magazine that s arranged thematically, including housing rights, feminism, environmental issues, religion, police brutality, globalization, and depictions of conflicts from the Middle East to the Midwest. World War 3 Illustrated isn t about a war that may happen; it s about the ongoing wars being waged around the world and on our very own doorsteps. World War 3 Illustrated also illuminates the war we wage on each other and sometimes the one taking place in our own minds. World War 3 artists have been covering the topics that matter for over three decades, and they re just getting warmed up!Back cover: Who is World War 3 Illustrated (WW3): We are a volunteer-run magazine of comics that deals with both huge world issues and intimate personal concerns. The magazine has always been supported by sales to loyal readers and WW3 has never done a fundraiser... until now. Contributors to WW3 include Sue Coe, Eric Drooker, Fly, Sandy Jimenez, Sabrina Jones, Peter Kuper, Mac McGill, Kevin Pyle, Spain Rodriguez, James Romberger, Nicole Schulman, Chuck Sperry, Art Spiegelman, Seth Tobocman, Tom Tomorrow, Susan Willmarth, Carlo Quispe, Isabella Bannerman, Jordan Worley, Mirko Illic, Mike Diana, Scott Cunningham, Ward Sutton, Paula Hewitt Amram, Peter Bagge, Hilary Allison, Rebecca Migdal, Ethan Heitner, Anton Van Dalen, and dozens more. Founded in 1979, we were one of the first American magazines (along with Raw, American Splendor, and Picture Story Magazine) to treat comics as a medium for serious social commentary and journalism. Over the past 35 years, WW3 has covered the important domestic and international issues and events of our time. For more information, go HERE. WW3 magazine has also been the launching pad for the careers of many cartoonists who are now well known, like Eric Drooker, Peter Bagge, Ted Rall, Sabrina Jones, Peter Kuper, Seth Tobocman, and Kevin Pyle. Please click here to learn more about PM Press, World War 3 Illustrated, and the editors of the anthology Peter Kuper and Seth Tobocman. Why we need your support: Now, with PM Press, we re putting together a hardcover, 320-page, full-color anthology with some of the best pieces from the last 35 years.Here's your chance to help make it all happen!We're asking readers to stake a claim in its publication now. Why? Everyone knows that the publishing industry is going through hard times. PM Press is a small publisher, founded by people with years of experience in the alternative press. They are taking the courageous step and risk of publishing the WW3 anthology as a gorgeous hardcover, full-color, 320-page book. Buying the book in advance or offering support through other pledges will help PM Press with the enormous printing and freight bills as well as ensure the book is widely distributed and publicized through every available channel.Right now, all of the artwork has been prepped and all that is needed is to raise the money and the presses will roll. Making sure that all of this succeeds is a dedicated team that combines the experience at PM with the World War 3 editorial board, who have been publishing North America s foremost political comics magazine for 35 years.What people are saying about World War 3 Illustrated: World War 3 Illustrated is the real thing. . . . As always it mixes newcomers and veterans, emphasizes content over style (but has plenty of style), keeps that content accessible and critical, and pays its printers and distributors but no one else. If it had nothing more than that kind of dedication to recommend it, it would be invaluable. But it has much, much more." New York Times This is art not marketing on the newsstand. It represents the sort of creativity too rarely given an outlet in comics. It s the best and longest running alternative comics anthology around." Comics Journal REWARDS AND PRIZES! Now's your chance to get a copy of the anthology, as well as striking, original, and iconic pieces of art from WW3 contributors including Peter Kuper, Seth Tobocman, Isabella Bannerman, Sabrina Jones, Kevin Pyle, Paula Hewitt Amram, Eric Drooker, Nicole Schulman, Rebecca Migdal, Hilary Allison, Jordan Worley, Scott Cunningham, and Tom Keough.

278`Mighty Mug Barware - The Only Barware That Won't Fall Over How many times have you been relaxing with a drink when, suddenly, you accidentally knock it over? It s even worse when the spill is red wine on your carpet, craft brew on the laptop, or scotch on your pants.Well, we put a stop to the madness. Move aside old-fashioned drinkware! The everyday worry of knocking a glass over became tiring, so we created a revolutionary solution to this universal problem: Mighty Mug Barware - the only barware that grips when knocked into.Able to withstand knocks from 360 degrees, Mighty Mug Barware will not topple over if bumped into, but will lift up naturally when you go in for a sip. That means: say goodbye to murder scene looking wine stains, fried laptops, and embarrassing wardrobe malfunctions. SmartGrip Technology - Some Next Level IshThe Mighty Mug Barware collection grips to any smooth and solid surface such as your table, desk, counter, or bar.Sorcery? Trick of the eye? No, the magic is in our patented Smartgrip technology. Not to be confused with a magnet or suction cup, the Smartgrip at the bottom of the cup creates a vacuum that locks the mug onto the surface - effectively preventing it from being knocked over. The vacuum is released instantly when the mug is lifted straight up (requiring no extra effort). Specs These new glasses are made out of crystal clear, BPA Free Tritan plastic giving them enhanced clarity and making the Mighty Mug Barware an unbreakable collection. Plus, all of the cups in this line are top rack dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Each piece is uniquely designed to withstand toppling, while still holding the perfect amount of your beverage: RewardsWhether you're getting Mighty Mug for yourself, gifting it to friends and family, buying it for your staff, or thanking your wedding guests with this as a parting gift - we have the perfect reward for you. All Kickstarter Rewards will ship before the items hit any retail outlets.Born to Be Mighty. Born to Be Gifted. Mighty Mug Barware is the gift that will get your whole neighborhood talking. It arrives at your door ready to be gifted, so just wrap it up or throw it in a party bag and call it a day! Mighty Mug on A BoatIn order to test Mighty Mug Barware, we took it out on the high seas, along with our original models for some high seas adventure. While we shattered a few beer bottles, Mighty Mug hung in for the adventure! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Return to Kickstarter Since the successful launch of our travel mug last year, Mighty Mug has been featured in hundreds of publications around the world such as the New York Times, Core 77, Real Simple, The Verge and hundreds of other media outlets. After receiving press from around the world, many asked us for a Mighty Mug specially made to enjoy their adult beverages. So, we went to work and began designing a variety of glasses that will be able to hold any drink you choose. This new campaign is to drive the project s finishing stage, so it can be delivered straight to your favorite bottle.Help us by sharing Mighty Mug with your friends! Faster + Better + Stronger = Mighty While our first campaign was a great success, we learned many important lessons that will help make this campaign run much more smoothly for backers. #1 International Shipping: For our first campaign, we shipped all packages via USPS (United States Postal Service). While this worked out well for US & Canada Backers, it was not optimal for International Backers (as it took their package 6 or more weeks to arrive). Resolution: This year all International Backers will have their rewards shipped via an expedited manner and rewards will arrive in 7-10 of leaving our office. #2 Tracking Information: Another lesson we learned during our first campaign was that by shipping International packages by the USPS' least expensive option, backers were unable to track their packages from start to finish. Resolution: This year, all International Backers will have their rewards shipped with tracking information that will update them up until the package reaches their door. #3 Updates/ Customer Service: During our first campaign we were not ready for the interest level Mighty Mug received. Thus, we were not ready for the amount of inquiries that came in. Resolution: This year, we have added Customer Happiness members to our team. All questions/inquiries during this campaign will be answered in 24 hours or less.#4 Quality Improvement and Happiness Guarantee :With each new model, we have advanced the technology and improved the quality of all Mighty Mugs. We are confident that you will absolutely love your Mighty Mug, but if you re not 100% happy, we will replace it for you at any time.Saving the World One Mug At a Time Team Mighty We are a team of mechanical engineers and industrial designers that are dedicated to saving people from disastrous spills. So, we designed mugs that will not fall over when knocked into. We spent 4 years developing and perfecting Mighty Mug and its patented Smartgrip technology. We hope that you love Mighty Mug and that all of your days to come are spill free.Praise From Our First Mighty Mug Launch International BackersWe can ship Mighty Mug worldwide, with the exceptions of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. Please note that you may be responsible for duties, fees, and taxes applicable to your region. For The Tech Savvy Mighty Mug's innovative Smartgrip technology uses basic principles of physics by trapping air underneath its base when placed down. This unbelievably strong hold is possible because air cannot be stretched when the mug is pushed.The real magic is experienced when the mug is lifted straight up. The air pressure is equalized instantly allowing the user to naturally lift the mug just as you would any other mug. At only half an inch in height, the Smartgrip puck that powers Mighty Mug is able to withstand between 5-10 lbs of force. Try that on your old drinkware! Need help? We're here for you.If you have questions at any time, during or after the campaign, you can always reach us at getmighty@themightymug.com Retailer/Distributor InquiryAre you are a retailer or distributor interested in selling Mighty Mug?

279`Purchase the Smart Letters on www.marbotic.fr Have you noticed that kids love to play with tablets? We have! So we designed an awesome educative tool that combines apps and wooden toys to help them prepare to learn to read and write. For kids aged 3-7. AlphamonsterWho has eaten all the letters? This app lets children explore the letters, the sound they make and their shapes with the fearful, letter-eating Monstromachine. This app was inspired by cognitive studies stating that the association between letters and phonics is the key to reading. VocabubbleDid you know that the extent of a kid's vocabulary can predict the speed he or she will learn to read? In our Vocabubble app, kids discover hundreds of words in a quirky and fun universe. Each letter of the alphabet pops out to disclose gorgeous old engravings, poetically animated. The illustrated word is then read out loud. My words (available in January 2016) Ok! So...What do you do with letters now? You write words of course! Kids stamp letters and hear the words being read out loud. You can even make out your own bizarre words like "pliz suppoart uz". These 3 beautiful iPads apps can be downloaded for free with the wooden toy. Should we let kids use tablets? Our educative values : Veronique teaches 3-year-olds in her classroom in Paris and she tested our prototype of Smart Letters. Here is what she has to say about it : From 3 years old, this smart toy will help your child as they learn to read and write This alphabet is made of wood, conductive plastic and metal, and it respects US and Europe children toys regulations No battery, wifi or bluetooth needed, it works with the static electricity of your body Is your device compatible? The Smart Letters are compatible with all iPad generations, excluding first generation iPads The letters and the apps can also be played with independently. You can use the letters as shape toys on a piece of paper Smart letters and the related apps are available in 5 languages

Also featured in: AMPY: Your movement is your power AMPY captures your kinetic energy when you move and stores it, so you can recharge your smartphone when you need it the most. AMPY charges iPhones, Android phones, and any other USB-powered device. Walk, run, or cycle... The more you move, the more battery life you get. AMPY stores the energy you generate in the internal lithium ion battery. Simply plug in your smartphone or wearable device into the USB port to start charging. In a hurry? We engineered AMPY to charge your devices just as fast as a wall outlet. AMPY's internal battery stores about a week's worth of physical activity and stays ready to use for months. You can also recharge AMPY from a wall outlet if needed using the micro-USB port on top. Move the way you want. Charge whenever you want.AMPY fits right into your lifestyle. Our accessory kit enables you to get creative with the way you move and capture more energy with AMPY. It comes with a sleeve, armband, and clip. The AMPY Backer ChallengeWe can't wait to see how you move with AMPY! To show you our commitment to living green and staying fit, here's our Backer Challenge: Personal Clean EnergyAMPY is one of the only ways for you to produce your own clean energy. When you charge with AMPY instead of from the wall, you're offsetting the carbon footprint of your devices using green energy that you generated! AMPY Smartphone App Want to know how much power you're generating?

In the future, AMPY will relay the information directly to your phone so you don't have to enter anything in!AMPY works without the app. Just wear AMPY and move. It will capture your energy and charge your electronics when you plug them in. Team & TechnologyIt started with a frustration we all have a dead smartphone at the worst time. AMPY's co-founders -- Tejas Shastry, Alex Smith, and Mike Geier -- met in an entrepreneurship class at Northwestern University during their engineering PhDs. As active urbanites, they wanted to capture the energy from our daily activities to charge their phones. They engineered a solution to do just that, creating the technology that powers AMPY (formerly known as myPowr).We see the technology behind AMPY being integrated directly into smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other devices yet to be invented, so you never have to plug them in. Traditional kinetic chargers capable of the same amount of energy generation as AMPY would need to be three times the size and weight. At the heart of AMPY are our proprietary inductors that transform your kinetic energy into usable power. We designed AMPY to be small and lightweight. Our patent-pending and proprietary inductor technology enables the device to generate significant power while remaining compact so it fits into your life.Bringing human power to life We have packed AMPY with lab-tested technology over the past year. Our team of engineers and designers crafted dozens of generations of prototypes before we got it right, including hours of product testing, hundreds of customer interactions, and dozens of 3D-printed models.Our product is validated and has won numerous awards, including the Clean Energy Trust Consumer Favorite Prize, the 1776 Global Challenge Cup Crowd Favorite, and the Energy Prize at the Northwestern University Venture Challenge. AMPY Co-founders Alex Smith, Mike Geier, and Tejas Shastry, winning the NU Venture Competition. (AMPY was formerly myPowr) AMPY is ready to launchWe recently won the Proto Labs Cool Idea! Award! The award will assist us in the tooling costs and production costs of AMPY's casing. Our campaign is Dragon Certified, ensuring we have an achievable manufacturing plan.

281`Our next goal: $20K!Your bonus reward? Each backer (existing and new) of $15 or more will receive one extra FREE pack of our snacks!Spread the KOOEE! Love! The search for the perfect natural, high-protein snack started with our deep-rooted Aussie love for the outdoors. From swinging kettle-bells to running ultra-marathons, we needed a healthier snack to fuel our active lifestyles both on the trail and at our desks. Frustrated that most high-protein snacks were highly processed and full of sugar, we decided to create our own, using only the highest quality ingredients. The result? A delicious range of all-natural Jerky Trail Mix. Each pack includes a wholesome blend of 100% grass-fed beef jerky, naturally dried fruit, raw nuts and seeds, and nutrient rich superfoods. Colleagues soon discovered me grazing on my Jerky Trail Mix at my desk. Craving something both tastier and more nutritious than what was conveniently available, they begged me to make Super Snacks for them too, and before long, our weekends were spent fulfilling orders in our tiny home kitchen.A twist of fate allowed us to take this one step further when we moved to the US. After a tremendous amount of encouragement from our new American friends, I decided to turn down the corporate gig, switch the suit for an apron, and launch KOOEE!.We now live in San Francisco, and our equally passionate friends Pika, Jamie and Andy have become Jerkypreneurs too and joined the KOOEE! team. Through the help (and taste buds) of countless friends, we re now proud to finally share KOOEE! with you! Our range of Jerky Trail Mix is the ultimate NATURAL snack to fuel your next adventure. Ideal for health-conscious, active people, our snacks are made using only PREMIUM, ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS, and nothing else. First and foremost, they are DELICIOUS, but our snacks have some other pretty cool features too: We spent months developing our world-first (patent pending) RIP>PEEL>MIX POUCH, which makes this easy. With jerky in one compartment and trail mix in the other, all you need to do is rip open the bag and the dividing seal peels away, allowing you to eat the snack all mixed together. This maintains freshness, maximizes flavor and prevents sticky fingers. We are initially offering two great-tasting flavors, Lime Pepper with Mango and Smoked Chipotle with Apple. Our Lime Pepper with Mango Jerky Trail Mix has become a favorite among friends. Our jerky is seasoned with cracked pepper and infused with fresh lime juice, a taste that intensifies with every bite. This is combined with naturally sweet dried mango (no added sugar or sulfates), a blend of crunchy nuts and seeds, and a pinch of dried goji berries. Our Smoked Chipotle with Apple offers a smoky yet subtle heat just enough to warm up your tastebuds on a mountaintop. Each bag has a healthy blend of smoky, chipotle inspired beef jerky, naturally dried apple slices, raw nuts and seeds, and a sprinkle of antioxidant-rich cacao nibs. Our search for a truly amazing source of the finest 100% grass-fed beef led us to the beautiful island state of Tasmania, Australia. Tasmania is scientifically regarded as a global benchmark for pure air and clean rainwater (yes, really!). The farmers we work with are proud to sustainably raise 100% grass-fed beef in the lush, year-round pastures of such a pristine environment. Why the hassle with using grass-fed beef? Aside from being more sustainable and ethical, it is also healthier for you too. When compared to regular, grain-fed beef, grass-fed beef contains up to five times as much Omega-3 fatty acid, and is loaded with more CLA, Vitamins A and E and micronutrients. Additionally, all our beef is non-GMO and will never have added hormones or antibiotics. Each individual pack of KOOEE! is stamped with a code that allows you to trace the beef inside all the way back to the Tasmanian farm where it was raised pack to farm. The unique code allows you to find out the exact location of the farm, discover the farmers, and learn about the type of cattle that they raise. All you have to do is enter it into our website and click Trace . Over the past two years we ve tested our snacks with hundreds of people from all walks of life. The conclusion? People love it. Here's what they actually said: So when can I start buying these? I want to eat one pretty much every-time I go surf I m hooked! Emily S, surfer, CA. Love the jerky!!! Neil M, former Army Ranger, MD. It is awesome... I opened it thinking I would just have a taste this afternoon and now it is all gone! Mark G, ultra-marathon runner, Australia Bottom Line: I thought it was great. Ben B, CrossFitter, WA This pre-sale through Kickstarter is the first time that we ll be offering our KOOEE! Jerky Trail Mix for sale to the public. At each reward level (except for our KOOEE! Kit $30 reward), we are offering you snack-size 2.15oz pack(s) of KOOEE! shipped straight to your door. Thanks for your support! We genuinely appreciate it. We re also offering some beautifully designed, custom merchandise to take with you on your adventure. We re offering a unique seamless bandana that has been custom-designed by our team.

We are also offering our Hats/Visors for our limited early bird Double Case offer ($95 only 80 available) and for all rewards over $200. We re ready to hit the ground running! Our products are USDA approved. We have a great team behind us. We have a manufacturer in California and all the supplier relationships we need. Our packaging is complete and ready to be printed and shipped. We ve been able to bootstrap this dream so far, but only with your help will we be able to bring our unique product to you guys, our fans! Your support will help finance our first ever commercial production run. Backing our project will also allow us to bring to market our next delicious flavor, Chili Cherry with Berries, which has already been USDA approved. Most importantly, however, by backing our Kickstarter you will receive the VERY FIRST PACKS of our snacks. We ve been burning midnight oil to prepare our operations for our first production run, and with your help we can finally make it there. Originally, "KOO-EE!" was a call made by Indigenous Australians to communicate across vast distances. Today, the call of "KOO-EE!" is used by adventurers to express their awe on a breathtaking mountaintop, or reveal the wild exhilaration of running deep into the woods. It's this raw energy of the outdoors that first inspired us, and is what we want to share with you in every pack of our snacks. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 KOOEE! was founded in 2013 by a group of friends with a genuine passion for healthy eating and the outdoors. We re in San Francisco, California, Boulder, Colorado and Launceston, Tasmania. We love making new friends, so please hit us up if you are around! Do you ship overseas? While we are focusing our project primarily in the US and Canada, we may be able to ship overseas to certain countries on a case by case basis. Hit us up with an email and we will determine if we can get KOOEE! to you. Please note that we are unable to export our Jerky Trail Mix to Australia and New Zealand due to customs restrictions. However, we'd still love your support, so help us get off the ground by purchasing some awesome KOOEE! Kit instead and we'll ship it straight to you!
282`If you love coffee as much as we do, we're sure you would LOVE to be able to drink it anytime anywhere. And so would we! That is why we decided to make a coffee mug that is practical and sustainable, but is also a fashion accessory and tells the primeval story of coffee. Its most obvious feature is definitely its shape which resembles the goat s horns but it also helps you drink that last sip of your coffee and makes you look good. We designed a special holder with leather touch which simply turns into a coffee mug stand so you can easily keep the Goat mug on your desk. Also, Goat mug comes with a set of two straps (short and longer part combine in to one), so you can simply attach it to your bag or just let it fall across your shoulder. This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around. Goat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE. Since you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand. Here's a look inside the Goat mug. It's shape makes it simple to clean. We designed a beautiful packaging to deliver your Goat mug in style. It can then become a perfect storage place for your fresh coffee beans. We would love for more coffee lovers to learn the real story about coffee as much as we would love all of them to be stylish and eco-friendly while drinking their coffee wherever and whenever. That is why we would appreciate you backing our project. Surely, there will be more coffees enjoyed if we manage to make our dream come true.Help us share our project among other coffee lover out there Awards structure: The first stretch goal is an idea we got from our backer Tamara. If we manage to raise $60,000 we will offer everyone a new colour option of the Goat mug - the PANTONE COLOUR OF THE YEAR: MARSALA. Let's do it! The second stretch goal is out! If we manage to raise $250,000 we will offer a new reward: HEMP EDITION Goat mug - for all those on the relaxed side of fashion. Never. Enough. Coffee. You asked for big, we're giving you GRANDE. Third streth goal is set to $350,000! Can we do this together? If all goes according to our plans, we will be shipping out products already in second half of February. Let's do this together! Design of the GOAT STORY Coffee mug was done by design studio Desnahemisfera in cooperation with MyEqua.
283`Thank you for making Runbell a smashing success! We are so excited to have received such fantastic support and to be taking Runbell to the next level. If you missed out on joining our Kickstarter campaign as a backer, please visit run-bell.com. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Our objective was simple: design a bell for urban runners that is extraordinarily easy to use, light-weight, AND that has some major style. We have a design to fit a range of hand sizes and has the quality of fine jewelry. Qualities Runbell is a compact yet powerful bell. Brass bells create the most beautiful sound. Simple. We made no shortcuts in this design. Most bells on the market are made from aluminium, which is cheaper. Would a musician opt for an aluminium instrument over brass? Of course not and neither do we. No other material can match brass for its quality of sound. Adjustability is key when not everyone has the exact same size finger. We designed Runbell to be slightly oversized. With two pairs of silicone inserts, you can reduce the ring size to fit YOUR finger perfectly. On cold days, leave out the inserts and wear gloves.Mens sizes: Runbell ring 24 mm. With silicone inserts: 22 mm and 20 mm. ( is diameter)Women s sizes: Ring ring 21 mm. With silicone inserts: 19 mm ring and 17 mm ring. mm mm mm mm mm mm Designed to be extremely small and lightweight, the Runbell will be a seamless addition to your running attire. A Runbell weighs in at about 1 ounce / 30 grams. g The striker for Runbell is designed to activate from any angle as well as to provide some accentuation. Want a loud sound, pull the striker straight back from the bell. Want a quick sound, then pull the striker any angle you can. Ten percent of women and six percent of men might be allergic to nickel. Rest assured. By using quality metal that contains zero nickel and lead, we cater to all runners.The grip is aluminium and the bell is brass. Finish, where needed, is brass electroplating. The soft inserts are made of silicone. Features The design concept for Runbell is jewelry. Our aim was to not just to create a functional running bell, but to create a stylish fashion accessory that looks good on the track as well as anywhere else. Pedestrians might be surprised to hear a runner with a Runbell, but they will be thankful. Startled walkers commonly complain about runners overtaking them in surprise. Men and ladies generally have different finger sizes so we have two types of Runbells: one for men and one for ladies. mm mm mm mm mm mm With the quality of craftsmanship that you expect from Japanese products, you can be assured that every detail is considered. We have spent significant time modelling each piece in 3D, and then 3D printing numerous concepts to gauge their feel and ease of use. Our manufacturing partner, who we can see from our apartment balcony, is known for their high quality bells, both in the US and Japan. MADE IN JAPAN RewardsAll rewards come with worldwide shipping. Who We AreKevin Nadolny and Tomoko Yano are the founders of Runbell and are husband and wife. Kevin has been running since the 2011 tsunami in East Japan. Running home from work in Tokyo can be frustrating due the number of pedestrians and bicycles sharing the streets. The Runbell concept was born as a bicycle bell and slowly formed into the sleek stylish design you see on this page. Km Kevin is a structural designer and will oversee production. Tomoko oversees design and style as well as marketing in Japan. KICKSTARTER Mr. Shimizu and Mr. Goto from Oghi Kogyo will be in charge of assembling our bells and advising our production. CRANE BELL MADE IN JAPAN Production PlanFor production, we need the following:1. For the silicone inserts, we will use an injection mould.2. The grip will be made using an aluminium die casting. One mould will have two cavities: one for the men's Runbell and one for the ladies' Runbell.3. The bell will be stamped and require a new mould to match our desired shape.4. The screws are steel with brass electroplating.5. The spring is a standard stainless steel spring.6. The strikers will be CNC machined in brass.With your support, we can cover these moulding and tooling costs and meet minimum order requirements. 200 CNC Schedule:2014.05 Kickstarter! 2014.06 Tooling and Production of moulds 2014.07 Receiving samples of Runbell components 2014.08 Assembly of Runbells 2014.09 Shipment of Runbells
284`We are Candylab a proudly crowdsourced company, born three years ago right here on Kickstarter. And now we're back with some even better stuff: we ve got three new cars, modernist building blocks to create an entire universe, and to top it all off, this campaign will help launch Candylab s very own manufacturing facility, right here in the US. We are clearly in love with cars. The land boat, the muscle car, the boxy leaf spring truck, 60 s kind. Here are the the latest three straight from our lab, and may your imagination take you to wonderful places! They are inextricable from a certain way of life, and we want to capture all that in our toy car designs. We distill the visual cues we love into handcrafted wood cars, made from solid beech, painted with water-based paints and sporting silicone tires.7/26 Update: As a later addition via Update #@, we made our Green Camper available too. Aside from our love of cars, we are also perennially enthralled by the entire spirit and pioneering design movement happening in the 60 s in the US: the modernist movement, the desert midcentury architecture and the industrial design renaissance of the post-war years. So let s hit the gas! This is our wood block set entry kit with an innovative rubber connector to keep what you build in one piece. The clever geometry allows for endless expansion and configurations. This kit will be made in USA with Uncle Goose s help. (if you have not heard of them yet you ve been missing out) So we finally did what we ve been burning to do for a while: we started creating a universe. We designed, engineered and are ready to launch into production a new set of simple wood blocks that assemble into the boxy, streamlined architecture of that era, down to the pastel colors. Slap our new roof signs on and voila, you can morph that box into whatever your imagination creates. And because no road trip vibe is complete without an iconic giant arty motel sign, we are launching that too: a road sign that s 30ft tall! Kidding. It s only 8 , but at scale compared to a real 1965 2-door hauler, that is about the height it would reach. The Lone Cactus sign is the first in this lineup. Made from elm wood, base weighted, with safe water based paints and silicone rubber lettering. No corners have been harmed or cut - in the making of this sign. That was the quick lowdown now let s cruise for a bit. Keep scrolling there is more to the story after this. If you ve been keeping up with the tribulations from our beginnings three years ago (totally fine if you didn t - our internet fame was less than that of a moderately cute cat pic) you will remember that thanks to you, our backers here on Kickstarter, we entirely skipped the garage phase. Thanks to the strength in numbers you offered, we jumped right into contract manufacturing overseas. We now tightly control the process, orchestrating each separate supplier ourselves and we managed to create and manufacture a product that by toy standards was very difficult to make. And it sure is, as a look around commercial wooden toy offerings quickly shows. We had to quickly learn and juggle multiple issues, from international logistics, to woodworking and developing sales channels. But we always wanted to make these toys right here, close to home. So far we have failed to find a single US supplier that will make these for us while allowing a profit for themselves, us, and result in a sustainable cost to you, our early adopters and customers. Needless to say commercial success and a sensible retail price are essential to growing and sticking around as a company. Which brings us to the entire point of this campaign, aside from launching the awesome new products we just revealed. We intend to take the remaining proceeds from this campaign, after covering expenses for the rewards, manufacturing, and shipping, and invest in setting up a manufacturing outpost. We have three reasons for being optimistic about the success of this new venture: We found a perfect space a three-hour drive away from our Brooklyn base. This will solve the real estate part of the equation, one that was most vexing in fact. Our tests so far with retrofitted off the shelf miter saws, raspberry pi s, actuators and a bit custom software show that automation will allow us to make our toys profitably, while still being able to hit a reasonable retail price. We are now experts at making these having developed our unique tooling and jigs to make our special pieces. The most important aspect though is our Uncle*: Mr. Pete from Uncle Goose. He is living proof that this can work. The Uncle Goose approach demonstrates that not only can you deliver exceptional unwavering product quality and profitably run an American toy factory for a few decades but also achieve full independence and sustainability, from locally harvested lumber to hiring folks that live a short drive away. We re still far off from the Uncle Goose model, but we have to start somewhere. Today is just as good as any, help us start this factory! This is where we answer your burning but specific - questions about the products themselves. For campaign logistics, keep scrolling. What makes Our Sweet Rides As with previous and current designs, all are fully tested to comply with US, European, Australian and NZ safety requirements. We exceed those.All models use prime quality solid beech wood lumber imported from Germany, sometimes New Zealand. Our beech has no knots, is kiln dried, and is almost as workable and stable as a solid block of aluminum. Each car has precision engineered wheel pins for its independent axles 4 of them. High grade ABS plastic rims, and Silicone tires. Only the best stuff and it shows: our cars roll really fast and far. Rosewood Microveneer and Real Magnets The Pioneer is a special treat: It includes 3 powerful micromagnets, buried deep in the wood body they can never come out unless one purposefully cuts up the car. This allows a neat little trick: Tow a Camper and carry that canoe up top without losing it at highway speeds. We use Michigan-sourced microveneer from our awesome supplier; and it s Rosewood, less than 1mm thick. Quite a hi-tech feat. Rewards: If you re a Kickstarter veteran, just consult the rewards diagram below. If you re new to Kickstarter, also consult the rewards below - except that once you hit the green Pledge button you ll have to create an account. It s easy peasy. The rewards summary below does not include shipping - it will vary depending on your geographical location. FAQ s Please read them, especially if you live outside the US. In this particular case, we feel this is important enough to mention here: Customs, Import duties or any other local levies are to be covered by the recipient. Combining Rewards: If you'd like to pledge more than one item, please identify shipping costs for each, and 1) add it all up then 2) Type in the corresponding amount in the pledge field. Your entire total pledge will be reconfirmed once the campaign ends. Shipping: We know, it's really expensive for you international folks. We strictly charge what postage actually costs and pay for warehousing, shipping cartons, labeling and on from the general overhead remaining. That is what carriers charge these days. Combining Rewards Shipping costs: There are many possible combinations of the rewards, countries and shipping weights. We tried our best to offer a fair deal, but please read the FAQ detailing this aspect. International Shipments: All international shipments are subject to duties, taxes and clearing fees which you are responsible for paying - your pledges are without sales-tax or VAT. All Kickstarter rewards will be considered gifts, however, most countries will assess duties/taxes and in certain countries the carrier will pre-pay the duties and taxes and bill you later. If you refuse delivery, your package will be abandoned. Once abandoned, we can t ship another package to you or issue a refund. Filling out your shipping address correctly is very important. A wring address and package sent back will incur shipping charges back to USA on our account.
285`I m Axelle, the founder and creator of Tulipe Noire Watches for Women. Tulipe Noire is a rare deep purple tulip, and is my inspiration for a unique women s watch collection that s mechanical, limited, and always sprinkled with genuine diamonds. I m a watch designer and gemologist with a dream. While I have created many collections for famous brands and fashion houses, I ve always wanted to design a collection, truly feminine, that doesn t look like a copy, a piece of dainty jewelry doubling as a watch, or a takedown of a men s timepiece. With Tulipe Noire, I created every piece in the collection to ensure each detail was exactly what I wanted in a watch. I have completed all my design work.

286`THE WORLD S FIRST BIOLUMINESCENT PETSThe Dino Pet redefines the whole Plant-Pet paradigm. It s a living pet that requires indirect sunlight during the day and gives you a wondrous light show when you play with it at night. Dino Pet will ship globally (where permissible by import laws) HELP US BRING THE DINO PET TO LIFE!Our goal with this Kickstarter campaign (and most all of our projects) is to present biology in a fun and inspiring manner. We ve had an amazing time experimenting with the dinoflagellates (or as we like to call them, "dinos") in our bio light and in plastic bags, jars and any uniquely shaped containers we could get our hands on. But the time has come to give these dinos a form! And what form is more fitting than a Brontosaurus, err an Apatosaurus...TEACHING CHILDREN ABOUT NATUREWe aim to create an interactive toy that teaches kids that magic is found in understanding the world around you. To understand and to work with Nature is paramount to living more sustainably. Harnessing biology to produce energy, medicines and entertainment is the future. Before discovering a pet, we applied these awesome bioluminescent creatures in our bio light. Our hope is the Dino Pet will inspire young minds to take an interest in biology and shape the way we live.

HOW DO YOU CARE FOR YOUR DINO PET? Frequently Asked Questions:Q1 // What are dinoflagellates? A1 // The dinoflagellates used in the Dino Pet are are a species of marine algae that have the ability to bioluminesce in response to mechanical agitation (shaking!). They are unicellular algae of the division Dinoflagellata and of the species Pyrocystis fusiformis.Q2 // What is the life expectancy of the Dino Pet?A2 // The life of the dinoflagellates vary based on their exposure to sunshine, temperature and how quickly they require new nutrients to be supplemented. Typically, a Dino Pet will live for approximately 1 month to 3 months. You can extend this period by adding Dino Food (supplemental growth medium) which can be purchased from Yonder Biology. By regularly adding Dino Food, the dinos can live indefinitely. You can also purchase refills of the dinoflagellates for your Dino Pet from Yonder Biology. A complete care manual is included with the shipment of your Dino Pet.We guarantee that your Dino Pet will arrive alive and healthy. If the dinos are not alive upon arrival, we will issue a replacement order immediately. Please contact us immediately and we will process the new dino shipment right away.Q3 // How are the Dino Pets shipped?A3 // Yonder will ship the Dino Pets with an expedited delivery service (FedEx or USPS Priority Mail). This is particularly important when shipping to extremely warm or cold destinations.Q4 // What happens if I drink the dinos?A4 // We recommend that you do not drink the dinoflagellates. However, the Pyrocystis fusiformis species of dinos we use in the Dino Pet are not toxic and are safe for children.Q5 // How do I care for the pet? A5 // Just leave the dinos in a sun lit room out of direct sunlight. You can also leave them under a low watt bulb for 10 to 12 hours/day. They should be kept between 65-75 degrees Fahrenheit to live optimally. Detailed care instructions are included with the Dino Pet.Q6 // How fast do these Dinos grow? A6 // The dinos' growth is dependent on the amount of available light, dark and nutrients. You can control dino growth by the amount of light they get every day. More detailed care instruction are provided with the Dino Pet. Dinos will live for 1-3 months without doing anything but giving them light. Yonder sells dino nutrients or new dinos to extend the life of your pet. Q7 // Please explain how this container works... A7 // The Dino Pet is delivered full of dinoflagellates. The container may be opened to add dino nutrients or fresh dinos.Q8 // What is the Dino Pet made of? PET? Glass?A8 // The Dino Pet will be made from a polyethylene based plastic. Q9 // Why does your apatosaurus not have a tail? A9 // Would you like a tail on your Dino Pet? Let us know your thoughts and we'll consider it.Q10 // Will you explain the light / dark cycle of dinoflagellates?A10 // Dinos grow and recharge during daylight hours by converting the sun s energy (or light energy) into chemical energy that they use to live and grow. Bioluminescence is visible only during dark cycles due the dinos circadian rhythm that s based on light-dark cycles (typically 12-hours light / 12-hours dark). Q11 // What makes this a good pet for kids?A11 // Dinos are non-toxic, safe and teach kids how to care for a pet while not having to directly feed, walk or pick up after the pet. The better they care for their Dino Pet the more light they will get in return. Happy Dinos = Bright bioluminescenceQ12 // What makes this a great present? A12 // Dino s make a great gift because they are easy to care for and unique. Do you know anyone who has living, glowing pet? Q13 // Do I have to find a dinositter if I go on vacation? A13 // Nope! Just leave your Dino Pet in a sun lit room out of direct sunlightQ14 // Where did dinoflagellates originate? Where are these Dinos naturally found?A14 // These particular dinos are from the ocean. Q15 // How will the funds raised be used?A15 // We will use the funds to create the tooling for the Dino Pet, scale up our bio-manufacturing of the dinoflagellates and perform the first production run. Q16 // How much is the Dino Food and how long will it last?A16 // The Dino Food is $10 for a liter which should last 4-6 months depending on how frequently you change the water.The Dino Pet currently holds ~500mL of liquid. We've had dinoflagellates living in closed containers for 9 months and they re still bioluminescing, although not as bright. However, we prefer to pour off ~half of the container and fill it back up with Dino Food (sterile salt water + nutrients) as soon as they start to dim to keep them at their brightest. You ll see dimming somewhere between 1-3 months.Q17 // Where is the opening on the Dino Pet to insert the food?A17 // We re still evaluating several options for the access port on the Dino Pet. These options are undergoing final evaluation now. Ideally, it'll be on the bottom of the rear right foot or under the belly. Importantly, we want to make sure there is no leakage. Our team is testing this thoroughly now. Some of you have mentioned that a tail could be a good place for the port -- we ll take a serious look at that option too.Q18 // How long do the dinoflagellates bioluminesce after shaking?A18 // The dinoflagellates must be shaken in order to maintain an intense bioluminescence. However, after shaking, they will continue to propel through the water for a while allowing you to see individual cells.THE NEXT STEPS // MANUFACTURING PLANOver the last year and a half, we ve worked with marine biologists and thermoplastic engineers to refine our concepts for the Dino Pet. Upon successful funding, we ll advance to the next stage of development of the Dino Pet: manufacturing. BIOMANUFACTURINGWe will biomanufacture the dinoflagellates in our own facility in Carlsbad, California. This requires a scaling of our current operations from 300L per year to a capacity that meets the demand of this campaign s goals. To successfully scale to meet demand we ll add lights, bioreactors, temperature controllers and purification systems to our current work flow.MANUFACTURINGFor the Dino Pet production (the container), we have partnered with an experienced, domestic thermoplastic manufacturer. Successful campaign funding will trigger mass production of the Dino Pet archetype to fulfill our campaign goals. The production units will include a valve to fill the Dino Pets, replenish nutrients and add/remove dinoflagellates. Thanks for your support. We are ready to glow!

288`What is PyroPet?PyroPet is a new brand created by designer Thorunn Arnadottir and Dan Koval, product developer. PyroPet is a family of animal shaped candles that each reveal a surprise within as they burn. The first PyroPet product is a cute little cat called "Kisa". ("Kisa" means "kitty" in Icelandic). As the sun begins to set and the shadows lengthen on the wall take a match and light the wick on Kisa. Settle into a cozy chair and relax. Watch as Kisa burns. Look at her shadow on the wall. A lazy warping profile of a kitten in the gathering evening darkness. But look closer. That is no kitten's profile. That is a skeleton's profile! Now look back at your candle. Your cute kitten's now melted skin has peeled back to reveal a menacing flame scorched skeleton. Its sharp teeth glinting in the candle light and fire filled eyes staring back at you unblinking and unamused. Featured in: "This Halloween, burn a kitten with PyroPet!" - VICE "...it s eerie, a bit creepy, and i couldn t stop staring. " - NOTCOT "Like they say naughty is the new cute!" -YANKO DESIGN How did the idea come about? The idea came to Thorunn when she was thinking about the way people use candles: "One day as I watched the chubby body of a jolly Santa Claus shaped candle slowly melt, deform, and perish into a sad pool of wax I wondered if I could elevate this common place ritual sacrifice into a true theatre of the macabre in wax." She came up with the idea of embedding a metal skeleton within a cat shaped candle. A sinister form, lurking, biding its time, waiting to be revealed. "Cats have always had a split personality. One minute purring contentedly the next hissing and temperamental. While they are cute and huggable they have a dark side associated with witchcraft and sorcery. Kisa was created to capture this duality. Kisa performs a slowly unfolding transformation from cute kitty to brooding skeleton." (Photos by: Glamour Et Cetera.) How is the candle produced? We have developed a special production process to create the PyroPet products. This process involves cutting a shape out of aluminium sheet, folding it into a skeleton shape, and then inserting the skeleton into the mould used to shape the candle. Our approach is a synthesis of high-tech production and traditional handcraft. Photos from prototype development: Product details: The dimensions of a Kisa candle are: 6.7 x 2.9 x 4.5 inches (17 x 7.5 x 11.5 cm) Each candle should have a burning time of approximately 20 hours. Each candle is slightly different and will burn in it's own unique way. We recommend placing your candle on a plate with a minimum diameter of 10 inches (25cm) to contain the wax as it melts. One of our rewards also include a lovely glass jar that will safely contain the wax and help prolong the burning time of the candle. Note: Images of the Kisa candles have been featured in various blogs and magazines where it was presented under the name of "The Devil's Pet". What is the current stage of the project? We are ready to start PyroPet production as soon as the Kickstarter campaign finishes. Production and delivery will take approximately 3 - 3.5 months. This is what happens during that time: Week 1-4: Production of tools and packaging. Week 5-8: Producing and packing the candles. Week 9-11: Shipment to USA/Europe Week 12-14: Dispatch rewards to our backers. Why do we need money? We have spent the past two years developing PyroPet production technology and finalising the first designs for the PyroPet family of products. What we need now are the funds for our first production run in a factory, industrial tooling, packaging, and marketing. As a reward for supporting us you will receive Kisa at a special reduced Kickstarter price. In addition as a special thank you from us you will receive some nice extras and rewards. Rewards: FREE US SHIPPING WITH ALL REWARDS. FOR Non-US customers: we will be shipping all orders from the UK, these orders will incur an extra shipping and VAT cost.

289`Good olive oil is like good wine. The specific variety of the fruit matters. The terroir the land and environment where it is grown matters. The production process matters. They all work in concert to create a unique taste and experience. Just as you enjoy exploring the depth and individuality of fine wine, we hope to introduce you to a similar experience with Auzoud extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).OUR STORYI was born and raised in the Ouzoud region of the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. This mountainous region is incredibly picturesque and gets its name from the Ouzoud Waterfalls, the tallest in Morocco. The word ouzoud means olive in Berber, my native language and that of the indigenous people of Morocco and North Africa. Ouzoud Waterfalls in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco Ouzoud s waters contribute to the region s fertile agricultural land, which is dotted with many small, family owned olive farms. These families still use traditional methods to harvest their olives every year. Like many of the farmers in this region, my grandfather has a small olive farm that was passed down from generation to generation. It has been in my family for as long as anyone can remember. Now ninety-four years old, my grandfather still lives off the land and the olive grove is still producing. As a child, I spent part of each year helping other family members and neighbors pick olives by hand during the harvest season. We would quickly move the olives to a small mill to press this extraordinary olive oil that we all loved for its full flavor and aroma.After moving to the U.S. several years ago, I became inspired by my childhood memories and my connection with my ancestors land to help the communities I left behind. I also wanted to share the experience of quality olive oil, which is so much a part of life in Morocco, with my American family and friends. I want people here to be able to experience an authentic and flavorful olive oil of the kind that is often difficult to find in the U.S. But just as important for me is the ability to help others prosper and improve their lives, and to honor the hard work of my grandfather and the local farmers from our region.THE HISTORY OF OLIVES IN THE OUZOUD REGIONAmazingly, the Ouzoud region has some of the oldest olive groves in the world. The ancient Romans were the first connoisseurs of Moroccan olive oil. They established the trading city of Volubilis in the 1st Century A.D. in northern Morocco, from which they could oversee their olive harvest. Old Olive Tree in Ouzoud Region Our olive oil is produced from the Picholine cultivar of olive. Picholines were originally grown in the south of France, but they have found a natural second home in Morocco s shared Mediterranean climate, where they are the dominant variety. The small farmers in Ouzoud have harvested it for generations.Olive oil made from the Picholine variety is recognized for its beautiful light golden color and fresh aroma. It will win you over with its soft, right, fruity and slightly peppery taste. WE OFFER THE HIGHEST QUALITY EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL You ve probably noticed that there are an overwhelming number of olive oils to choose from in the store, but did you know that a 2010 study by the University of California, Davis found that two-thirds of the biggest imported brands failed to meet the requirements to actually label their olive oil as extra virgin ? These companies often source their olive oil in massive quantities without knowing where it comes from, how it was grown or how it was processed. They often mix different varieties of olive oil to create a homogenous flavor that loses any sense of the individual profile and personality of the olives it was grown from. In some cases the oil is also diluted with cheap vegetable oils, like peanut or sunflower. Some producers also use stale olive oil, which may taste rancid. Not only are these practices fraudulent for consumers but they are also setting the tone for a general acceptance of low-quality oil and open the door to other major concerns, such as food allergies/sensitivities. In order to receive U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) classification as an extra virgin olive oil, the oil must be pressed mechanically without the use of any alteration methods. The acidity level must be 0.8 or less for every 100 grams. During the pressing stage, when the oil is squeezed from the olive fruit, the temperature must remain constant at 80 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). At Auzoud we make sure to meet these requirements during our process and with lab testing. The result is a fantastic olive oil with very low acidity and a full, rich flavor. We want to change the way people think about and experience extra virgin olive oil, a staple in so many of our diets. I have participated in every stage of the process from hand picking, pressing and bottling. Auzoud Extra Virgin Olive Oil PROUDLY PARTNERED WITH MOROCCO S SMALL FARMERS In addition to offering only the finest extra virgin olive oil, Auzoud is committed to working with low-income farmers from the High Atlas mountain region. This rural area is home to hundreds of olive farmers, most of whom live without simple amenities like running water and electricity. Auzoud is proud to partner with the Ben Youssef Farmers Cooperative, which was founded in 2010 to support better social conditions for women, youth and agricultural workers in the region. Partnering With Ben Youssef Cooperative The co-op helps empower local farmers obtain higher prices for their olives and a more sustainable livelihood for them and their families. All of the olives we use are sourced directly from this group. There are currently over a hundred co-op members and many more farmers are working with the organization to participate in the next harvest. One of the co-op s missions is to educate members about sustainable olive farming. To this end, Auzoud and the co-op are working together to obtain organic certification for all members. The money raised through this campaign will help Auzoud expand the number of farmers we work with, in turn directly increasing profit margins for local farmers and most importantly, their quality of life. MORE THAN JUST OLIVE OIL In addition to our oil, we sell batches of pitted green and black olives cured in olive oil. They are delicious! Oil Cured Picholine Black Olives Picholine Green Olives Pitted USE OF FUNDSCustomers and staff of the specialty stores and retailers where we sell our products say they love the unique taste and that we ve changed the way they experience and think about olives and olive oil.Auzoud has already partnered with several retail outlets, and is sold in a number of specialty and natural stores. Many more stores plan to carry Auzoud products but only if we can bring in a new shipment this fall. Demand is high but we have to be able to meet the minimum quantities at which many stores will only agree to deal with us. This will require a significant expansion from the product numbers we were able to bring to market in the past.Funds from this campaign will be used to purchase olives from the Ben Youssef Farmers Co-op. We will also be working with the co-op in its modern facility to press and bottle the oil for shipment to the U.S. Savings and proceeds from previous sales will be used to finance shipping costs. Any funds in excess of our goal will be used to prepare the olives for retail sale, which includes packaging in glass jars and labeling. As with our oil, we already have a waitlist for these. Additional funds will also be used to grow our online presence and online sales capabilities, so that we can continue to grow our company and the pool of farmers we work with.Of course, we will keep you informed about the progress of the project. SPREAD THE WORD Thank you for taking the time to learn about our project. We appreciate your interest and hope you will join us! If you know of anyone who loves quality food, sustainable and natural agricultural production, fair trade, or who might otherwise be interested in our work, please share this campaign with them. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
290`Thank YOU to ALL backers for FUNding!Did you miss the KickStarter? Pre-order Pack O Game SET 2: HEREFor more information visit: www.perplext.comFollow me on Twitter: @ChrisHandy Pack O Game is a series of small card games with a surprising amount of gameplay, strategy and fun. Each game is unique in theme, mechanics and complexity, with 30 cards (1 inch by 3 inch) in a tuck box the size of a pack of gum. In 2014, Pack O Game SET 1 launched with great success. It s focus was variety for many types of people. SET 2 is about short, middle-weight games for gamers and people looking for more depth and interesting gameplay. Hook: Unique Team Picking" (just like those gym class days!) with interesting strategy and manipulation during the event playing phase. In GYM, players play on 1 of 2 teams, which can accommodate 2, 4 or 6 players. There are 2 phases to the game. The "Pick" phase is just like Gym class! Each team member will choose a Kid from the line up to add to his hand. If a "bully" is acquired, a team member is allowed to influence which 4 (of the 6) events will be played in the next phase. In the "Play" phase, each team member will play a Kid to one of the 4 events on his turn. Playing Kids will also allow an "event action", which may manipulate player hands, Kid positions, and more. Playing a "bully" allows you to reposition a Coach, which reduces chaos at an event, but also makes it more difficult to make changes to the roster. In the end, the team with the most cumulative points from the 4 events is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY GYM NOW! "Don't be fooled by the size of the box; GYM is a heavy game requiring little table space. Pound for Pound, GYM is one if my new favorites, given its size, weight, and portability." - Brian Fiore (Just Got Played) Hook: Quick turns, Press your luck , set collecting with stealing. RUM is a press your luck, set collecting game that s played quickly, over many turns. On your turn, you must draw a card or play sets of bottles to gain Captain Cards and earn points. The 3 face up cards are called The Beach and these are community cards and considered in your hand . You can also play a Rum Trio , which is 3 single bottles in a color, to steal the captain card and increase it by 2. But, you can t press your luck too long, because the Parrot is lurking close by to steal your rum. The game ends when a player reaches a set amount of points OR when the time on the Castaway Clock runs out. Tabletopia User? TRY RUM NOW! Hook: Mancala meets secret goal/set collecting farming game. SOW is a challenging gardening game in which players redistribute seeds and flowers in the garden in order to pick the bouquet that will reward the most points at the end of the game. Each turn, a player must redistribute a row in the garden, then takes any applicable actions. If the last card placed was a Seeds Card, it must be flipped over (and all other matching Seeds of that color) to become a Flower. Flowers reward points when collected from a player s Wheelbarrow. There are 2 Garden Action Cards that may also allow extra actions, if placed in the same row, on the same turn. Garden Actions will allow a Gardener to change the windmill direction (which changes the card redistribution in future turns), or it may allow a player to discard all flowers of a certain type (Gopher) or collect a flower in their wheel barrow (watering can). In the end, the players show their favorite color and are rewarded points for flowers. Each player calculates their score as follows: 3 points for each flower with his Favorite Color in the Center portion. 2 points for each flower with his Favorite Color on the Outer portion. 1 point for each flower WITHOUT his Favorite Color. Tabletopia User? TRY SOW NOW! Hook: A short, 2-player battle of hand management and timing. On your turn, you must perform the following actions in order:1. Deploy Orcs: Play 1 card from your hand to a Territory that has not yet been conquered.2. Draw Weapons: Choose ANY Stockpile(s). Draw card(s) as follows: A. Draw 1 card into your hand if you deployed 2 Orcs. B. Draw 2 cards into your hand if you deployed 1 Orc. A Territory battle occurs immediately after the Stockpile next to a Territory is exhausted. Then, players total their deployed Orcs at that Territory, and a victor will be declared. Orcs that fight in battle will not score points, they only help conquer Territories. Scoring occurs at the end of the game, when all Stockpiles have been exhausted. The player who conquers the most valuable Territories and holds native Orcs in their hand (matching those lands), is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY ORC NOW! I am just so impressed by Orc! Almost from the first turn the decisions will grip you and not let up until the very end. I think what amazes me is that each choice is fundamentally simple: which card do I play and to which battle? Yet each of those choices has numerous hugely important implications for the remaining game, all of which are immediately understandable from a glance at the tabletop. While the box might say war is ugly, this game is anything but! - Matt (Creaking Shelves) In this nutty set connecting game, players will acquire nut cards and and arrange them in their own individual trees. Same-colored nuts that are kept together will reward players with more points as they may only count their largest nut cluster in each of the 6 colors at the end of the game. The player with the most points is the winner! Each round, the role of the Forager will rotate clockwise from player to player. When a player is the Forager, he must add a new nut column to replenish the previously taken column. Then, he must take any 1 card in a column and place it in his playing area. Then, the remaining players must take 1 card from the same column and place them in their playing area. The game continues with the next player in clockwise order becoming the Forager, and so on. Nut Cards will create trees with nuts on both sides. Cards must touch at least one square side or cover a full square (or at least a third of a card). Once cards have been placed, they may not me moved for the remainder of the game. A Squirrel will double the value of a cluster of nuts if it is orthogonally connected to the largest cluster of the squirrel s corresponding color. Squirrels must be placed with the squirrel right-side up, facing the player.The Squirrel has no value itself, but may be a connector for 2 sections of same colored nut clusters. Wild Nuts may be used as any colored nut during the scoring if it is contiguously connected to the largest cluster of a particular color. The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted AND there are no columns left in play. The player who earned the most points from his six sets of nuts is the winner. In DIG, each player is a dog that will run throughout the Yard, dig up bones and attempt to return them to the matching colored Dog Bowl with the greatest efficiency. All players will score once, at the end of the game, based on the cumulative value of the Bones that he returned to the matching Dog Bowls. There are 4 Bones in each of the 5 colors in the game. A Bone's value is determined at the end of the game, based on the distance of its corresponding Dog Bowl to the Dog House. The Dog Bowl that is closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 5 for each bone of that color. The Dog Bowl that is second closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 4 for each bone of that color, and so on. The Bowls and Bones will be swapped from the end of the Yard into the place of a recently dug up bone, continuously moving the 5 Bowls to the end of the Yard nearest the Dog House. Each Yard Card has a Scent with 2 colors. The Bone on the opposite side of the Yard Card matches 1 of the colors of the Scent. This will help players determine which color Bone might be dug if that Yard Card is selected for digging. One of the most interesting aspects of DIG is the unique "Leap Frog" Yard replacement mechanism. When a Bone is dug up, the Card that is furthest from the the Dog House, is removed and fills the empty spot created by the Dog. This action creates some interesting ways to influence which Bones and Bowls each Dog has close access to, but also makes timing critical for influencing Bone value for scoring. On a player's turn, he may perform ANY or ALL of the following actions, but may only perform each action ONCE per turn. MOVE: A player may move his Dog a maximum of 4 cards along the Yard Cards, and 1 less for each Bone he holds prior to movement. For example, if a player holds 2 Bone cards, he may move his Dog up to 2 Cards, moving below or above the Yard cards. A player may move his Dog in any direction. There is a movement legend on the bottom half of the Dog House for easy reference. DIG: A player may dig up a bone and place the Bone card in his hand. Bones that are in the hand are kept secret until they are dropped off and placed in front of the player. The empty space created from the Yard Card removal is filled with the last Card at the edge of Yard. A player may have no more than 3 Bones in their hand at any time. DROP: Drop a Bone into a Dog Bowl and place the Bone card from your hand to the playing area in front of himself, face up with the Bone visible to all players. A Dog must be AT the Bowl of the corresponding color in order to drop off any Bones of that color. Game End and Scoring: When Bowls are the only remaining Cards in the Yard (next to the Dog House), the game ends immediately and players total their scores. Any Bones still in a player's hand are removed from the game and do not count for scoring. Calculate your score by identifying the value of each Bone in your possession.5 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color closest to the Dog House.4 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color second closest to the Dog House.3 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color third closest to the Dog House.2 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color fourth closest to the Dog House.1 Point Each: Bones matching the Bowl color furthest from the Dog House. The player with the most points wins! Here are 4 games that take little space and little time to play, but demand all of a player s attention. That s impressive and fun.

292`If you love coffee as much as we do, we're sure you would LOVE to be able to drink it anytime anywhere. And so would we! That is why we decided to make a coffee mug that is practical and sustainable, but is also a fashion accessory and tells the primeval story of coffee. Its most obvious feature is definitely its shape which resembles the goat s horns but it also helps you drink that last sip of your coffee and makes you look good. We designed a special holder with leather touch which simply turns into a coffee mug stand so you can easily keep the Goat mug on your desk. Also, Goat mug comes with a set of two straps (short and longer part combine in to one), so you can simply attach it to your bag or just let it fall across your shoulder. This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around. Goat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE. Since you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand. Here's a look inside the Goat mug. It's shape makes it simple to clean. We designed a beautiful packaging to deliver your Goat mug in style. It can then become a perfect storage place for your fresh coffee beans. We would love for more coffee lovers to learn the real story about coffee as much as we would love all of them to be stylish and eco-friendly while drinking their coffee wherever and whenever. That is why we would appreciate you backing our project. Surely, there will be more coffees enjoyed if we manage to make our dream come true.Help us share our project among other coffee lover out there Awards structure: The first stretch goal is an idea we got from our backer Tamara. If we manage to raise $60,000 we will offer everyone a new colour option of the Goat mug - the PANTONE COLOUR OF THE YEAR: MARSALA. Let's do it! The second stretch goal is out! If we manage to raise $250,000 we will offer a new reward: HEMP EDITION Goat mug - for all those on the relaxed side of fashion. Never. Enough. Coffee. You asked for big, we're giving you GRANDE. Third streth goal is set to $350,000! Can we do this together? If all goes according to our plans, we will be shipping out products already in second half of February. Let's do this together! Design of the GOAT STORY Coffee mug was done by design studio Desnahemisfera in cooperation with MyEqua.

Innovation is open to everyone - Prof. Miles Pennington, Innovation Design Engineering & Global Innovation Design, Imperial College London & Royal College of Art SAM is a crazy new technology that will fundamentally change the way you go from idea to finished product - Andy McCartney and Diane Perlman, CEO in Residence - Microsoft Ventures UK Why SAM?I'm a mechanical engineer, and was always scared of the dark magic of electrical engineering. Stuff never works, there's always a bug, and you can't duct tape it into correctness. I wanted to find a way to make it fun for people to learn circuitry and coding. A human centered model that would be easy to use and which taught you while you worked with it. This gave birth to SAM, the idea of giving designers and creative people the powers of engineers. We hope to be a the start of a democratic revolution for the Internet of Things so that children can learn and that impactful, highly technologically innovative projects can be undertaken by designers who do not necessarily have the luxury of having been technically trained as engineers.1. SAM makes creating easy. Until now, electronics projects have required hardware skills (wiring, soldering), software wizardry (coding, hacking, debugging) and a lot of patience! With SAM, you can forget all of these. SAM ensures a seamless communication between hardware and software. No more head bashing - it just works. With no frustration, it s fun to use! 2. SAM opens the Internet of Everything market to designers and creators. Gone are the days when society depends on engineers and technical experts to shape the world around us. Thanks to SAM, anyone with an idea turns it into reality. 3. SAM helps you learn about code. While coding is not necessary with SAM, code is generated for all your drag and drop creations. As you become comfortable with this code, start adding your own to unleash the power of SAM and create awesome stuff!Open Source and the SAM community We believe in the Open Hardware movement and we will upload the kits hardware schematics and board designs, the components we re using are available from any major distributor. ...also, they look quite good! Production Plan As soon as the campaign ends, we will place an order for all the components needed for mass manufacture. These components have a lead time of up to three months, and we have booked the manufacturing plant for the middle of February just in case any delays in component sourcing arise. Fresh out of the factory, the kits will be dispatched straight to your houses.Who is SAM Labs?We are a multi-disciplinary team of designers from the Royal College of Art and engineers from Imperial College London.The idea for SAM came to us while eating fat soba in Tokyo in August 2013, and the team started assembling in early 2014.We have been working remotely on SAM with regular hackathon meets, but have now settled at Central Working s collaborative working space in Whitechapel, London.Thank you Thanks for reading all the way down, we hope you ve enjoyed learning about SAM and are ready to join us on the journey.

Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Kamigami robots are built from a unique, patent-pending material (an extremely durable plastic composite) that allows them to fold up in an origami-like process. In the Media Our kit comes with everything you need to build and run your own Kamigami robot. This includes the laser-cut body components, as well as the motor, transmission, rechargeable battery, micro-USB and plug-and-play electronics. The assembly should take less than an hour. We will have videos online with instructions to show you how it all comes together. Kamigami robots are controlled through our free mobile app (for iOS and Android) which you can download to your smartphone or tablet. For a full list of compatible devices and operating systems, please see our Frequently Asked Questions below. There are three Kamigami robots to choose from Musubi, Inari, and Goki each with their own unique appearance! Once assembled, your Kamigami robot is ready to go and will be running around at top speed in no time. See what Kamigami robots can really do build a Kamigami ramp, make your own obstacle course over all sorts of terrain, or race your friends to see who can get the fastest time. Kamigami robots are designed to run like the world s fastest animals. Biologists have discovered that all animals feature an alternating gait whether they have two legs, four, six, or more. We ve baked this into Kamigami by building a linkage that alternates the up and down motion of each leg. The circular motion of the motors is turned into elliptical motion of the legs through these linkages. By doing this, we get a leg pattern very similar to real animals! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Another important part of animal locomotion is how springy or stiff the legs are relative to the size and mass of the animal s body. Almost all animals have the same leg stiffness when scaled to their mass. We ve made sure Kamigami hold true to this principle, allowing them to run swiftly and efficiently. Now, how do the mechanics of everything work? There are 3 main components of the Kamigami robots: Chassis (or Body), Electronics, Gearbox and Motors. Chassis The chassis is made of a plastic-fabric composite we invented, which allows us to build durable, lightweight robots like no one else. The chassis is composed entirely of flexible hinges, also called flexure joints, which have lots of advantages over traditional joints, including: They are frictionless, which means better efficiency. They can be made incredibly small. They don t fatigue or wear. They make the robot fun to build! It s these flexure joints that give Kamigami their unique origami nature.

You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 And voila! Electronics Our electronics are custom designed, and packed with processing power and sensors. The main microprocessor features a Cortex M0 core and Bluetooth Smart radio. Sensors include ambient light, infrared detectors and emitter, gyroscope, and accelerometer. The electronics also feature motor drivers, charging circuitry, and an accessory header for expandability. The infrared emitter and detectors allow Kamigami to send signals to each other, and know where they re receiving them from. A signal might be tag, you re it or spin and light your eyes or send this message to the mobile device controlling you. This allows for the development of swarm robotics in the future as multiple robots communicate and react to each other. The electronics also come with a rechargeable battery attached, so you don t have to run to the store before running your robots. Battery life is about 30-45 minutes of play time and recharges in about the same amount of time. Gearbox and Motors The gearbox is made up of two motors, six gears, and a housing to locate everything. The gearbox is connected to the electronics through a process called heat-staking, and the electronics and gearbox come as a single piece. The motors are 6mm diameter coreless brushed motors, similar to what you d find in a small RC helicopter. The gearbox provides a 16:1 reduction so that the Kamigami can charge over tough obstacles. We're manufacturing Kamigami in the USA. We believe this leads to the best quality, communication, and time to market possible. The chassis, electronics, and gearbox are all built in different ways. The chassis is laser cut, using a patent pending multi-step process that involves lamination, alignment, and roll-to-roll manufacturing. Check out a real-time video below: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 For prototyping we use a slower laser in our lab that allows us to try out new designs every day. Our robot s electronics are made by another robot! This is called a pick-and-place machine, and it uses computer vision to pick up, place, and solder each tiny component onto each board. The gearbox features gears made of injection molded nylon, and a gearbox made of injection molded ABS plastic. These are all custom parts. Our motors and pins are off the shelf. We believe in building with your hands that engineering is not separate from emotion. We believe in STEM education for everyone that creating is for everyone. So we created Kamigami: lightning-fast, origami-style robots you can build, program, play with and evolve. During the past year, we shared our robots with local schools and camps and the response was overwhelming. And now we want to share them with everyone! Kamigami is brought to you by an awesome bunch of people. Nick and Andrew are the co-founders and old climbing buddies who met while working in a robotics lab at UC Berkeley. Dwight, our hardware engineer, joined soon after the company got started and is a fellow Berkeley alum, who comes out of the biology department where he and his labmates study animal locomotion. Polly is the Head of Marketing and makes sure everyone knows how awesome Kamigami robots are. Adam is our Software Product Lead, combining a mastery of coding, UI/UX, and design skills to build a killer app and an amazing play and programming experience. Kelvin Nguyen is our industrial and graphic designer, so if you like the art on the page, or the Kamigami characters, you have him to thank! We've been working on developing Kamigami for a long time now, and have experience manufacturing, having already shipped 1300 Beta robots in 2014. Here's what we have today. Chassis: 100 manufacturing prototypes built by our contract manufacturer Transmission: Injection molded samples in hand, run of 100 manufacturing prototypes starting this week Electronics: 100 manufacturing prototypes built by our contract manufacturer Software: Early version of iOS app about 2 weeks from App Store approval We will be shipping our first 1,000 units in January 2016. The remaining units will be shipped in March 2016. We will be shipping to the United States and Canada. U.S.: Shipping within the U.S. is free. Canada: Shipping to Canada is free for our Kamigami Decorative Ornament reward. A subsidized fee of $5 USD will be applied for all other rewards shipping to Canada. After the project ends, we will send you an email with a form to validate your shipping information. At this time, you will be able to select the Kamigami robot of your choice. Thank you for your support!
295`Fast Company: "...an heirloom-worthy ice cream scoop"Wired: "...services up frozen treats and high style."Cool hunting: "an elegant update on the classic utensil keeps comfort at the forefront of its design"PSFK: "Cuts through ice cream like a hot knife through butter"TrendHunter: "..effective and comfortable to hold" We love products that are stunningly beautiful, perform brilliantly and exude craftsmanship. We believe that we have developed an ice cream scoop that has all of these characteristics. Our goal was to create the best performing, most beautiful and durable ice cream scoop ever created. We are seeking your support to bring the Belle-V ice cream scoop to life.TWENTY YEARS OF PASSIONDr. Karl Ulrich, Vice Dean of Innovation at the Wharton School has been collecting ice cream scoops for over twenty years.Karl noticed many scoops pose ergonomic challenges by working against the natural motion of your wrist. This makes it hard to drive through hard ice cream or easily reach into the corners of ice cream containers. L: Karl's personal antique ice cream scoop collection. R: The first series of Belle-V prototypes. Karl recently explored the redesign of an ice cream scoop as the example for his online Coursera class. The key innovation Karl presented to his students was to angle and elongate the head of the scoop, which allows you to keep your wrist straight and makes the ice cream scoop more comfortable and easier to use.WORLD CLASS DESIGN PARTNER LUNAR is a globally renowned design firm, famous for creating some of the world s most beautiful and ergonomic products. Jeff Salazar, lead designer of the Oral-B CrossAction Toothbrush, amongst other products, led the design team that transformed Karl s functional concept into a gorgeously simple and elegant form.By designing, testing and refining several dozen prototypes, LUNAR optimized the asymmetric handle and refined the geometry of the angled scoop head with spade-shaped leading edge. L: Design team's initial sketches. R: Prototypes showing evolution of Belle-V ice cream scoop. STUNNING BEAUTYWhen was the last time you displayed a kitchen utensil like a piece of sculpture? Pre-production Belle-V ice cream scoop. The Belle-V ice cream scoop has a striking design you can proudly show off in your kitchen or dining room and present as a centerpiece when serving dessert at your next party.BRILLIANT PERFORMANCEDoes the Belle-V ice cream scoop really work better? YES! The handle is sculpted, weighted and balanced to feel just right in your hand. The angled head works with -- not against -- the natural rolling action of your wrist to give you maximum leverage to easily drive through the hardest ice cream. The spade-shaped leading edge helps you get into those hard-to-reach corners at the bottom of your ice cream container. Belle-V scoops are made from aluminum, chosen for its strength and high thermal conductivity. Heat from your hand quickly conducts through the handle to the head of the scoop to more easily release ice cream. The Belle-V ice cream scoop is patent pending. Three segment series demonstrating axial arm and wrist rotation. HAND CRAFTED, HEIRLOOM QUALITY Our team reminisced about heirloom artifacts that have been passed on from one generation to the next, and we set out to craft a Belle-V ice cream scoop with the same kind of lasting value. To ensure the highest quality and best functionality, we make each scoop out of die cast aluminum, hand finish it and then apply striking surface treatments. Each scoop is finished and polished by hand to eliminate the rough edges of the die casting process. No two will be exactly alike, but all Belle-V scoops will be crafted to our exacting standards. We are especially proud that Belle-V ice cream scoops have solid cores with no inserts, liquids or fillers. This yields a single form that is both elegant and durable. L: Solid form of Belle-V scoop. R: Hand finishing. BELLE-V SCOOP COLORS Scoop colors from left to right: Jet Black, Matte Silver, Chrome, Gold-plated WE NEED YOUR SUPPORTWe're launching this product on Kickstarter because conventional retailing models make it hard for even professionals like us to get products of this caliber directly to you. So please help us bring this product to life by supporting us with a pledge. The $5,000 we are seeking will help us fund production tooling and acquire material for initial production.

298`Thank you so much for taking a few minutes out of your day to stop by and consider backing my first Kickstarter project - Meepillows! I want to personally thank you in writing since the producers of the video didn't think I had "it" to speak on camera (self-reflection is very hard). I want to sincerely express my appreciation to you and the hobby that has changed my life - board games! Is it weird to say that? Perhaps. But through all the friends I have met, all the colleagues I have connected with, all the strain my brain has endured at game night, and all the good times it all has brought, I feel that it has changed my life in a very positive way.Now, here I am! Instead of backing another board game on Kickstar...hold on......yeah, I just backed another game on Kickstarter...Anyway, I finally decided to create my own board game related project. I not only started my company Top Shelf Fun through my innate desire to be a part of this great hobby, but to bring something different to the tabletop/sofa. By backing this project you are not just helping me bring a Meepillow to your gameroom, but you are helping me set my company up for sucess to create other future projects! There are some pretty hefty minimums from the manufacturer to bring a plush to life, and I am doing it with 6 different colors! It's crazy, but I am confident we can make this happen. I really believe we can do this together!So, once again, a big "thank you" for stopping by while your boss isn't looking to help my dream become a reality! Now, I know what you are thinking! What are 'Thank You' goals? Well, when I started this project I didn't know what to expect. At all. I knew that I didn't have the ability to upgrade the Meepillow in any way as a product (no component upgrades were possible), so I didn't include "Stretch Goals" in my campaign. Since this was my first Kickstarter I also wanted to keep it simple and clean.Fast forward a couple weeks and I was so overwhelmed by the community, the support, and how fast I surpassed my initial funding goal I just had to figure out a way to thank each of you. I wanted to express my appreciation in a fun way. A gamer's way!So, here are the special 'Thank You' Goals we have unlocked thus far:1. Future Discounts: Each backer will receive special codes after the campaign ends that will entitle them to future exclusive discounts on my website.2. End of Campaign Game: After the campaign has ended I will be taking a survey. I will ask each backer two questions:A. What was the most popular Meepillow color of the campaign?B. What was the total quantity sold of that Meepillow?The backer who was closest to the correct answer of the correct color (you can go over) will win a free set of all 6 Meepillows! In case of a tie there will (of course) be a D20 roll off which will be recorded on video. 3. Official Meepillow Certificate: At the end of the campaign every backer will receive a link to a set of "Official Meepillow Guarantee" .pdf files. There will be 6 .pdfs (one for each Meepillow color) and these particular certificates (blue shown below) will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers only! The Meepillow Guarantee! Again, thank you so much for all of your support. I certainly couldn't have done it without you! A "meeple" is a little wooden pawn used in many modern day board games to represent a player. "Meeple" is believed to be a combination of the words "my" and "people." The meeple originated in the board game Carcassonne which was released about 15 years ago and continues to make gamers out of unsuspecting people today! Glorious Meeples!!! Since then, meeples have been used in countless other board games and have become the unofficial symbol of modern day tabletop gaming. Nowadays, meeples are not only used to represent people, but animals, creatures, monsters, and much, much more. You see them in logos, t-shirts, playing cards, and many other suprising places!They're everywhere! Meepillow Blueprint Meepillows are my interpretation of what the offspring of meeples and pillows would look like. They are soft, huggable and will definitely liven up any room in your home. They are 15 inches tall, almost 16 inches wide and 6 inches thick. They were born out of my love of board games and the tabletop game industry as a whole. The original 6 colors were chosen based on popular player colors used in modern day board games, but from this Kickstarter I hope to grow this business with new sizes and colors! I knew from the beginning that shipping would be a challenge. Unlike other projects, this one would pose a logistical problem of shipping many multiple large items together. The Meepillow is already quite large and an odd shape, and adding multiple units makes the shipping box huge! So, I decided to absorb shipping costs best I could, offer discount tiers on different reward levels, and ship from multiple fulfillment warehouses that will help offset the insane costs. "Dimension Weight" is my least favorite combination of words right now!1 Meepillow: US $8 / The World $102 Meepillows: US $15 / The World $183 Meepillows: US $20 / The World $254 Meepillows: US $25 / The World $325 Meepillows: US $29 / The World $406 Meepillows: US $32 / The World $47Many months later of pulling my hair out it turns out in the end the cost to ship was simply unavoidable. I stopped worrying and decided to just love the project.I hope you do too! I went through a few companies and prototypes until I fined tuned the meeple shape that works best as a giant huggable plush. Even though the shape is simple, it is iconic and it needed to be perfect. Otherwise it would have just been a blob or a weird starfish shape. Making the shape work was surprisingly more difficult than expected. Receiving these prototypes was so amazing. All the hard work was starting to pay off. Having them in hand and being able to show people validated what I already knew. These Meepillows were not only cool to look at, but incredibly soft and quite epic! Prototypes in all their meeple glory! Since the prototypes are just, well, prototypes I needed to test multiple colors as well. In the end the Purple Meepillow (which is clearly more of a lavender above) and the Yellow Meepillow will see the biggest changes.Please note that your screen will not accurately portray the colors exactly how they will be in final product. Between the camera used to photograph the fabric, the lighting, and your computer/phone screen it can be difficult to show the colors exactly as they are represented. Have faith though! They are vibrant and accurate to my specifications! Final Red Swatch Final Blue Swatch Final Green Swatch Final Black Swatch Final Yellow Swatch Final Purple Swatch Help spread the word by downloading these cool Meepillow avatars and using them on different social media sites! Top Shelf Fun was born out of a love for fun, geeky and just plain awesome stuff. Board games, action figures, comic books, pop culture memorabilia, and video games are just a few of my favorite things. When there is no room left on my shelves, the toys will walk the earth.As Top Shelf Fun was indeed born out of a love of board games, Meepillows are the first board game products to be born out of Top Shelf Fun. With your help I will not only kickstart Meepillows, but it will be the foundation of all future products (in which I have many)!I can't thank you enough for your support!A very special 'Thank You' to the following people who helped me get this project off the ground:Kristan Delle - Wife and big-time supporter of my shenanigans.Rob McClure - Actor, editor, and all around great guy.Maggie Lakis - Actress, director, and best friend.Keith Bailey - Art assets and long time chum of immense talent.Brae Howard - Photographer extraordinaire.Kiril Tchangov - Top Shelf Fun logo & Meepillow Certificate designer.

301`My name is Steve Smith. I have been a fan of Beno t Peeters and Fran ois Schuiten's French graphic novel series The Obscure Cities since the late 1980s. Five books in the series were translated into English but stopped after 2002 with three graphic novels and at least five other books left in the series. The Obscure Cities is an internationally acclaimed graphic novel series, having won major awards in Europe and Japan including the Grand Prize Manga in the 2013 Japan Arts Festival. It was the first time that a foreign author or series won this award. The translated The Obscure Cities album was chosen over 457 other entries.I have translated The Leaning Girl ( L'enfant Pench e) into English and have licensed the rights to the entire series with the hope of reintroducing these great stories to the United States and English-speaking countries. This Kickstarter campaign is to help cover the production costs on the first book, The Leaning Girl. I have the blessings of the author and artist, and the licensing rights from their publisher, Casterman, in Belgium. Cover-in-progress for THE LEANING GIRL graphic novel This series is a passion of mine and I want to be able to share it with other European comic and art lovers in English speaking countries. Part of my desire to use Kickstarter is that this series should be seen by a larger audience that has proven time and again it is supportive of unique artistic projects.I have spent the past three months translating The Leaning Girl in to English. The story is very personal and real to me.The art is some of the most delicate and beautiful I have ever seen in comics. a page from the beginning of the story. REWARDSHere are some examples of some the rewards supporters can receive as part of this campaign in addition to the 176-page graphic novel.This is a mockup of what the limited edition t-shirt will look like. The front features the iconic Alaxis Press logo and the back features a beautiful illustration of Mary, the leaning girl, standing atop a meteor. Both the logo and the illustration are by Fran ois Schuiten. The shirt will be a 100% cotton high quality shirt available in men's and women's adult sizes. Next is the very limited edition print signed by both artist Fran ois Schuiten and writer Beno t Peeters. It will measure approximately 18" x 22" and will be produced on high quality archival art paper. The limited edition signed print as part of the Level 8 rewards The following video montage gives a great sneak peek into the visuals. The musical accompaniment is by longtime Peeters & Schuiten collaborator and international recording artist, Bruno Letort. Please visit my website, www.theobscurecities.com for many more videos. I have tried to make the reward levels as simple as possible because really, the goal is to get this book into everyone's hands. I do have two stretch goal rewards I am hoping to reveal should this campaign surpass its initial $30,000 goal. Additional revenue will go towards advertising and promotion of this book and the next books in the series.With your support, I will be able to introduce this and other amazing stories from the Obscure Cities to an audience hungry for great writing and great storytelling. I want to thank you in advance for your support and I invite you to ask me questions throughout the process.
302`You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Change the message. Change her world. "Science is not for girls." That's the wrong message for our girls to hear. We know that inside every girl is a scientist, but over time, girls pick up on societal cues that tell them that science is not for them - it's for boys. This message is reinforced in the toy aisle, where chemistry and physics kits are marketed to boys and pseudoscience "spa" kits are marketed to girls.Girls lose confidence. And miss opportunities.In 4th grade, most girls say they like science. But by 8th grade this number drops dramatically as girls lose confidence in their ability to do science. This trend continues beyond school. Although women make up 48% of the total workforce, they make up only 24% of science jobs.Science is for girls. At Yellow Scope, we want to build girls' confidence in science before they fall off the curve. Research shows that girls learn best when they can approach projects in a creative and open-ended way. That's why we designed our kits to engage both the scientific and creative minds of girls. The experiments are rigorous, and there is plenty of room for girls to draw their observations and doodle their ideas in their very own lab notebook.STEM and the leaky pipeline.STEM is the acronym for science, technology, engineering, and math. There has been a lot of talk about the gender imbalance in STEM and the "leaky pipeline" - a term used to describe the loss of girls and women at every step along the path to STEM careers. We want to fix the leak early, while girls are still confident and enthusiastic about science. Science Kit Cover Our kit: is targeted for girls 8 - 12 years old, when interest in science is most vulnerable aligns with Next Generation Science Standards includes supplies for dozens of experiments Key concepts: Molecules and molecular motion Chemical reactions Temperature in chemistry Included in the kit: Lab notebook (which is really a lot more than just a lab notebook...) It's a sketch pad - reference guide - doodle book - and lab safety & instruction manual. In a nutshell, it's a place to learn, experiment, wonder, design, and create. And it's really cool.

Safety goggles 3 Beakers Thermometer Timer Stirring rod Candle Citric acid Sodium bicarbonate Colored pencils Pencil sharpener Red, yellow, and blue colored dye Red, yellow, and blue citric acid/sodium bicarbonate tablets Mini pencil with eraser and logo Chalk cloth/lab mat (phthalate-free) Chalk Collectible chemistry badge Earn Your Collectible Chemistry Badge. Future kits (Biology badge, anyone?) will come with different badges that girls can pin on their backpacks or lab coats. Lab Notebook Cover Lab Notebook Excerpts Real science girls doing real science: Lab Mat Included in Kit (Phew!) What's Currently on the Market? We dare you to Google "science kits for girls" images. Go ahead, open another window and do it. We did this the other night, and here's what came up: Screenshot of Google search for "Science Kits for Girls" Images - Can you see us in the bottom right corner? There are a couple of good kits that come up in the search -- including Roominate, which is a really great toy (go Alice and Bettina!) And we're really excited that our kit showed up. However, take a look at the overwhelming majority of the science kits that are targeted specifically at girls. This is what the toy aisle offers our daughters, nieces, granddaughters, and friends. The world may tell girls that they can be anything and do anything. But the real message is that they should focus on their appearances, and that rigorous science is not for them. Reward Details: Artwork for our limited edition buttons The lab coat embroidered with our yellow microscope These are the three science girls (and their lab rat friend) that you can help name in the NAME THE SCIENCE GIRL reward Chemistry 101: The ultimate science party Reasons to support us on Kickstarter today: You will be the first to own the Foundation Chemistry kit. Our product is unique; there are no products currently on the market like this. You will send the message that girls can do anything - especially real science. You will help get real science into the hands of your daughter/niece/granddaughter/friend. You will help fix the leaky pipeline, so girls in STEM will become women in STEM. Kickstarter perks! Need we say more? We ask for your pledge so that we can get volume discounts, finish up the graphic design for the lab notebook, and cover start-up printing costs. If this really takes off, your pledges will help start us on the path of a whole line of science kits for girls. After our Foundation Chemistry Kit, we plan to develop a series of kits in different subject areas - Physics, Biology, Earth Science, Coding, and more. For each subject area, we will create several kits on different topics, and at different price points. As a backer, you will receive exclusive updates on our new products.

303`|LumoPack is a reliable, fast-charging, portable battery pack.Charge LumoPack at 140 Watts for six minutes to store enough power to give your iPhone 6 a full charge! LumoPack was designed to be a simple product, reducing the noise that is often magnified by competitors looking to differentiate themselves in the marketplace. Portable electronics (i.e. smartphones) have gotten exponentially better with each passing year. Successive generations feature better CPUs, cameras, screens, and cellular signals, which all place an increasing strain on the battery.The development of batteries has not kept pace with our portable electronics. This led to an increased demand for battery packs. However there is a problem within the battery market.Too often, battery packs differentiate themselves through their PACK (form, style, and gimmicks), instead of the actual BATTERY. Lyte has focused on what matters most the science of the battery cell. To make all this happen, Lyte has combined forces with Nivo Systems and incorporated Nivo s groundbreaking Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) technology into LumoPack. Applying Nivo s MOF material into LumoPack has brought 3 major improvements: Accelerated Charge Times: Detach from the wall and stay on-the-go. LumoPack can be charged at 140 watts that s 14-28 times more than standard battery packs (5-10 watts).As a result, after just 6 minutes of charging, LumoPack stores enough power for a full iPhone 6 charge, and after 9 minutes, enough power for a Samsung Galaxy S6. LumoPack s battery only needs 30 minutes for a full charge (6000 mAh). ***Recharges based on iPhone 6 mAh capacity*** Battery packs today that offer higher charging power over industry standards, do so at the expense of cycle life, which can drop as low as 50-100 cycles. In contrast, the LumoPack battery cell allows it to sustain high charging speeds without risking cycle life. Not only does the LumoPack charge at a high wattage, but it also extends the Battery Cycle Life!* *Battery Cycle Life refers to the number of complete charges & discharges before the battery falls below 80% of original storage capacity. Extended Cycle Life: LumoPack is a longer lasting product. Approx. Battery Life Cycles Ever wonder why your old laptop or phone dies soon after it s charged up to 100%? It s because you ve used up your cycle life. The standard batteries today last about 300 cycles, with most leaders in the industry maxing out at 500 cycles. However, this number is only at its most ideal conditions, which is usually never the case. In comparison, even with faster charging, the LumoPack can sustain 1000 charge cycles, that s 2-3 times the industry standard today! Battery Coating: Battery bulging? Catching on fire? EXPLODING? The MacBook Pro's battery is bulging and causing the trackpad to pop out and crack. Not with LumoPack! Increase Safety with MOF As time passes, Lithium-ion battery cells degrade, which in turn leaves space in the cell for unwanted gases, such as oxygen, to enter. This is what can cause your batteries to bulge, catch on fire, or even explode. MOF technology coats and protects LumoPack s battery cell, thus significantly reducing these risks. Did you know? large lithium-ion battery packs are starting to be banned globally on flights due to these safety risks. LumoPack is compatible with all USB enabled devices. Have some fun with LumoPack's 3D model below: ___________ ___________ Compared to most conventional battery packs, which only offer one way of charging (usually through a micro USB port), LumoPack comes with three different charging methods to maximize convenience for all your charging scenarios. The three types include: Micro USB Charger, Car Charger, and Wall Charger. The Micro USB Charger is the standard way of charging most battery packs on the market today. This method charges LumoPack at 10W (5V x 2A). This is convenient if you want to charge LumoPack through your computer. It can also be used as a back-up charger to carry with you. Charging with the Micro USB Charger will be much slower than the 140W Car Charger and Wall Charger methods. The Car Charger is made for your on-the go needs. Whether you are traveling in a cab, bus, or your own vehicle, the Car Charger offers an extremely portable method for you to charge LumoPack at its full 140W capability. The image above shows a Car Charger which is about 4 feet long, but this is not set in stone. The length will be based on the preference of our Backers, which will be conducted through a post-campaign survey on KickStarter. The LumoPack Wall Charger is designed to charge LumoPack at 140W. However, the Wall Charger is significantly bigger than both chargers above because it needs to pull a high 140W current from the wall. Please refer to the sections below for a better understanding of the Wall Charger. Power adapters have always given us the feeling of carrying around a brick, in a manner of speaking. Imagine a laptop charger that needs power ranging anywhere from 45W~85W or more (i.e. MacBook Pro 15 - 85W). Now, imagine if it offered 140 watts of power. The size of the power adapters are relative to the amount of output wattage. 140W adapters on the market today are very large. We have continually searched for the best 140W wall chargers available, however, due to the unpopularity of 140W chargers, there hasn t been much development to them and they remain relatively big in size. This leads us to presenting our Extended Goal. As you all know, Lyte is a new company, and we are at the early stages of this startup. Our focus of development have been on the battery pack itself. Reducing the size of the power adapter has always been in our pipeline, but to make it happen, we would need to raise much more than $50,000. Power adapters are not cheap (i.e. - 60W Apple MagSafe for a 13 in. Macbook Pro retails for $79.00). To be perfectly honest, the manufacturing price we ve found for our original 140W power adapter ranged from $10-$25 dollars. However, after seeing the amazing support from our wonderful Backers, letting us reach $70,000, we ve been reaching out to power adapter manufacturers and engineers 24/7 to find a way of developing a new power adapter unique for LumoPack. After countless hours of searching over the past couple of weeks, we found a way to make this happen. With an extended goal of $100,000, we will have the financial capability to R&D, design, mold, produce, and deliver a new power adapter that will be significantly smaller! As of right now, we are averaging a size of about 80x80x25mm (3.15in x 3.15in x 0.98), which offers an amazing ratio of wattage per cubic inch. That is an approximate 60% decrease in size from the original power adapter. Notice the ratio is better than chargers on the market today. By reaching this extended goal, all Backers will receive the newly developed power adapter with no additional cost! So, don t worry about having to pay extra or having to buy another reward. Thank you to everyone for believing in us. Let s make this extended goal a reality. LumoPack batteries are coated with a special material developed by Nivo Systems, Inc. known as Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). MOF represent an emerging class of materials that have attracted extensive interest because of their tunable porosities and versatile functionalities. Nivo has developed a special combination of materials that can enhance a Lithium-ion battery s capacity, power, and longevity. Nivo s MOF material used in the LumoPack focuses on the LiCoO2 cathode. The material is used for an advanced form of coating and doping in order to enhance the stability and performance in Lithium-ion batteries. This advanced coating works as a protective and scavenging layer, which results in significant fast charging capabilities and increased cycle performance. Comparing MOF with Leading Li-ion Dr. Wang, Co-Founder and CTO of Nivo Systems, is the scientist behind Nivo s MOF materials. His career as a scientist began under Dr. Omar M. Yaghi the Inventor of MOF. Although many events led to Dr. Wang becoming the successful scientist that he is today, the biggest turning point was when he received inspirational insight from Dr. Yaghi. Dr. Yaghi pointed out that as a theory in science, Dr. Wang s work can only impact those who understand it, but as a man who gets his science to the masses, he can change the world. After Dr. Wang mastered the theories of MOF technology under Dr. Yaghi, he set out to create his own variations of MOF that could be applicable to everyday lives. Determined to commercialize technology for the common good, Dr. Wang became the youngest tenured professor in the history of the Beijing Institute of Technology. Much of his research and work has been adopted by companies and governments across several of industries. Currently, his central work is the improvement of Lithium-ion batteries. Dr. Wang believes that his work can be used to benefit the world, which is why he founded Nivo Systems with two notable entrepreneurs from the United States: Dr. David Choi and Phillip Czernin. Dr. Wang developed MOF for the LiCoO2 cathode to enhance Lithium-ion batteries (the technology in Lyte s LumoPack), but such an application is merely just the beginning. His current developments include enhancing the Silicon anode and Li-Sulfur cathode, in hopes to further revolutionize battery technology. In early 2014, Lyte Systems was founded by Gordon and Neiv through Loyola Marymount University s incubator program. These two entrepreneurs were frustrated with wasting time being stuck to a wall, waiting for their devices to charge. Together they set out to free users from current battery constraints, thereby making mobile devices truly portable in the progress. LMU Incubator Presentation || Spring 2014 After successfully finishing LMU s incubator program as the top ranked project, Lyte s team continued its development of the world s fastest charging battery pack. Along the way, they joined up with Nivo Systems to utilize its groundbreaking Metal Organic Framework (MOF) technology, and also teamed up with a leading developer and manufacturer of consumer battery packs Carku Technology. Lyte s dream is to not only to create a next-generation battery pack; its larger vision is to remove the time constraints of charging all electronic devices. By leveraging their new and advanced technologies, as well as their strategic partnerships, Lyte Systems is committed to finding new and innovative ways for us to live a truly mobile lifestyle. By funding this project, you will be giving us a platform to spread this technology. The benefits of MOF are not limited to battery packs, as it can be implemented into all lithium-ion related products. Not only will your help fund a project that will change our expectations of charging speeds, but you will also allow us to put more resources into furthering the future applications of this technology. In turn, this will allow us to create more innovative, efficient, and fast charging products for everyday life. Thanks for your support!|

So many problemsEveryone knows how agonizing it is to hold that untouchably hot metal utensil handle, how frustrating it is to see that wooden handle with scorch marks and how ugly your melted plastic utensil handle looks because its been resting on the edge of the pan that has been on the stove for too long. Not to mention the melted plastic from spatula heads getting into your food! Also, does the spoon slipping into the serving dish sound familiar? How about those messy drips when you move your spoon from the pot to the spoon rest? Arghh.. Metal cooking utensils get too hot. Burn marks on wooden spatulas. Melted plastic utensils look ugly and pose health risk. Spoons sliding into the serving dish is embarrassing and unhygienic. One single solution These problems are ubiquitous and have been existing in our kitchens for ages. Looking at these common problems, we conducted a survey and we were not at all surprised by the feedback. Every single person who took the survey faced the same exact problems and was eager for a solution. Snug Ideation Images Early Snug Prototypes This is when we started drawing the picture of a simple yet elegant gadget in our mind, this one single solution, that will take care of all the above problems. After months of brain storming, mechanical and industrial design, several iterations of prototypes, feedback from trial groups and intense testing, we came up with an optimally engineered, aesthetically seductive and Patent Pending innovation The Snug.

Snug comes in Small and Large sizes to fit most of the handles. To put on the Snug, just grab the utensil with its handle and insert it through the top slot of the Snug. Turn the handle inside the Snug for a tight fit. Once installed, you do not need to take it out to stir food. SNUG contact with food is no problem! The silicone material is FDA approved, just like other silicone spatula material in the market.When you wish to use the utensil for stirring food, just grab it in your hand, make it rest on the edge of the pot that you are cooking in using the notch at the bottom of the Snug, stir your food and put it back on the edge, without having to use a spoon rest and preventing messy drips. Also rest assured that the handle will always remain cool and the Snug won t melt or burn even if it is made to rest on the hot pan or pot for hours on straight! Hold metal handles without thinking twice - with Snug. [Small Sized Snug shown here] Snug makes melted plastic spatulas a thing of the past! [Large Sized Snug shown here] No need to throw away expensive plastic spatulas anymore! [Large Sized Snug shown here] Snugs in daily useWatch a casual video below to show the Snugs in daily use to paint a better picture of their use. Thermal imaging camera clearly shows the difference You can also install Snug on various types of serving spoons, whisks and even ice cream scoops (not kidding!), before serving so that it stops the utensils from sliding into the serving dish, mixing bowl or ice cream bucket even when sub-consciously left against the edge. Prevent spoons from sliding into the serving dish. [Small Sized Snug shown here] Pretty spoon savers! [Small Sized Snug shown here] No need for spoon rests. Snug on whisks keeps the mess where it belongs - in the pan. [Large Sized Snug shown here] Use Snug when you need the lid slightly open while cooking. Snug fits onto most of the utensils out there! Feel free to be creative with it. [Size of Snug used here from Left to Right - S,S,L,L,L,L,L] Snug is designed to work with pots and pans with or without a lip at the rim. ConstructionSnug is made of FDA approved, high temperature grade Silicone material, that is heat resistant up to 570 F (or 300 C), sufficiently more than what you would ever need in the kitchen. This helps thermally insulate the utensil handle and keeps it cool. Snug is optimally designed to provide adequate flexibility around the top slot so that it can easily accommodate most of the utensil handles and also provide just the right stiffness at the bottom notch to give that nice snug feel when placing on the pot. Key Features Easy to install and remove on almost any utensil in your home or in the market Available in a variety of enticing colors High temperature (heat resistant up to 570 F or 300 C), FDA approved food grade silicone material provides thermal insulation and prevents utensil handles from getting too hot Prevents messy drips Stops the servings spoons from sliding into food Made of anti-aging and anti-bacterial material Very easy to clean, Dishwasher safe Thoughtfully shaped so that there are no nooks, crannies, or edges where food can get stuck, thus preventing bacterial growth US Patent Pending You got to see it to believe it! Easy to wash by hand under running water. Scrub if needed. Snug is designed with washing and hygiene in mind. There are no nooks or crannies where food can get stuck. Snug is completely Dishwasher safe. You can even throw it in there installed on the spatulas. Endurance TestingSnug has already gone through (and is going through) a lot of endurance stress tests before making it to your kitchen: High temperature tests while cooking on the stove Flame tests (sitting in the flame) for 2 minutes just in case you drop it. See picture above for results. It did not melt or smoke : ) Cycle tests (Handle insertion and rotation) on the upper hole Cycle tests on the lower notch Dishwasher tests Hand wash and scrubbing tests Food color seepage tests Detailed Design Elements Design Features Funding needed for Injection Molding Tooling for both sizes (small and large) Minimum Order Quantities (MOQ) the manufacturer requires us to make for each size and color Packaging and Labor charges for MOQ Note about Retail PriceApproximate retail price would be ranging from $17 to $25 depending on the number of Snugs per pack.

307`"At first I thought, 'oh great, another hipster bike thing.' But the Buca Boot is quite remarkable in its use of space and materials." - UnderConsideration "It's the stuff city-cycling dreams are made of." - Refinery 29The StoryNothing beats the convenience of riding your bike. I do it everyday. But I really hate worrying about how to carry around all the stuff that comes with a busy life. What if it rains? What if I get cold? What if I want to go to that party later? What if I need to pick up groceries or grab a six-pack?The Buca Boot answers those questions. It holds everything from a pair of shoes to a laptop to a case of beer. It keeps your things dry in the rain and safe when you walk away. Did we mention it looks good, too?Over the past year, I ve worked with an amazing team to create the prototype you see here. With your help, we can bring the Buca Boot to life and make it easier to choose your bike everyday. The idea for Buca Boot was born while cycling the streets of London. I was always going somewhere to classes at LSE, to a museum, to the pub, or all three in a row. Every activity required me to carry different things. I felt like a pack mule taking it all on my bike. I started thinking wouldn t it be great if I could treat my bike the way that everyone treats a car trunk (or boot, as they call it in Britain), where you can just toss a gym bag or an extra pair of shoes in the trunk, no problem? Over the last four years, I've enlisted various designers and engineers to realize my vision. We worked through iteration after iteration just trying to nail the combination of features that make the Buca Boot different: security, weather resistance, and a flexible lid system. In 2013, the final team came together and made something we wanted to share with the world. Who We Are Our team shares a passion for biking and beautiful, purposeful design. Kathryn Carlson is a big-thinking economist who lives in Boston and bikes 365 days a year. She had the original spark for Buca Boot and brought the team together to make it a reality.Tomorrow Lab designs and engineers products from its Manhattan studio and was founded by Dean DiPietro, Pepin Gelardi, and Theodore Ullrich. With more than 35 years of collective experience, they know how to manage the manufacturing process and bring a new product to launch.Guts & Glory is Faun Chapin and Meg Paradise, a creative collaborative that specializes in crafting brands that use storytelling to build connections. Where is Your Money Going? We funded the prototype with our own savings and lots of sweat equity. But setting up a full manufacturing process is expensive we can t do it alone. The biggest expenses are manufacturing the lids and setting up the molds to make the base and hinge/locking system. Until we get large enough for huge orders (come on REI, order 10,000!), even the material cost adds up. The Manufacturing Process: Next StepsWe have already arranged for manufacturers in New York and China to make the base and side panniers (although we re still looking for ways to make everything here holler if you re interested!). Once we secure funding, we can pay for the largest fixed cost of the project: the molds for the plastic base of the boot and hinge system.We re working with an apparel manufacturer in New York City to make the side pannier bags. They produced the nylon canvas panniers for our prototypes and have patterns ready for a larger production run. The lids are the final piece. We are working with a shop in Western Massachusetts to test marine grade mahogany and sourcing and testing bamboo from suppliers in China. After living through a Massachusetts winter with the potential lids, we will decide which is best. Thank you!A huge heartfelt thank you to all the family and friends who have provided support over the many years of this development, the wonderful advice from other mentors, entrepreneurs and cyclists and of course our team! With special thanks to our awesome videographer, Carlo Paolo Espiritu of wildnice fame for his talent, time and devotion to this project!

See update #14 from May 4 for photos and details of our new add-ons and stretch goals. Boy Story, finally a cool boy doll for all kids. We teach our kids diversity. Our world is diverse. But the toy market has failed to embrace inclusion and diversity. Boy Story adds boys into the missing equation, so our children see dolls just like them - boys and girls - in the toy aisles. Boy Story brings Action Dolls to the world: 18" boy dolls with adjustable ball-joints to join the action and fun with all the girl dolls out there. Action Dolls are cool. Action Dolls encourage pretend play and imagination. Action Dolls are for all kids. Action Dolls are just plain FUN. Click here to read about why our Action Doll joints are so unique! Action Dolls: 18" dolls with specially designed ball joints to pose like an action figure! One of the biggest difference between our Action Doll and a standard 18" doll is that we added extra joints, 11 points of articulation to be exact. On top of that, most standard dolls are strung even if they do have extra joints (5 joints is most common in dolls). First thing we prioritized was quality and durability. These Action Dolls are so fun, we expect kids to drag them through mud, load them in bike baskets, romp through fields, and toss them through the air. We have seen all the crazy and imaginative ways kids play with our Action Dolls. Just as they were designed. These dolls are meant to be PLAYED with. The dolls are made of: High quality phthalate-free vinyl for the head, limbs, and ball joints (limiting scratches and making for easy cleanup) Durable, yet squeezable, cotton twill for the soft body (rugged enough to endure years of play, but soft enough to sleep/cuddle with) We even sculpted the hair styles of each Action Doll to avoid tangled, messy hair disasters. We expect messes! Thanks to the molded hair, you can simply wipe the dolls clean and they're back in action. Second, we designed the dolls to be cool, boyish, and diverse. Missing from mainstream 18" doll lines are detailed facial features capturing the uniqueness we love in children. Most 18 dolls limit changes to skin tone and hair color, and many children (especially boys) are not represented. Even the boy dolls out there, we found, often look like they are wearing makeup or are girl dolls with cut hair. Boy Story believes that children s toys especially those representing humans should be as diverse as the kids who play with them. Making unique dolls has not been cheap, but the results are completely worth the cost. We will continue to make different face molds for each of our Action Dolls. Our line starts with two unique boys, Billy and Mason, and we have many more planned (sneak peek in the "Meet the Boys" section below). Third, our dolls had to move! We came up with the idea for Action Dolls as a combo between action figures with their super cool poses and traditional dolls. Our Action Dolls have 11 points of articulation! Most standard dolls have few or even no joints, and those with joints are usually entirely elastic-strung, with extremely limited movement. Our dolls have 6 specially designed ball joints, 4 sewn and strung cup joints at the soft body, and a unique neck joint that allows the head to twist and tilt. These separate ball joints were specially designed to move in all different directions, as well as hold strong poses. Click here to read more about the joints! Last, (but not least) our Action Dolls represent real boys and wear cool outfits just like your little tyke. The quality of the outfits, as well as their designs, are as close as we could get to the real deal. We are talking eye-catching designs that would really be worn by a boy today. This means real buttons, zippers, brass snaps, laces, cuffed jeans, and little tiny canvas shoes, to name a few! Our clothing line is expanding rapidly, and in addition to regular outfits, we will be introducing special outfits designed to expand pretend and role play (think: soldiers, super heroes, pilots, scientists, etc.) (think also: stretch goal!). PS, (We know we said last... but...) can't forget to mention that our Action Dolls are designed to be compatible with standard 18" doll accessories. So get an Action Doll hurry for our limited quantity Kickstarter specials! to join in the fun and complete your doll collection today. We are Boy STORY. Reading unlocks the imagination. It develops a sense of wonder and fun. It teaches life lessons. Boy Story encourages reading through exciting, illustrated adventure stories that spill out of the page and into our Action Dolls. Kids can close the book and keep the adventure going. Statistics show that although girls scores in S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) related subjects are improving (thanks to great toys such as Goldieblox and Roominate working to encourage girls interest in S.T.E.M. related subjects), boys reading scores continue to lag behind. A cool Action Doll with an adventure story encourages and introduces reading in new ways to both boys and girls. For the collector (or just the kid) in you. With the quality level of the Action Dolls so high, we made absolutely sure to do everything we could to make each doll and book collectable. Every Action Doll comes with its own Boy Story Certificate of Authenticity. Production numbers are printed on the tag, and will serve to prove that you have the very first Boy Story Action Dolls ever to be made. We engraved the Boy Story logo on the bottom of each doll s foot as seen in the photo below. (This is an image of a molded part, so the foot will not actually be gold, it will be skin tone.) The books are both made and printed in the USA. We wanted Boy Story's adventure books to be really special, so we designed them to be standard collectable comic book size, yet read like a chapter book. They are filled with beautiful and colorful illustrations and are printed on thick satin-finish pages. The covers are soft with a velvety matte finish, and we are looking into adding a spot gloss to the covers and a watermark page to our books as a stretch goal. Both the books and dolls are made to last and even be passed down through generations to come. Boy Story takes pride in putting safety first! Our co-founder is a mom of two boys, and she always says "As a mom, being certain that the toy my child is playing with is safe is not something I take lightly. Boy Story's Action Dolls are going through rigorous safety testing for sales in the US, Canada, and Europe. Action Dolls are safe for children ages 3+ due to small parts. Mason! If there's one thing you will remember about Mason, it's that he has a wild imagination. This kid is always thinking up the most exciting adventures. Never a dull moment with him. He loves to ask questions, frequents the library, and has a big mystery to solve! Billy! Get ready for a belly full of laughs with this character because Billy is a bit of a prankster. When he is around, you'd better watch out for strategic placement of his pet frog (yikes!). He lives in Louisiana and loves to grab his backpack and go exploring through the Bayou. He s not even afraid of the monstrous alligator that roams these parts. Tons of excitement awaits with Billy! And now for the SNEAK PEEK at the next two characters to be featured in a Boy Story: Aspen! Aspen is always on the move, traveling around the world with his mom, who is an Army Sergeant. Much more than a military brat, Aspen s a huge fan of baseball and can be a bit shy when meeting new friends and being in new places. On his latest adventure in Japan, he soon finds that he has a lot more in common with the local kids than he thought. Friendships blossom and baseball games abound! Kenji! Kenji loves making new friends and is a superstar on his baseball league. He has a heart of gold and enjoys teaching people all about his Japanese culture. Hmmm, sounds like Aspen and Kenji could end up being great friends, but you ll have to wait to find out! ~~~3 PIECE BUTTON PACK~~~ 3 Piece Button Pack ~~~BOY STORY BOOK~~~ Choose one or get them both.

309`The concept Coaster Craft is an age old and simple concept that I just wanted to see through execution. I almost never use a coaster and I always get sideways glances or worse for it. But who really wants to use most coasters anyway? So I set out to create a coaster I would want to use and I hope enough of you out there like it enough to make it a reality.First I worked through several material options and settled on a brushed stainless steel for its look and durability. Then I thought - what else can this thing do? Which lead to stamping a bottle opener in it. Then I worked with AntiDesigns here in Boston to develop awesome Craft Beer graphics for these slick stainless steel coasters. The Coasters Everything is designed and I have several prototypes. The factory is ready for orders and I'm ready to make it happen. I just need some kickstarter help to get the volume up enough to make this happen. So please join in bringing about coasters people will actually want to use! Sample all packed up Any questions? Hit me up directly on twitter @robjday or check out our company twitter @FuhlSpeed or message me right here.Cheers! Coasters In Real Life
310`|LumoPack is a reliable, fast-charging, portable battery pack.Charge LumoPack at 140 Watts for six minutes to store enough power to give your iPhone 6 a full charge! LumoPack was designed to be a simple product, reducing the noise that is often magnified by competitors looking to differentiate themselves in the marketplace. Portable electronics (i.e. smartphones) have gotten exponentially better with each passing year. Successive generations feature better CPUs, cameras, screens, and cellular signals, which all place an increasing strain on the battery.The development of batteries has not kept pace with our portable electronics. This led to an increased demand for battery packs. However there is a problem within the battery market.Too often, battery packs differentiate themselves through their PACK (form, style, and gimmicks), instead of the actual BATTERY. Lyte has focused on what matters most the science of the battery cell. To make all this happen, Lyte has combined forces with Nivo Systems and incorporated Nivo s groundbreaking Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF) technology into LumoPack. Applying Nivo s MOF material into LumoPack has brought 3 major improvements: Accelerated Charge Times: Detach from the wall and stay on-the-go. LumoPack can be charged at 140 watts that s 14-28 times more than standard battery packs (5-10 watts).As a result, after just 6 minutes of charging, LumoPack stores enough power for a full iPhone 6 charge, and after 9 minutes, enough power for a Samsung Galaxy S6. LumoPack s battery only needs 30 minutes for a full charge (6000 mAh). ***Recharges based on iPhone 6 mAh capacity*** Battery packs today that offer higher charging power over industry standards, do so at the expense of cycle life, which can drop as low as 50-100 cycles. In contrast, the LumoPack battery cell allows it to sustain high charging speeds without risking cycle life. Not only does the LumoPack charge at a high wattage, but it also extends the Battery Cycle Life!* *Battery Cycle Life refers to the number of complete charges & discharges before the battery falls below 80% of original storage capacity. Extended Cycle Life: LumoPack is a longer lasting product. Approx. Battery Life Cycles Ever wonder why your old laptop or phone dies soon after it s charged up to 100%? It s because you ve used up your cycle life. The standard batteries today last about 300 cycles, with most leaders in the industry maxing out at 500 cycles. However, this number is only at its most ideal conditions, which is usually never the case. In comparison, even with faster charging, the LumoPack can sustain 1000 charge cycles, that s 2-3 times the industry standard today! Battery Coating: Battery bulging? Catching on fire? EXPLODING? The MacBook Pro's battery is bulging and causing the trackpad to pop out and crack. Not with LumoPack! Increase Safety with MOF As time passes, Lithium-ion battery cells degrade, which in turn leaves space in the cell for unwanted gases, such as oxygen, to enter. This is what can cause your batteries to bulge, catch on fire, or even explode. MOF technology coats and protects LumoPack s battery cell, thus significantly reducing these risks. Did you know? large lithium-ion battery packs are starting to be banned globally on flights due to these safety risks. LumoPack is compatible with all USB enabled devices. Have some fun with LumoPack's 3D model below: ___________ ___________ Compared to most conventional battery packs, which only offer one way of charging (usually through a micro USB port), LumoPack comes with three different charging methods to maximize convenience for all your charging scenarios. The three types include: Micro USB Charger, Car Charger, and Wall Charger. The Micro USB Charger is the standard way of charging most battery packs on the market today. This method charges LumoPack at 10W (5V x 2A). This is convenient if you want to charge LumoPack through your computer. It can also be used as a back-up charger to carry with you. Charging with the Micro USB Charger will be much slower than the 140W Car Charger and Wall Charger methods. The Car Charger is made for your on-the go needs. Whether you are traveling in a cab, bus, or your own vehicle, the Car Charger offers an extremely portable method for you to charge LumoPack at its full 140W capability. The image above shows a Car Charger which is about 4 feet long, but this is not set in stone. The length will be based on the preference of our Backers, which will be conducted through a post-campaign survey on KickStarter. The LumoPack Wall Charger is designed to charge LumoPack at 140W. However, the Wall Charger is significantly bigger than both chargers above because it needs to pull a high 140W current from the wall. Please refer to the sections below for a better understanding of the Wall Charger. Power adapters have always given us the feeling of carrying around a brick, in a manner of speaking. Imagine a laptop charger that needs power ranging anywhere from 45W~85W or more (i.e. MacBook Pro 15 - 85W). Now, imagine if it offered 140 watts of power. The size of the power adapters are relative to the amount of output wattage. 140W adapters on the market today are very large. We have continually searched for the best 140W wall chargers available, however, due to the unpopularity of 140W chargers, there hasn t been much development to them and they remain relatively big in size. This leads us to presenting our Extended Goal. As you all know, Lyte is a new company, and we are at the early stages of this startup. Our focus of development have been on the battery pack itself. Reducing the size of the power adapter has always been in our pipeline, but to make it happen, we would need to raise much more than $50,000. Power adapters are not cheap (i.e. - 60W Apple MagSafe for a 13 in. Macbook Pro retails for $79.00). To be perfectly honest, the manufacturing price we ve found for our original 140W power adapter ranged from $10-$25 dollars. However, after seeing the amazing support from our wonderful Backers, letting us reach $70,000, we ve been reaching out to power adapter manufacturers and engineers 24/7 to find a way of developing a new power adapter unique for LumoPack. After countless hours of searching over the past couple of weeks, we found a way to make this happen. With an extended goal of $100,000, we will have the financial capability to R&D, design, mold, produce, and deliver a new power adapter that will be significantly smaller! As of right now, we are averaging a size of about 80x80x25mm (3.15in x 3.15in x 0.98), which offers an amazing ratio of wattage per cubic inch. That is an approximate 60% decrease in size from the original power adapter. Notice the ratio is better than chargers on the market today. By reaching this extended goal, all Backers will receive the newly developed power adapter with no additional cost! So, don t worry about having to pay extra or having to buy another reward. Thank you to everyone for believing in us. Let s make this extended goal a reality. LumoPack batteries are coated with a special material developed by Nivo Systems, Inc. known as Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). MOF represent an emerging class of materials that have attracted extensive interest because of their tunable porosities and versatile functionalities. Nivo has developed a special combination of materials that can enhance a Lithium-ion battery s capacity, power, and longevity. Nivo s MOF material used in the LumoPack focuses on the LiCoO2 cathode. The material is used for an advanced form of coating and doping in order to enhance the stability and performance in Lithium-ion batteries. This advanced coating works as a protective and scavenging layer, which results in significant fast charging capabilities and increased cycle performance. Comparing MOF with Leading Li-ion Dr. Wang, Co-Founder and CTO of Nivo Systems, is the scientist behind Nivo s MOF materials. His career as a scientist began under Dr. Omar M. Yaghi the Inventor of MOF. Although many events led to Dr. Wang becoming the successful scientist that he is today, the biggest turning point was when he received inspirational insight from Dr. Yaghi. Dr. Yaghi pointed out that as a theory in science, Dr. Wang s work can only impact those who understand it, but as a man who gets his science to the masses, he can change the world. After Dr. Wang mastered the theories of MOF technology under Dr. Yaghi, he set out to create his own variations of MOF that could be applicable to everyday lives. Determined to commercialize technology for the common good, Dr. Wang became the youngest tenured professor in the history of the Beijing Institute of Technology. Much of his research and work has been adopted by companies and governments across several of industries. Currently, his central work is the improvement of Lithium-ion batteries. Dr. Wang believes that his work can be used to benefit the world, which is why he founded Nivo Systems with two notable entrepreneurs from the United States: Dr. David Choi and Phillip Czernin. Dr. Wang developed MOF for the LiCoO2 cathode to enhance Lithium-ion batteries (the technology in Lyte s LumoPack), but such an application is merely just the beginning. His current developments include enhancing the Silicon anode and Li-Sulfur cathode, in hopes to further revolutionize battery technology. In early 2014, Lyte Systems was founded by Gordon and Neiv through Loyola Marymount University s incubator program. These two entrepreneurs were frustrated with wasting time being stuck to a wall, waiting for their devices to charge. Together they set out to free users from current battery constraints, thereby making mobile devices truly portable in the progress. LMU Incubator Presentation || Spring 2014 After successfully finishing LMU s incubator program as the top ranked project, Lyte s team continued its development of the world s fastest charging battery pack. Along the way, they joined up with Nivo Systems to utilize its groundbreaking Metal Organic Framework (MOF) technology, and also teamed up with a leading developer and manufacturer of consumer battery packs Carku Technology. Lyte s dream is to not only to create a next-generation battery pack; its larger vision is to remove the time constraints of charging all electronic devices. By leveraging their new and advanced technologies, as well as their strategic partnerships, Lyte Systems is committed to finding new and innovative ways for us to live a truly mobile lifestyle. By funding this project, you will be giving us a platform to spread this technology. The benefits of MOF are not limited to battery packs, as it can be implemented into all lithium-ion related products. Not only will your help fund a project that will change our expectations of charging speeds, but you will also allow us to put more resources into furthering the future applications of this technology. In turn, this will allow us to create more innovative, efficient, and fast charging products for everyday life. Thanks for your support!|
311`UPDATE 7/02: We've hit our first stretch goal which means the book will be hardcover!UPDATE 6/24: We are excited to announce Gigantic Worlds will include rare and previously uncollected work from J. G. Ballard and Philip K. Dick!UPDATE 6/21: We are thrilled and humbled to say we've hit our initial goal! Stretch goals added below. UPDATE 6/19: We are insanely excited to announce that the great Michael DeForge will be doing the cover for the anthology! What is Gigantic Worlds? The weeping planet of sadness, the cackling planet of joy, the realm of night and nightmares, a city composed entirely of clones of 18th-century novelists, and the world of mole people tunneling mere miles below our feet... Gigantic Worlds, the first ever title from Gigantic Books, will be an anthology of science flash fiction and art published simultaneously in print and e-book form. The anthology will feature original work by contemporary writers such as Jonathan Lethem, Ed Park, J. Robert Lennon, Lynne Tillman, and Matt Bell (see list below). These stories will transport you to other worlds realms of the unknown, the unbelievable, the logically illogical, and the disturbing or disturbed. And unlike the disposable paperbacks and poorly formatted e-books that litter garbage dumps both terrestrial and virtual, Gigantic Worlds will be a beautiful art object that deserves a permanent place on your shelf or hard drive. Both the e-book and print editions will feature gorgeous color illustrations by contemporary artists such as Michael DeForge, Luisa Kazanas, and Panayiotis Terzis. Why science flash fiction? We could talk about how in an age of Google Glass and remote-controlled drones our own reality is becoming increasingly unreal, making science fiction more important than ever. But really we re just huge fans of the genre. Although our background is in the literary world, we ve always thought the barrier between literary and genre is about as solid as a hologram. Gigantic Worlds will feature a wide range of work from a wide variety of authors, so whether science fiction to you means J. G. Ballard, Ursula K. Le Guin, H. P. Lovecraft, or Italo Calvino, you will find work inside that you will love. Why flash fiction? Gigantic has always focused on flash fiction. It is simply what we love, know, and do best. Science flash fiction poses a unique challenge, since the author has a limited number of words to impart a whole other reality. But if all the matter in the universe was compacted into a singularity before exploding out in a big bang, we are confident our writers can wow you in a few hundred words. Who will be in it? Authors already on board include: Jonathan Lethem, author of The Fortress of Solitude J. Robert Lennon, author of Castle Lynne Tillman, author of Someday This Will Be Funny Laird Barron, author of The Croning Grace Krilanovich, author of The Orange Eats Creeps Ed Park, author of Personal Days Christopher Kennedy, author of Nietzsche's Horse Matt Bell, author of Cataclysm Baby Alexandra Chasin, author of Brief Adam Wilson, author of Flatscreen Kyle Minor, author of In the Devil's Territory Adrian Van Young, author of The Man Who Noticed Everything Amber Sparks, author of May We Shed These Human Bodies Clancy Martin, author of How to Sell Seth Fried, author of The Great Frustration Corey Zeller, author of Man Vs Sky James Brubaker, music editor at The Fiddleback Ben Segal, ed. of The Official Catalog of the LIbrary of Potential Literature Blake Butler, author of There Is No Year Helen Phillips, author of And Yet They Were Happy Virginia Zech Jedediah Berry, author of The Manual of Detection J. G. Ballard (rare and previously uncollected work) Philip K. Dick (rare and previously uncollected work) and more to come! We are also looking for submissions from YOU. In addition to aesthetic diversity, Gigantic Books thinks it s important to maintain diversity of race, gender, sexual orientation, and country (or planet) of origin. We encourage writers from all backgrounds and all known points of the universe to submit.We have an open submission period right now! so click here to see our guidelines. Submit and donate and be a part of the very anthology you help create! Where will the money go? How amazing we can make Gigantic Worlds depends on how much you give. As long as we hit our minimum goal, Gigantic Worlds will be a beautifully designed and illustrated full-length book on high-quality paper. But the more money we raise, the more we can do. More illustrations, more color, more content, a guaranteed professional rate for our contributors, and all the bells and whistles at our designer s hands, from linen-bound hardcover to hot foil stamping. Our expenses include: printing with color illustrations, ISBN purchase, Kickstarter fees, design, website, and shipping. When can I get my hands/tentacles/clamps on it? Gigantic Worlds will be out by the end of 2013. It will then be made available online and at select independent bookstores. Backers will have their copies beamed to their homes first. About Gigantic Gigantic is a Brooklyn-based magazine of short prose and art edited by Lincoln Michel and James Yeh.

312`Thank you so much for taking a few minutes out of your day to stop by and consider backing my first Kickstarter project - Meepillows! I want to personally thank you in writing since the producers of the video didn't think I had "it" to speak on camera (self-reflection is very hard). I want to sincerely express my appreciation to you and the hobby that has changed my life - board games! Is it weird to say that? Perhaps. But through all the friends I have met, all the colleagues I have connected with, all the strain my brain has endured at game night, and all the good times it all has brought, I feel that it has changed my life in a very positive way.Now, here I am! Instead of backing another board game on Kickstar...hold on......yeah, I just backed another game on Kickstarter...Anyway, I finally decided to create my own board game related project. I not only started my company Top Shelf Fun through my innate desire to be a part of this great hobby, but to bring something different to the tabletop/sofa. By backing this project you are not just helping me bring a Meepillow to your gameroom, but you are helping me set my company up for sucess to create other future projects! There are some pretty hefty minimums from the manufacturer to bring a plush to life, and I am doing it with 6 different colors! It's crazy, but I am confident we can make this happen. I really believe we can do this together!So, once again, a big "thank you" for stopping by while your boss isn't looking to help my dream become a reality! Now, I know what you are thinking! What are 'Thank You' goals? Well, when I started this project I didn't know what to expect. At all. I knew that I didn't have the ability to upgrade the Meepillow in any way as a product (no component upgrades were possible), so I didn't include "Stretch Goals" in my campaign. Since this was my first Kickstarter I also wanted to keep it simple and clean.Fast forward a couple weeks and I was so overwhelmed by the community, the support, and how fast I surpassed my initial funding goal I just had to figure out a way to thank each of you. I wanted to express my appreciation in a fun way. A gamer's way!So, here are the special 'Thank You' Goals we have unlocked thus far:1. Future Discounts: Each backer will receive special codes after the campaign ends that will entitle them to future exclusive discounts on my website.2. End of Campaign Game: After the campaign has ended I will be taking a survey. I will ask each backer two questions:A. What was the most popular Meepillow color of the campaign?B. What was the total quantity sold of that Meepillow?The backer who was closest to the correct answer of the correct color (you can go over) will win a free set of all 6 Meepillows! In case of a tie there will (of course) be a D20 roll off which will be recorded on video. 3. Official Meepillow Certificate: At the end of the campaign every backer will receive a link to a set of "Official Meepillow Guarantee" .pdf files. There will be 6 .pdfs (one for each Meepillow color) and these particular certificates (blue shown below) will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers only! The Meepillow Guarantee! Again, thank you so much for all of your support. I certainly couldn't have done it without you! A "meeple" is a little wooden pawn used in many modern day board games to represent a player. "Meeple" is believed to be a combination of the words "my" and "people." The meeple originated in the board game Carcassonne which was released about 15 years ago and continues to make gamers out of unsuspecting people today! Glorious Meeples!!! Since then, meeples have been used in countless other board games and have become the unofficial symbol of modern day tabletop gaming. Nowadays, meeples are not only used to represent people, but animals, creatures, monsters, and much, much more. You see them in logos, t-shirts, playing cards, and many other suprising places!They're everywhere! Meepillow Blueprint Meepillows are my interpretation of what the offspring of meeples and pillows would look like. They are soft, huggable and will definitely liven up any room in your home. They are 15 inches tall, almost 16 inches wide and 6 inches thick. They were born out of my love of board games and the tabletop game industry as a whole. The original 6 colors were chosen based on popular player colors used in modern day board games, but from this Kickstarter I hope to grow this business with new sizes and colors! I knew from the beginning that shipping would be a challenge. Unlike other projects, this one would pose a logistical problem of shipping many multiple large items together. The Meepillow is already quite large and an odd shape, and adding multiple units makes the shipping box huge! So, I decided to absorb shipping costs best I could, offer discount tiers on different reward levels, and ship from multiple fulfillment warehouses that will help offset the insane costs. "Dimension Weight" is my least favorite combination of words right now!1 Meepillow: US $8 / The World $102 Meepillows: US $15 / The World $183 Meepillows: US $20 / The World $254 Meepillows: US $25 / The World $325 Meepillows: US $29 / The World $406 Meepillows: US $32 / The World $47Many months later of pulling my hair out it turns out in the end the cost to ship was simply unavoidable. I stopped worrying and decided to just love the project.I hope you do too! I went through a few companies and prototypes until I fined tuned the meeple shape that works best as a giant huggable plush. Even though the shape is simple, it is iconic and it needed to be perfect. Otherwise it would have just been a blob or a weird starfish shape. Making the shape work was surprisingly more difficult than expected. Receiving these prototypes was so amazing. All the hard work was starting to pay off. Having them in hand and being able to show people validated what I already knew. These Meepillows were not only cool to look at, but incredibly soft and quite epic! Prototypes in all their meeple glory! Since the prototypes are just, well, prototypes I needed to test multiple colors as well. In the end the Purple Meepillow (which is clearly more of a lavender above) and the Yellow Meepillow will see the biggest changes.Please note that your screen will not accurately portray the colors exactly how they will be in final product. Between the camera used to photograph the fabric, the lighting, and your computer/phone screen it can be difficult to show the colors exactly as they are represented. Have faith though! They are vibrant and accurate to my specifications! Final Red Swatch Final Blue Swatch Final Green Swatch Final Black Swatch Final Yellow Swatch Final Purple Swatch Help spread the word by downloading these cool Meepillow avatars and using them on different social media sites! Top Shelf Fun was born out of a love for fun, geeky and just plain awesome stuff. Board games, action figures, comic books, pop culture memorabilia, and video games are just a few of my favorite things. When there is no room left on my shelves, the toys will walk the earth.As Top Shelf Fun was indeed born out of a love of board games, Meepillows are the first board game products to be born out of Top Shelf Fun. With your help I will not only kickstart Meepillows, but it will be the foundation of all future products (in which I have many)!I can't thank you enough for your support!A very special 'Thank You' to the following people who helped me get this project off the ground:Kristan Delle - Wife and big-time supporter of my shenanigans.Rob McClure - Actor, editor, and all around great guy.Maggie Lakis - Actress, director, and best friend.Keith Bailey - Art assets and long time chum of immense talent.Brae Howard - Photographer extraordinaire.Kiril Tchangov - Top Shelf Fun logo & Meepillow Certificate designer.
313`Mighty Mug Barware - The Only Barware That Won't Fall Over How many times have you been relaxing with a drink when, suddenly, you accidentally knock it over? It s even worse when the spill is red wine on your carpet, craft brew on the laptop, or scotch on your pants.Well, we put a stop to the madness. Move aside old-fashioned drinkware! The everyday worry of knocking a glass over became tiring, so we created a revolutionary solution to this universal problem: Mighty Mug Barware - the only barware that grips when knocked into.Able to withstand knocks from 360 degrees, Mighty Mug Barware will not topple over if bumped into, but will lift up naturally when you go in for a sip. That means: say goodbye to murder scene looking wine stains, fried laptops, and embarrassing wardrobe malfunctions. SmartGrip Technology - Some Next Level IshThe Mighty Mug Barware collection grips to any smooth and solid surface such as your table, desk, counter, or bar.Sorcery? Trick of the eye? No, the magic is in our patented Smartgrip technology. Not to be confused with a magnet or suction cup, the Smartgrip at the bottom of the cup creates a vacuum that locks the mug onto the surface - effectively preventing it from being knocked over. The vacuum is released instantly when the mug is lifted straight up (requiring no extra effort). Specs These new glasses are made out of crystal clear, BPA Free Tritan plastic giving them enhanced clarity and making the Mighty Mug Barware an unbreakable collection. Plus, all of the cups in this line are top rack dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Each piece is uniquely designed to withstand toppling, while still holding the perfect amount of your beverage: RewardsWhether you're getting Mighty Mug for yourself, gifting it to friends and family, buying it for your staff, or thanking your wedding guests with this as a parting gift - we have the perfect reward for you. All Kickstarter Rewards will ship before the items hit any retail outlets.Born to Be Mighty. Born to Be Gifted. Mighty Mug Barware is the gift that will get your whole neighborhood talking. It arrives at your door ready to be gifted, so just wrap it up or throw it in a party bag and call it a day! Mighty Mug on A BoatIn order to test Mighty Mug Barware, we took it out on the high seas, along with our original models for some high seas adventure. While we shattered a few beer bottles, Mighty Mug hung in for the adventure! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Return to Kickstarter Since the successful launch of our travel mug last year, Mighty Mug has been featured in hundreds of publications around the world such as the New York Times, Core 77, Real Simple, The Verge and hundreds of other media outlets. After receiving press from around the world, many asked us for a Mighty Mug specially made to enjoy their adult beverages. So, we went to work and began designing a variety of glasses that will be able to hold any drink you choose. This new campaign is to drive the project s finishing stage, so it can be delivered straight to your favorite bottle.Help us by sharing Mighty Mug with your friends! Faster + Better + Stronger = Mighty While our first campaign was a great success, we learned many important lessons that will help make this campaign run much more smoothly for backers. #1 International Shipping: For our first campaign, we shipped all packages via USPS (United States Postal Service). While this worked out well for US & Canada Backers, it was not optimal for International Backers (as it took their package 6 or more weeks to arrive). Resolution: This year all International Backers will have their rewards shipped via an expedited manner and rewards will arrive in 7-10 of leaving our office. #2 Tracking Information: Another lesson we learned during our first campaign was that by shipping International packages by the USPS' least expensive option, backers were unable to track their packages from start to finish. Resolution: This year, all International Backers will have their rewards shipped with tracking information that will update them up until the package reaches their door. #3 Updates/ Customer Service: During our first campaign we were not ready for the interest level Mighty Mug received. Thus, we were not ready for the amount of inquiries that came in. Resolution: This year, we have added Customer Happiness members to our team. All questions/inquiries during this campaign will be answered in 24 hours or less.#4 Quality Improvement and Happiness Guarantee :With each new model, we have advanced the technology and improved the quality of all Mighty Mugs. We are confident that you will absolutely love your Mighty Mug, but if you re not 100% happy, we will replace it for you at any time.Saving the World One Mug At a Time Team Mighty We are a team of mechanical engineers and industrial designers that are dedicated to saving people from disastrous spills. So, we designed mugs that will not fall over when knocked into. We spent 4 years developing and perfecting Mighty Mug and its patented Smartgrip technology. We hope that you love Mighty Mug and that all of your days to come are spill free.Praise From Our First Mighty Mug Launch International BackersWe can ship Mighty Mug worldwide, with the exceptions of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. Please note that you may be responsible for duties, fees, and taxes applicable to your region. For The Tech Savvy Mighty Mug's innovative Smartgrip technology uses basic principles of physics by trapping air underneath its base when placed down. This unbelievably strong hold is possible because air cannot be stretched when the mug is pushed.The real magic is experienced when the mug is lifted straight up. The air pressure is equalized instantly allowing the user to naturally lift the mug just as you would any other mug. At only half an inch in height, the Smartgrip puck that powers Mighty Mug is able to withstand between 5-10 lbs of force. Try that on your old drinkware! Need help? We're here for you.If you have questions at any time, during or after the campaign, you can always reach us at getmighty@themightymug.com Retailer/Distributor InquiryAre you are a retailer or distributor interested in selling Mighty Mug?

316`Seekers of Knowledge! Raise thine heads and give ear to these words:I speak to you across the gulf of space and time through ways chthonic and astral, gifts of dark gods granted to us privileged few.On this day, I come to you offering a pact, a bargain to be struck and sealed through will, ink and blood. Sitting in my tower fastness I have heard the cries and incantations from the rifts below. They speak my name in tongues. They shout: Tell me your secrets. They demand: Fulfill what you have promised.And after spending this past month of darkness and damp weather in deep contemplation, I say to you: I have heard yon shouts and demands.Such secrets should be spoken, not kept silent. And so, I shall, from my tower, speak the ancient names, sing the spells and summon forth from the grave that which has nearly passed into the ages.And should you do your part, should you chant with me, should you lend your sweat, blood and tears, your will and faith, together we shall raise from the depths secrets once lost, but now reborn.Only together, locked in a frenetic dancing ritual, lasting 30 days and nights, can we accomplish what was heretofore impossible. Only together can we release the magic, monsters and secrets of lore that you so crave. Together we shall raid the ancient texts, reformulate forgotten spells and rebirth dead denizens. Should our spells prove fruitful, only then shall we: PUBLISH THE BURNING WHEEL GOLD CODEX. The Form of the ForgottenWe shall create a tome of similar dimension and density to the urtext, Burning Wheel Gold. Its cover shall shimmer cerulean and gold. Its pages shall have the hue of gossamer and bone. Its ink shall be black. And it shall contain: the paths and ways of the Dark Elves, Roden, Trolls and Great Wolves; an encyclopedia of traits and skills; an arcane library of magical ways; a libram of magic artifacts; and detailed commentary on nearly every aspect of the urtext itself.The Summoning RitualVital is the fire built during this cold-cloaked winter month, for long must it last us: The ritual we must enact requires patience and fortitude. Officiants familiar to you shall assist me with the offices: Thor Olavsrud and Topi Makkonen shall pore over the writhing texts and tame them, make them Gold; Jordan Worley, Kurt Komoda and Richard Luschek shall illuminate dreams and nightmares, and elucidate the ideas obscure through form and visage. Even now they begin their toils, while the day is short and night is yet long.And should our auguries be true, should the sleeping gods dream us into being and the waking gods forget us in their petty struggles, then said Codex shall become material before the dawning of the first day of the mighty convocation that the lay speak of as Gen Con. And we shall rejoice, together, wreathed in mystical knowledge.
317`If you love coffee as much as we do, we're sure you would LOVE to be able to drink it anytime anywhere. And so would we! That is why we decided to make a coffee mug that is practical and sustainable, but is also a fashion accessory and tells the primeval story of coffee. Its most obvious feature is definitely its shape which resembles the goat s horns but it also helps you drink that last sip of your coffee and makes you look good. We designed a special holder with leather touch which simply turns into a coffee mug stand so you can easily keep the Goat mug on your desk. Also, Goat mug comes with a set of two straps (short and longer part combine in to one), so you can simply attach it to your bag or just let it fall across your shoulder. This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around. Goat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE. Since you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand. Here's a look inside the Goat mug. It's shape makes it simple to clean. We designed a beautiful packaging to deliver your Goat mug in style. It can then become a perfect storage place for your fresh coffee beans. We would love for more coffee lovers to learn the real story about coffee as much as we would love all of them to be stylish and eco-friendly while drinking their coffee wherever and whenever. That is why we would appreciate you backing our project. Surely, there will be more coffees enjoyed if we manage to make our dream come true.Help us share our project among other coffee lover out there Awards structure: The first stretch goal is an idea we got from our backer Tamara. If we manage to raise $60,000 we will offer everyone a new colour option of the Goat mug - the PANTONE COLOUR OF THE YEAR: MARSALA. Let's do it! The second stretch goal is out! If we manage to raise $250,000 we will offer a new reward: HEMP EDITION Goat mug - for all those on the relaxed side of fashion. Never. Enough. Coffee. You asked for big, we're giving you GRANDE. Third streth goal is set to $350,000! Can we do this together? If all goes according to our plans, we will be shipping out products already in second half of February. Let's do this together! Design of the GOAT STORY Coffee mug was done by design studio Desnahemisfera in cooperation with MyEqua.

We have spent the last couple months sending our socks to media and other influencers their response has been amazing, with dozens of great reviews! Read them all at lilytrotters.com/testimonial.html "All we want to do is make pretty compression socks."This is the phrase we have been repeating over and over for the past three years. When the idea came up for Lily Trotters back in 2012, we had no idea how hard it would be to make high-quality, designer athletic compression socks. Designed, sourced, manufactured, and quality-tested in the USA, no less. But every hurdle, every challenge, every conversation that ended in, "Sorry, we can't help you what you are asking for cannot be done," has been worth it.It has been quite a journey. We started by doing small sock-wearing studies with healthy women who had never worn compression socks to ascertain whether they felt benefits wearing a 15-20mmHg compression sock; the feedback was a unanimous yes! Next, we did extensive market research to analyze the compression sock market and see where Lily Trotters might fit in. We talked to everybody and anybody who had different perspectives along the way. We learned and are still learning so much. Arranging for the production of our socks was a saga in itself. We cold-called so many sock mills in the USA. This was really hard, since most are over-booked and not in a position to even talk to a start-up, let alone develop a new product. Still, we got super lucky and found the right mill. They saw our vision from the get-go and have worked with us to explore every possibility. We have sampled nearly 30 prototypes to date, and discovered how to "knit in" different colored yarns without compromising the compression in our socks.Finally, we conducted a comprehensive sock-wearing study of our prototypes on female volunteers. The findings were overwhelmingly positive. Each and every step of the way we have looked for validation that we were designing a product that would be both desirable to and functional for women.All we wanted to do was make pretty compression socks. Lily Trotters are all that and more. Lily Trotters is not providing any medical advice. Please consult your doctor before wearing compression socks.

321`In Magicka Mayhem: The Card Game, you combine Elements to craft Spells from recipes found on Spell Cards... as long as it doesn't get MAYHEM-ified!SEE IT IN ACTION: CHECK OUT THE VIDEO ABOVE!!!Magicka Mayhem was designed to be fun for all levels of players from complete card game noobs (apparently, that s a real word that the kids use nowadays) to tabletop gaming Cracker Jacks. Spectacular Success, Epic #Fails and Pee-Your-Pants Hilarity! You can rain fiery death on your mortal enemies, protect yourself (or those luckiest enough to call you 'friend') using Elemental Shields or heal yourself (or your Wizards-in-arms) from injury. And if you don t like to get your hands dirty you can Summon Elementals to do your destructifying for you! Strategically combine Elements into Spells to: Destroy Your Foes Protect Your Friends and Summon Powerful Creatures to fight at your side. BUT, if Harry Potter taught us anything it s that Spellcasting IS NOT a perfect science! After every Spell there is a CHANCE that the target of your Spell will draw a Mayhem Card! What happens next is entirely up to the will of the Gods (i.e., whatever the Mayhem Card says!). WATCH OUT! Your Spell could get MAYHEM-ified! Mayhem cards can cause Your Spell to Blow Up in Your Face Save Your Butt from Disaster or Make You Pee Your Pants with Laughter! While your Spell could be made ridiculously more powerful or disastrously blow up in your face or anything in between, one thing is certain: the outcome will make you laugh your head off (which is WAY less messy than peeing your pants!). Gameplay Limited ONLY by Your IMAGINATION! Your Choice: LOTS of Great Strategies to Choose From Fetch the REWARDS!!! All from the mind of a 10 year-old boy. Ethan's dream of making his very own card game started with this 'pitch' video! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Ethan Needs Your HELP!!! While Ethan has amassed a small fortune in Birdie Bucks (his parents ridiculously babyish as Ethan puts it way of teaching him about personal finance), it appears that few graphic designers or playing card publishing houses accept Birdie Bucks as payment for their services. You and me! Let's make this happen! So, if you re into Card Games, Magic Spells, Super Successes, Epic #Fails and Peeing Your Pants (in a good way) then Magicka Mayhem: The Card Game is for you. The World According to ETHAN:: The Making of Magicka Mayhem One day my slightly immature gamer friend (AKA dad ) and I were playing Magicka on our computer when he said something like You know.... when the Zombie Apocalypse happens we ll probably be more likely to die of BOREDOM before ever getting eaten by any zombies. What WOULD we do for fun IF the Zombie Apocalypse actually happens or, worse, we had to go to grandma s house where her idea of advanced technology is a phone that doesn t PLUG INTO THE WALL??!?!?? So I made my 1st version of my game.... VERSION 1. I got to work and created these cards from some pieces of notebook paper and a dull pencil! VERSION 2: I added pictures to these cards. I think they look WAY better! EDITOR'S (i.e., 'dad') NOTE: Notice the misspelling of 'Shield'! ;-) VERSION 3: These cards were SO much more fun to play with and even look like real cards!!!! My friends liked them a lot too. My dad said we needed permission before we could sell the card game. My family and I like to watch Shark Tank so I knew about licensing because Mr. Wonderful is always talking about it (btw I would NEVER do a deal with Mr. Wonderful!!). Thank you Mr. Wonderful for teaching me about licensing but I still don't think I want to do a deal with you! I wrote a script for a video and recorded the video with my dad all on the same day. I did the video like the pitches that they do all the time on Shark Tank. This is the script that I wrote for the video that we sent to Paradox. We got an email back from Paradox in like a couple days. This is my favorite line from the email:"We get hundreds of pitches every month - most of them are...poop. Not only was yours good - but it also made us happy."TRUST ME .. when the Zombie Apocalypse happens you DO NOT want to be digging through the rubble of a game store. Imagine how dangerous Gamer Zombies are! Mad skills, strategic thinking and always eating junk food even when they are not hungry! SEEE! I just saved your life!!!! You're welcome. DO IT! DO IT RIGHT NOW!!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???? GET TO THE CHOPPER!!!!! GET MY GAME!!!! DO IT!!!!!!!!!Ethan Erickson (Double E)

Headphones that Tame the Cord Does this look familiar? If you've tried storing your headphones in a gym bag, desk drawer, or pants pocket, you've experienced the frustration of picking apart a tangled mess of plastic. Finding a way to neatly manage your cords can be a challenge, and when more than one is in the same container? Forget it! That's why we designed the CordCruncher Headphones. Outfitted with high-quality earbuds, the CordCruncher Headphone's elastic sleeve allows you to customize your listening experience, giving you complete control of your cord length. Adjust it anywhere from 16 inches to 3.5 feet. Finish up at the gym, crunch the earbuds, and toss them into your bag for the next use all tangle-free, every single time! How to Crunch Zip up your headphone cords, tangle free, with just a flick of your wrist. The cord management system is elegant, intuitive, and can be mastered in seconds.

See our update for full details.** A Dream to Crunch Thank you for taking an interest in our product. It s hard to throttle back the enthusiasm we have for the CordCruncher idea. We ve had amazing feedback from our prospective customers and the electronics industry. I was introduced to Kickstarter.com by a Microsoft representative at the CES show this past January. I feel he accurately viewed the Kickstarter community as the perfect launching point for our new CordCruncher headphones. We are asking for your support to achieve two goals:First, we want to place our product in the hands of informed early adapters. A consumer audience who can quickly get what we are offering and introduce the product to their friends and colleagues. Second, we hope the Kickstarter community will serve as a platform to introduce the value of CordCruncher s intellectual property to the world. We really appreciate your interest in our enterprise, and look forward to collaborating with you, the Kickstarter community. Respectfully, Jay The 2012 Consumer Electronics Show - Las Vegas, Nevada. This year, we had a fantastic opportunity to set up shop at The 2012 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Karen has led company operations from idea to prototype to product to this kickstarter campaign -- and is working with Duane to ensure timely delivery of the products to customers this year. Karen earned an M.B.A. and a Master's in Taxation from the University of Denver. Duane Wilson, Co-Founder: With 20 years experience in software and technology companies with a focus on startups and building new products / teams within large enterprises including Capital One, Ofoto / Kodak, Playphone, Openwave and more. Duane is a gadget geek and active purchaser of Kickstarter projects and got the hardware bug! Duane watched that Seinfeld episode, the one with George's wallet and thought... Yeah, this thing does suck and immediately tossed the stuffed and torn relic and started going commando (wallet wise), keys, phone and a few cards and cash just loose in the pocket. This didn't work out too well so after much searching and trying out dozens of wallets he resigned himself to as minimal a wallet as he could find. Duane was a guest at Demo Day and heard Karen give a talk and show off an early prototype of New Wallet and got in touch, things have been moving fast ever since. Duane earned his BFA in Sculpture from Virginia Commonwealth University and has been addicted to the Internet and Mobile apps for a very long time. J2ME anyone? Jack Crawford, Co-Founder/Chairman of the Board: Jack carried around a prototype for 2 years asking any willing listener how they would improve on New Wallet and what features they would want to see in a great product that solves our problem of carrying too much stuff!

324`Thank YOU to ALL backers for FUNding!Did you miss the KickStarter? Pre-order Pack O Game SET 2: HEREFor more information visit: www.perplext.comFollow me on Twitter: @ChrisHandy Pack O Game is a series of small card games with a surprising amount of gameplay, strategy and fun. Each game is unique in theme, mechanics and complexity, with 30 cards (1 inch by 3 inch) in a tuck box the size of a pack of gum. In 2014, Pack O Game SET 1 launched with great success. It s focus was variety for many types of people. SET 2 is about short, middle-weight games for gamers and people looking for more depth and interesting gameplay. Hook: Unique Team Picking" (just like those gym class days!) with interesting strategy and manipulation during the event playing phase. In GYM, players play on 1 of 2 teams, which can accommodate 2, 4 or 6 players. There are 2 phases to the game. The "Pick" phase is just like Gym class! Each team member will choose a Kid from the line up to add to his hand. If a "bully" is acquired, a team member is allowed to influence which 4 (of the 6) events will be played in the next phase. In the "Play" phase, each team member will play a Kid to one of the 4 events on his turn. Playing Kids will also allow an "event action", which may manipulate player hands, Kid positions, and more. Playing a "bully" allows you to reposition a Coach, which reduces chaos at an event, but also makes it more difficult to make changes to the roster. In the end, the team with the most cumulative points from the 4 events is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY GYM NOW! "Don't be fooled by the size of the box; GYM is a heavy game requiring little table space. Pound for Pound, GYM is one if my new favorites, given its size, weight, and portability." - Brian Fiore (Just Got Played) Hook: Quick turns, Press your luck , set collecting with stealing. RUM is a press your luck, set collecting game that s played quickly, over many turns. On your turn, you must draw a card or play sets of bottles to gain Captain Cards and earn points. The 3 face up cards are called The Beach and these are community cards and considered in your hand . You can also play a Rum Trio , which is 3 single bottles in a color, to steal the captain card and increase it by 2. But, you can t press your luck too long, because the Parrot is lurking close by to steal your rum. The game ends when a player reaches a set amount of points OR when the time on the Castaway Clock runs out. Tabletopia User? TRY RUM NOW! Hook: Mancala meets secret goal/set collecting farming game. SOW is a challenging gardening game in which players redistribute seeds and flowers in the garden in order to pick the bouquet that will reward the most points at the end of the game. Each turn, a player must redistribute a row in the garden, then takes any applicable actions. If the last card placed was a Seeds Card, it must be flipped over (and all other matching Seeds of that color) to become a Flower. Flowers reward points when collected from a player s Wheelbarrow. There are 2 Garden Action Cards that may also allow extra actions, if placed in the same row, on the same turn. Garden Actions will allow a Gardener to change the windmill direction (which changes the card redistribution in future turns), or it may allow a player to discard all flowers of a certain type (Gopher) or collect a flower in their wheel barrow (watering can). In the end, the players show their favorite color and are rewarded points for flowers. Each player calculates their score as follows: 3 points for each flower with his Favorite Color in the Center portion. 2 points for each flower with his Favorite Color on the Outer portion. 1 point for each flower WITHOUT his Favorite Color. Tabletopia User? TRY SOW NOW! Hook: A short, 2-player battle of hand management and timing. On your turn, you must perform the following actions in order:1. Deploy Orcs: Play 1 card from your hand to a Territory that has not yet been conquered.2. Draw Weapons: Choose ANY Stockpile(s). Draw card(s) as follows: A. Draw 1 card into your hand if you deployed 2 Orcs. B. Draw 2 cards into your hand if you deployed 1 Orc. A Territory battle occurs immediately after the Stockpile next to a Territory is exhausted. Then, players total their deployed Orcs at that Territory, and a victor will be declared. Orcs that fight in battle will not score points, they only help conquer Territories. Scoring occurs at the end of the game, when all Stockpiles have been exhausted. The player who conquers the most valuable Territories and holds native Orcs in their hand (matching those lands), is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY ORC NOW! I am just so impressed by Orc! Almost from the first turn the decisions will grip you and not let up until the very end. I think what amazes me is that each choice is fundamentally simple: which card do I play and to which battle? Yet each of those choices has numerous hugely important implications for the remaining game, all of which are immediately understandable from a glance at the tabletop. While the box might say war is ugly, this game is anything but! - Matt (Creaking Shelves) In this nutty set connecting game, players will acquire nut cards and and arrange them in their own individual trees. Same-colored nuts that are kept together will reward players with more points as they may only count their largest nut cluster in each of the 6 colors at the end of the game. The player with the most points is the winner! Each round, the role of the Forager will rotate clockwise from player to player. When a player is the Forager, he must add a new nut column to replenish the previously taken column. Then, he must take any 1 card in a column and place it in his playing area. Then, the remaining players must take 1 card from the same column and place them in their playing area. The game continues with the next player in clockwise order becoming the Forager, and so on. Nut Cards will create trees with nuts on both sides. Cards must touch at least one square side or cover a full square (or at least a third of a card). Once cards have been placed, they may not me moved for the remainder of the game. A Squirrel will double the value of a cluster of nuts if it is orthogonally connected to the largest cluster of the squirrel s corresponding color. Squirrels must be placed with the squirrel right-side up, facing the player.The Squirrel has no value itself, but may be a connector for 2 sections of same colored nut clusters. Wild Nuts may be used as any colored nut during the scoring if it is contiguously connected to the largest cluster of a particular color. The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted AND there are no columns left in play. The player who earned the most points from his six sets of nuts is the winner. In DIG, each player is a dog that will run throughout the Yard, dig up bones and attempt to return them to the matching colored Dog Bowl with the greatest efficiency. All players will score once, at the end of the game, based on the cumulative value of the Bones that he returned to the matching Dog Bowls. There are 4 Bones in each of the 5 colors in the game. A Bone's value is determined at the end of the game, based on the distance of its corresponding Dog Bowl to the Dog House. The Dog Bowl that is closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 5 for each bone of that color. The Dog Bowl that is second closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 4 for each bone of that color, and so on. The Bowls and Bones will be swapped from the end of the Yard into the place of a recently dug up bone, continuously moving the 5 Bowls to the end of the Yard nearest the Dog House. Each Yard Card has a Scent with 2 colors. The Bone on the opposite side of the Yard Card matches 1 of the colors of the Scent. This will help players determine which color Bone might be dug if that Yard Card is selected for digging. One of the most interesting aspects of DIG is the unique "Leap Frog" Yard replacement mechanism. When a Bone is dug up, the Card that is furthest from the the Dog House, is removed and fills the empty spot created by the Dog. This action creates some interesting ways to influence which Bones and Bowls each Dog has close access to, but also makes timing critical for influencing Bone value for scoring. On a player's turn, he may perform ANY or ALL of the following actions, but may only perform each action ONCE per turn. MOVE: A player may move his Dog a maximum of 4 cards along the Yard Cards, and 1 less for each Bone he holds prior to movement. For example, if a player holds 2 Bone cards, he may move his Dog up to 2 Cards, moving below or above the Yard cards. A player may move his Dog in any direction. There is a movement legend on the bottom half of the Dog House for easy reference. DIG: A player may dig up a bone and place the Bone card in his hand. Bones that are in the hand are kept secret until they are dropped off and placed in front of the player. The empty space created from the Yard Card removal is filled with the last Card at the edge of Yard. A player may have no more than 3 Bones in their hand at any time. DROP: Drop a Bone into a Dog Bowl and place the Bone card from your hand to the playing area in front of himself, face up with the Bone visible to all players. A Dog must be AT the Bowl of the corresponding color in order to drop off any Bones of that color. Game End and Scoring: When Bowls are the only remaining Cards in the Yard (next to the Dog House), the game ends immediately and players total their scores. Any Bones still in a player's hand are removed from the game and do not count for scoring. Calculate your score by identifying the value of each Bone in your possession.5 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color closest to the Dog House.4 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color second closest to the Dog House.3 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color third closest to the Dog House.2 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color fourth closest to the Dog House.1 Point Each: Bones matching the Bowl color furthest from the Dog House. The player with the most points wins! Here are 4 games that take little space and little time to play, but demand all of a player s attention. That s impressive and fun.

See update #14 from May 4 for photos and details of our new add-ons and stretch goals. Boy Story, finally a cool boy doll for all kids. We teach our kids diversity. Our world is diverse. But the toy market has failed to embrace inclusion and diversity. Boy Story adds boys into the missing equation, so our children see dolls just like them - boys and girls - in the toy aisles. Boy Story brings Action Dolls to the world: 18" boy dolls with adjustable ball-joints to join the action and fun with all the girl dolls out there. Action Dolls are cool. Action Dolls encourage pretend play and imagination. Action Dolls are for all kids. Action Dolls are just plain FUN. Click here to read about why our Action Doll joints are so unique! Action Dolls: 18" dolls with specially designed ball joints to pose like an action figure! One of the biggest difference between our Action Doll and a standard 18" doll is that we added extra joints, 11 points of articulation to be exact. On top of that, most standard dolls are strung even if they do have extra joints (5 joints is most common in dolls). First thing we prioritized was quality and durability. These Action Dolls are so fun, we expect kids to drag them through mud, load them in bike baskets, romp through fields, and toss them through the air. We have seen all the crazy and imaginative ways kids play with our Action Dolls. Just as they were designed. These dolls are meant to be PLAYED with. The dolls are made of: High quality phthalate-free vinyl for the head, limbs, and ball joints (limiting scratches and making for easy cleanup) Durable, yet squeezable, cotton twill for the soft body (rugged enough to endure years of play, but soft enough to sleep/cuddle with) We even sculpted the hair styles of each Action Doll to avoid tangled, messy hair disasters. We expect messes! Thanks to the molded hair, you can simply wipe the dolls clean and they're back in action. Second, we designed the dolls to be cool, boyish, and diverse. Missing from mainstream 18" doll lines are detailed facial features capturing the uniqueness we love in children. Most 18 dolls limit changes to skin tone and hair color, and many children (especially boys) are not represented. Even the boy dolls out there, we found, often look like they are wearing makeup or are girl dolls with cut hair. Boy Story believes that children s toys especially those representing humans should be as diverse as the kids who play with them. Making unique dolls has not been cheap, but the results are completely worth the cost. We will continue to make different face molds for each of our Action Dolls. Our line starts with two unique boys, Billy and Mason, and we have many more planned (sneak peek in the "Meet the Boys" section below). Third, our dolls had to move! We came up with the idea for Action Dolls as a combo between action figures with their super cool poses and traditional dolls. Our Action Dolls have 11 points of articulation! Most standard dolls have few or even no joints, and those with joints are usually entirely elastic-strung, with extremely limited movement. Our dolls have 6 specially designed ball joints, 4 sewn and strung cup joints at the soft body, and a unique neck joint that allows the head to twist and tilt. These separate ball joints were specially designed to move in all different directions, as well as hold strong poses. Click here to read more about the joints! Last, (but not least) our Action Dolls represent real boys and wear cool outfits just like your little tyke. The quality of the outfits, as well as their designs, are as close as we could get to the real deal. We are talking eye-catching designs that would really be worn by a boy today. This means real buttons, zippers, brass snaps, laces, cuffed jeans, and little tiny canvas shoes, to name a few! Our clothing line is expanding rapidly, and in addition to regular outfits, we will be introducing special outfits designed to expand pretend and role play (think: soldiers, super heroes, pilots, scientists, etc.) (think also: stretch goal!). PS, (We know we said last... but...) can't forget to mention that our Action Dolls are designed to be compatible with standard 18" doll accessories. So get an Action Doll hurry for our limited quantity Kickstarter specials! to join in the fun and complete your doll collection today. We are Boy STORY. Reading unlocks the imagination. It develops a sense of wonder and fun. It teaches life lessons. Boy Story encourages reading through exciting, illustrated adventure stories that spill out of the page and into our Action Dolls. Kids can close the book and keep the adventure going. Statistics show that although girls scores in S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) related subjects are improving (thanks to great toys such as Goldieblox and Roominate working to encourage girls interest in S.T.E.M. related subjects), boys reading scores continue to lag behind. A cool Action Doll with an adventure story encourages and introduces reading in new ways to both boys and girls. For the collector (or just the kid) in you. With the quality level of the Action Dolls so high, we made absolutely sure to do everything we could to make each doll and book collectable. Every Action Doll comes with its own Boy Story Certificate of Authenticity. Production numbers are printed on the tag, and will serve to prove that you have the very first Boy Story Action Dolls ever to be made. We engraved the Boy Story logo on the bottom of each doll s foot as seen in the photo below. (This is an image of a molded part, so the foot will not actually be gold, it will be skin tone.) The books are both made and printed in the USA. We wanted Boy Story's adventure books to be really special, so we designed them to be standard collectable comic book size, yet read like a chapter book. They are filled with beautiful and colorful illustrations and are printed on thick satin-finish pages. The covers are soft with a velvety matte finish, and we are looking into adding a spot gloss to the covers and a watermark page to our books as a stretch goal. Both the books and dolls are made to last and even be passed down through generations to come. Boy Story takes pride in putting safety first! Our co-founder is a mom of two boys, and she always says "As a mom, being certain that the toy my child is playing with is safe is not something I take lightly. Boy Story's Action Dolls are going through rigorous safety testing for sales in the US, Canada, and Europe. Action Dolls are safe for children ages 3+ due to small parts. Mason! If there's one thing you will remember about Mason, it's that he has a wild imagination. This kid is always thinking up the most exciting adventures. Never a dull moment with him. He loves to ask questions, frequents the library, and has a big mystery to solve! Billy! Get ready for a belly full of laughs with this character because Billy is a bit of a prankster. When he is around, you'd better watch out for strategic placement of his pet frog (yikes!). He lives in Louisiana and loves to grab his backpack and go exploring through the Bayou. He s not even afraid of the monstrous alligator that roams these parts. Tons of excitement awaits with Billy! And now for the SNEAK PEEK at the next two characters to be featured in a Boy Story: Aspen! Aspen is always on the move, traveling around the world with his mom, who is an Army Sergeant. Much more than a military brat, Aspen s a huge fan of baseball and can be a bit shy when meeting new friends and being in new places. On his latest adventure in Japan, he soon finds that he has a lot more in common with the local kids than he thought. Friendships blossom and baseball games abound! Kenji! Kenji loves making new friends and is a superstar on his baseball league. He has a heart of gold and enjoys teaching people all about his Japanese culture. Hmmm, sounds like Aspen and Kenji could end up being great friends, but you ll have to wait to find out! ~~~3 PIECE BUTTON PACK~~~ 3 Piece Button Pack ~~~BOY STORY BOOK~~~ Choose one or get them both.

326`If you love coffee as much as we do, we're sure you would LOVE to be able to drink it anytime anywhere. And so would we! That is why we decided to make a coffee mug that is practical and sustainable, but is also a fashion accessory and tells the primeval story of coffee. Its most obvious feature is definitely its shape which resembles the goat s horns but it also helps you drink that last sip of your coffee and makes you look good. We designed a special holder with leather touch which simply turns into a coffee mug stand so you can easily keep the Goat mug on your desk. Also, Goat mug comes with a set of two straps (short and longer part combine in to one), so you can simply attach it to your bag or just let it fall across your shoulder. This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around. Goat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE. Since you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand. Here's a look inside the Goat mug. It's shape makes it simple to clean. We designed a beautiful packaging to deliver your Goat mug in style. It can then become a perfect storage place for your fresh coffee beans. We would love for more coffee lovers to learn the real story about coffee as much as we would love all of them to be stylish and eco-friendly while drinking their coffee wherever and whenever. That is why we would appreciate you backing our project. Surely, there will be more coffees enjoyed if we manage to make our dream come true.Help us share our project among other coffee lover out there Awards structure: The first stretch goal is an idea we got from our backer Tamara. If we manage to raise $60,000 we will offer everyone a new colour option of the Goat mug - the PANTONE COLOUR OF THE YEAR: MARSALA. Let's do it! The second stretch goal is out! If we manage to raise $250,000 we will offer a new reward: HEMP EDITION Goat mug - for all those on the relaxed side of fashion. Never. Enough. Coffee. You asked for big, we're giving you GRANDE. Third streth goal is set to $350,000! Can we do this together? If all goes according to our plans, we will be shipping out products already in second half of February. Let's do this together! Design of the GOAT STORY Coffee mug was done by design studio Desnahemisfera in cooperation with MyEqua.

Innovation is open to everyone - Prof. Miles Pennington, Innovation Design Engineering & Global Innovation Design, Imperial College London & Royal College of Art SAM is a crazy new technology that will fundamentally change the way you go from idea to finished product - Andy McCartney and Diane Perlman, CEO in Residence - Microsoft Ventures UK Why SAM?I'm a mechanical engineer, and was always scared of the dark magic of electrical engineering. Stuff never works, there's always a bug, and you can't duct tape it into correctness. I wanted to find a way to make it fun for people to learn circuitry and coding. A human centered model that would be easy to use and which taught you while you worked with it. This gave birth to SAM, the idea of giving designers and creative people the powers of engineers. We hope to be a the start of a democratic revolution for the Internet of Things so that children can learn and that impactful, highly technologically innovative projects can be undertaken by designers who do not necessarily have the luxury of having been technically trained as engineers.1. SAM makes creating easy. Until now, electronics projects have required hardware skills (wiring, soldering), software wizardry (coding, hacking, debugging) and a lot of patience! With SAM, you can forget all of these. SAM ensures a seamless communication between hardware and software. No more head bashing - it just works. With no frustration, it s fun to use! 2. SAM opens the Internet of Everything market to designers and creators. Gone are the days when society depends on engineers and technical experts to shape the world around us. Thanks to SAM, anyone with an idea turns it into reality. 3. SAM helps you learn about code. While coding is not necessary with SAM, code is generated for all your drag and drop creations. As you become comfortable with this code, start adding your own to unleash the power of SAM and create awesome stuff!Open Source and the SAM community We believe in the Open Hardware movement and we will upload the kits hardware schematics and board designs, the components we re using are available from any major distributor. ...also, they look quite good! Production Plan As soon as the campaign ends, we will place an order for all the components needed for mass manufacture. These components have a lead time of up to three months, and we have booked the manufacturing plant for the middle of February just in case any delays in component sourcing arise. Fresh out of the factory, the kits will be dispatched straight to your houses.Who is SAM Labs?We are a multi-disciplinary team of designers from the Royal College of Art and engineers from Imperial College London.The idea for SAM came to us while eating fat soba in Tokyo in August 2013, and the team started assembling in early 2014.We have been working remotely on SAM with regular hackathon meets, but have now settled at Central Working s collaborative working space in Whitechapel, London.Thank you Thanks for reading all the way down, we hope you ve enjoyed learning about SAM and are ready to join us on the journey.

328`It's a USB 3.0 Hub with lots of power for rapid charging. In-fact it delivers more power than any other Wall Charger currently available in the market. OctoFire-Hub delivers whopping 2.4 Amps per port (12 Watts) of power to rapidly charge your devices. It is built on strong foundations of earlier successful Kickstater project: OctoFire Charger (http://kck.st/1bK6kO7).OctoFire-Hub acts like a standalone charger when not connected to host/PC/laptop. Intelligent device detection makes it possible to deliver optimal power to any device you connect to it. It has built-in over-heat, over-charge, over-current & over-voltage protection.It can transfer data at super-speed of USB 3.0 and you can expect upto 5 Gbps speed of data transfer. No more waiting for files to get copied. The OctoFire Hub design is taken from previous OctoFire design, but we have tried to incorporate the suggestion and feedback of all OctoFire backers. The OctoFire Hub has evolved OctoFire from a simple 8 port charging station facing all directions to a more distinct crescent like USB port for easier access and less space consumption. Other than this aesthetic change, we have also added few technical changes by adding Hub functionality and upgrading charging current from 2.1 Amps to 2.4 Amps per ports. All of these are just a add-on with major changes in dimensions and specifications making OctoFire Hub our best revelation yet. You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

He is a soldier in the Army National Guard and he is leading the design efforts for this unique product line. His brother Chris, has a very different background with experience in marketing, search engine optimization and business management. Together, their skills set a strong foundation for building this company into a trusted and recognized brand. WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP"Movements are not started by leaders, they are started by the first followers."We need your support to prove that people are ready to demand a higher standard for the products they use and carry everyday. Your support will bring affirmation to our vision and your orders will allow us to fulfill minimum order quantities for our first line of production. If we meet our goal, we will be able to put our first product, the wallet, into production. Help us exceed our goal and we will be able to bring a whole product line to the market with a variety of products that hold true to our unique concept of design. We have several other ideas and prototypes that we are excited to introduce to the world. A Sneak Peak at Some of Our Working Prototypes OUR PRODUCTION PLANWe have established relationships with all our manufacturing and supply partners and we have worked hard to understand their capabilities and ensure that they can meet our production needs. Upon the successful completion of our Kickstarter campaign, we will immediately place the order for materials and get the first line of production underway. Predicted Timeline Wait 20 days for funds to clear 3 weeks to order tools and materials 6 weeks for production and Quality Assurance checks 2 weeks for packaging and shipment Send Off! We expect to start shipping in July 2014 TORTURE TESTING (Added At The Request Of Our Backers) I put peanut butter inside a Hammer Riveted Wallet and gave it to my Rhodesian Ridge Back puppy to chew on for an hour. When she was done with it, the wallet did not look pretty (as you can see in the picture), but it is important to note that she was not able to rip it apart. The wallet still holds its shape and is entirely functional. Also notice that her teeth never punctured the leather. This leather really is as tough as it gets. I do not however recommend giving your wallet to your dog as a chew toy.
330`Why do we still teach children to sit down?Why are children still sitting down all day in class, especially when standing feels so much better? Here at JASWIG, we create health-promoting furniture to make you feel better both mentally and physically. This is why we created the StandUp, the first height-adjustable wooden standing desk made for both kids and adults. It seems that everywhere we go, we have a place to sit: in public spaces, at the office, in our cars, on public transit, at home (you get the picture). For most of us, the default option is to recline, and our furniture and infrastructure make it the easiest choice. This occurs in schools as well, where most children spend their day in ill-fitted sitting desks. Even with afterschool activities, most modern-day kids spend up to 85% of their waking hours in sedentary activities. Adults are no better, spending 8-12 hours a day in a seated position.If sitting is the new smoking in terms of health risks, then why are we letting our kids get hooked at such an early age? Studies suggest that sitting for more than three hours a day can decrease our life expectancy by two years, even if we exercise regularly. Sitting too much increases the risks for obesity, muscle degeneration, heart disease, and even depression. The good news is that our sitting problem is fixed through a simple intervention: standing up and moving more. This is where JASWIG comes in. We want to change our sitting culture by introducing the first height-adjustable wooden standing desk for both children and adults. We call it the StandUp. Its sleek design is made from sustainably sourced wood, and is easily adjusted by even the youngest of users. Don't educate children to sit down Sitting has become a staple of western society, but it doesn t need to stay that way. With the StandUp, we are aiming to support a new, active culture that will help prevent sedentary-related public health problems before they develop. Our dream is to make the StandUp accessible and affordable to everyone, because we believe that everybody, especially every child, should have access to a standing desk and in result a healthier lifestyle. Meeting our Kickstarter campaign goal brings us closer to realizing this vision, and closer to getting more standing desks in schools everywhere.One size fits noneThe StandUp is the first height-adjustable wooden standing desk. Its lightweight and simple design allows for safe and easy height adjustments in seconds, even for a young child. No person is the same size, and using a standardized sitting desk or table for hours can compromise your posture, circulation, and musculature. When it comes to furniture, there really is no one size fits all. Adult and Child Benefits of standing regularly For children, it allows them to burn energy in a productive way and allows them to better focus on the task at hand, be that homework in your living room or a project in the classroom. For adults (and everyone else), it increases muscle circulation, burns more calories, improves posture and balance, and even helps you think more clearly. Offices all over the world are adopting standing desks because they see it increasing productivity and improving health outcomes for their workers. Relieves stress from the lower back, shoulders and neck Stimulates muscle activity and good posture Increases calorie burn, on average 50 calories/h more than sitting Improves blood flow and oxygen influx to the brains Helps productivity, creativity and concentration Better interaction between teacher and students Allow children to channel their excessive energy "Let s Move! Michelle Obama We think better on our feet than in our seat. Mark Benden, PhD, CPE Kids can fidget at a standing desk, but it's not as disruptive. Juliet Starrett, StandUpKids.org Improved learning environment Good posture Design Our desk displays a beautiful balance between simplicity, functionality, sustainability and familiarity. The design is based on the vintage 60 s school desks but the edges and material are reflective of recent technological innovations. Sustainability is truly important to us and is reflected in the choices we have made in our materials and manufacturing process. Our desks are made from Forest Stewardship Counsel (FSC) Certified Russian Birch, which ensures it comes from forests that provide environmental, social, and economic benefits. If you or your child ever outgrows your desk, we gladly take the product back for reuse and recycling. We use a specific varnish with low-VOC and formaldehyde levels, reducing impact to air quality. Any waste material created during the manufacturing process is reused for other products or prototyping. Our desk design is optimized for digital manufacturing in local wood workshops with state-of-the-art machines. This allows us to make the desk nearly anywhere, which limits transportation-related pollution and provides work for local businesses . Simplicity Features 1. Easy and safe height adjustable system: The height can easily be adjusted by anyone, even the youngest of users. This assures an ergonomic position for everyone. The desk has no pinch points and can be locked in place to ensure a stable and safe surface to work. 2. Natural materials: The desk is made from high-quality, FSC-certified Russian Birch plywood, and is finished with a durable, low-VOC and low-formaldehyde varnish. 3. Designed for (dis)assembly: All parts of our desk are easily replaced. This prevents the need to buy a new desk if a specific part gets damaged. Since the video was made, the design of the desk has changed. The desk that we are offering on Kickstarter has the following additional attributes: A shelf for extra storage space. Black screws (instead of finger joints) for easier fastening and a stylish, European look. Fits everywhere Yes, everywhere. Manufacturing JASWIG designs, engineers and prototypes all of the furniture we develop. The manufacturing occurs in wood workshops we partner with. Local small businesses receive our digital files and use CNC-technology to produce the pieces. Once cut, the pieces are sanded and the edges are rounded for a beautiful and smoothly finished product. The last step before shipping is finishing all surfaces with a durable yet environmentally friendly protective coating. We currently have production set up in Cleveland, Ohio and Gent, Belgium. If this Kickstarter is successful we will set up more manufacturing hubs around the globe, but until then we limit shipping to the US, Canada, Europe, and the UK. Manufacturing Distribution The desks are shipped flat-packed. At the manufacturing shop, all the finished pieces are put in a custom designed box with fasteners. These packages are delivered only over land to reach you in the most efficient and sensible manner to minimize transportation-related pollution. Flat-packed desks. Ecodelivery in Belgium by Bubble Post. Why we need your help We want to change the sitting norm, which we believe is accomplished through changing the habits of every generation from child to parent. That is why we want to support independent research studying the impact of introducing standing desks in the classroom. We are currently working with UDS Steel Academy, an Akron school that accommodates students with learning difficulties. A Psychology PhD student from Cleveland State will quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate changes in behavior and performance of the students after the introduction of standing desks in their classroom. You can be part of this important research! One of our rewards allows you to donate a desk. We will make sure to include your name as one of the important sponsors of this research. We want to make the desks as affordable as possible, because we believe that every child should have access to a standing desk. In order to do this, we need a large network of manufacturers that have the appropriate equipment and can meet our end-product quality requirements. Making the desks locally cuts down on transportation costs and pollution. However, this requires extensive legal agreements, prototyping and testing phases at different locations and clear guidelines about our manufacturing and distribution process. Having your financial support will allow us to set this up. Research Rewards The rewards are all shipped from Ohio for the US and Canada, and from Belgium for Europe and the UK. Expected delivery date for the desks are early December just in time for the holidays! Unfortunately we do not ship the desks internationally as it doesn't fit our vision of local manufacturing and low-carbon transportation. If you would love to have this desk but are not located in the US, Canada, Europe, or UK, then please tell us where you are from! We will set up future manufacturing hubs based on where demand is highest, and you could help bring the benefits of this standing desk to your part of the world. Important! Please be aware that the desks that we are offering here on Kickstarter: Include a shelf for extra storage space. Have a locking bar. Have black screws that allows for easier fastening and a stylish, European look. This is different from the finger joints on the model used in our Kickstarter movie. Our final design is still in the making. So keep an eye out for updates Timeline The excited and motivated Jaswig team Eight friends, and a cow.

Sketch > Design > First Prototype Founded in 2012, our products are inspired by nearly a decade of military service and a lifetime of adventures. Fidelis, faithful, is the defining principle born into all aspects of our company. We re a scrappy team of veterans, creative professionals, and gear junkies that mashup the intelligent design of tactical gear and urban aesthetics into bags that transcend work and play, indoors and out. Tim O'Neil - After deployments to Asia and the Middle East as an Infantry Officer in the Marines, Tim wanted to bring the quality of rugged well built gear to his new life as a urban professional. Brandon Jernigan - Brandon is the creative of the team. He's backpacked 5 continents and honed his craft as a commercial photographer. He also sprouted a mullet at the tender age of 7. Et al. We also want to acknowledge all the help we have received from others along the way. Thanks! Follow us on Facebook and Instagram. Our bags are cut and sewn on American soil. We're also proud members of the Maker's Coalition, an initiative to bring back the cut and sew industry back to the States. We're bootstrapping this venture and manufacturing in the US demands more upfront production costs. We strategically source most of our materials domestically, and occasionally incorporate some of the most innovative tactical components from around the world. We've elected to manufacture limited first edition bags to ensure tighter quality assurance and the production of the most rugged, reliable, and progressive gear. These bags have been rigorously tested and after multiple revisions, we're ready to "click" manufacture. The only problem is we can't make these bags yet. With your support, we can cut and sew these bags right here in Minnesota as soon this campaign ends. Please feel free to contact us at info@fidelisco.com. Thanks you for your support!

But the toy market has failed to embrace inclusion and diversity. Boy Story adds boys into the missing equation, so our children see dolls just like them - boys and girls - in the toy aisles. Boy Story brings Action Dolls to the world: 18" boy dolls with adjustable ball-joints to join the action and fun with all the girl dolls out there. Action Dolls are cool. Action Dolls encourage pretend play and imagination. Action Dolls are for all kids. Action Dolls are just plain FUN. Click here to read about why our Action Doll joints are so unique! Action Dolls: 18" dolls with specially designed ball joints to pose like an action figure! One of the biggest difference between our Action Doll and a standard 18" doll is that we added extra joints, 11 points of articulation to be exact. On top of that, most standard dolls are strung even if they do have extra joints (5 joints is most common in dolls). First thing we prioritized was quality and durability. These Action Dolls are so fun, we expect kids to drag them through mud, load them in bike baskets, romp through fields, and toss them through the air. We have seen all the crazy and imaginative ways kids play with our Action Dolls. Just as they were designed. These dolls are meant to be PLAYED with. The dolls are made of: High quality phthalate-free vinyl for the head, limbs, and ball joints (limiting scratches and making for easy cleanup) Durable, yet squeezable, cotton twill for the soft body (rugged enough to endure years of play, but soft enough to sleep/cuddle with) We even sculpted the hair styles of each Action Doll to avoid tangled, messy hair disasters. We expect messes! Thanks to the molded hair, you can simply wipe the dolls clean and they're back in action. Second, we designed the dolls to be cool, boyish, and diverse. Missing from mainstream 18" doll lines are detailed facial features capturing the uniqueness we love in children. Most 18 dolls limit changes to skin tone and hair color, and many children (especially boys) are not represented. Even the boy dolls out there, we found, often look like they are wearing makeup or are girl dolls with cut hair. Boy Story believes that children s toys especially those representing humans should be as diverse as the kids who play with them. Making unique dolls has not been cheap, but the results are completely worth the cost. We will continue to make different face molds for each of our Action Dolls. Our line starts with two unique boys, Billy and Mason, and we have many more planned (sneak peek in the "Meet the Boys" section below). Third, our dolls had to move! We came up with the idea for Action Dolls as a combo between action figures with their super cool poses and traditional dolls. Our Action Dolls have 11 points of articulation! Most standard dolls have few or even no joints, and those with joints are usually entirely elastic-strung, with extremely limited movement. Our dolls have 6 specially designed ball joints, 4 sewn and strung cup joints at the soft body, and a unique neck joint that allows the head to twist and tilt. These separate ball joints were specially designed to move in all different directions, as well as hold strong poses. Click here to read more about the joints! Last, (but not least) our Action Dolls represent real boys and wear cool outfits just like your little tyke. The quality of the outfits, as well as their designs, are as close as we could get to the real deal. We are talking eye-catching designs that would really be worn by a boy today. This means real buttons, zippers, brass snaps, laces, cuffed jeans, and little tiny canvas shoes, to name a few! Our clothing line is expanding rapidly, and in addition to regular outfits, we will be introducing special outfits designed to expand pretend and role play (think: soldiers, super heroes, pilots, scientists, etc.) (think also: stretch goal!). PS, (We know we said last... but...) can't forget to mention that our Action Dolls are designed to be compatible with standard 18" doll accessories. So get an Action Doll hurry for our limited quantity Kickstarter specials! to join in the fun and complete your doll collection today. We are Boy STORY. Reading unlocks the imagination. It develops a sense of wonder and fun. It teaches life lessons. Boy Story encourages reading through exciting, illustrated adventure stories that spill out of the page and into our Action Dolls. Kids can close the book and keep the adventure going. Statistics show that although girls scores in S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) related subjects are improving (thanks to great toys such as Goldieblox and Roominate working to encourage girls interest in S.T.E.M. related subjects), boys reading scores continue to lag behind. A cool Action Doll with an adventure story encourages and introduces reading in new ways to both boys and girls. For the collector (or just the kid) in you. With the quality level of the Action Dolls so high, we made absolutely sure to do everything we could to make each doll and book collectable. Every Action Doll comes with its own Boy Story Certificate of Authenticity. Production numbers are printed on the tag, and will serve to prove that you have the very first Boy Story Action Dolls ever to be made. We engraved the Boy Story logo on the bottom of each doll s foot as seen in the photo below. (This is an image of a molded part, so the foot will not actually be gold, it will be skin tone.) The books are both made and printed in the USA. We wanted Boy Story's adventure books to be really special, so we designed them to be standard collectable comic book size, yet read like a chapter book. They are filled with beautiful and colorful illustrations and are printed on thick satin-finish pages. The covers are soft with a velvety matte finish, and we are looking into adding a spot gloss to the covers and a watermark page to our books as a stretch goal. Both the books and dolls are made to last and even be passed down through generations to come. Boy Story takes pride in putting safety first! Our co-founder is a mom of two boys, and she always says "As a mom, being certain that the toy my child is playing with is safe is not something I take lightly. Boy Story's Action Dolls are going through rigorous safety testing for sales in the US, Canada, and Europe. Action Dolls are safe for children ages 3+ due to small parts. Mason! If there's one thing you will remember about Mason, it's that he has a wild imagination. This kid is always thinking up the most exciting adventures. Never a dull moment with him. He loves to ask questions, frequents the library, and has a big mystery to solve! Billy! Get ready for a belly full of laughs with this character because Billy is a bit of a prankster.

And now for the SNEAK PEEK at the next two characters to be featured in a Boy Story: Aspen! Aspen is always on the move, traveling around the world with his mom, who is an Army Sergeant.

On his latest adventure in Japan, he soon finds that he has a lot more in common with the local kids than he thought. Friendships blossom and baseball games abound! Kenji! Kenji loves making new friends and is a superstar on his baseball league. He has a heart of gold and enjoys teaching people all about his Japanese culture. Hmmm, sounds like Aspen and Kenji could end up being great friends, but you ll have to wait to find out! ~~~3 PIECE BUTTON PACK~~~ 3 Piece Button Pack ~~~BOY STORY BOOK~~~ Choose one or get them both.

338`Stretch Goal - An additional new and free book app IF reached $60,000! Kickstarter Staff PICK ! Pick & Draw Mozbii is world's first color picking stylus specifically designed for kids and adults with creative minds, enabling the exploration of their surroundings, while at the same time interacting with their favorite colors on tablet screens in a beautifully crafted coloring book app. What People Are Saying "One of the main things that I like about Mozbii is that it encourages children, who spend an increasing amount of time on tablets, to explore their environment and the objects around them." Why We Created MozbiiThe goal was to integrate technology into the learning process of kids. Something that would help them explore the world around them, rather than simply staring at the screen.What's MozbiiThe lollipop-shaped Mozbii is a capacitive-type stylus, with a built-in color-sensor, that will work with your typical Android and iOS tablets.The color-picking process is easy. Simply press against the surface from which the color is to be duplicated, wait for the LED display to light-up and blink the captured color, then draw that color on the supplied coloring-book app. Pick and draw... Because Mozbii is designed specifically for kids, there are minimal buttons to fumble with. It will be ready to use out of the box. Designing MozbiiMozbii is designed to last for a long time, even when used by a toddler. No button pressed are required to capture colours, but a simple press of the sensor side against the capturing surface, and the sensor is activated automatically. The flexible neck is designed with medical grade silica-gel to last millions of presses without warping, and the materials used to construct this pen is certified to be child-safe and toxin-free. A magnet is built inside, so that Mozbii can be attached to a fridge at home or white board in a classroom environment. This way, the stylus stays in the most visible place in a home or classroom, so it will be easy to locate, and ready to access. A magnetic charging head is also included so even a child can easily charge the pen when low on battery. The charger attaches to the pen automatically when directed, and is easily detacheable. Mozbii is available in six different colors. Two colors will be manufactured in the first batch, while the other colors will be made as limited edition copies. color simulation for reference only 3D rendering model for color reference only The nib is not designed with conductive rubber, but rather conductive cloth which lasts 10 times longer than the regular capacitive-type rubber nibs. ConnectivityMozbii leverages the low-power nature of Bluetooth 4.0, plus a smart power management system minimises the power consumption of the color sensor plus full-color LED. It lasts for up to a week between charges under normal usage. The tablets to be used with Mozbii need to have Bluetooth 4.0 support.Color CapabilityMozbii has a 16-bit color sensor, and can therefore recognize more than 65,000 different colors in the spectrum. The built-in memory buffer stores 12-color in the stylus at all times, on a first-in first-out basis, but the supplied Mozbii Coloring-Book app can store unlimited number of your favorite colour palettes, limited only by the size of storage space in your tablet device. SoftwareThe Mozbii Coloring Book app is made available for download on both the iOS App Store and Google Play. It functions both in pen and hand modes, so download your copy today for a quick trial on your tablet. Mozbii Coloring Book app comes with 10 sets of line arts ready to be painted, plus 10 additional sets of sticker arts available to decorate the final art pieces. Addtional line arts plus themed stickers will be released through future software updates. There are several interactive color-related apps planned to support Mozbii, and will be released in the very near future. Mika and Lubi, two mascots representing characters in the Ufro family, will also make their appearances through the various software releases. Where We Are NowWe have successfully completed all engineering verification of the concept, and have so far built 9 different prototypes with color-picking accuracy at up to 80 per cent. We expect to improve color accuracy to 95 per cent within two months, while at the same time working on improving the power efficiency of the electrical elements to optimize battery life.

Mozbii is using HWTrek's Project Development Hub to manage and monitor the project progress to product mass production. Pledges What Will We Do NextThe team is actively working on the SDK, so that interested third parties can leverage the technical capability of Mozbii with their existing apps. We hope to ship the SDK sometime in Dec.With your support, we hope to gather enough resources to conduct a sizeable production verification testing to iron out the final wrinkles in the product, with the aim of shipping Mozbii to those who pledged before Christmas 2014.

339`The Brydge Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can now order a Brydge at www.thebrydge.com.The best way to contact the Brydge team is by emailing us at info@thebrydge.com. You can also follow us on Twitter and on Facebook.TIME - "Brydge stands out for its Apple aesthetics."CNET - "A keyboard case that makes your iPad look a lot like the MacBook Air." New York Times - "Brydge..turns an iPad into a laptop resembling the MacBook Air."Mashable - "Brydge Turns Your iPad Into a Laptop" Huffington Post - "The Brydge also mimics the Apple design aesthetic"Cassandra Daily - "Tablet devices have yet to replace computers altogether, but iPad accessory Brydge could make the latter obsolete"ZDNet - "Brydge Kickstarter project could have been called ToasterFridge "Macgasm - "Brydge Is The Sexiest Way To Turn Your iPad Into A Laptop"Phone Area - "Brydge is probably one of the most elegantly designed keyboards docks for the iPad and this really is a compliment given the myriad of options available."GigaOM - "I was recently enamored by the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover for iPad, but I may hold off and back the Brydge instead."9to5Mac - "this appears to be one of the better made keyboard cases we have come across."UberGizmo - "Aesthetically speaking, the Brydge does seem to have many design cues that hail from Cupertino"GeekWire - "no toaster required"SlideToPlay - "The product looks stylish, the materials seem high-quality, and the construction appears sturdy"iPhoneinCanada - "elegantly crafted using aerospace-grade aluminum to closely match the feel of the iPad itself"Technabob - "Brydge iPad Keyboard: Admit It Apple, This is a Good Idea" Thanks for checking out our project! We highly recommend watching our video to get the best idea of what Brydge can do. Is it just us, or does it feel like the options for iPad keyboards and accessories are excessive in quantity, yet lacking in quality? This is why we created Brydge. This idea of adding a high quality hinging keyboard to your iPad seemed obvious to us and we were shocked when we could not find any accessory that accomplished this. So we set out to make such a product to perfectly compliment your iPad. Brydge is an elegant solution to the lack of quality iPad keyboards and accessories currently on the market. Brydge connects to your iPad using a patent-pending hinge which allows for close to 180 degrees of iPad positioning and holds your iPad secure. Watch our "Shake Test" to see how strongly Brydge's hinge holds your iPadBrydge's aluminum body ismachined and anodized so that it matches the look and feel of the iPad precisely. When paired together Brydge and your iPad appear to be two parts of the same device, blending style and functionality seamlessly. Unlike other products made of painted plastic in an effort to look similar to the iPad, Brydge does not fake it. Not only does it look good, but when held in your hands you can feel the quality craftsmanship Apple lovers demand. Watch our "Keyboard Comparison" video to see what sets Brydge apartBrydge's patent-pending hinge holds the iPad secure and allows for close to 180 degrees of positioning. While many stands offer a non-adjustable ledge to lean your iPad up against, Brydge's hinge allows you to position your iPad at nearly any angle, even allowing you to close it up entirely for easy transportation. Once closed, both your iPad and Brydge go to sleep automatically. Hinge made of metal alloys and magnets, with a thermoplastic elastomer shellBrydge s hinge combines the forces of friction and magnetism to hold strongly onto the iPad. There is no need to enclose your iPad in any sort of case, instead, your iPad snaps in and is ready to go. If you need your iPad free from Brydge, simple hold down on the Brydge and pull your iPad free. Optional Stereo Speakers Brydge connects with your iPad via bluetooth, so there is no need to deal with any wires or plugs. This was important aesthetically, but also adds to the portability and convenience of the product. Additionally, the keyboard has been designed specifically for an iPad, with iPad functions built in and charges through a USB connection.Kickstarter is an amazing tool that has helped introduce you to our product so that we can raise this capital. We have come so far and have a clear plan to cross the finish line, but part of that plan relies on you. We have calculated that we need $90K in order to produce the product in bulk and bring it to market. If you're interested in seeing the Brydge being made and would like to receive one of the first editions please pledge. Thank you!

340`Thank you so much for taking a few minutes out of your day to stop by and consider backing my first Kickstarter project - Meepillows! I want to personally thank you in writing since the producers of the video didn't think I had "it" to speak on camera (self-reflection is very hard). I want to sincerely express my appreciation to you and the hobby that has changed my life - board games! Is it weird to say that? Perhaps. But through all the friends I have met, all the colleagues I have connected with, all the strain my brain has endured at game night, and all the good times it all has brought, I feel that it has changed my life in a very positive way.Now, here I am! Instead of backing another board game on Kickstar...hold on......yeah, I just backed another game on Kickstarter...Anyway, I finally decided to create my own board game related project. I not only started my company Top Shelf Fun through my innate desire to be a part of this great hobby, but to bring something different to the tabletop/sofa. By backing this project you are not just helping me bring a Meepillow to your gameroom, but you are helping me set my company up for sucess to create other future projects! There are some pretty hefty minimums from the manufacturer to bring a plush to life, and I am doing it with 6 different colors! It's crazy, but I am confident we can make this happen. I really believe we can do this together!So, once again, a big "thank you" for stopping by while your boss isn't looking to help my dream become a reality! Now, I know what you are thinking! What are 'Thank You' goals? Well, when I started this project I didn't know what to expect. At all. I knew that I didn't have the ability to upgrade the Meepillow in any way as a product (no component upgrades were possible), so I didn't include "Stretch Goals" in my campaign. Since this was my first Kickstarter I also wanted to keep it simple and clean.Fast forward a couple weeks and I was so overwhelmed by the community, the support, and how fast I surpassed my initial funding goal I just had to figure out a way to thank each of you. I wanted to express my appreciation in a fun way. A gamer's way!So, here are the special 'Thank You' Goals we have unlocked thus far:1. Future Discounts: Each backer will receive special codes after the campaign ends that will entitle them to future exclusive discounts on my website.2. End of Campaign Game: After the campaign has ended I will be taking a survey. I will ask each backer two questions:A. What was the most popular Meepillow color of the campaign?B. What was the total quantity sold of that Meepillow?The backer who was closest to the correct answer of the correct color (you can go over) will win a free set of all 6 Meepillows! In case of a tie there will (of course) be a D20 roll off which will be recorded on video. 3. Official Meepillow Certificate: At the end of the campaign every backer will receive a link to a set of "Official Meepillow Guarantee" .pdf files. There will be 6 .pdfs (one for each Meepillow color) and these particular certificates (blue shown below) will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers only! The Meepillow Guarantee! Again, thank you so much for all of your support. I certainly couldn't have done it without you! A "meeple" is a little wooden pawn used in many modern day board games to represent a player. "Meeple" is believed to be a combination of the words "my" and "people." The meeple originated in the board game Carcassonne which was released about 15 years ago and continues to make gamers out of unsuspecting people today! Glorious Meeples!!! Since then, meeples have been used in countless other board games and have become the unofficial symbol of modern day tabletop gaming. Nowadays, meeples are not only used to represent people, but animals, creatures, monsters, and much, much more. You see them in logos, t-shirts, playing cards, and many other suprising places!They're everywhere! Meepillow Blueprint Meepillows are my interpretation of what the offspring of meeples and pillows would look like. They are soft, huggable and will definitely liven up any room in your home. They are 15 inches tall, almost 16 inches wide and 6 inches thick. They were born out of my love of board games and the tabletop game industry as a whole. The original 6 colors were chosen based on popular player colors used in modern day board games, but from this Kickstarter I hope to grow this business with new sizes and colors! I knew from the beginning that shipping would be a challenge. Unlike other projects, this one would pose a logistical problem of shipping many multiple large items together. The Meepillow is already quite large and an odd shape, and adding multiple units makes the shipping box huge! So, I decided to absorb shipping costs best I could, offer discount tiers on different reward levels, and ship from multiple fulfillment warehouses that will help offset the insane costs. "Dimension Weight" is my least favorite combination of words right now!1 Meepillow: US $8 / The World $102 Meepillows: US $15 / The World $183 Meepillows: US $20 / The World $254 Meepillows: US $25 / The World $325 Meepillows: US $29 / The World $406 Meepillows: US $32 / The World $47Many months later of pulling my hair out it turns out in the end the cost to ship was simply unavoidable. I stopped worrying and decided to just love the project.I hope you do too! I went through a few companies and prototypes until I fined tuned the meeple shape that works best as a giant huggable plush. Even though the shape is simple, it is iconic and it needed to be perfect. Otherwise it would have just been a blob or a weird starfish shape. Making the shape work was surprisingly more difficult than expected. Receiving these prototypes was so amazing. All the hard work was starting to pay off. Having them in hand and being able to show people validated what I already knew. These Meepillows were not only cool to look at, but incredibly soft and quite epic! Prototypes in all their meeple glory! Since the prototypes are just, well, prototypes I needed to test multiple colors as well. In the end the Purple Meepillow (which is clearly more of a lavender above) and the Yellow Meepillow will see the biggest changes.Please note that your screen will not accurately portray the colors exactly how they will be in final product. Between the camera used to photograph the fabric, the lighting, and your computer/phone screen it can be difficult to show the colors exactly as they are represented. Have faith though! They are vibrant and accurate to my specifications!

Top Shelf Fun was born out of a love for fun, geeky and just plain awesome stuff.

341`Mighty Mug Barware - The Only Barware That Won't Fall Over How many times have you been relaxing with a drink when, suddenly, you accidentally knock it over? It s even worse when the spill is red wine on your carpet, craft brew on the laptop, or scotch on your pants.Well, we put a stop to the madness. Move aside old-fashioned drinkware! The everyday worry of knocking a glass over became tiring, so we created a revolutionary solution to this universal problem: Mighty Mug Barware - the only barware that grips when knocked into.Able to withstand knocks from 360 degrees, Mighty Mug Barware will not topple over if bumped into, but will lift up naturally when you go in for a sip. That means: say goodbye to murder scene looking wine stains, fried laptops, and embarrassing wardrobe malfunctions. SmartGrip Technology - Some Next Level IshThe Mighty Mug Barware collection grips to any smooth and solid surface such as your table, desk, counter, or bar.Sorcery? Trick of the eye? No, the magic is in our patented Smartgrip technology. Not to be confused with a magnet or suction cup, the Smartgrip at the bottom of the cup creates a vacuum that locks the mug onto the surface - effectively preventing it from being knocked over. The vacuum is released instantly when the mug is lifted straight up (requiring no extra effort). Specs These new glasses are made out of crystal clear, BPA Free Tritan plastic giving them enhanced clarity and making the Mighty Mug Barware an unbreakable collection. Plus, all of the cups in this line are top rack dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Each piece is uniquely designed to withstand toppling, while still holding the perfect amount of your beverage: RewardsWhether you're getting Mighty Mug for yourself, gifting it to friends and family, buying it for your staff, or thanking your wedding guests with this as a parting gift - we have the perfect reward for you. All Kickstarter Rewards will ship before the items hit any retail outlets.Born to Be Mighty. Born to Be Gifted. Mighty Mug Barware is the gift that will get your whole neighborhood talking. It arrives at your door ready to be gifted, so just wrap it up or throw it in a party bag and call it a day! Mighty Mug on A BoatIn order to test Mighty Mug Barware, we took it out on the high seas, along with our original models for some high seas adventure. While we shattered a few beer bottles, Mighty Mug hung in for the adventure! You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 Return to Kickstarter Since the successful launch of our travel mug last year, Mighty Mug has been featured in hundreds of publications around the world such as the New York Times, Core 77, Real Simple, The Verge and hundreds of other media outlets. After receiving press from around the world, many asked us for a Mighty Mug specially made to enjoy their adult beverages. So, we went to work and began designing a variety of glasses that will be able to hold any drink you choose. This new campaign is to drive the project s finishing stage, so it can be delivered straight to your favorite bottle.Help us by sharing Mighty Mug with your friends! Faster + Better + Stronger = Mighty While our first campaign was a great success, we learned many important lessons that will help make this campaign run much more smoothly for backers. #1 International Shipping: For our first campaign, we shipped all packages via USPS (United States Postal Service). While this worked out well for US & Canada Backers, it was not optimal for International Backers (as it took their package 6 or more weeks to arrive). Resolution: This year all International Backers will have their rewards shipped via an expedited manner and rewards will arrive in 7-10 of leaving our office. #2 Tracking Information: Another lesson we learned during our first campaign was that by shipping International packages by the USPS' least expensive option, backers were unable to track their packages from start to finish. Resolution: This year, all International Backers will have their rewards shipped with tracking information that will update them up until the package reaches their door. #3 Updates/ Customer Service: During our first campaign we were not ready for the interest level Mighty Mug received. Thus, we were not ready for the amount of inquiries that came in. Resolution: This year, we have added Customer Happiness members to our team. All questions/inquiries during this campaign will be answered in 24 hours or less.#4 Quality Improvement and Happiness Guarantee :With each new model, we have advanced the technology and improved the quality of all Mighty Mugs. We are confident that you will absolutely love your Mighty Mug, but if you re not 100% happy, we will replace it for you at any time.Saving the World One Mug At a Time Team Mighty We are a team of mechanical engineers and industrial designers that are dedicated to saving people from disastrous spills. So, we designed mugs that will not fall over when knocked into. We spent 4 years developing and perfecting Mighty Mug and its patented Smartgrip technology. We hope that you love Mighty Mug and that all of your days to come are spill free.Praise From Our First Mighty Mug Launch International BackersWe can ship Mighty Mug worldwide, with the exceptions of Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela. Please note that you may be responsible for duties, fees, and taxes applicable to your region. For The Tech Savvy Mighty Mug's innovative Smartgrip technology uses basic principles of physics by trapping air underneath its base when placed down. This unbelievably strong hold is possible because air cannot be stretched when the mug is pushed.The real magic is experienced when the mug is lifted straight up. The air pressure is equalized instantly allowing the user to naturally lift the mug just as you would any other mug. At only half an inch in height, the Smartgrip puck that powers Mighty Mug is able to withstand between 5-10 lbs of force. Try that on your old drinkware! Need help? We're here for you.If you have questions at any time, during or after the campaign, you can always reach us at getmighty@themightymug.com Retailer/Distributor InquiryAre you are a retailer or distributor interested in selling Mighty Mug? If so we would love to hear from you. US Retailer /Wholesaler Mighty Mug ContactInternational Retailer / Wholesaler Mighty Mug Contact
342`CellRobot is the first complete consumer robotics kit that allows you to build your very own robot. Created by a team of Ivy-league Chinese robotics engineers, CellRobot is bringing accessible robotics to everybody! Modular robotics is one of the most complex areas of robotics because each added element allows new movements & functionality. Normally such robots are exclusive to research labs, until now. CellRobot is bringing accessible robots to consumers. Create one to draw a picture, help with time-lapse photos, monitor your home for security & more! Just as the cells in our bodies work together to create an organism, CellRobot is made up of single cells that, when combined, build functioning robots. Unique in its progressive design, CellRobot gives you the opportunity to learn, explore & create. Start with a Heart, snap on Cells & add Functional Cells like vision, wheels, or mounts for additional functionality! Each cell has eight joint faces which can be connected to each other through a simple twist movement. The joints will snap together for secure attachment. CellRobot's app has an extensive pre-uploaded shape library. From the home screen, open the Shape library and scroll through numerous builds. Once you've selected your design, follow the interactive instructions to easily create a robot. The app detects your robot and tells you which cells to attach to which joints. Refresh to get helpful feedback about position and placement. Then, control your robot with preprogrammed movements. Once you feel comfortable with CellRobot and have your own ideas for build, you can create through 'Custom Mode' in the app. CellRobot detects the positioning of each cell unit. Create a new design and set specific parameters for how each cell unit will move. You have the power to create complex and specific movements. Save your designs in the app to access later or share with the community. Set your movements in one of two ways: setting parameters for each cell in the app or manually twisting cells into desired positions. CellRobot allows you to create complex cinematic & combinatory movement through manipulation of each single cell-all through your smartphone! Home Surveillance Zoom a CellRobot around your house with a camera to monitor every room while you're away. Your Pet's New Best FriendPlay with your pets & take the cutest photo from their level. Timelapse Photography AssistantSet up CellRobot to get that perfect sunset time lapse & step up your Instagram game. Racing VehicleCellRobot is powerful enough to cruise over any terrain. Build your best drone & race your friends. Personal AssistantSet your robot to water your garden, create a perfect reading lamp, fan you when you're hot, or hold your iPad while you FaceTime. CellRobot can even mix your cocktail after a long day! Futuristic GadgetCellRobot opens up a limitless world of exploration, eliminating boredom of restrictive robots that box in your imagination. What will you create!? Anything you can conceptualize, you can build! The modular design allows one Heart unit to be connected up to 20 Cells, including Wheels, Vision & Mount. CellRobot's app allows users to control their robot without programming, directly from their phone or tablet. Due to the modularity, you can create extremely unique & hyper concentrated movements. Each individual cell has a full 360 degree rotation, allowing the user to program degree of rotation, timing & order of movements. This means that no limits are set on what you can create or what your robot can do! Working with CellRobot encourages critical thinking & creative exploration. Creating from within the shape library employs classical mechanics, having users follow directions & make physical connections. When users create with custom mode, they expand even further into programming logic, setting specific rules that define how an entire system will operate. No coding or mechanical engineering knowledge is required to start building. All units connect through a simple but secure twist & snap joint. Because it is so easy to get started, anybody can use CellRobot to create their own high functioning robot. Use CellRobot as a jumping off platform for your imagination & share with the community what you discover. This allows for continual growth through a community with a shared passion for robotics. Join & Grow the CellRobot CommunityCellRobot provides an open Hardware Platform Interface (HPI) to our users to encourage makers to contribute to the growth of our robot community. Our goal is to enable all developers to add their functional modules to the platform to make CellRobot smarter and more powerful. The CellRobot community encourages creativity & innovation through an easy-to-use platform. Users have the opportunity to add actuators like a robot hand or pneumatic suction cup or distance & infrared sensors.

346`HOT OFF THE PRESSMotorbike Writer: Women rider motorcycle bags look chicDealerNews.com: MotoChic launches Kickstarter for ladies backpackBIKEEXIF: Hot Picks: Women s Motorcycle GearBikes in the Fast Lane: Idea: Lauren Backpack Made For Chic Female BikersSilicon Valley Lodge: Silicon Valley: Women, Motorcycles and The Bag GirlRiders: Fashion and Function in a Backpack Designed for Women Motorcycle RideMY MISSIONWhile road tripping on a motorcycle to visit friends in Sacramento one weekend, I borrowed my boyfriend's backpack and found it to be ill-fitting and very masculine in design. I went looking for my own gear and couldn't find anything that was functional and stylish.For the past 18 months, I've been pursuing my dream to design functional, fashionable gear for women on the go. Today, I'm excited to unveil the Lauren - a bag that quickly and easily converts from a backpack to a tote bag. My mission is to elevate women's gear from the "shrink it and pink it" approach taken by most manufacturers to MotoChic. I've designed a collection of high quality, design-conscious clothing and accessories for use on or off the bike. Whether you ride motorcycles, are a student, or a busy mom you are going to love these bags for their style and versatility. INTRODUCING THE LAUREN We've come a long way, baby. My muse for this design was iconic American model, actress, and motorcycle enthusiast, Lauren Hutton. Did you know Lauren was the original vice-president of the Guggenheim Museum Motorcycle Club? Yes, she's badass and so is this bag. Exclusively designed as the ultimate lifestyle bag, the Lauren converts from a functional backpack to a chic, everyday purse and is the only bag you'll ever need for on or off road adventures. Wait until you see this beauty in person Classic Styling with Practical Details Whether you re commuting to the office, getting away for the weekend, or taking a Sunday afternoon ride on curvy back roads, the Lauren is the only bag you ll ever need. Patent-pending design converts quickly and easily from a sleek, aerodynamic backpack to a stylish tote Lightweight, yet offers stability without the rigidity of hard sided backpacks Clever hideaway compartments hold the backpack harness, tote straps, and waist belt Shoulder straps for tote mode are long, 100% genuine leather for durability and ease of use with bulky jackets Lauren in backpack mode Lauren in tote bag mode Take a Peek Inside The interior features a spacious main compartment with three open pockets and a full-length zippered pocket The soft, lined protective pocket in the back fits a 13" laptop, a tablet, 2L hydration pack, or back protector for riding Signature moto lining is PU coated for water resistance and protection against spills/stains Outside zipper opens to reveal a full-length pocket, half pocket for easy access to personal items, and a key leash Three open pockets and a zippered pocket inside Inside padded pocket with water resistant moto print lining Full-length pocket, half pocket for easy access to personal items, and a key leash Looking good...how about the outside? Made from durable, lightweight, easy to clean, polyester Leather side closures reduce wind resistance when bag is in backpack mode Large reflective panels on the back for nighttime visibility Two exterior side pockets ensure ready access to water bottles, phones, sunglasses, or other essentials Main compartment has a two way zipper that opens halfway to protect items from falling out Hidden dust/rain fly with reflective logo and metal snap hooks keep the fly attached to your backpack through wind, rain, and high speed Bottom is constructed with high strength 1000 denier polyester Side closures for improved aerodynamics Side pockets and main opening with two way zipper Sturdy reinforced bottom with attached rainfly Rainfly with reflective logo The Fit Backpack harness curves inward to better fit women's shoulders Hydration tube holders on left and right side of harness (great for hiking, riding, biking, festivals, and more) Sternum strap, waist belt, and underarm straps are fully adjustable for a tailored fit Don't take our word for it I either am wearing a big backpack that's not very cute or a tiny crossbody purse that I can't carry anything in. This is a good combo of both. :) -Kate S. I'm stoked that there is someone out there who is finally making gear towards lady moto riders! When I ride, I'm rocking a big, bulky bag because I like it to buckle across my chest to make sure it's secure (which, thankfully this bag also does). -Laura L. I think your bag is the best I've ever seen...plus it's made by a female who knows what a female likes/needs. - Valerie T.The Nitty,GrittyDetails Made from durable,lightweight polyester 100% leather shoulder straps & quilting Corrosion resistant YKK zippers Dimensions: H 16 in x W 12.5 in x D 5 in (H: 41 cm x W 32 cm x D 13 cm) Tote strap drop: 14 in (35.6 cm) Volume: 915 cubic inches (15 L) ENCORE: THE VALERIEThe Valerie is the perfect accessory for taking your essentials with you on or off the bike.

348`Thank YOU to ALL backers for FUNding!Did you miss the KickStarter? Pre-order Pack O Game SET 2: HEREFor more information visit: www.perplext.comFollow me on Twitter: @ChrisHandy Pack O Game is a series of small card games with a surprising amount of gameplay, strategy and fun. Each game is unique in theme, mechanics and complexity, with 30 cards (1 inch by 3 inch) in a tuck box the size of a pack of gum. In 2014, Pack O Game SET 1 launched with great success. It s focus was variety for many types of people. SET 2 is about short, middle-weight games for gamers and people looking for more depth and interesting gameplay. Hook: Unique Team Picking" (just like those gym class days!) with interesting strategy and manipulation during the event playing phase. In GYM, players play on 1 of 2 teams, which can accommodate 2, 4 or 6 players. There are 2 phases to the game. The "Pick" phase is just like Gym class! Each team member will choose a Kid from the line up to add to his hand. If a "bully" is acquired, a team member is allowed to influence which 4 (of the 6) events will be played in the next phase. In the "Play" phase, each team member will play a Kid to one of the 4 events on his turn. Playing Kids will also allow an "event action", which may manipulate player hands, Kid positions, and more. Playing a "bully" allows you to reposition a Coach, which reduces chaos at an event, but also makes it more difficult to make changes to the roster. In the end, the team with the most cumulative points from the 4 events is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY GYM NOW! "Don't be fooled by the size of the box; GYM is a heavy game requiring little table space. Pound for Pound, GYM is one if my new favorites, given its size, weight, and portability." - Brian Fiore (Just Got Played) Hook: Quick turns, Press your luck , set collecting with stealing. RUM is a press your luck, set collecting game that s played quickly, over many turns. On your turn, you must draw a card or play sets of bottles to gain Captain Cards and earn points. The 3 face up cards are called The Beach and these are community cards and considered in your hand . You can also play a Rum Trio , which is 3 single bottles in a color, to steal the captain card and increase it by 2. But, you can t press your luck too long, because the Parrot is lurking close by to steal your rum. The game ends when a player reaches a set amount of points OR when the time on the Castaway Clock runs out. Tabletopia User? TRY RUM NOW! Hook: Mancala meets secret goal/set collecting farming game. SOW is a challenging gardening game in which players redistribute seeds and flowers in the garden in order to pick the bouquet that will reward the most points at the end of the game. Each turn, a player must redistribute a row in the garden, then takes any applicable actions. If the last card placed was a Seeds Card, it must be flipped over (and all other matching Seeds of that color) to become a Flower. Flowers reward points when collected from a player s Wheelbarrow. There are 2 Garden Action Cards that may also allow extra actions, if placed in the same row, on the same turn. Garden Actions will allow a Gardener to change the windmill direction (which changes the card redistribution in future turns), or it may allow a player to discard all flowers of a certain type (Gopher) or collect a flower in their wheel barrow (watering can). In the end, the players show their favorite color and are rewarded points for flowers. Each player calculates their score as follows: 3 points for each flower with his Favorite Color in the Center portion. 2 points for each flower with his Favorite Color on the Outer portion. 1 point for each flower WITHOUT his Favorite Color. Tabletopia User? TRY SOW NOW! Hook: A short, 2-player battle of hand management and timing. On your turn, you must perform the following actions in order:1. Deploy Orcs: Play 1 card from your hand to a Territory that has not yet been conquered.2. Draw Weapons: Choose ANY Stockpile(s). Draw card(s) as follows: A. Draw 1 card into your hand if you deployed 2 Orcs. B. Draw 2 cards into your hand if you deployed 1 Orc. A Territory battle occurs immediately after the Stockpile next to a Territory is exhausted. Then, players total their deployed Orcs at that Territory, and a victor will be declared. Orcs that fight in battle will not score points, they only help conquer Territories. Scoring occurs at the end of the game, when all Stockpiles have been exhausted. The player who conquers the most valuable Territories and holds native Orcs in their hand (matching those lands), is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY ORC NOW! I am just so impressed by Orc! Almost from the first turn the decisions will grip you and not let up until the very end. I think what amazes me is that each choice is fundamentally simple: which card do I play and to which battle? Yet each of those choices has numerous hugely important implications for the remaining game, all of which are immediately understandable from a glance at the tabletop. While the box might say war is ugly, this game is anything but! - Matt (Creaking Shelves) In this nutty set connecting game, players will acquire nut cards and and arrange them in their own individual trees. Same-colored nuts that are kept together will reward players with more points as they may only count their largest nut cluster in each of the 6 colors at the end of the game. The player with the most points is the winner! Each round, the role of the Forager will rotate clockwise from player to player. When a player is the Forager, he must add a new nut column to replenish the previously taken column. Then, he must take any 1 card in a column and place it in his playing area. Then, the remaining players must take 1 card from the same column and place them in their playing area. The game continues with the next player in clockwise order becoming the Forager, and so on. Nut Cards will create trees with nuts on both sides. Cards must touch at least one square side or cover a full square (or at least a third of a card). Once cards have been placed, they may not me moved for the remainder of the game. A Squirrel will double the value of a cluster of nuts if it is orthogonally connected to the largest cluster of the squirrel s corresponding color. Squirrels must be placed with the squirrel right-side up, facing the player.The Squirrel has no value itself, but may be a connector for 2 sections of same colored nut clusters. Wild Nuts may be used as any colored nut during the scoring if it is contiguously connected to the largest cluster of a particular color. The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted AND there are no columns left in play. The player who earned the most points from his six sets of nuts is the winner. In DIG, each player is a dog that will run throughout the Yard, dig up bones and attempt to return them to the matching colored Dog Bowl with the greatest efficiency. All players will score once, at the end of the game, based on the cumulative value of the Bones that he returned to the matching Dog Bowls. There are 4 Bones in each of the 5 colors in the game. A Bone's value is determined at the end of the game, based on the distance of its corresponding Dog Bowl to the Dog House. The Dog Bowl that is closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 5 for each bone of that color. The Dog Bowl that is second closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 4 for each bone of that color, and so on. The Bowls and Bones will be swapped from the end of the Yard into the place of a recently dug up bone, continuously moving the 5 Bowls to the end of the Yard nearest the Dog House. Each Yard Card has a Scent with 2 colors. The Bone on the opposite side of the Yard Card matches 1 of the colors of the Scent. This will help players determine which color Bone might be dug if that Yard Card is selected for digging. One of the most interesting aspects of DIG is the unique "Leap Frog" Yard replacement mechanism. When a Bone is dug up, the Card that is furthest from the the Dog House, is removed and fills the empty spot created by the Dog. This action creates some interesting ways to influence which Bones and Bowls each Dog has close access to, but also makes timing critical for influencing Bone value for scoring. On a player's turn, he may perform ANY or ALL of the following actions, but may only perform each action ONCE per turn. MOVE: A player may move his Dog a maximum of 4 cards along the Yard Cards, and 1 less for each Bone he holds prior to movement. For example, if a player holds 2 Bone cards, he may move his Dog up to 2 Cards, moving below or above the Yard cards. A player may move his Dog in any direction. There is a movement legend on the bottom half of the Dog House for easy reference. DIG: A player may dig up a bone and place the Bone card in his hand. Bones that are in the hand are kept secret until they are dropped off and placed in front of the player. The empty space created from the Yard Card removal is filled with the last Card at the edge of Yard. A player may have no more than 3 Bones in their hand at any time. DROP: Drop a Bone into a Dog Bowl and place the Bone card from your hand to the playing area in front of himself, face up with the Bone visible to all players. A Dog must be AT the Bowl of the corresponding color in order to drop off any Bones of that color. Game End and Scoring: When Bowls are the only remaining Cards in the Yard (next to the Dog House), the game ends immediately and players total their scores. Any Bones still in a player's hand are removed from the game and do not count for scoring. Calculate your score by identifying the value of each Bone in your possession.5 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color closest to the Dog House.4 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color second closest to the Dog House.3 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color third closest to the Dog House.2 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color fourth closest to the Dog House.1 Point Each: Bones matching the Bowl color furthest from the Dog House. The player with the most points wins! Here are 4 games that take little space and little time to play, but demand all of a player s attention. That s impressive and fun.

349`AnyMote Home fills the last gap in home automation by bringing you full control over InfraRed controllable electronics like your TV, DVD/BluRay player, amplifier, air conditioner and even IR-controlled power plugs. Through extreme power efficiency algorithms, Bluetooth 4.0 wireless connectivity and 360 control, AnyMote Home makes it easy for you to control your entire living room, using only your smartphone or tablet! We have on average 4 remotes in our living rooms, and spend two weeks of our lifetimes looking for lost remotes. Why keep struggling with a 60-year old technology when we always have our smartphones with us ? STEP 0: Put the AnyMote on your coffee table, or in any place where it has direct line of sight to the equipment you want to control. Indirect/reflected line of sight might also work, depending on the reflecting surface. STEP 1: Launch Smart IR Remote on your phone or tablet(iOS and Android compatible) and wait 2 seconds for it to find your AnyMote Home. If multiple AnyMotes are available, you'll be prompted to pick one that will control the device you're about to add. STEP 2: Pick a category, type in your model and go through the intuitive testing process to find and select the best matching remote for your device. In the small chance that your device isn't supported by our database, you can record the commands you need. And more than 1,000 other supported brands STEP 3: Repeat Step 2 for each device you want to control, then start using your phone as an universal remote! AnyMote Home is accompanied by Smart IR Remote (iPhone / iPad version to come), the app that everyone in the past year and a half agrees is that it's simply the best universal IR remote ever created for a smartphone. With the ability to create macros, automation through own tasks (like "IF phone rings THEN mute everything"), Tasker integration and IFTTT (planned), you'll be able to have your living room work for you. If you're worried about device coverage, don't be: having Smart IR Remote for sale for over a year means we've had time to build one of the most comprehensive databases of remotes ever created. With nearly 800,000 remotes, you're most certainly covered! Even if you're not, AnyMote Home's learning feature will get you the last few steps over the finish line. To sweeten the deal, we have commands you'll never find on the original remotes, despite their unmeasurable value. For example, for Samsung, LG, and many other TVs, we have discrete buttons for switching directly to HDMI1, HDMI 2, ..; setting the MUTE to ON or OFF; etc.. You no longer have to toggle through inputs, mute, or other settings - simply go in one setting directly to the state you need, without even having to look at your TV! With battery power and absolutely no wires, 4 high-power IR leds for 360 view and huge IR range of 10 meters (33 feet), you can put AnyMote Home anywhere in the room where there's a line of sight to your equipment (most of the time, that line can even be bounced off a wall). You can hide your equipment along with AnyMote Home in a drawer now You don't have to worry about battery life either. Our hardware + software is custom built and was constructed from the ground-up to be powerful and efficient. Our several months-long tests show that two classic Duracell AA batteries should last a year with an average of 2700 commands sent daily. This isn't just a gimmick. We've been using prototypes for months now, and it's really been liberating to not have to search for remotes all the time. Here are a few examples of our day-to-day uses: MUTE/PAUSE ON PHONE CALL - Each time our phone rings, the TV will become muted, our movie will pause (if there's a movie playing), and Sonos system will mute (the smartphone app also has Sonos integration through WiFi) ONE REMOTE TO RULE THEM ALL - With the help of a Smart Remote (that's what we call custom remotes), we made a single screen where the volume and mute buttons control a Sonos zone, channel buttons control the Set Top Box, play/pause and file browsing buttons control a XBMC player (again, through WiFi), and the power button is a macro that turns everything on or off WELCOME HOME - When we come home, the Sonos system starts playing the music queue, air conditioning turns on, sets the mode to COOL and temperature to 23C, and the lights to 50%. This all happens automatically, without even launching the app. MOVIE MODE - A single button press turns on the TV (if it wasn't already on), turns on a XBMC player, switches the TV to HDMI 3, sets the speaker volume to 50%, and turns the light off. If only there was an IR/WiFi controllable home popcorn machine... TV ZAPPER - This one is exclusive to Samsung phones, but cool nonetheless: with a simple hand wave upwards above the phone (without even touching it), the TV channel switches up, a hand wave downwards switches the channel down, left and right waves change the volume 5 steps. It's all configurable! Here's what sits at the core of AnyMote Home and the accompanying Smart Remote app:AnyMote Home: BLE (Bluetooth 4.0 Smart) for efficient and fast communication with your phone / tablet CC2541 by Texas Instruments chip for a reliable BLE stack and ideal performance 4 high-power IR LEDs for 360 degree view and 10m (33ft) range. Most times, you don't even need direct line of sight as signal easily bounces off walls and furniture 1 IR receiver that can capture signals from 4m (13ft) away 20kHz - 60Khz IR signal frequency 2xAA batteries - with 2000mAh each (classic Duracell), lasts one year with an average of 2700 commands/day 10cm (4 inch) radius, 4.5cm (1.8 inch) height OTA updates delivered through Smart IR Remote on your phone Multiple simultaneous connections possible through some clever tricks in the Smart IR Remote app running on your phone Smart IR Remote (the app controlling AnyMote Home): Already published on Google Play, currently works with phones that have an IR Blaster integrated (Galaxy S4, S5, HTC One), has a rating of 4.6/5 out with 100.000 customers. Database of 800.000 remotes, with more added daily Integration with devices over WiFi and Internet (existing: XBMC, VLC, Sonos, Roku, etc.., planned: Nest, Smart Things, LIFX, and anything that's technically possible) macros for combining commands, tasks (if this then that), widgets, floating remotes (chathead style remotes, for true multi-tasking - Android-only) Integration with Tasker, planned integration with IFTTT, Google Now iOS app is 90% done, with estimated launch date in November 2014. All backers will get (optional) beta access. Android Wear integration (planned), Samsung Gear 2 (Tizen) integration - partially released control unlimited devices (no stupid limits for just 3, 5, 15, etc..) We're experts in building software, but when it comes to hardware projects like these, building a product isn't just making fancy plastic cases, timelines, or even perfectly working prototypes. Timelines get adjusted, sometimes for the worst, but we've planned conservatively and found reliable partners with experience in the area so that we'd be able to keep track with our plan as closely as possible. Our prototype is working 100% and the electronic design we have is at it's final version. Through the already published android app that was used and tested by hundreds of thousands of customers, AnyMote Home currently acts just like an external IR Blaster for your phone. We tried a quick prototype with Arduino to make sure it works Advanced to a dedicated proof-of-concept with industry-leading Texas Instruments chip Got our prototype to 360 degree range Slimmed it down to fit in our case Voil Special ThanksBesides everyone else involved in this project, we'd like to thank the guys at Digital New Media for offering to help us with our campaign video! We couldn't have done it without you!

Sketch > Design > First Prototype Founded in 2012, our products are inspired by nearly a decade of military service and a lifetime of adventures. Fidelis, faithful, is the defining principle born into all aspects of our company. We re a scrappy team of veterans, creative professionals, and gear junkies that mashup the intelligent design of tactical gear and urban aesthetics into bags that transcend work and play, indoors and out. Tim O'Neil - After deployments to Asia and the Middle East as an Infantry Officer in the Marines, Tim wanted to bring the quality of rugged well built gear to his new life as a urban professional. Brandon Jernigan - Brandon is the creative of the team. He's backpacked 5 continents and honed his craft as a commercial photographer. He also sprouted a mullet at the tender age of 7. Et al. We also want to acknowledge all the help we have received from others along the way. Thanks! Follow us on Facebook and Instagram. Our bags are cut and sewn on American soil. We're also proud members of the Maker's Coalition, an initiative to bring back the cut and sew industry back to the States. We're bootstrapping this venture and manufacturing in the US demands more upfront production costs. We strategically source most of our materials domestically, and occasionally incorporate some of the most innovative tactical components from around the world. We've elected to manufacture limited first edition bags to ensure tighter quality assurance and the production of the most rugged, reliable, and progressive gear. These bags have been rigorously tested and after multiple revisions, we're ready to "click" manufacture. The only problem is we can't make these bags yet. With your support, we can cut and sew these bags right here in Minnesota as soon this campaign ends. Please feel free to contact us at info@fidelisco.com. Thanks you for your support!

352`8 INCH JUNKYARD GLASS BOWL VESSEL SINK MADE FROM JUNKYARD GLASS About us We are the Genetti s, a family with a dream of using our crafting skills to turn discarded tempered glass from junkyards into useful, profitable and eco-friendly products. We believe that creating beautiful, handmade objects can go hand in hand with a positive impact on the environment and our local communities. The beautiful vessel sink that we have created is our version of giving value to what is currently a waste material bound for landfills.The EPA estimates that we currently discard 12-15 million tons of non-recyclable glass annually. Our idea for "upcycling" this glass provides not only the possibility of making a variety of elegant artisanal products, but an ingenious way to practice sustainable manufacturing. This project could even stimulate an upcycling stream to boost our local economy. We have already engineered the basic process, are looking into local available light manufacturing spaces and, thanks to our wonderful supporters, we are already receiving donations of discarded tempered glass to help expand our project. We also have the opportunity to partner with major solar/wind generated electric suppliers. Why do we need the money? To make our dream become a reality, we need a larger workspace to store, wash and make our Junkyard Glass products. We will use your generous donations to secure a suitable space and construct a larger fusing oven. We also intend to provide payment for several people who are currently donating their time to see this project succeed.

353`Where are the toys that provide young boys with positive messages? Look up and down the aisles at toy stores you ll find characters that are part of today's Hero-Industrial Complex, invented decades ago, being reused and repackaged by billion-dollar corporations to crank out merchandise, with no thought given to the development of young boys. As parents, we see first-hand the struggles boys face: it s hard to sit still, be quiet, share, pay attention. We want our boys to know it s OK to be themselves, and we want to teach them the values that we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. That is why we created the HeroBoys: a toy and comic book made specifically for young boys about young boys. HeroBoys are line of toys and comic books meant to celebrate the adventure, imagination, and limitless potential inherent in boys, while reinforcing positive values. With your support, we can bring a thoughtful alternative into the unimaginative world of boys toys. Our Heroes People are Talking about HeroBoys.. Late Congressman s son launches 'HeroBoys' toys and comic books How a Dad and a Mom Invented a New Toy Idea to Help Inspire Their Boys to Grow Into Good Men HeroBoys are Positive Super Hero Toys for Young Boys Dynamic Mom & Pop Duo Create HeroBoys Comics & Toys Rewards Hero Combo Starter Set That covers the why; let s move on to the what. The HeroBoys are 6 ordinary boys who are given superpowers by their mentor, The Gentleman, with a mandate to do good and provide an example to a city being overrun by selfish behavior. The HeroBoys line will follow this narrative through: Action Figures. Our first toy available on Kickstarter is the HeroBoys action figure: the only 18-inch action figure with a plush body AND functioning elbow and knee joints. You can choose from six different HeroBoys: We will send our backers images of the completed Hero figures so they can choose the Hero they would like. Gusto Prototype Comic Books. The HeroBoys comic book will be available as the first issue only or as a monthly subscription (hard copy and eComic). In these pages, the HeroBoys will learn that true strength comes from being honest, decent, and determined. Each issue will have a clear lesson for boys that can be used as teachable moment for parents who have precious few hours each day with their children. As a subscription, kids will get a new story every month. The stories use simple words to inspire a love of reading because we believe comic books are a vastly underutilized tool for encouraging literacy in young boys. T-Shirts. We also have some very cool, soft cotton HeroBoys T-shirts available with the HB team logo or the logo of your favorite HeroBoy. This is a great reward for those want to support this project but might not have a young boy at home. T-Shirts (The Hero Every Day of the Week package) Very Cool T-shirts Cape and Mask Sets. All Superheroes need to protect their secret identity make sure your superhero can too! Match your HeroBoys T-shirt with that Hero s cape and mask!! Our Heroes with Capes & Masks Where We Stand now Some of our development work We have spent thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars researching, writing, sourcing and prototyping to bring HeroBoys to this point. We have produced a prototype and are in discussions with manufacturers in China to begin production. We have the first comic written and illustrated. The T-shirts have been designed and have been produced in limited quantities. With the money raised through this campaign we will be able customize our prototype model for each HeroBoy and place our first production order. We will also be able to print the comic book and manufacturer the t-shirts. We are currently in discussions with fulfillment centers to fulfill orders. We intend to start shipping once all rewards are ready which we expect to be in the first quarter of 2016. The success of this campaign will also allow us to hire staff like an illustrator and developer to carry forward the HeroBoys mission.

355`Thank YOU to ALL backers for FUNding!Did you miss the KickStarter? Pre-order Pack O Game SET 2: HEREFor more information visit: www.perplext.comFollow me on Twitter: @ChrisHandy Pack O Game is a series of small card games with a surprising amount of gameplay, strategy and fun. Each game is unique in theme, mechanics and complexity, with 30 cards (1 inch by 3 inch) in a tuck box the size of a pack of gum. In 2014, Pack O Game SET 1 launched with great success. It s focus was variety for many types of people. SET 2 is about short, middle-weight games for gamers and people looking for more depth and interesting gameplay. Hook: Unique Team Picking" (just like those gym class days!) with interesting strategy and manipulation during the event playing phase. In GYM, players play on 1 of 2 teams, which can accommodate 2, 4 or 6 players. There are 2 phases to the game. The "Pick" phase is just like Gym class! Each team member will choose a Kid from the line up to add to his hand. If a "bully" is acquired, a team member is allowed to influence which 4 (of the 6) events will be played in the next phase. In the "Play" phase, each team member will play a Kid to one of the 4 events on his turn. Playing Kids will also allow an "event action", which may manipulate player hands, Kid positions, and more. Playing a "bully" allows you to reposition a Coach, which reduces chaos at an event, but also makes it more difficult to make changes to the roster. In the end, the team with the most cumulative points from the 4 events is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY GYM NOW! "Don't be fooled by the size of the box; GYM is a heavy game requiring little table space. Pound for Pound, GYM is one if my new favorites, given its size, weight, and portability." - Brian Fiore (Just Got Played) Hook: Quick turns, Press your luck , set collecting with stealing. RUM is a press your luck, set collecting game that s played quickly, over many turns. On your turn, you must draw a card or play sets of bottles to gain Captain Cards and earn points. The 3 face up cards are called The Beach and these are community cards and considered in your hand . You can also play a Rum Trio , which is 3 single bottles in a color, to steal the captain card and increase it by 2. But, you can t press your luck too long, because the Parrot is lurking close by to steal your rum. The game ends when a player reaches a set amount of points OR when the time on the Castaway Clock runs out. Tabletopia User? TRY RUM NOW! Hook: Mancala meets secret goal/set collecting farming game. SOW is a challenging gardening game in which players redistribute seeds and flowers in the garden in order to pick the bouquet that will reward the most points at the end of the game. Each turn, a player must redistribute a row in the garden, then takes any applicable actions. If the last card placed was a Seeds Card, it must be flipped over (and all other matching Seeds of that color) to become a Flower. Flowers reward points when collected from a player s Wheelbarrow. There are 2 Garden Action Cards that may also allow extra actions, if placed in the same row, on the same turn. Garden Actions will allow a Gardener to change the windmill direction (which changes the card redistribution in future turns), or it may allow a player to discard all flowers of a certain type (Gopher) or collect a flower in their wheel barrow (watering can). In the end, the players show their favorite color and are rewarded points for flowers. Each player calculates their score as follows: 3 points for each flower with his Favorite Color in the Center portion. 2 points for each flower with his Favorite Color on the Outer portion. 1 point for each flower WITHOUT his Favorite Color. Tabletopia User? TRY SOW NOW! Hook: A short, 2-player battle of hand management and timing. On your turn, you must perform the following actions in order:1. Deploy Orcs: Play 1 card from your hand to a Territory that has not yet been conquered.2. Draw Weapons: Choose ANY Stockpile(s). Draw card(s) as follows: A. Draw 1 card into your hand if you deployed 2 Orcs. B. Draw 2 cards into your hand if you deployed 1 Orc. A Territory battle occurs immediately after the Stockpile next to a Territory is exhausted. Then, players total their deployed Orcs at that Territory, and a victor will be declared. Orcs that fight in battle will not score points, they only help conquer Territories. Scoring occurs at the end of the game, when all Stockpiles have been exhausted. The player who conquers the most valuable Territories and holds native Orcs in their hand (matching those lands), is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY ORC NOW! I am just so impressed by Orc! Almost from the first turn the decisions will grip you and not let up until the very end. I think what amazes me is that each choice is fundamentally simple: which card do I play and to which battle? Yet each of those choices has numerous hugely important implications for the remaining game, all of which are immediately understandable from a glance at the tabletop. While the box might say war is ugly, this game is anything but! - Matt (Creaking Shelves) In this nutty set connecting game, players will acquire nut cards and and arrange them in their own individual trees. Same-colored nuts that are kept together will reward players with more points as they may only count their largest nut cluster in each of the 6 colors at the end of the game. The player with the most points is the winner! Each round, the role of the Forager will rotate clockwise from player to player. When a player is the Forager, he must add a new nut column to replenish the previously taken column. Then, he must take any 1 card in a column and place it in his playing area. Then, the remaining players must take 1 card from the same column and place them in their playing area. The game continues with the next player in clockwise order becoming the Forager, and so on. Nut Cards will create trees with nuts on both sides. Cards must touch at least one square side or cover a full square (or at least a third of a card). Once cards have been placed, they may not me moved for the remainder of the game. A Squirrel will double the value of a cluster of nuts if it is orthogonally connected to the largest cluster of the squirrel s corresponding color. Squirrels must be placed with the squirrel right-side up, facing the player.The Squirrel has no value itself, but may be a connector for 2 sections of same colored nut clusters. Wild Nuts may be used as any colored nut during the scoring if it is contiguously connected to the largest cluster of a particular color. The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted AND there are no columns left in play. The player who earned the most points from his six sets of nuts is the winner. In DIG, each player is a dog that will run throughout the Yard, dig up bones and attempt to return them to the matching colored Dog Bowl with the greatest efficiency. All players will score once, at the end of the game, based on the cumulative value of the Bones that he returned to the matching Dog Bowls. There are 4 Bones in each of the 5 colors in the game. A Bone's value is determined at the end of the game, based on the distance of its corresponding Dog Bowl to the Dog House. The Dog Bowl that is closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 5 for each bone of that color. The Dog Bowl that is second closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 4 for each bone of that color, and so on. The Bowls and Bones will be swapped from the end of the Yard into the place of a recently dug up bone, continuously moving the 5 Bowls to the end of the Yard nearest the Dog House. Each Yard Card has a Scent with 2 colors. The Bone on the opposite side of the Yard Card matches 1 of the colors of the Scent. This will help players determine which color Bone might be dug if that Yard Card is selected for digging. One of the most interesting aspects of DIG is the unique "Leap Frog" Yard replacement mechanism. When a Bone is dug up, the Card that is furthest from the the Dog House, is removed and fills the empty spot created by the Dog. This action creates some interesting ways to influence which Bones and Bowls each Dog has close access to, but also makes timing critical for influencing Bone value for scoring. On a player's turn, he may perform ANY or ALL of the following actions, but may only perform each action ONCE per turn. MOVE: A player may move his Dog a maximum of 4 cards along the Yard Cards, and 1 less for each Bone he holds prior to movement. For example, if a player holds 2 Bone cards, he may move his Dog up to 2 Cards, moving below or above the Yard cards. A player may move his Dog in any direction. There is a movement legend on the bottom half of the Dog House for easy reference. DIG: A player may dig up a bone and place the Bone card in his hand. Bones that are in the hand are kept secret until they are dropped off and placed in front of the player. The empty space created from the Yard Card removal is filled with the last Card at the edge of Yard. A player may have no more than 3 Bones in their hand at any time. DROP: Drop a Bone into a Dog Bowl and place the Bone card from your hand to the playing area in front of himself, face up with the Bone visible to all players. A Dog must be AT the Bowl of the corresponding color in order to drop off any Bones of that color. Game End and Scoring: When Bowls are the only remaining Cards in the Yard (next to the Dog House), the game ends immediately and players total their scores. Any Bones still in a player's hand are removed from the game and do not count for scoring. Calculate your score by identifying the value of each Bone in your possession.5 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color closest to the Dog House.4 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color second closest to the Dog House.3 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color third closest to the Dog House.2 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color fourth closest to the Dog House.1 Point Each: Bones matching the Bowl color furthest from the Dog House. The player with the most points wins! Here are 4 games that take little space and little time to play, but demand all of a player s attention. That s impressive and fun.

356`Our Kickstarter is over but you can still find Neoh on www.3dsoundlabs.com Neoh : the first smart 3D audio headphonesPlease meet Neoh, headphones for cinema sound anytime, anywhere ! Neoh is the first wearable home theater system. These headphones provide spatial sound simulation, using embedded motion sensors to provide the most immersive sound experience technology has ever brought to you. Our mobile application simulates multi-point sound sources in a virtual environment. The experience is comparable to the latest generation of movie theater surround sound systems or the most sophisticated home theater equipment on the market. With our 360 sound technology, we have successfully introduced a realistic and theatrical sound experience to 3D audio headphones. What we call 3D sound is the real life s sound. With Neoh headphones, we have ability to reproduce a sound that will appear to come from anywhere we want it to come from. We create a full artificial environment (360 ) with sound sources you will perceive as coming from any distance or direction.MONOOne source, one speaker, one channel This is a monophonic sound reproduction. It is the sound given to you by the gramophone in our video. STEREOTwo sources, two speakers, two channels Most of the time the stereophonic sound is represented by a left and a right speaker. It is what you have found in all the other headphones up-until today. Don t be afraid, it s over now. MULTISOURCEThis is what you got when you bought a home-theater sound system. You had to install five speakers, two behind you, three in front and one subwoofer for the bass. You can find 5.1 sound on DVDs, Blu-rays use 7.1 sources (same principle, 2 more speakers). It means you would have to buy and install up to eight speakers, to enjoy it but in one room only... However this provides a pretty good surround sound ! Today, you don t need this anymore. Neoh is your own personal home cinema and you can take it with you anytime, anywhere.Some new 3D audio formats are coming up, with even more virtual sound sources and a large number of speakers to reproduce them. Get ready ! Neoh breaks the barrier of having a limited amount of sound source.: You will be completely immersed in the sound. Neoh is your own personal home cinema and you can take it with you anytime, anywhere. Install the free Neoh player, to watch a movie on your iPad with 3D Sound. If you don t have an iPad, maybe you could watch a movie on your iPhone with 3D Sound. Soon you will be able to watch a movie on your laptop too. You have to call your friends to tell them you ve got a Neoh. Obviously, you can listen to music from any device you want but most importantly, enjoy it with your friends ! Very soon, you will watch movies with Android devices, play video games in the most immersive way or enter a virtual reality with a real 3D sound ! Our mobile application uses advanced signal processing algorithms to position the different audio sources.For instance, with a movie providing 5.1 audio channels, if a sound is defined to be coming from the source on your back right, you ll hear it coming directly from your back right.You will be able to play any movie and any music without having to change their format as we have made it compatible with most of multimedia standards available out there. We have also made it easy for you to access all of your content : Direct download Connection to your Dropbox Connection to your Google Drive Connection to your personal server You can accelerate the development of our application on Android Of course, you can also use Neoh without our mobile application: Neoh will work like any other pair of headphones.... Only without the realistic and immersive experience of 3D sound. Motion sensors:The housing on the left of the headset encloses our electronics. It is composed of many components, including gyroscopes, an accelerometers and a magnetometers. The sensors data are sent to our application by a Bluetooth Low Energy chip. All the system is powered by a rechargeable battery. The sensors track every one of your movements. Indeed, you do not stay completely motionless while watching a movie, and we have to offset even the smallest of your micro-movements to completely immerse you in your activity. This is due to a psychoacoustic effect. In your daily life, you subconsciously make a detailed analysis of your environment and you're brain gives specific attention to any kind of change within this environment. When you hear a sound, you unconsciously move your head in order to figure out the exact origin of the sound. The difference perceived in the sound is necessary for your brain to accurately locate sound sources. It does not need a large movement, just a few degrees is enough. You also make those micro-movements when you are watching a movie. This gets more important as the number of sound sources increase. Neoh compensates those movements to create a fixed audio sources relative to the screen. Without this your brain won t be able to figure out exactly where the sound is coming from: This is the only way to have a full immersion and an experience comparable to that of reality. Being able to hear sound where they re supposed to come from is also very useful in a lot of video games. First Person Shooter games are an obvious field of interest; Neoh gives you an incredible tactical advantage. Improving the perception of your environment, it enables you to have quicker and better reactions to game events. Finally, compensating those micro-movements increases the realism to an incredible extent to truly immerse you in a virtual reality. With regular headphones, the sound sticks to you : not so realistic after all ! With Neoh and its motion sensors, the sound stays where it's supposed to be: you're immersed in a virtual environment ! What do we mean with mobile cinema ?When we think about mobile cinema, we think about you, watching a movie anywhere, anytime you want. You re on a mobile device, such as a mobile phone or a tablet. We have chosen to start our development on iOS but we are already working on deploying our technology to others platforms.Why are we doing this ?We are doing this to let everybody enjoy the quality of movie theater sound. A home-cinema system can be expensive, requires a lot of space and is used in only one room. While on a tablet, you can enjoy a cinema sound experience in each room, while traveling or even at the office! What s next ?We are already working to extend our technology to personal computers. A successful campaign could help us accelerate this ! We already integrated it in our video because this is planned for the near future, and your support, we will be able to make it happen faster, as soon as this summer ! GAMINGOur technology will be a great enhancement to the gaming world! By now, every gamer can probably imagine the incredible potential of Neoh in gaming. Imagine being fully immersed in your favorite digital world. Battling it out in a war zone? Have an edge on your opponent by hearing them attacking from behind. Racing cars? Hear the roar of the engine from the driver's seat as you zoom by your opponents.. Your support will accelerate the development of the computer platform for Neoh. With your help this could be as soon as this summerVIRTUAL REALITYWe think that virtual reality will become increasingly important in the foreseeable future. In fact, we are not the only ones to think so ! This is why more and more companies develop VR technologies and devices. New features are introduced everyday ! So far VR has been mostly about video. Audio is needed to bring a more realistic and immersive reality. The Verge: "You can buy these head-tracking headphones instead of 25 speakers" Gizmodo: "In trying it out for a a few moments just now, it definitely works: The sound stays put spatially, even as your head moves." Tom's Guide : "3D Sound Labs may have found the winning formula with its Neoh" We are a team of professionals, entrepreneurs, scientists and engineers passionate by sound. The 3D Sound Labs team ! It has been a long journey already: from algorithms development, electronics and mechanical prototyping, assembly of the first samples, testing, then ... re-doing it over again until we reach a result that satisfies us ... to supply chain and logistics... Today, Neoh is almost ready to hit the shelves. Molds are built and the headphones are industrialized. We even designed a nice packaging to give you a great Neoh experience, right out-of-the-box. But we are not yet at the end of the road:CERTIFICATIONSWe are going to get our products certified (Wireless certifications, FCC, ). We have done everything from start to facilitate this. From electronics to plastic components, everything has been pre-checked and validated.APPLICATIONWe are finalizing our mobile application. We have optimized all our algorithms and developed an alpha-version. From now on we need to develop a great user-interface to make your experience with Neoh as intuitive and straightforward as it deserves to be.USAGESWe really would like to accelerate the development to cover more usages and platforms. First, we would like to be able to run on any PC. Then, we ll address the virtual reality market. Everything depends on you. Neoh by 3dsoundlabs on Sketchfab
357`As seen on... Vigo is the first wearable device to quantify your alertness. With this data, Vigo can do cool things like nudge you when you re dozing off or give you recommendations about when to take smarter breaks. With Vigo, staying alert and being your best has never been easier. How does Vigo work? Vigo tracks patterns in your blinks and in your body's movement to quantify how alert you are in real time. The idea is simple - although your brain has a tendency to trick you into thinking you re mentally fit enough to keep pushing on with your daily business, your body can t hide when you re tired. With an infrared sensor, an accelerometer, and a clever algorithm, Vigo knows you re drowsy before you do. Wearing Vigo is simple. 1. Wear Vigo whenever you need to be alert for an extended amount of time.2. Connect Vigo to your mobile device through Bluetooth.3. Customize when, and how, Vigo nudges you.4. Tag the event when you re finished so you can look back on the data later. What's in a blink? The average blink happens in 1/5th of a second - but there s so much information packed in that small amount of time! Vigo tracks over 20 parameters in your blinks and watches how these variables change. This information, combined with data about your activity and head motion, allows Vigo to quantify your mental energy in real time. When can I wear Vigo? Wear Vigo to protect you from dozing off on long drives. Wear Vigo at work to help break up your day and build more efficient routines. Wear Vigo to keep you alert in class or during presentations Why wear Vigo? We designed Vigo to give you full control over when, and how, the device nudges you. Choose whether Vigo alerts you when you ve been idle for too long or when you re starting to doze off by controlling the sensitivity of the algorithm. And how does Vigo get your attention when it detects you re not your best? That s up to you. Choose between a soft pulsing vibration, a discreet notification LED or your favorite pump up song to help you re-focus and get back in the zone. Vigo starts logging data about your alertness the moment you put the device on, and doesn t stop until you take it off. The companion app visualizes the important information about your alertness in a simple, useful way to allow you to see patterns and make changes in your routine. Maybe you re more drowsy on weekday afternoons, or maybe you re in a better state in the evenings than mornings. Vigo helps you understand yourself better so you can plan your day accordingly. Maybe you spend too much time sitting in one place, maybe you tend to get groggy early in the morning, or maybe you drive past too many exits on the road without taking a rest. Vigo finds the times you re low on fuel and gives you ideas about ways you can change your routine to help you get in the zone faster, and stay in it longer. Vigo connects to your phone and functions just like a Bluetooth headset with handsfree talking capabilities - so you don t have to worry about missing phone calls, texts, or notifications from your friends and family. Where it all began... Our motivation to build Vigo can be traced back to our college days at the University of Pennsylvania. Whether we were in a boring lecture, cramming all night at the library, or working long hours at our internships, drowsiness was always haunting us! Coffees and energy drinks were all somewhat effective in keeping us from dozing off, but the most reliable way to stay alert was having a buddy next to us that could watch when we were losing our focus and nudge us when we started to doze off. Since carrying a friend around all the time wasn t feasible, we built the next best thing - Vigo. The Growth of Vigo Vigo has moved through more than 10 iterations throughout the past year, starting from our college campus, and more recently, as part of the hardware accelerator program HAXLR8R in Shenzhen, China. We are proud of what we ve accomplished and we are excited to present Vigo to you. (Above) Previous prototypes and testing rig. (Below) Current state of development.

358`Thank YOU to ALL backers for FUNding!Did you miss the KickStarter? Pre-order Pack O Game SET 2: HEREFor more information visit: www.perplext.comFollow me on Twitter: @ChrisHandy Pack O Game is a series of small card games with a surprising amount of gameplay, strategy and fun. Each game is unique in theme, mechanics and complexity, with 30 cards (1 inch by 3 inch) in a tuck box the size of a pack of gum. In 2014, Pack O Game SET 1 launched with great success. It s focus was variety for many types of people. SET 2 is about short, middle-weight games for gamers and people looking for more depth and interesting gameplay. Hook: Unique Team Picking" (just like those gym class days!) with interesting strategy and manipulation during the event playing phase. In GYM, players play on 1 of 2 teams, which can accommodate 2, 4 or 6 players. There are 2 phases to the game. The "Pick" phase is just like Gym class! Each team member will choose a Kid from the line up to add to his hand. If a "bully" is acquired, a team member is allowed to influence which 4 (of the 6) events will be played in the next phase. In the "Play" phase, each team member will play a Kid to one of the 4 events on his turn. Playing Kids will also allow an "event action", which may manipulate player hands, Kid positions, and more. Playing a "bully" allows you to reposition a Coach, which reduces chaos at an event, but also makes it more difficult to make changes to the roster. In the end, the team with the most cumulative points from the 4 events is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY GYM NOW! "Don't be fooled by the size of the box; GYM is a heavy game requiring little table space. Pound for Pound, GYM is one if my new favorites, given its size, weight, and portability." - Brian Fiore (Just Got Played) Hook: Quick turns, Press your luck , set collecting with stealing. RUM is a press your luck, set collecting game that s played quickly, over many turns. On your turn, you must draw a card or play sets of bottles to gain Captain Cards and earn points. The 3 face up cards are called The Beach and these are community cards and considered in your hand . You can also play a Rum Trio , which is 3 single bottles in a color, to steal the captain card and increase it by 2. But, you can t press your luck too long, because the Parrot is lurking close by to steal your rum. The game ends when a player reaches a set amount of points OR when the time on the Castaway Clock runs out. Tabletopia User? TRY RUM NOW! Hook: Mancala meets secret goal/set collecting farming game. SOW is a challenging gardening game in which players redistribute seeds and flowers in the garden in order to pick the bouquet that will reward the most points at the end of the game. Each turn, a player must redistribute a row in the garden, then takes any applicable actions. If the last card placed was a Seeds Card, it must be flipped over (and all other matching Seeds of that color) to become a Flower. Flowers reward points when collected from a player s Wheelbarrow. There are 2 Garden Action Cards that may also allow extra actions, if placed in the same row, on the same turn. Garden Actions will allow a Gardener to change the windmill direction (which changes the card redistribution in future turns), or it may allow a player to discard all flowers of a certain type (Gopher) or collect a flower in their wheel barrow (watering can). In the end, the players show their favorite color and are rewarded points for flowers. Each player calculates their score as follows: 3 points for each flower with his Favorite Color in the Center portion. 2 points for each flower with his Favorite Color on the Outer portion. 1 point for each flower WITHOUT his Favorite Color. Tabletopia User? TRY SOW NOW! Hook: A short, 2-player battle of hand management and timing. On your turn, you must perform the following actions in order:1. Deploy Orcs: Play 1 card from your hand to a Territory that has not yet been conquered.2. Draw Weapons: Choose ANY Stockpile(s). Draw card(s) as follows: A. Draw 1 card into your hand if you deployed 2 Orcs. B. Draw 2 cards into your hand if you deployed 1 Orc. A Territory battle occurs immediately after the Stockpile next to a Territory is exhausted. Then, players total their deployed Orcs at that Territory, and a victor will be declared. Orcs that fight in battle will not score points, they only help conquer Territories. Scoring occurs at the end of the game, when all Stockpiles have been exhausted. The player who conquers the most valuable Territories and holds native Orcs in their hand (matching those lands), is the winner! Tabletopia User? TRY ORC NOW! I am just so impressed by Orc! Almost from the first turn the decisions will grip you and not let up until the very end. I think what amazes me is that each choice is fundamentally simple: which card do I play and to which battle? Yet each of those choices has numerous hugely important implications for the remaining game, all of which are immediately understandable from a glance at the tabletop. While the box might say war is ugly, this game is anything but! - Matt (Creaking Shelves) In this nutty set connecting game, players will acquire nut cards and and arrange them in their own individual trees. Same-colored nuts that are kept together will reward players with more points as they may only count their largest nut cluster in each of the 6 colors at the end of the game. The player with the most points is the winner! Each round, the role of the Forager will rotate clockwise from player to player. When a player is the Forager, he must add a new nut column to replenish the previously taken column. Then, he must take any 1 card in a column and place it in his playing area. Then, the remaining players must take 1 card from the same column and place them in their playing area. The game continues with the next player in clockwise order becoming the Forager, and so on. Nut Cards will create trees with nuts on both sides. Cards must touch at least one square side or cover a full square (or at least a third of a card). Once cards have been placed, they may not me moved for the remainder of the game. A Squirrel will double the value of a cluster of nuts if it is orthogonally connected to the largest cluster of the squirrel s corresponding color. Squirrels must be placed with the squirrel right-side up, facing the player.The Squirrel has no value itself, but may be a connector for 2 sections of same colored nut clusters. Wild Nuts may be used as any colored nut during the scoring if it is contiguously connected to the largest cluster of a particular color. The game ends when the draw deck is exhausted AND there are no columns left in play. The player who earned the most points from his six sets of nuts is the winner. In DIG, each player is a dog that will run throughout the Yard, dig up bones and attempt to return them to the matching colored Dog Bowl with the greatest efficiency. All players will score once, at the end of the game, based on the cumulative value of the Bones that he returned to the matching Dog Bowls. There are 4 Bones in each of the 5 colors in the game. A Bone's value is determined at the end of the game, based on the distance of its corresponding Dog Bowl to the Dog House. The Dog Bowl that is closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 5 for each bone of that color. The Dog Bowl that is second closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 4 for each bone of that color, and so on. The Bowls and Bones will be swapped from the end of the Yard into the place of a recently dug up bone, continuously moving the 5 Bowls to the end of the Yard nearest the Dog House. Each Yard Card has a Scent with 2 colors. The Bone on the opposite side of the Yard Card matches 1 of the colors of the Scent. This will help players determine which color Bone might be dug if that Yard Card is selected for digging. One of the most interesting aspects of DIG is the unique "Leap Frog" Yard replacement mechanism. When a Bone is dug up, the Card that is furthest from the the Dog House, is removed and fills the empty spot created by the Dog. This action creates some interesting ways to influence which Bones and Bowls each Dog has close access to, but also makes timing critical for influencing Bone value for scoring. On a player's turn, he may perform ANY or ALL of the following actions, but may only perform each action ONCE per turn. MOVE: A player may move his Dog a maximum of 4 cards along the Yard Cards, and 1 less for each Bone he holds prior to movement. For example, if a player holds 2 Bone cards, he may move his Dog up to 2 Cards, moving below or above the Yard cards. A player may move his Dog in any direction. There is a movement legend on the bottom half of the Dog House for easy reference. DIG: A player may dig up a bone and place the Bone card in his hand. Bones that are in the hand are kept secret until they are dropped off and placed in front of the player. The empty space created from the Yard Card removal is filled with the last Card at the edge of Yard. A player may have no more than 3 Bones in their hand at any time. DROP: Drop a Bone into a Dog Bowl and place the Bone card from your hand to the playing area in front of himself, face up with the Bone visible to all players. A Dog must be AT the Bowl of the corresponding color in order to drop off any Bones of that color. Game End and Scoring: When Bowls are the only remaining Cards in the Yard (next to the Dog House), the game ends immediately and players total their scores. Any Bones still in a player's hand are removed from the game and do not count for scoring. Calculate your score by identifying the value of each Bone in your possession.5 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color closest to the Dog House.4 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color second closest to the Dog House.3 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color third closest to the Dog House.2 Points Each: Bones matching the Bowl color fourth closest to the Dog House.1 Point Each: Bones matching the Bowl color furthest from the Dog House. The player with the most points wins! Here are 4 games that take little space and little time to play, but demand all of a player s attention. That s impressive and fun.

359`Our Kickstarter is over but you can still find Neoh on www.3dsoundlabs.com Neoh : the first smart 3D audio headphonesPlease meet Neoh, headphones for cinema sound anytime, anywhere ! Neoh is the first wearable home theater system. These headphones provide spatial sound simulation, using embedded motion sensors to provide the most immersive sound experience technology has ever brought to you. Our mobile application simulates multi-point sound sources in a virtual environment. The experience is comparable to the latest generation of movie theater surround sound systems or the most sophisticated home theater equipment on the market. With our 360 sound technology, we have successfully introduced a realistic and theatrical sound experience to 3D audio headphones. What we call 3D sound is the real life s sound. With Neoh headphones, we have ability to reproduce a sound that will appear to come from anywhere we want it to come from. We create a full artificial environment (360 ) with sound sources you will perceive as coming from any distance or direction.MONOOne source, one speaker, one channel This is a monophonic sound reproduction. It is the sound given to you by the gramophone in our video. STEREOTwo sources, two speakers, two channels Most of the time the stereophonic sound is represented by a left and a right speaker. It is what you have found in all the other headphones up-until today. Don t be afraid, it s over now. MULTISOURCEThis is what you got when you bought a home-theater sound system. You had to install five speakers, two behind you, three in front and one subwoofer for the bass. You can find 5.1 sound on DVDs, Blu-rays use 7.1 sources (same principle, 2 more speakers). It means you would have to buy and install up to eight speakers, to enjoy it but in one room only... However this provides a pretty good surround sound ! Today, you don t need this anymore. Neoh is your own personal home cinema and you can take it with you anytime, anywhere.Some new 3D audio formats are coming up, with even more virtual sound sources and a large number of speakers to reproduce them. Get ready ! Neoh breaks the barrier of having a limited amount of sound source.: You will be completely immersed in the sound. Neoh is your own personal home cinema and you can take it with you anytime, anywhere. Install the free Neoh player, to watch a movie on your iPad with 3D Sound. If you don t have an iPad, maybe you could watch a movie on your iPhone with 3D Sound. Soon you will be able to watch a movie on your laptop too. You have to call your friends to tell them you ve got a Neoh. Obviously, you can listen to music from any device you want but most importantly, enjoy it with your friends ! Very soon, you will watch movies with Android devices, play video games in the most immersive way or enter a virtual reality with a real 3D sound ! Our mobile application uses advanced signal processing algorithms to position the different audio sources.For instance, with a movie providing 5.1 audio channels, if a sound is defined to be coming from the source on your back right, you ll hear it coming directly from your back right.You will be able to play any movie and any music without having to change their format as we have made it compatible with most of multimedia standards available out there. We have also made it easy for you to access all of your content : Direct download Connection to your Dropbox Connection to your Google Drive Connection to your personal server You can accelerate the development of our application on Android Of course, you can also use Neoh without our mobile application: Neoh will work like any other pair of headphones.... Only without the realistic and immersive experience of 3D sound. Motion sensors:The housing on the left of the headset encloses our electronics. It is composed of many components, including gyroscopes, an accelerometers and a magnetometers. The sensors data are sent to our application by a Bluetooth Low Energy chip. All the system is powered by a rechargeable battery. The sensors track every one of your movements. Indeed, you do not stay completely motionless while watching a movie, and we have to offset even the smallest of your micro-movements to completely immerse you in your activity. This is due to a psychoacoustic effect. In your daily life, you subconsciously make a detailed analysis of your environment and you're brain gives specific attention to any kind of change within this environment. When you hear a sound, you unconsciously move your head in order to figure out the exact origin of the sound. The difference perceived in the sound is necessary for your brain to accurately locate sound sources. It does not need a large movement, just a few degrees is enough. You also make those micro-movements when you are watching a movie. This gets more important as the number of sound sources increase. Neoh compensates those movements to create a fixed audio sources relative to the screen. Without this your brain won t be able to figure out exactly where the sound is coming from: This is the only way to have a full immersion and an experience comparable to that of reality. Being able to hear sound where they re supposed to come from is also very useful in a lot of video games. First Person Shooter games are an obvious field of interest; Neoh gives you an incredible tactical advantage. Improving the perception of your environment, it enables you to have quicker and better reactions to game events. Finally, compensating those micro-movements increases the realism to an incredible extent to truly immerse you in a virtual reality. With regular headphones, the sound sticks to you : not so realistic after all ! With Neoh and its motion sensors, the sound stays where it's supposed to be: you're immersed in a virtual environment ! What do we mean with mobile cinema ?When we think about mobile cinema, we think about you, watching a movie anywhere, anytime you want. You re on a mobile device, such as a mobile phone or a tablet. We have chosen to start our development on iOS but we are already working on deploying our technology to others platforms.Why are we doing this ?We are doing this to let everybody enjoy the quality of movie theater sound. A home-cinema system can be expensive, requires a lot of space and is used in only one room. While on a tablet, you can enjoy a cinema sound experience in each room, while traveling or even at the office! What s next ?We are already working to extend our technology to personal computers. A successful campaign could help us accelerate this ! We already integrated it in our video because this is planned for the near future, and your support, we will be able to make it happen faster, as soon as this summer ! GAMINGOur technology will be a great enhancement to the gaming world! By now, every gamer can probably imagine the incredible potential of Neoh in gaming. Imagine being fully immersed in your favorite digital world. Battling it out in a war zone? Have an edge on your opponent by hearing them attacking from behind. Racing cars? Hear the roar of the engine from the driver's seat as you zoom by your opponents.. Your support will accelerate the development of the computer platform for Neoh. With your help this could be as soon as this summerVIRTUAL REALITYWe think that virtual reality will become increasingly important in the foreseeable future. In fact, we are not the only ones to think so ! This is why more and more companies develop VR technologies and devices. New features are introduced everyday ! So far VR has been mostly about video. Audio is needed to bring a more realistic and immersive reality. The Verge: "You can buy these head-tracking headphones instead of 25 speakers" Gizmodo: "In trying it out for a a few moments just now, it definitely works: The sound stays put spatially, even as your head moves." Tom's Guide : "3D Sound Labs may have found the winning formula with its Neoh" We are a team of professionals, entrepreneurs, scientists and engineers passionate by sound. The 3D Sound Labs team ! It has been a long journey already: from algorithms development, electronics and mechanical prototyping, assembly of the first samples, testing, then ... re-doing it over again until we reach a result that satisfies us ... to supply chain and logistics... Today, Neoh is almost ready to hit the shelves. Molds are built and the headphones are industrialized. We even designed a nice packaging to give you a great Neoh experience, right out-of-the-box. But we are not yet at the end of the road:CERTIFICATIONSWe are going to get our products certified (Wireless certifications, FCC, ). We have done everything from start to facilitate this. From electronics to plastic components, everything has been pre-checked and validated.APPLICATIONWe are finalizing our mobile application. We have optimized all our algorithms and developed an alpha-version. From now on we need to develop a great user-interface to make your experience with Neoh as intuitive and straightforward as it deserves to be.USAGESWe really would like to accelerate the development to cover more usages and platforms. First, we would like to be able to run on any PC. Then, we ll address the virtual reality market. Everything depends on you. Neoh by 3dsoundlabs on Sketchfab
360`Where are the toys that provide young boys with positive messages? Look up and down the aisles at toy stores you ll find characters that are part of today's Hero-Industrial Complex, invented decades ago, being reused and repackaged by billion-dollar corporations to crank out merchandise, with no thought given to the development of young boys. As parents, we see first-hand the struggles boys face: it s hard to sit still, be quiet, share, pay attention. We want our boys to know it s OK to be themselves, and we want to teach them the values that we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. That is why we created the HeroBoys: a toy and comic book made specifically for young boys about young boys. HeroBoys are line of toys and comic books meant to celebrate the adventure, imagination, and limitless potential inherent in boys, while reinforcing positive values. With your support, we can bring a thoughtful alternative into the unimaginative world of boys toys. Our Heroes People are Talking about HeroBoys.. Late Congressman s son launches 'HeroBoys' toys and comic books How a Dad and a Mom Invented a New Toy Idea to Help Inspire Their Boys to Grow Into Good Men HeroBoys are Positive Super Hero Toys for Young Boys Dynamic Mom & Pop Duo Create HeroBoys Comics & Toys Rewards Hero Combo Starter Set That covers the why; let s move on to the what. The HeroBoys are 6 ordinary boys who are given superpowers by their mentor, The Gentleman, with a mandate to do good and provide an example to a city being overrun by selfish behavior. The HeroBoys line will follow this narrative through: Action Figures. Our first toy available on Kickstarter is the HeroBoys action figure: the only 18-inch action figure with a plush body AND functioning elbow and knee joints. You can choose from six different HeroBoys: We will send our backers images of the completed Hero figures so they can choose the Hero they would like. Gusto Prototype Comic Books. The HeroBoys comic book will be available as the first issue only or as a monthly subscription (hard copy and eComic). In these pages, the HeroBoys will learn that true strength comes from being honest, decent, and determined. Each issue will have a clear lesson for boys that can be used as teachable moment for parents who have precious few hours each day with their children. As a subscription, kids will get a new story every month. The stories use simple words to inspire a love of reading because we believe comic books are a vastly underutilized tool for encouraging literacy in young boys. T-Shirts. We also have some very cool, soft cotton HeroBoys T-shirts available with the HB team logo or the logo of your favorite HeroBoy. This is a great reward for those want to support this project but might not have a young boy at home. T-Shirts (The Hero Every Day of the Week package) Very Cool T-shirts Cape and Mask Sets. All Superheroes need to protect their secret identity make sure your superhero can too! Match your HeroBoys T-shirt with that Hero s cape and mask!! Our Heroes with Capes & Masks Where We Stand now Some of our development work We have spent thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars researching, writing, sourcing and prototyping to bring HeroBoys to this point. We have produced a prototype and are in discussions with manufacturers in China to begin production. We have the first comic written and illustrated. The T-shirts have been designed and have been produced in limited quantities. With the money raised through this campaign we will be able customize our prototype model for each HeroBoy and place our first production order. We will also be able to print the comic book and manufacturer the t-shirts. We are currently in discussions with fulfillment centers to fulfill orders. We intend to start shipping once all rewards are ready which we expect to be in the first quarter of 2016. The success of this campaign will also allow us to hire staff like an illustrator and developer to carry forward the HeroBoys mission.
361`The Hydration Shirt - line drawings F.A.Q.1. How much more hydrated will I be with The Hydration Shirt?A typical user going for a run, playing a sport or doing high-intensity training will be able to get a 40% hydration boost in as little as 20-30 minutes on a full charge when combined with The Hydration Shorts. HydraQore inserts extract your heat based on the intensity of your workout and level of exertion.2. How does your technology work?The Hydration Shirt works off of timeless First Aid principles taught to emergency medical personnel of all levels by the American Red Cross.Emergency Medical personnel are taught to address temperature-related illness (hypothermia & heat stroke, as examples) by placing heating or cooling inserts over the Pulse Points at the Femoral, Brachial and Ulnar/Radial arteries. The Hydration Shirt works off of the same principle, but packages it in a form factor optimized for athletes and professionals in demanding environments.3. Is this just like every other workout shirt? Not at all! What makes The Hydration Shirt unique are the Pulse Point Pockets which hold the heat-absorbing inserts in place where our bodies have a high volume of blood flowing close to the skins surface. These inserts absorb heat from your blood stream so your body doesn't have to sweat or breathe as intensely to dispose of excess heat. In turn, this keeps more water in your body, boosting hydration and nearly every other aspect of athletic performance with it: endurance, strength, mental focus and especially recovery. Of course, The Hydration Shirt is also moisture-wicking, anti-microbial, four-way stretch, and UPF 50+. It's amazing. 4. Is The Hydration Shirt available for both men and women? Absolutely! 5. When can I expect my reward? We expect to deliver your reward by May 2016. For those of you who ADD-ON the Christmas Delivery Package, you will receive your "tree ready" Qore Performance Trucker Hat in gift box with card by December 23rd 2015! The card is the placeholder for The Hydration Shirt gift which will be delivered by May 2016 at the same time every other reward ships. 6. Do you make anything for my lower body? Yes. We currently offer The Hydration Shorts as an ADD-ON for $50. Our customers universally tell us it is THE most comfortable compression short they have ever worn. The Hydration Short is 100% Made in America. 7. Where is The Hydration Shirt manufactured? The Hydration Shirt is 100% American Made. Not one single thread, stitch, label, card or inch of fabric comes from outside the Lower 48. That's right. Same goes for our HydraQore inserts. We do sell a NON-Qore Performance brand of hand warmer on our website and those hand warmers are made overseas. 8. Does the The Hydration Shirt work with "all" sports? Thus far, we've only had prototypes, but it's worked with about a dozen of 126 Olympic events we've tested to date. We're hoping to test the rest soon. Curling will be interesting. We also ran a mile in tactical gear in the middle of a Washington DC summer: https://youtu.be/hlJJ_UygrVI 9. Is The Hydration Shirt only for elite athletes, military and law enforcement people?The Hydration Shirt is for everyone who sweats! 10. What are the HydraQore inserts made of? Our Inserts contain a non-toxic Phase Change Material that has a melting point of about 60 F/15.5 C. This is a lot higher than the melting point of ice so your body will offload heat efficiently without your blood vessels constricting. The outer shell is a smooth and extremely strong and durable polymer that resists odor and bacteria. You can even keep them charged in your water bottle. 11. Will the HydraQore inserts break? We ran over them with a Ford F-150 weighing nearly 5,000 pounds and they didn't break. The video of the tests was really fun to shoot! 12. How many times can I recharge my HydraQore inserts? The inserts have unlimited recharging capability. When we say rechargeable, we mean it! 13. Do you have a patent? Yes. We have numerous Patents Pending. We will monitor domestic and international trade shows as well as multiple USA/International internet and brick-and-mortar retailers and resellers. We will protect our Patents / brands / images / retailers / resellers to the fullest extent of the law. 14. How do I know what size to order? We've provided both a Men's and Women's Size Guide above. Don't worry though, we'll send you a survey if the project is successful that will have all of the sizing info you need then too. Plus, we'll be here the whole time via email, live chat or phone to answer any and every question you've got! 15. I have to wear a uniform shirt to work. Do you have any products I can wear under or in addition to my uniform shirt without showing? For sure! The Hydration Arm Band was actually designed with that requirement in mind. If you need a long sleeve option, The Hydration Sleeves are for you. Both products are on our website: www.QorePerformance.com. All orders placed on our website during the Kickstarter campaign will ship out same day via USPS if received before 7pm Eastern Time. 16. Why does The Hydration Shirt have only two Pulse Point Pockets? The location of the pockets in our garments, and therefore the number of HydraQore inserts supported, is determined by two main factors: 1. finding an area on the body where you have a lot of blood close to the surface of the skin, aka your pulse points, and 2. that pulse point must be generally "out of the way," so that your range of motion is not disturbed during athletic activity. The Short Sleeve Hydration Shirt targets the brachial artery on both arms because it easily meets these two criteria, and in fact, is a quite efficient place to extract heat from the body. The Long Sleeve Hydration Shirt also targets this location, but has additional pockets and inserts located at the wrist which target the Radial and Ulnar complex.

363`As seen on... Vigo is the first wearable device to quantify your alertness. With this data, Vigo can do cool things like nudge you when you re dozing off or give you recommendations about when to take smarter breaks. With Vigo, staying alert and being your best has never been easier. How does Vigo work? Vigo tracks patterns in your blinks and in your body's movement to quantify how alert you are in real time. The idea is simple - although your brain has a tendency to trick you into thinking you re mentally fit enough to keep pushing on with your daily business, your body can t hide when you re tired. With an infrared sensor, an accelerometer, and a clever algorithm, Vigo knows you re drowsy before you do. Wearing Vigo is simple. 1. Wear Vigo whenever you need to be alert for an extended amount of time.2. Connect Vigo to your mobile device through Bluetooth.3. Customize when, and how, Vigo nudges you.4. Tag the event when you re finished so you can look back on the data later. What's in a blink? The average blink happens in 1/5th of a second - but there s so much information packed in that small amount of time! Vigo tracks over 20 parameters in your blinks and watches how these variables change. This information, combined with data about your activity and head motion, allows Vigo to quantify your mental energy in real time. When can I wear Vigo? Wear Vigo to protect you from dozing off on long drives. Wear Vigo at work to help break up your day and build more efficient routines. Wear Vigo to keep you alert in class or during presentations Why wear Vigo? We designed Vigo to give you full control over when, and how, the device nudges you. Choose whether Vigo alerts you when you ve been idle for too long or when you re starting to doze off by controlling the sensitivity of the algorithm. And how does Vigo get your attention when it detects you re not your best? That s up to you. Choose between a soft pulsing vibration, a discreet notification LED or your favorite pump up song to help you re-focus and get back in the zone. Vigo starts logging data about your alertness the moment you put the device on, and doesn t stop until you take it off. The companion app visualizes the important information about your alertness in a simple, useful way to allow you to see patterns and make changes in your routine. Maybe you re more drowsy on weekday afternoons, or maybe you re in a better state in the evenings than mornings. Vigo helps you understand yourself better so you can plan your day accordingly. Maybe you spend too much time sitting in one place, maybe you tend to get groggy early in the morning, or maybe you drive past too many exits on the road without taking a rest. Vigo finds the times you re low on fuel and gives you ideas about ways you can change your routine to help you get in the zone faster, and stay in it longer. Vigo connects to your phone and functions just like a Bluetooth headset with handsfree talking capabilities - so you don t have to worry about missing phone calls, texts, or notifications from your friends and family. Where it all began... Our motivation to build Vigo can be traced back to our college days at the University of Pennsylvania. Whether we were in a boring lecture, cramming all night at the library, or working long hours at our internships, drowsiness was always haunting us! Coffees and energy drinks were all somewhat effective in keeping us from dozing off, but the most reliable way to stay alert was having a buddy next to us that could watch when we were losing our focus and nudge us when we started to doze off. Since carrying a friend around all the time wasn t feasible, we built the next best thing - Vigo. The Growth of Vigo Vigo has moved through more than 10 iterations throughout the past year, starting from our college campus, and more recently, as part of the hardware accelerator program HAXLR8R in Shenzhen, China. We are proud of what we ve accomplished and we are excited to present Vigo to you. (Above) Previous prototypes and testing rig. (Below) Current state of development.

Examples include the iPhone 4S and newer, Samsung Galaxy S3 and S4, HTC One, Google Nexus. Inviting Researchers and Developers Vigo s built-in infrared sensor and accelerometer can open up a world of possibilities - from taking pictures on your phone by winking, to receiving LED light notifications when receiving text messages and emails, to controlling Powerpoint slides with your blinks. The possibilities are endless. We are excited to see the creative ways that you would use Vigo. We are launching a Software Development Kit (SDK) for iOS and Android, providing a platform and API to develop innovative software and hardware applications. With the SDK, you can: Access accelerometer data Access infrared sensor data Control device functionality including notification LED, vibration motors, and audio Connect with and control other Bluetooth devices Meet the Team Meet the co-founders of Vigo - Drew Karabinos, Jason Gui and Jonathan Kern. Drew focuses on the design and user interaction of Vigo. Jason cranks out the technology and dives deep into hardware and software to make Vigo happen. Jonathan leads the prototyping and testing of Vigo to make sure it is being developed and manufactured on time. We ve also had many brilliant people contribute to the success of Vigo. A few people who have been vital to bringing Vigo to life include: King Li - Embedded Systems Engineer by trade, genius by nature Sam Stern - App Developer, coding guru Yang Zhao - Interaction Designer, uncanny eye for design What is the funding for? We ve been building Vigo in Shenzhen, China over the past couple months under the arm of the hardware incubator HAXLR8R. We have fully functional prototypes of the device as well as a companion Android app that can communicate with the device and demonstrate its functionality, and now we need your help to make Vigo a reality. We need your financial support to help us produce the first batch of Vigos. Funds will be used towards injection molds for the casings, building of electronics, FCC and CE certifications, as well as hiring developers to complete development of the Android and iOS app and continue tweaking the algorithm to make it even more accurate. We want you to wear Vigo with us, give us feedback, tell us what features you love and what you think could be even better.

But the toy market has failed to embrace inclusion and diversity. Boy Story adds boys into the missing equation, so our children see dolls just like them - boys and girls - in the toy aisles. Boy Story brings Action Dolls to the world: 18" boy dolls with adjustable ball-joints to join the action and fun with all the girl dolls out there. Action Dolls are cool. Action Dolls encourage pretend play and imagination. Action Dolls are for all kids. Action Dolls are just plain FUN. Click here to read about why our Action Doll joints are so unique! Action Dolls: 18" dolls with specially designed ball joints to pose like an action figure! One of the biggest difference between our Action Doll and a standard 18" doll is that we added extra joints, 11 points of articulation to be exact. On top of that, most standard dolls are strung even if they do have extra joints (5 joints is most common in dolls). First thing we prioritized was quality and durability. These Action Dolls are so fun, we expect kids to drag them through mud, load them in bike baskets, romp through fields, and toss them through the air. We have seen all the crazy and imaginative ways kids play with our Action Dolls. Just as they were designed. These dolls are meant to be PLAYED with. The dolls are made of: High quality phthalate-free vinyl for the head, limbs, and ball joints (limiting scratches and making for easy cleanup) Durable, yet squeezable, cotton twill for the soft body (rugged enough to endure years of play, but soft enough to sleep/cuddle with) We even sculpted the hair styles of each Action Doll to avoid tangled, messy hair disasters. We expect messes! Thanks to the molded hair, you can simply wipe the dolls clean and they're back in action. Second, we designed the dolls to be cool, boyish, and diverse. Missing from mainstream 18" doll lines are detailed facial features capturing the uniqueness we love in children. Most 18 dolls limit changes to skin tone and hair color, and many children (especially boys) are not represented. Even the boy dolls out there, we found, often look like they are wearing makeup or are girl dolls with cut hair. Boy Story believes that children s toys especially those representing humans should be as diverse as the kids who play with them. Making unique dolls has not been cheap, but the results are completely worth the cost. We will continue to make different face molds for each of our Action Dolls. Our line starts with two unique boys, Billy and Mason, and we have many more planned (sneak peek in the "Meet the Boys" section below). Third, our dolls had to move! We came up with the idea for Action Dolls as a combo between action figures with their super cool poses and traditional dolls. Our Action Dolls have 11 points of articulation! Most standard dolls have few or even no joints, and those with joints are usually entirely elastic-strung, with extremely limited movement. Our dolls have 6 specially designed ball joints, 4 sewn and strung cup joints at the soft body, and a unique neck joint that allows the head to twist and tilt. These separate ball joints were specially designed to move in all different directions, as well as hold strong poses. Click here to read more about the joints! Last, (but not least) our Action Dolls represent real boys and wear cool outfits just like your little tyke. The quality of the outfits, as well as their designs, are as close as we could get to the real deal. We are talking eye-catching designs that would really be worn by a boy today. This means real buttons, zippers, brass snaps, laces, cuffed jeans, and little tiny canvas shoes, to name a few! Our clothing line is expanding rapidly, and in addition to regular outfits, we will be introducing special outfits designed to expand pretend and role play (think: soldiers, super heroes, pilots, scientists, etc.) (think also: stretch goal!). PS, (We know we said last... but...) can't forget to mention that our Action Dolls are designed to be compatible with standard 18" doll accessories. So get an Action Doll hurry for our limited quantity Kickstarter specials! to join in the fun and complete your doll collection today. We are Boy STORY. Reading unlocks the imagination. It develops a sense of wonder and fun. It teaches life lessons. Boy Story encourages reading through exciting, illustrated adventure stories that spill out of the page and into our Action Dolls. Kids can close the book and keep the adventure going. Statistics show that although girls scores in S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) related subjects are improving (thanks to great toys such as Goldieblox and Roominate working to encourage girls interest in S.T.E.M. related subjects), boys reading scores continue to lag behind. A cool Action Doll with an adventure story encourages and introduces reading in new ways to both boys and girls. For the collector (or just the kid) in you. With the quality level of the Action Dolls so high, we made absolutely sure to do everything we could to make each doll and book collectable. Every Action Doll comes with its own Boy Story Certificate of Authenticity. Production numbers are printed on the tag, and will serve to prove that you have the very first Boy Story Action Dolls ever to be made. We engraved the Boy Story logo on the bottom of each doll s foot as seen in the photo below. (This is an image of a molded part, so the foot will not actually be gold, it will be skin tone.) The books are both made and printed in the USA. We wanted Boy Story's adventure books to be really special, so we designed them to be standard collectable comic book size, yet read like a chapter book. They are filled with beautiful and colorful illustrations and are printed on thick satin-finish pages. The covers are soft with a velvety matte finish, and we are looking into adding a spot gloss to the covers and a watermark page to our books as a stretch goal. Both the books and dolls are made to last and even be passed down through generations to come. Boy Story takes pride in putting safety first! Our co-founder is a mom of two boys, and she always says "As a mom, being certain that the toy my child is playing with is safe is not something I take lightly. Boy Story's Action Dolls are going through rigorous safety testing for sales in the US, Canada, and Europe. Action Dolls are safe for children ages 3+ due to small parts. Mason! If there's one thing you will remember about Mason, it's that he has a wild imagination. This kid is always thinking up the most exciting adventures. Never a dull moment with him. He loves to ask questions, frequents the library, and has a big mystery to solve! Billy! Get ready for a belly full of laughs with this character because Billy is a bit of a prankster.

And now for the SNEAK PEEK at the next two characters to be featured in a Boy Story: Aspen! Aspen is always on the move, traveling around the world with his mom, who is an Army Sergeant. Much more than a military brat, Aspen s a huge fan of baseball and can be a bit shy when meeting new friends and being in new places. On his latest adventure in Japan, he soon finds that he has a lot more in common with the local kids than he thought. Friendships blossom and baseball games abound! Kenji! Kenji loves making new friends and is a superstar on his baseball league. He has a heart of gold and enjoys teaching people all about his Japanese culture.

Before the ARCHT One, listeners in search of the optimal home audio experience were limited to the location where speakers were placed, often leading them to be tethered to very specific spots in a room. In many cases, the result is a rigid, inconsistent audio experience. Today, we see consumers demanding more from their music as freedom of movement and design have become increasingly important. ARCHT One vs the competition We built the ARCHT One from ground up to address that. After years of development by our team of award winning team of engineers and designers, we have engineered and patented our Sound Array technology to create a first of its kind omnidirectional, audiophile quality speaker. Omnidirectional, Audiophile Quality Sound Dispersion With ARCHT One, we aim to transform audio into something that listeners can seamlessly integrate into their lifestyle and home without compromising quality. Incorporating elegant design with innovative acoustics and simple-to-use features, ARCHT One is the ultimate wireless speaker that listeners control at their fingertips. MODERN LIFESTYLE DESIGN: Fits Any Space A Design Piece Like No Other In the past, speaker designs have been characterized as large, boxy objects framing a home s entertainment system and mounted to specific corners of a room. Connected through a twist of wires and controlled with a remote often misplaced or buried between couch cushions, home audio systems of the past proved cumbersome and crude to the eye. Fits Any Space ARCHT One disrupts all that. ARCHT One comes fully equipped with full range drivers, a sub-woofer, a passive radiator, amplifier, digital signal processor (DSP) and a digital analog (DAC) converter, eliminating wire clutter. All this is efficiently assembled into a sleek package guaranteed to turn heads. Acoustic Perfection ARCHT One is also designed to sound acoustically perfect, regardless of where you put it in the room. ARCHT One s stunning design architecture incorporates years of acoustic research resulting in the creation of our groundbreaking Sound Array technology. ARCHT One represents a symbiotic relationship between function and design that will transform homes into elegant concert halls with the music quality to match. PATENTED ACOUSTIC INNOVATION: Consistent Multi-Directional Sound Dispersion that Adapts to its Environment Patented Sound Array Many speakers claim to provide true surround sound in a single device. However, speakers are directional by nature and they sound best when listening from a specific point. Adding multiple speakers does not change this reality and can cause distortion and inconsistent audio quality. Consistent Distortion Free Sound ARCHT One is a true omni-directional speaker with a built in sub-woofer ARCHT One solves this problem with its patented Sound Array technology: the only one of its kind. It only uses 3 speakers a full range driver for the mids and highs, a sub-woofer and passive radiator for the bass. Each of these speakers are equipped with a Sound Array module, which transforms the speakers from directional to omnidirectional. The result is consistent, distortion free audio which redefines the meaning of surround sound - it s truly amazing. Multi-speaker solution in a single device ARCHT One adapts to its surroundings A first of its kind, dynamic audio optimization allows ARCHT One to adapt to its surroundings. Our custom ARCHT Audio application gives smartphone users the power to optimize the ARCHT One s sound based upon the space in which it is being used. With the app, ARCHT One will always be tuned to your environment, ensuring you get the best audio experience wherever you are. Dynamic Audio Optimization through the ARCHT Audio App AUDIO AT YOUR FINGERTIPS: Wireless Connectivity and Multi-Zone Pairing Plethora of Connectivity Options ARCHT One has Connectivity Options for Everyone At the push of a button, you can control playback of music directly on the ARCHT One wirelessly from your laptop, tablet or mobile device.

He started out with high end systems but soon realized that while bigger may be better; the ultimate speaker is not all about raw power, but about the overall user experience. From the first purchase, opening the box, speaker set up and daily use - enjoying high end audio should not be a complicated process. Evolution of the ARCHT One He teamed up with an acoustic expert and industry veteran in the US, with the aim of developing a speaker that would look fantastic, sound awesome and be extremely easy for anyone to setup and use. We displayed hand-crafted prototypes at CES 2014 earlier this year to test this hypothesis. At CES, the team received great feedback from technology and design communities. After the event, we knew we were on to something. Handcrafted Samples Displayed at CES 2014 The ARCHT One project is 3 years in the making. With your support, we can take the ARCHT One from Prototype to Production, and launch in a city near you.

366`Thank you so much for taking a few minutes out of your day to stop by and consider backing my first Kickstarter project - Meepillows! I want to personally thank you in writing since the producers of the video didn't think I had "it" to speak on camera (self-reflection is very hard). I want to sincerely express my appreciation to you and the hobby that has changed my life - board games! Is it weird to say that? Perhaps. But through all the friends I have met, all the colleagues I have connected with, all the strain my brain has endured at game night, and all the good times it all has brought, I feel that it has changed my life in a very positive way.Now, here I am! Instead of backing another board game on Kickstar...hold on......yeah, I just backed another game on Kickstarter...Anyway, I finally decided to create my own board game related project. I not only started my company Top Shelf Fun through my innate desire to be a part of this great hobby, but to bring something different to the tabletop/sofa. By backing this project you are not just helping me bring a Meepillow to your gameroom, but you are helping me set my company up for sucess to create other future projects! There are some pretty hefty minimums from the manufacturer to bring a plush to life, and I am doing it with 6 different colors! It's crazy, but I am confident we can make this happen. I really believe we can do this together!So, once again, a big "thank you" for stopping by while your boss isn't looking to help my dream become a reality! Now, I know what you are thinking! What are 'Thank You' goals? Well, when I started this project I didn't know what to expect. At all. I knew that I didn't have the ability to upgrade the Meepillow in any way as a product (no component upgrades were possible), so I didn't include "Stretch Goals" in my campaign. Since this was my first Kickstarter I also wanted to keep it simple and clean.Fast forward a couple weeks and I was so overwhelmed by the community, the support, and how fast I surpassed my initial funding goal I just had to figure out a way to thank each of you. I wanted to express my appreciation in a fun way. A gamer's way!So, here are the special 'Thank You' Goals we have unlocked thus far:1. Future Discounts: Each backer will receive special codes after the campaign ends that will entitle them to future exclusive discounts on my website.2. End of Campaign Game: After the campaign has ended I will be taking a survey. I will ask each backer two questions:A. What was the most popular Meepillow color of the campaign?B. What was the total quantity sold of that Meepillow?The backer who was closest to the correct answer of the correct color (you can go over) will win a free set of all 6 Meepillows! In case of a tie there will (of course) be a D20 roll off which will be recorded on video. 3. Official Meepillow Certificate: At the end of the campaign every backer will receive a link to a set of "Official Meepillow Guarantee" .pdf files. There will be 6 .pdfs (one for each Meepillow color) and these particular certificates (blue shown below) will be exclusive to Kickstarter backers only! The Meepillow Guarantee! Again, thank you so much for all of your support. I certainly couldn't have done it without you! A "meeple" is a little wooden pawn used in many modern day board games to represent a player. "Meeple" is believed to be a combination of the words "my" and "people." The meeple originated in the board game Carcassonne which was released about 15 years ago and continues to make gamers out of unsuspecting people today! Glorious Meeples!!! Since then, meeples have been used in countless other board games and have become the unofficial symbol of modern day tabletop gaming. Nowadays, meeples are not only used to represent people, but animals, creatures, monsters, and much, much more. You see them in logos, t-shirts, playing cards, and many other suprising places!They're everywhere! Meepillow Blueprint Meepillows are my interpretation of what the offspring of meeples and pillows would look like. They are soft, huggable and will definitely liven up any room in your home. They are 15 inches tall, almost 16 inches wide and 6 inches thick. They were born out of my love of board games and the tabletop game industry as a whole. The original 6 colors were chosen based on popular player colors used in modern day board games, but from this Kickstarter I hope to grow this business with new sizes and colors! I knew from the beginning that shipping would be a challenge. Unlike other projects, this one would pose a logistical problem of shipping many multiple large items together. The Meepillow is already quite large and an odd shape, and adding multiple units makes the shipping box huge! So, I decided to absorb shipping costs best I could, offer discount tiers on different reward levels, and ship from multiple fulfillment warehouses that will help offset the insane costs. "Dimension Weight" is my least favorite combination of words right now!1 Meepillow: US $8 / The World $102 Meepillows: US $15 / The World $183 Meepillows: US $20 / The World $254 Meepillows: US $25 / The World $325 Meepillows: US $29 / The World $406 Meepillows: US $32 / The World $47Many months later of pulling my hair out it turns out in the end the cost to ship was simply unavoidable. I stopped worrying and decided to just love the project.I hope you do too! I went through a few companies and prototypes until I fined tuned the meeple shape that works best as a giant huggable plush. Even though the shape is simple, it is iconic and it needed to be perfect. Otherwise it would have just been a blob or a weird starfish shape. Making the shape work was surprisingly more difficult than expected. Receiving these prototypes was so amazing. All the hard work was starting to pay off. Having them in hand and being able to show people validated what I already knew. These Meepillows were not only cool to look at, but incredibly soft and quite epic! Prototypes in all their meeple glory! Since the prototypes are just, well, prototypes I needed to test multiple colors as well. In the end the Purple Meepillow (which is clearly more of a lavender above) and the Yellow Meepillow will see the biggest changes.Please note that your screen will not accurately portray the colors exactly how they will be in final product. Between the camera used to photograph the fabric, the lighting, and your computer/phone screen it can be difficult to show the colors exactly as they are represented. Have faith though! They are vibrant and accurate to my specifications! Final Red Swatch Final Blue Swatch Final Green Swatch Final Black Swatch Final Yellow Swatch Final Purple Swatch Help spread the word by downloading these cool Meepillow avatars and using them on different social media sites! Top Shelf Fun was born out of a love for fun, geeky and just plain awesome stuff. Board games, action figures, comic books, pop culture memorabilia, and video games are just a few of my favorite things. When there is no room left on my shelves, the toys will walk the earth.As Top Shelf Fun was indeed born out of a love of board games, Meepillows are the first board game products to be born out of Top Shelf Fun. With your help I will not only kickstart Meepillows, but it will be the foundation of all future products (in which I have many)!I can't thank you enough for your support!A very special 'Thank You' to the following people who helped me get this project off the ground:Kristan Delle - Wife and big-time supporter of my shenanigans.Rob McClure - Actor, editor, and all around great guy.Maggie Lakis - Actress, director, and best friend.Keith Bailey - Art assets and long time chum of immense talent.Brae Howard - Photographer extraordinaire.Kiril Tchangov - Top Shelf Fun logo & Meepillow Certificate designer.
367`What people say about Smart Mone Maker: Bearded Meeple, Game Reviewer Gerard van den Akker, One of my First Backers"(...) Smart Money Maker shows you how the real world works in a fun way.""Paying off my debts will be actually fun.""I really like how you not only play against your opponents, but also against the game itself." Vincent Petruzzi, Instructional Designer"Smart Money Maker shows us that playing is actually the most simple and engaging way to learn something new." Sally Brammall, Means of Change"A great idea for a game that could also help explain new economy concepts.."Smart Money Maker is a card game to illustrate the rules of the New Economy. It is based on a simple concept: everyone plays against the problems left behind by the old economy! The objective is to pay for all debts, taxes, loans and make investments to remain in the market. Smart Money Maker card game (photo: Danilo Franzini) Players have to collaborate: they receive a portfolio of cards that represent the New Economy models. The cards can be traded in for cash when they are used to pay off debts. After the whole deck has been used up, if all of the debts have been paid off by the players, the player who has the most cash wins the game. A collaborative card game for 2-6 players to illustrate the rules of the New Economy Despite the many opportunities to collaborate, it's possible that players won t manage to pay off all debts. In that case, the game is the winner! Sharing with others, expressing our opinions, and joining a community are all actions that generate value. Smart Money Maker is a collaborative card game for 2-6 players of all ages (10-99 years old) to illustrate the rules of the New Economy!Laurence Humier, a Belgian-born, Milan-based designer and engineer, uses design to communicate social changes. Smart Money Maker (photo: Michele Silvestro) How to play? How was Smart Money Maker developed? Monopoly , a game born in the old capitalist era, was based on the accumulation of money and goods. Since the economy rules have changed, Laurence Humier has designed Smart Money Maker to illustrate the fundamentals of the New Economy. In the old economy, value was determined by the market: the relationship between supply and demand determined the price of a commodity. In the new economy everything has been turned upside down. The US writer Kevin Kelly explained it in his book New Rules for the New Economy. Abundance determines value: the more one consumes, the less resources will cost. Production price approaches zero thanks to the digital sphere. Replication is just a click away.How does competition work in the New Economy? Connections have to be made quicker and volumes of data multiplied. Word of mouth is crucial to creating positive impressions among groups, subcultures, communities. People who know how to deal with the New Economy make and break news, and spread information about services and products. According to this model, a search engine like Google creates wealth with a stream of information just like banks generate it with a stream of money. The penny-wise who follow the rules of the old economy keep their assets out of circulation: earn low returns, pay taxes and run losses. In the New Economy, the one who moves their investments wins. Who is Smart Money Maker for? The game will be produced in English for anyone who loves to play card from 10 to 99 years old! What do I get? Smart Money Maker comes into a beautiful box that contains the 154 cards. The first edition is being offered here on Kickstarter and will be delivered in January 2016. If you live in Milan, save the shipping costs by pledging for the Early Bird - Pick it up in Milan reward. We will agree on a day and time for you to come by my office and pick up your Smart Money Maker deck, even a couple of days before Christmas. Who's the creator? Laurence Humier is a Belgian architectural engineer by training. She works as a designer in Milan, providing services and products in the field of industrial design, communication services, and education. Laurence debuted at an international level when one of her creations was included in the permanent collection of New York s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). In 2010, Laurence began work on Cooking Material, a collaboration with a chemical engineer, and the possible applications of do-it-yourself types of matter inspired by cooking recipes. She has organized workshops relating to this project at a number of respected institutions and events, including Cit des Sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris, Espace des Inventions in Lausanne, and the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York. Following these experiences, Laurence designed a chemistry set for children called Alchemist Matter; it was funded via Kickstarter in January 2015. The apparent transversality of her research, her diversity of interests, and her international works are strong points within an activity devoted to a broad sense of design. Credits.

368`The Brydge Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can now order a Brydge at www.thebrydge.com.The best way to contact the Brydge team is by emailing us at info@thebrydge.com. You can also follow us on Twitter and on Facebook.TIME - "Brydge stands out for its Apple aesthetics."CNET - "A keyboard case that makes your iPad look a lot like the MacBook Air."

We highly recommend watching our video to get the best idea of what Brydge can do. Is it just us, or does it feel like the options for iPad keyboards and accessories are excessive in quantity, yet lacking in quality? This is why we created Brydge. This idea of adding a high quality hinging keyboard to your iPad seemed obvious to us and we were shocked when we could not find any accessory that accomplished this. So we set out to make such a product to perfectly compliment your iPad. Brydge is an elegant solution to the lack of quality iPad keyboards and accessories currently on the market. Brydge connects to your iPad using a patent-pending hinge which allows for close to 180 degrees of iPad positioning and holds your iPad secure. Watch our "Shake Test" to see how strongly Brydge's hinge holds your iPadBrydge's aluminum body ismachined and anodized so that it matches the look and feel of the iPad precisely. When paired together Brydge and your iPad appear to be two parts of the same device, blending style and functionality seamlessly. Unlike other products made of painted plastic in an effort to look similar to the iPad, Brydge does not fake it. Not only does it look good, but when held in your hands you can feel the quality craftsmanship Apple lovers demand. Watch our "Keyboard Comparison" video to see what sets Brydge apartBrydge's patent-pending hinge holds the iPad secure and allows for close to 180 degrees of positioning. While many stands offer a non-adjustable ledge to lean your iPad up against, Brydge's hinge allows you to position your iPad at nearly any angle, even allowing you to close it up entirely for easy transportation. Once closed, both your iPad and Brydge go to sleep automatically. Hinge made of metal alloys and magnets, with a thermoplastic elastomer shellBrydge s hinge combines the forces of friction and magnetism to hold strongly onto the iPad. There is no need to enclose your iPad in any sort of case, instead, your iPad snaps in and is ready to go. If you need your iPad free from Brydge, simple hold down on the Brydge and pull your iPad free. Optional Stereo Speakers Brydge connects with your iPad via bluetooth, so there is no need to deal with any wires or plugs. This was important aesthetically, but also adds to the portability and convenience of the product. Additionally, the keyboard has been designed specifically for an iPad, with iPad functions built in and charges through a USB connection.Kickstarter is an amazing tool that has helped introduce you to our product so that we can raise this capital. We have come so far and have a clear plan to cross the finish line, but part of that plan relies on you. We have calculated that we need $90K in order to produce the product in bulk and bring it to market. If you're interested in seeing the Brydge being made and would like to receive one of the first editions please pledge. Thank you!

369`Where are the toys that provide young boys with positive messages? Look up and down the aisles at toy stores you ll find characters that are part of today's Hero-Industrial Complex, invented decades ago, being reused and repackaged by billion-dollar corporations to crank out merchandise, with no thought given to the development of young boys. As parents, we see first-hand the struggles boys face: it s hard to sit still, be quiet, share, pay attention. We want our boys to know it s OK to be themselves, and we want to teach them the values that we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. That is why we created the HeroBoys: a toy and comic book made specifically for young boys about young boys. HeroBoys are line of toys and comic books meant to celebrate the adventure, imagination, and limitless potential inherent in boys, while reinforcing positive values. With your support, we can bring a thoughtful alternative into the unimaginative world of boys toys. Our Heroes People are Talking about HeroBoys.. Late Congressman s son launches 'HeroBoys' toys and comic books How a Dad and a Mom Invented a New Toy Idea to Help Inspire Their Boys to Grow Into Good Men HeroBoys are Positive Super Hero Toys for Young Boys Dynamic Mom & Pop Duo Create HeroBoys Comics & Toys Rewards Hero Combo Starter Set That covers the why; let s move on to the what. The HeroBoys are 6 ordinary boys who are given superpowers by their mentor, The Gentleman, with a mandate to do good and provide an example to a city being overrun by selfish behavior. The HeroBoys line will follow this narrative through: Action Figures. Our first toy available on Kickstarter is the HeroBoys action figure: the only 18-inch action figure with a plush body AND functioning elbow and knee joints. You can choose from six different HeroBoys: We will send our backers images of the completed Hero figures so they can choose the Hero they would like. Gusto Prototype Comic Books. The HeroBoys comic book will be available as the first issue only or as a monthly subscription (hard copy and eComic). In these pages, the HeroBoys will learn that true strength comes from being honest, decent, and determined. Each issue will have a clear lesson for boys that can be used as teachable moment for parents who have precious few hours each day with their children. As a subscription, kids will get a new story every month. The stories use simple words to inspire a love of reading because we believe comic books are a vastly underutilized tool for encouraging literacy in young boys. T-Shirts. We also have some very cool, soft cotton HeroBoys T-shirts available with the HB team logo or the logo of your favorite HeroBoy. This is a great reward for those want to support this project but might not have a young boy at home. T-Shirts (The Hero Every Day of the Week package) Very Cool T-shirts Cape and Mask Sets.

We have produced a prototype and are in discussions with manufacturers in China to begin production. We have the first comic written and illustrated. The T-shirts have been designed and have been produced in limited quantities. With the money raised through this campaign we will be able customize our prototype model for each HeroBoy and place our first production order. We will also be able to print the comic book and manufacturer the t-shirts. We are currently in discussions with fulfillment centers to fulfill orders. We intend to start shipping once all rewards are ready which we expect to be in the first quarter of 2016. The success of this campaign will also allow us to hire staff like an illustrator and developer to carry forward the HeroBoys mission.

With the Egg, all our videos and photos go on to the Egg and we selectively share things with individuals or groups directly from the Egg without the work of having to filter the information or worrying about our stuff getting hacked or stolen." - Hina M. Kids : "I love that we can use The Egg to play movies while in the car. Its so cool and it fits right in my hand! And my mom loves it too because it keeps me from fighting with my brother" - Jonathan A. Musicians : "Most bands like ours, that create and play music, do it for fun since it is not our full-time job. We have limited time to devote to our music. The Egg allows us to share music that we're working on between band members and do so privately. This allows each band member to work on the music on their schedule" - Vanessa P. Photographers : "No longer is photography about just having a good camera and a decent set of lenses, you need a tool to back those images up, or face the devastation of lost files. I can still remember when one of my friends put a message out asking anyone who had attended their wedding to send any pictures they took. They had misplaced photos of their wedding, and the photographer didn t have a back up. The Egg has proven to be the best solution for not only storing photographs of events that I work, share them with my clients and keep them secure at all times." - Mike B. Product Details/Specifications The Egg comes in an attractive hand-held form-factor. It has Wi-Fi for Connectivity and a 2.4 - 320 x 240 pixel color touch screen.

We realized that as this phenomenon continued to grow, consumers were facing two problems, How can I quickly free up storage on my phones and cameras? Where can I safely (because the cloud was not an option due to security concerns and cellular data plan limitations) store my videos and photos but still be able to easily access them? We knew that the product would have to: Automatically import photos, videos and other content from any device that has a USB port including iPhones, Android phones, SLR and GoPro cameras Expand the storage of mobile devices Be accessible from anywhere via an on-board personal website Be accessible locally Include password protection for complete control of user privacy Be easy to set up and manage Come with iOS and Android apps that would let users seamlessly access their Egg from anywhere During our discussions about this personal repository for ALL things Us , one of the members of the team drew this (see image below) on the board. He imagined the device to look like an Egg. As we talked about what this device would do, we kept referring to it as The Egg. In every subsequent meeting that we had, we kept calling it The Egg because it was much simpler than calling it the personal repository for all your digital things and it felt right . Over time, the name stuck because the team felt that, in nature, Eggs are special and we all knew that this device that we had started out to build was going to be special. Over the next couple of years, we developed and tested numerous designs with users to find the right balance between utility and usability. After many iterations, we settled on The Egg s current form factor. Not only does it feel great to hold but it also fits easily in a pocket or purse.

We have successfully run workshops with students from Imperial College London, the London Royal College of Art, young entrepreneurs at O2 Think Big and Microsoft Ventures, children, and teenagers. We have invested in running manufacture at production levels to create 200 kits - these are the ones that you see live in action in our videos.Before testing out the first 200 kits we made many software and hardware iterations, this is how they looked like: Here s what people are saying about SAM: Andy Brand, teaching fellow of engineering design at Imperial College, who ran an intense weeklong wearable tech workshop with SAM in July: You'll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content. Play Replay with sound Play with sound 00:00 00:00 We're glad people said: SAM is the first Internet of Things development kit that is truly intuitive and works out of the box - Alexander Asseily, CEO - State, Founder & Chair - Jawbone SAM is amazing for children and all creative types to understand and create their wonderful ideas - Mark Champkins, London Science Museum - Designer in Residence SAM is awesome, my kids love it, my students love it, I love it. Innovation is open to everyone - Prof. Miles Pennington, Innovation Design Engineering & Global Innovation Design, Imperial College London & Royal College of Art SAM is a crazy new technology that will fundamentally change the way you go from idea to finished product - Andy McCartney and Diane Perlman, CEO in Residence - Microsoft Ventures UK Why SAM?I'm a mechanical engineer, and was always scared of the dark magic of electrical engineering. Stuff never works, there's always a bug, and you can't duct tape it into correctness. I wanted to find a way to make it fun for people to learn circuitry and coding. A human centered model that would be easy to use and which taught you while you worked with it. This gave birth to SAM, the idea of giving designers and creative people the powers of engineers. We hope to be a the start of a democratic revolution for the Internet of Things so that children can learn and that impactful, highly technologically innovative projects can be undertaken by designers who do not necessarily have the luxury of having been technically trained as engineers.1. SAM makes creating easy. Until now, electronics projects have required hardware skills (wiring, soldering), software wizardry (coding, hacking, debugging) and a lot of patience! With SAM, you can forget all of these. SAM ensures a seamless communication between hardware and software. No more head bashing - it just works. With no frustration, it s fun to use! 2. SAM opens the Internet of Everything market to designers and creators. Gone are the days when society depends on engineers and technical experts to shape the world around us. Thanks to SAM, anyone with an idea turns it into reality. 3. SAM helps you learn about code. While coding is not necessary with SAM, code is generated for all your drag and drop creations. As you become comfortable with this code, start adding your own to unleash the power of SAM and create awesome stuff!Open Source and the SAM community We believe in the Open Hardware movement and we will upload the kits hardware schematics and board designs, the components we re using are available from any major distributor. ...also, they look quite good! Production Plan As soon as the campaign ends, we will place an order for all the components needed for mass manufacture. These components have a lead time of up to three months, and we have booked the manufacturing plant for the middle of February just in case any delays in component sourcing arise. Fresh out of the factory, the kits will be dispatched straight to your houses.Who is SAM Labs?We are a multi-disciplinary team of designers from the Royal College of Art and engineers from Imperial College London.The idea for SAM came to us while eating fat soba in Tokyo in August 2013, and the team started assembling in early 2014.We have been working remotely on SAM with regular hackathon meets, but have now settled at Central Working s collaborative working space in Whitechapel, London.Thank you Thanks for reading all the way down, we hope you ve enjoyed learning about SAM and are ready to join us on the journey.

373`Where are the toys that provide young boys with positive messages? Look up and down the aisles at toy stores you ll find characters that are part of today's Hero-Industrial Complex, invented decades ago, being reused and repackaged by billion-dollar corporations to crank out merchandise, with no thought given to the development of young boys. As parents, we see first-hand the struggles boys face: it s hard to sit still, be quiet, share, pay attention. We want our boys to know it s OK to be themselves, and we want to teach them the values that we learned from our parents: honesty, loyalty, humility, compassion, and diligence. That is why we created the HeroBoys: a toy and comic book made specifically for young boys about young boys. HeroBoys are line of toys and comic books meant to celebrate the adventure, imagination, and limitless potential inherent in boys, while reinforcing positive values. With your support, we can bring a thoughtful alternative into the unimaginative world of boys toys. Our Heroes People are Talking about HeroBoys.. Late Congressman s son launches 'HeroBoys' toys and comic books How a Dad and a Mom Invented a New Toy Idea to Help Inspire Their Boys to Grow Into Good Men HeroBoys are Positive Super Hero Toys for Young Boys Dynamic Mom & Pop Duo Create HeroBoys Comics & Toys Rewards Hero Combo Starter Set That covers the why; let s move on to the what. The HeroBoys are 6 ordinary boys who are given superpowers by their mentor, The Gentleman, with a mandate to do good and provide an example to a city being overrun by selfish behavior. The HeroBoys line will follow this narrative through: Action Figures. Our first toy available on Kickstarter is the HeroBoys action figure: the only 18-inch action figure with a plush body AND functioning elbow and knee joints. You can choose from six different HeroBoys: We will send our backers images of the completed Hero figures so they can choose the Hero they would like. Gusto Prototype Comic Books. The HeroBoys comic book will be available as the first issue only or as a monthly subscription (hard copy and eComic). In these pages, the HeroBoys will learn that true strength comes from being honest, decent, and determined. Each issue will have a clear lesson for boys that can be used as teachable moment for parents who have precious few hours each day with their children. As a subscription, kids will get a new story every month. The stories use simple words to inspire a love of reading because we believe comic books are a vastly underutilized tool for encouraging literacy in young boys. T-Shirts. We also have some very cool, soft cotton HeroBoys T-shirts available with the HB team logo or the logo of your favorite HeroBoy. This is a great reward for those want to support this project but might not have a young boy at home. T-Shirts (The Hero Every Day of the Week package) Very Cool T-shirts Cape and Mask Sets. All Superheroes need to protect their secret identity make sure your superhero can too! Match your HeroBoys T-shirt with that Hero s cape and mask!! Our Heroes with Capes & Masks Where We Stand now Some of our development work We have spent thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars researching, writing, sourcing and prototyping to bring HeroBoys to this point. We have produced a prototype and are in discussions with manufacturers in China to begin production. We have the first comic written and illustrated. The T-shirts have been designed and have been produced in limited quantities. With the money raised through this campaign we will be able customize our prototype model for each HeroBoy and place our first production order. We will also be able to print the comic book and manufacturer the t-shirts. We are currently in discussions with fulfillment centers to fulfill orders. We intend to start shipping once all rewards are ready which we expect to be in the first quarter of 2016. The success of this campaign will also allow us to hire staff like an illustrator and developer to carry forward the HeroBoys mission.

But you don't have to take that from them! You will have ample time to plan around these attacks and there are special protective Dome Shields that can be activated by spending Neutronium as a fuel source. If you have any crew assigned to a site that is under attack, you can pay any resource to protect them, or they must flee those sites and return to their quarters on your ship. When a Therion Marauders card is drawn, between 0 and 4 Sites are attacked. If you have any Crew there, you have to raise the shields or flee!

The more Followers and Likes we can accumulate means the more people know about our projects, which equals more awesome content in every game! THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! All rewards for this project will be shipped from the USA. Delivering Your Reward Responsibly Our number one goal and responsibility is to deliver the rewards that our backers pledge for. Gamelyn Games brings years of experience to this project and has overseen all of our planning and arrangements to ensure Darkrock Ventures will be delivered to all backers in a timely manner just like all of their previous projects. Every backer is important to us, regardless of location, just as much every pledge makes a difference, regardless of amount. Unfortunately shipping costs are something we all have to face, but that does not mean we cannot be transparent about this challenge and tackle it responsibly. The learning experiences Gamelyn Games has overcome with shipping have come to this campaign in full, and we aim to manage our (and your) risk in a responsible and professional manner. Shipping costs are a very real factor. They can be volatile and are never trivial. Further, I do not feel that claiming to offer "Free Shipping" only to hide that very real & significant cost somewhere else is the best way of doing things and our backers deserve better. We have decided to offer affordable FLAT-RATE shipping to various regions, but at the same time offer CUSTOMS-FRIENDLY shipping available to ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD through our friends at Ship Naked to offer the best overall value we can for your pledge. We will always endeavor to keep shipping charges as low as possible by offering discounts on pledges for more than one copy at a time through campaign rewards and add-ons made available through Pledge Manager. The best way to get the game for the lowest cost possible is to split a multi-pack with some friends or family members, everyone can share the cost benefit and more copies ordered means Darkrock Ventures itself will become a better game. Regarding Customs: Our shipping partner, Ship Naked, offers what they call "Customs-Friendly Worldwide Shipping" meaning they coordinate all transport, customs clearance, and brokerage from the factory to the destination using shipping depots all around the world. They have already laid the groundwork to ensure all packages will make it to backers in every country as smoothly and inexpensively as possible. While we cannot personally guarantee that no single person will have any customs difficulties on an individual level, we are confident in Ship Naked's ability to mitigate any potential issues and keep surprise costs far away from our backers and their ability to make it right should any such problems arise. Historically, Gamelyn Games has had very few individual cases of customs difficulties and the processes have improved even more since those challenges have occurred. Pledge with Confidence! International Backers Please Keep in Mind: While the shipping costs outside the USA are greater, every base copy of the game will be sold $11 below MSRP through this campaign, with discounts even greater when multiple copies are ordered. Plus, you are guaranteed to get the game before general retailers AND with all bonus content which may never be available at retail at all. Making you pledge in this campaign your BEST VALUE for the complete Darkrock Ventures experience! Get some friends together to split a multi-pack to maximize the value for your pledge! Click the image to see an interview with the Designer of Darkrock Ventures! Michael Eskue is the designer of Darkrock Ventures, as well as many other awesome games such as the TableTop-featured Council of Verona from Crash Games. Michael is an experienced designer and we hope you'll agree he has outdone himself with Darkrock Ventures! Meet the Rest of the Team! Not pictured: all of the outstanding fans, reviewers, playtesters, and backers! (Sorry, there wasn't enough room for everyone!) All Add-Ons for this project are included in the reward tiers and/or will be handled AFTER the campaign within PledgeManager. There are no separate Add-Ons during the campaign. If you'd like to add additional copies of the game to your pledge beyond what is available in the reward tiers, you will be able to do so within PledgeManager after this Kickstarter campaign ends. Please do not add to your KS pledge for add-ons, you will pay for them in PledgeManager. Want extra copies after the campaign ends? No problem with PledgeManager!

375`Hex is a completely open source nanocopter kit made by a community of makers from around the world. It's also the world's first consumer electronic product that uses 3D printing technology to achieve personalization. What makes Hex so special:1. Piloting made easy: With an extremely user-friendly control app, everyone can enjoy the feeling of being a pilot.2. See the world from a different perspective: Put a camera on Hex and take video from the air, in real time.3. Personalize your flying experience: You decide what you want your Hex to look like.4. Be creative and hack: Hex is completely open source, modify it in any way you like.5. No soldering required: Just click the kit to together to create your own personal copter in minutes. New sensors added! Learn more: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1387330585/hex-a-copter-that-anyone-can-fly/posts/595702Piloting made easy! Smartphone controlled Hex is controlled using smartphones and other mobile devices, so complicated remote controls are not required to get it off the ground. The control system we use, RC Touch, has an extremely user-friendly interface and is already available for iOS and Android devices. Multiple control methodsHex can be controlled using the gravity sensors in a mobile device. It imitates the movement of the smartphone or a tablet in the air. In addition, traditional throttle, elevator, aileron, rudder control systems can be used to operate your Hex. Utilizing Bluetooth 4.0 for communication Hex uses Bluetooth 4.0 since this communication protocol is available in most modern mobile devices. Bluetooth 4.0 provides Hex with efficient long distance communication. Auto-stabilization Hex s flight control system is paired with various sensors help to make flying more safe and steady. These components massively reduce the risk of crashing. The sophisticated electronics in the copter allow it to sense when Hex is not balanced and adjust the motor speeds accordingly. See the world from a different perspective! Camera compatibility A camera can be attached to Hex for aerial photography and videography. First Person View (FPV) With FPV glasses provided in the Hex Spy Kit, you can experience the thrills and joys of being in the air! A 5.8G Radio telemetry module is used for real time transfer of videos to the FPV glasses. Real-time Wi-Fi telemetry Hex also lets you see what the webcam sees on your mobile device in real time. A Wi-Fi communication module is used. (The FPV glasses kit has no battery included. The external power port of the glasses can be used for supplying power. The voltage of the external power supply shall be at 8-13V)Personalize your flying experience! Choosing shells Hex can be customized in a number of different ways. You choose how you want it to look depending on what you like. We provide many 3D printed shells. All shells are directly mounted on top of the circuit board, and no soldering is required. Designing personalized shellsIf you are a designer, you can design your own shells and print them out from Shapeways or a 3D printer at your home or a nearby hackerspace and mount them to your Hex. Be creative and hack!Arduino compatibilityYou can change Hex's behavior by changing Hex's open source code or hardware. Hex is Arduino compatible which makes it easy to fiddle with it.Auto-balancing hacksThe autopilot system of Hex allows it to auto-balance itself in mid-air, but if you are creative, the same circuit board can be used to balance other devices such as a two-wheeled robot car, fixed-wing aircrafts, camera gimbals, submarines etc. Who We AreWe are a team of makers coming from different parts of the world who believe that drones will be a big part of our future. Our team is made up of designers as well as software and hardware engineers. We have been making and researching drones for the past year and hope this is just the first of many projects related to drone technology. With your support, we hope to develop Hex nanocopters into a very customizable experience.
