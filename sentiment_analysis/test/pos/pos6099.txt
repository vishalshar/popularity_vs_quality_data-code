I own 2 male cats...a Bengal (3 1/2) and a Tabby (2 1/2).  The Bengal is a pure-bred cat from a breeder and the Tabby is a rescue from a shelter.  When I got the Bengal, the breeder gave me a sample of the Whole Life Chicken to try out.  He loved it right from the first taste!  He gets his "treat" every night and gobbles it down.  The Tabby however shows no interest in it at all.  Very strange.I used to buy the 21 oz. bags from another supplier.  I didn't know that Amazon sold it.  The other supplier sent me bags that had about 20% crushed pieces on the bottom...crushed almost to a powder.  Granted I could still mix this in with the regular cat food, but I wasn't happy with it.  Plus this suppler was more expensive.So I tried it from Amazon and to my suprise, the quality of the product was head-and-shoulders above the other supplier.  And it was considerably cheaper.  I've been buying it from Amazon ever since...probably bought 5 bags in the past year or so.I highly recommend this product and also recommend buying it from Amazon.  Better quality, cheaper price...and FREE shipping.  You can't beat it!
