I couldn't be happier about it. So far I've worn it as a necklace and bracelet and it works perfectly in both modes. It can detect very subtle variations in sleep (I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night but I don't even get out of bed or anything, and then the next morning the leaf can tell exactly when it happened. Very impressive.)As for exercises other than walking/running, the tracker doesn't work so well, but you can easily log whatever activity you engaged in manually (and they have SO MANY options, from cooking to yoga).As for the appearance, it looks really good. I was quite concerned about this because I am very petite and have very thin wrists. Still, it looks pretty as a bracelet.One criticism: after you enter your menstrual cycle information (specifically the duration), you can't easily alter that if you made a mistake (so far I haven't figured out how to).Overall, a very good product that I would gladly recommend to any woman who wants to have an insight on their health and habits.
