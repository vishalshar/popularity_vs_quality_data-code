Received this May 14th and within a few days had our first mouse.  To date, May 30th, we have eliminated 4 mice in total and one full grown squirrel.  We were quire surprised to come home yesterday afternoon to find the lower half of a full grown squirrel hanging out of the back of this thing.It is quick, quite and clean and really does do exactly what it says it does.  Throw in 2 to 3 pieces of cat food, turn it on, set it against a wall where you know mice/rats travel and wait for that blinking red light.
