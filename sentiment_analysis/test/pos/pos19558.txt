I've had numerous pillows in my life time and a handful of 'memory foam' pillows that made promises of comfort and pain relief etc that they never delivered. After a week of use, on the first night I knew, this pillow was worth the money. I use it as a base underneath a down pillow and in addition to being pleasantly firm, but not too soft, I actually  do not wake with neckpain or stiffness. I'd buy this pillow again if I hadn't already bought two.
