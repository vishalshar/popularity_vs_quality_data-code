My 6 year old grand daughter absolutely loves it. However she worked her way to the beach which seems to be the end. It said there would be updates. She started over and is trying new things, but it seems like the original program should last longer than a few days. We also could use some directions for the if...then. We're looking forward to the new Osmo module next week.
