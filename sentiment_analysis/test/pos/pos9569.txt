I did a lot of research before purchasing a car mount. I've had some in the past that are just too flimsy and swivel around when unwanted. But this one is so sturdy and it is in a location that I needed, in plain sight for music and maps. Some mounts require you to look down if plugged in to your lighter. I love that it has the foot to hold the phone, as well as leaving an opening for my charger to fit. I also really love the fact that it is universal so my husband's iphone can fit in as well.
