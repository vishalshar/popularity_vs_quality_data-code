Phone unboxing review: https://youtu.be/avwolZSNjJECamera review: https://youtu.be/NrI9LPaC2DQThis is an amazing phone. The gesture addition is great. You can awake your screen by double tapping the screen when off. You can also launch any application right from the screen being turned off by doing a gesture command. The display is great, it does not have the darkest colors and  it is quite bright. The phone runs smooth when playing games and multitasking. The only thing is that it holds a micro sim card on slot 2 and a normal sim in slot 1. I bought the white version and it has an elegant design. Overall this phone is great. I owned the posh mobile titian hd e500 aand it was a great phone and this one seems like it will be just as great. The gesture command was an awesome addition. Oh and the Bluetooth is easier to find. The screen is great for streaming videos and reading articles and so forth. It is easy for me to hold and I am able to use it single handed most of the time. After a while my hand cramps up though._. that's just me though. You should really give it a try as it comes with prime shipping and can return it if it has issues for a refund free of cost. Also because of the spectacular camera. For the price the 13mp camera is just wicked. The colors are not the most vibrant but they do a great job. If you have any questions feel free to ask.Update 10-31-15:The phone is still going strong I have experience a few crashes here and there, but still working great. With the developer option turned on and having animation scale at .5 is helping a lot in the smoothness of screen transition and speed :) The battery life is still great. specially the standby as it tends to keep its charge very well i mean ridiculously good. at 12 am at night to 7:30 am it looses 1-3% :O so when it is at 90%. I wake up with 89% most of the time.
