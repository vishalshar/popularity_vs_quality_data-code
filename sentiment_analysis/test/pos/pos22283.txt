My wife and I had stopped eating pasta for the most part in our at home diet in an attempt to curb overall carb consumption. I missed pasta and I longed for its sweet and usually sauce covered embrace. I first came across Banza in the aisles at Sprouts and figured i'd give it a try. I'm now taking time out of my day to write a review to support this new product. It's a great substitute for pasta, especially for those looking to keep a higher protein diet and to reduce carbohydrate intake. It prepares the same and tastes great. Prepare it however you love your pasta, you won't be disappointed. Personally, I like to make mine as follows:- 1-2 grilled chicken breasts diced into bite sized pieces- toss into the cooked strained pasta, add small amount of olive oil- add italian salad dressing (i prefer Wishbone)- add parmesan cheese- (optional) add red pepper flakes and/or hot chile oil (i use mongolian fire oil)- stir to mix and serve up hotTrust me, it's delicious.
