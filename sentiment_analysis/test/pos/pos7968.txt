Everyone should own one of these. Everyone who takes their phones into the bathroom with them at least! I had recently read an article about when you flush it sprays in the air 6 feet in every direction. Even if you wash your hands, you aren't washing your phone. Even if you wash your hands, 50 people before you using that same bathroom may not have washed theirs. When you touch that door knob on your way out and then two hours later you are eating while stalking someone on Instagram you are putting your hands in your mouth! The same hands that touched all of those nasty things in the bathroom and your precious cell phone!! Gross!!!This UV filter fits even the large iPhone6 plus! It came in 2 days with free shipping and all of the phones in our house were disinfected in no time at all! It literally only takes a few minutes to clean your phone!Everyone with a cell phone should have one of these!
