If you like a good shave oil, this one is worth a shot.  The real reason to buy this one is the story behind the product. If you haven't already, check out the listing.  It gives a good history for this product.As far as a shave oil goes, this one is decent.  It's not the best I've found, but it lands in the upper tier.  It's a nice thick oil that does not leave you feeling greasy.  I will warn you though, you may experience some stinging or a sensation of heating.  I never got uncomfortable but some people might be alarmed by that.Overall it's not as good as Shave Secret and it's more expensive, but it's still a great option for anyone who loves a shave oil.
