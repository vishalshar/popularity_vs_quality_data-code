I love it! It's so sleek and small, and the wide angle of the lens gives great coverage! The image is beautiful, and is still impressive in the dark. I got this to help the eldest of my three kitty boys, as our recent move has him a little out of sorts when I am away at work. So far, all three seem to get a kick out of it. ?It was very easy to set up, and the companion application is fantastic, too.(My photo shows two of them in the dark. I will be getting a mountable tripod to put it somewhere where they won't mess with it. ? They were quick to find out where the laser and my voice were coming from. This photo cracks me up.)EDIT:Now that I have a tripod, this camera truly is amazing. The wide angle sees the entire room my boys and I are currently staying in, and the night vision works in total darkness. It gives me wonderful piece of mind. <3
