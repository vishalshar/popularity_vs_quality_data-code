It's a variety of mushrooms ground into a fine powder.  I have an 8 Ib dog, so he only needs about 3/4th of the smaller spoon provided.  I mix it with a few drops of water and give it to him through a medicine dropper.  He doesn't' seem to mind, and he gets lots of loves and a goodie afterward.  He had an abscess on his skin twice now that needed to be lanced at the vet, and he'd have to go on antibiotics.  He also gets little pimples on his back regularly.  I wanted to find something to boost his immune system.  He's been on this Immunity for about two weeks.  So far so good!  I noticed he has increased in energy.  He's been playing more and acting more joyful. I'm going to keep up this daily routine of giving this to him because it seems like it's making a difference and the little pimples on his back have decreased quite a bit.  I ended up finding a human version for me that's in a pill form because I saw how much it's helped my dog.
