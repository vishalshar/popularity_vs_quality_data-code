I bought this small pouch of 24 loads to test the detergent, but now I have obtained the bigger container (132 loads) in the same lavender flavor.  I have been using the Green Grab dish washing detergent, so I am not new to GrabGreen and thought of giving this a try when I ran out of the other green washing detergent I was using.The clothes washed great and I noticed that this was more effective in removing grease and stain than the previous one I was using. I must say I was a little worried about the lavender fragrance as sometimes it can be too over powering.  The lavender smell is great and is subtle without feeling very overpowering. It also saves time measuring the amount of detergent as just a pod needs to be tossed along with the clothes. The pod dissolves quickly and I did not find any residue or particles remaining on the clothes. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to switch to a greener detergent.
