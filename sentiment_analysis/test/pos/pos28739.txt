This is the second one I have bought. First one was broke by being stepped on. Liked both. The finding my car app is the least of the reason I use it. In fact have never used it. But checking my system I use all the time, However the charging is GREAT. I drive all day for work, and use my cell phone and tablet for many things all day long, so I have to constantly charge one or the other and this thing is a monster when it comes to charging. The fact that you can put the cord in any direction is really nice. It keeps all my electronics running, I can see how the system is doing in any vehicle I get into, and in case I ever do lose my vehicle I will be able to find it.Over the years I have used all kinds of gadgets, I love gadgets, and this is one of the best I have ever got. It is worth the cost. If I could find something else that would do what this does cheaper I would get it but it aint out there. This thing is well made. I drove over one with a truck once by accident, and didn't hurt it. The only thing that did it in was a 270 lb man with hard soled shoes on and it sitting in a crack on the ground and when he stepped on it and it being at an angel it broke more like bent into an L shape. It may have still worked but I was so pissed at this idiot I picked up the messed up ZUS and threw it into the desert. I then immediately went and bought a new one. Didn't think twice about it. I aint rich, just a poor working stiff but this thing is worth it.
