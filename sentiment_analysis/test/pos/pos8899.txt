It's great if you have short-term renters, regular tenants, or out-of-town guests. No more handing out copies of your key. No more sitting around waiting to give out your key. No more hassle trying to recover your key. No more changing your locks after every tenant. Just send the people you want to have access a link or text from the August Lock app on your phone, and it is all done. Set up temporary "guest" list by time and date, and you are all set. Best used with the August Connect or other device to connect it to your home network.When installing the lock, just make sure you calibrate as instructed, then test to make sure the deadbolt actually locks. If your lock is a bit hard to close manually by key, as is in my case, no worries. This machine has some torque and can easily close my sticky lock.
