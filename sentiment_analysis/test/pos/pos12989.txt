PROS:- No knobs needed to mount car mount- Innovative idea to use magnets to mount phone- Easy to mount phone- Magnet can be used with speck iPhone case- Only 1 locking mechanism needed to lock into CD slotCONS:- Hard to adjust phone at correct angle with phone mounted; phone would sometimes fall off mount- CD slot is low on the dash, so often had to look down a lot while driving- Worried that CD Car Mount will mess up my CD player system- VERY skeptical putting magnet very close to phone all the time- "Temporary interference" description for select smartphone compassesOverall, I would give this product 4 out of 5 stars. I'm still very skeptical to use a magnet to mount a GPS functioning phone... If there's a warning that there may be "temporary interference" to particular smartphone's compasses, I'm a bit turned off. You're using your phone for navigation and you don't want ANY interference when you're trying to go somewhere... I'm also very skeptical to even use a car mount that will mount to my CD slot... I get this feeling that it might mess up my CD player. It's also difficult to adjust the car mount to an angle while the phone is in place (would sometimes fall off because it moves away from the magnet). I really like the fact that there aren't many knobs to mount the car mount, which really bothers me with most car mounts these days. It's also great to not have to push any buttons or twist anything to mount the phone. Very simple to use.*NOTE: This product was offered to me for free/at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.
