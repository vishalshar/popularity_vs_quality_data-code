Looks great. I do not have to take my watch off for anything. Good for the office and for working out. Only con is that you need a chronometer if you go running. The withings will tell you how long and how far you ran after you sync but does not replace a chrono.The sleep tracker is very accurate as far as I can tell. The step counter is good. It's actually perfect for me as I do not care if it isn't completely accurate. It at least gives you a comparison point from day to day of how active you've been. The smart phone app is good. My only complaint is that I haven't been able to sync myfitness pal with it.Overall, I love it and just bought another one as a gift.
