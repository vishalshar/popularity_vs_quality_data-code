As an owner of 5+ years of their old system and have been extremely happy with it these collars are a great improvement over the old plastic ones. Although i had to buy a complete new system I didn't mind as i expected the rechargable battery to be near the end of its life to hold  a charge for the  the 5+ years of flawless performance. If the collar part of this ever gets worn from use it can be replaced with a store bought collar put on the receiver. The connection part of the collar is similiuar to most other collars with a plastic push to snap closed. An added feature is when i want to check how close the receiver activates to the boundary wire it is easily visible with the rapid blinking green light as i approach it. My two cocker spaniels are so used to where their boundary is they seldom have to wear the collars but once every couple of months. Thank you petsafe for an outstanding product and one of the best customer service i have used.
