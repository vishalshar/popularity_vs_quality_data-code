This is basically my ideal watch.  It's slim enough that it fits under my dress shirts for work, but also doesn't look super cheap (it doesn't look expensive either, but the black plastic is a nice matte).It's a nondescript time piece that provides some great features:  - useful data on my wrist - the watchface "Timeboxed" allows me to have sun rise-set times, a second time zone, my activity time, my distance walked, the date, and battery life.  - a wide range of apps - I love the Time+ to time short walks during breaks at work, Fitness Break for my workouts, and Solanum, probably the best implementation I've found for the pomodoro technique for my work day.  - an always on display that is easy to see at a wide variety of angles - (super awesome for when you need to sneak a peek at the time during a boring meeting).  - pretty good notification implementation - I wish it would auto-dismiss after 10 second or so, but you can also interact with notifications in some semi-sophisticated ways, so that's neat.  - sturdy build quality - I can wear this to the gym, to the beach, for a swim, to work - which is nice because many of the apps are so useful in both the workplace and during off hours.  - NO HEART RATE MONITOR - this actually makes me super happy.  I find the HR monitors just dig into my wrist and make the watches uncomfortable.  I'll take enhanced comfort over the HR data any day.  I have the frankly incredible Garmin Vivoactive HR but I rarely, if ever, use the HR data.  I wish Garmin did the Pebble thing and offered a non-HR variant of the Garmin Vivoactive HR - exactly the same product, but no HR.I had the Pebble Time Round for a bit, and while I liked that, the physical watch piece looked a bit goofy to me (I had the silver with the white circle around it - it just looked weird) and this Pebble 2 has way more battery life than the Pebble Time Round.  And it's much lighter than the Pebble Time (and presumably much lighter than the Pebble Time 2).  I think you'd be hard press to go wrong with this watch._____________________UPDATE - 16.11.13Two pretty cool things I've discovered:1. The Timeboxed watch face allows me to show one watch face during the day, and one shortly after I wake up.  The one when I wake up shows me how long I slept, how much of that was deep sleep, and what the forecasted high and low is for the day.  That's pretty awesome!2. The watch can preview the next upcoming event in my timeline (which I can sync with my google calendar) up to 30 minutes before the event happens.  This is cool because sometimes I forget that I'm supposed to be somewhere or doing something but the little box pops up on the bottom quarter of the watch face and I almost always take notice.  A simple back-button press dismisses the notice.3. There is an app that allows me to control my music.  I thought this seemed useless until yesterday when I was in a hammock and my phone was not within reach.  I realized I could just pause the music from my watch.  It worked!4. You can reply to texts via voice - this is pretty finicky still.  I think it works best with very short dictated responses - but for a $100 watch, I still think it's pretty cool and I don't have a problem playing around with it to figure out what the optimal response length is.
