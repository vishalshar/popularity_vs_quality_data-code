After using this speaker heavily for the past couple weeks I can finally write a decent review on the product.Pros:Packaging is pretty, the USB cable and aux cord come in a cute little baggy for meGood bass for a small, Bluetooth speaker360 degrees of sound is pretty coolPretty cool on/off guy talking to me (my friends all mock me now whenever I turn it on - maybe this is a con now? hehe)Very sturdy. My friend accidentally kicked it while cliff diving (thankfully it didn't fall into the water) and I hardly noticed a scratch on it.It tells me when the battery is low whenever it's on, and gives me an estimate of how much battery is have left.The microphone actually works!!Cons:These cons may be a bit nitpicky, but I do feel they were definitely significant enough to comment on (i.e. they're the reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5). I also tried to give each con a decent reason why I thought they were cons.The power and Bluetooth buttons are in an awkward position on the speaker. I have to really dig my finger into the crevice in order to turn it on. I would really have liked the power button to be on the top with all the other buttons or at least somewhere more accessible on the speaker.Whenever the battery is low, the speaker will tell me "Battery is low", but it will always tell me at a constant volume. As in, there is always a set volume the 'announcer' will report things to me, instead of the speaker raising/lowering the voice in order to match whatever volume I'm on. I use the speaker at an extremely low volume when I'm sleeping, so when the speaker tells me the battery is low, it sounds like he's yelling, "BATTERY IS LOW" at me when I would rather him whisper it to me instead. This is the biggest reason why I gave the speaker four stars, honestly. Why would you not match the volume I have my music at, Fugoo plsI would like more precise battery estimates. I've only noticed that he will only tell me four options: Battery is full, about 3/4, about half, or low. I'd like it to be precise to at least 10% maybe? Reporting the exact percentage like my iPhone does would be ideal.Maybe a little bit of nonslip grip on the bottom to keep it from sliding around would help it out.Overall, despite my extremely nitpicky reasons (except for my big paragraph), this speaker is definitely still worth the money. Definitely invest in a quality Bluetooth speaker, because the cheaper ones will die on you quickly.
