This anemometer and the associated app makes for interesting and fun expansion of the I-Phone. We frequently hike the California coastal mountains where the weather is unpredictable. The Vaavud anemometer installs in seconds and accurately reports wind speed and other useful metrics, then posts them to the map.  Other hikers in the area using their Vaavud anemometer display their results in the areas they are walking or hiking. Useful if looking for a less windy area to hike.Also useful when sailing the coastal area here in Long Beach and San Diego area
