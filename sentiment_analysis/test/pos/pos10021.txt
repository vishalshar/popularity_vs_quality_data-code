Very happy with this product and exceptionally satisfied with the customer service... Works as described and very straight forward. Only complaint was that the case that holds the collar stays doesn't seem to close easily once opened...Not such a big deal for me since the actual collar stays work perfectly--but when I emailed the inventor about it, he agreed to ship a new package without hesitation.Very happy to support this product, and will definitely buy more as gifts.
