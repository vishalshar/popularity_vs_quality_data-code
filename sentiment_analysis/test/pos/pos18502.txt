We have three cats and they are like our kids. The only bummer about going on vacation for me is leaving them. The Petzi treat cam has given me a great interactive way to check up on them when we are not at home. The cats hear the clicking of the treats getting ready to dispense and they all come running.  You can see the excitement and anticipation on their faces.The video quality is very good and I haven't had many glitches, even over cellular connections.It is easy to set up, and there are always software improvements being made.Thank you, Petzi, for easing my separation anxiety!
