Saw this item and thought I would give it a try as I had bought 5 lbs of imported Parmiggiano-Romano which I wanted to keep fresh.  Have been using it on all my cheeses.  What an improvement over wrapping in plastic wrap!  Easier to wrap and unwrap and the cheese keeps beautifully.  I'm always going to keep some of these around.
