After wearing this around for a week, I really love this case & watch band. My watch feels protected and I've been getting lots of compliments. When I first got my Apple Watch, I was worried with how delicate it felt and didn't like how long it took to put on the sports band. This does the trick. I had no problem installing it and the Digital Crown works great. Yes, sometimes the back of my hand with push down on the crown and trigger Siri, but that's in extreme cases. Overall I would definitely recommend this case.
