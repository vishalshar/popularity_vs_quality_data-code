Hey, gotta admit, was a little skeptical that this fence would work for my cat.  A little training required, per directions... Hey my cat can now go outside and stay in the yard.  Here's a little backround.  My cat Stripes has run free for nearly 7 years.  Recently I discovered he was visiting some distant neighbors and destroying their flower beds, with the help of other cats as well.  A concern for his well-being led me to this product.  We went from a cat whom had only worn a collar once in his life (and tried to kill himself with it) to a cat that now wears his collar, stays in his own yard, and fewer worried nights.  If you would like to know where your cat is... Not wondering when he doesn't show up for dinner...  Definitely get this fence.
