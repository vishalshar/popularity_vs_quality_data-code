I purchased three of these. I have a new MacBook and needed an adaptor for USB devices. They seem to be of very good quality. I have one always with the computer, one at work, and one at home for those miscellaneous USB devices. There's a small LED that lets you know everything is connected correctly. By the way, when using this with the MacBook you'll need to gently press it in all the way. You will hear a click. Otherwise it will be slightly loose with an interrupted signal.
