I've been looking for a long time for a skin care recovery cream for after the sun exposure.  Even I put on sun block, I still get a little sunburn on my face and I am so happy that I found this cream from Amazon.  I live in Southern California and sun exposure is very strong.  My husband and I like to walk on the beach or hike all the time.  I always wear sun block and sun visor right before I walk on the beach or hike.  No matter how often or how much I put sun block on my face, I can still see the sun burn around my cheeks.  So I was looking for a product that works after the sun exposure to recover from the sun damage and this sun recovery cream is exactly what I was looking for.  This recovery cream is not greasy at all like sun block. The cream texture is very smooth and after you apply it on your face it absorbs into your skin right away. I had this product about a month and it works and feels great.  I wear sun block during the day and the sun recovery cream at night.  My skin feels moist and smooth.  It is a great sun recovery cream!
