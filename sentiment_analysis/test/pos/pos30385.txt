This product is amazing!  Highly recommend it to anyone looking to have a phone that will take up less space and still be able to check emails and stream music and videos. Extremely portable, calls sound clear and people hear me well the included headphones have a nice crisp clean sound, overall a top notch product. For the price you cannot beat it!  Using on tmobile it immediately detected the network after me only inserting the SIM card and turning it on! So easy!Fit and finish top notch! Battery back cover and SIM card all fit just right!Also their customer support at posh mobile literally called me within minutes of receiving my email with a question about which micro sd card to buy with it! Customer service between posh mobile and Amazon Five stars all the way!Originally bought as something of a conversation piece but im very impressed with how it actually handles every task I have asked of it so far! Bright screen nice audio and it's adorable.This was the link to the 32 GB card that gives maximum storage and makes this a very impressive phone!https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Class-Adapter-MB-MP32DA-AM/dp/B00IVPU786/
