I am very happy with my leaf urban tracker! I love the fact that it looks like a cool chunky bracelet, and that I can also wear it as a necklace using the included chain. The bracelet was a little challenging to fasten, but now its pretty easy. A little concerning is that it unhooked twice while I was wearing it, which was probably due to the way my wrist was positioned. I am a little worried that if this happens without my feeling it, I may lose my leaf urban.There are many positive qualities to this awesome tracker.  It reminds me to move if I sit too long, and I like the fact that I can listen to some meditation exercises to de-stress.  It accurately tracks my steps, and my sleep, and offers feedback on the type of sleep Ive had.  It syncs to my phone easily, and also to the fitness app pre-installed on my phone. And the best part for me is that it looks like jewelry, not a fitness tracker.
