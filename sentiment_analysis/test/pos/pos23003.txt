I've started using these instead of strings on my running shoes. Using these is much faster because it makes the shoe a slip on. It also makes it possible to add color. These are all the same width and, for me, I need the two laces by the toe shorter, the middle ones are fine, and the two above the arch near the top of my foot need to be longer. This is remedied by lacing techniques. The shortest ones are crossed, the longest ones are two strung together like a square, and the middle ones are just straight across. There are instructions on the package. This is my second pair of elastic laces, and Hickies are theh only ones I have tried, but I like them.
