Looks cool, easy to install, test and set up. I initially set it to the same late fall cycle of my previous controller just to gain confidence in the product.I then spent some time in the advanced set up, looking up manufacturer's specifications of the various sprinklers I have installed and mapping out the areas covered.For the lawn sprinklers, the in/ hour is easy to obtain. The calculation of larger lawn areas was simplified by using the Planimeter iOS App. I have some confidence that the major lawn areas are reasonably accurately specified.I also have 2 emitter zones that cover everything from pine trees to annuals. I specified the plants for the most water hungry varieties and then generalized the in/ hour for the 4 gal/ hour emitter heads. I am not so confident that I got the emitter zones right.Out of the box, I was surprised that there is no freeze delay. I am currently using the recipe in IFFT, but this is primarily designed to avoid system damage. I need to avoid plant damage through spraying water in freezing conditions. I would like to see an option to suspend each zone if the outside temperature is freezing during a scheduled cycle.The system is already saving water. I live in New Mexico and the recent California rain blew in and soaked us. The IRO anticipated the rain and skipped a cycle. We got a good soaking and I thought the next cycle would also be skipped or shortened, but I had to intervene. However, the system is already cutting back on zone times to compensate for cooler weather.I anticipate that I may have to do some tweaking to balance rain and irrigation, but once I am confident that I have the mix correct, I don't think I will have to touch this at all. Priceless.The iOS App is easy to use. I have experienced a couple of bugs, but nothing major.I see this device and the infrastructure as part of a much longer journey. As the community grows and experience is shared, balancing weather with irrigation will just get better. Of course, I could have been more prudent with water using the previous "dumb" controller, but the IRO makes the whole process painless. I am looking forward to a long, water efficient relationship.
