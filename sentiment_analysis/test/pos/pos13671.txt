I received my Eight cover yesterday. I loved the packaging! The white box looks very sleek :) The unboxing experience and installation of the cover was easy enough and the on boarding on the app went smooth. After sleeping on it the first night, I received my sleep data that was quite accurate and detailed. However it would be helpful to get a description of what each piece of data means. My girlfriend love the warming, as sheÂ’s typically cold at night. Definitely a solid product!
