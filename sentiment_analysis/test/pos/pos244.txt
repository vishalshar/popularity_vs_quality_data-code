I used these on a recent flight to Cyprus with a host of technical equipment was bringing for work-  Changed planes a few times to include coming and going through London Heathrow.  Using the application I was able to track my luggage at every point.  Some patience needs to be taken with the update of the application and in some cases you find that you need to "refresh" or reopen the application to get an accurate display of the devices current status in-order initiate a track.  Its important to remember that luggage  is not always moving through a location that provides cellular service.  Plans run at different rates for different periods.  I used a $4.99 for 30 days plan.  This can be applied instantaneously. The Bluetooth proximity feature works flawlessly.  My luggage was to large to utilize the conveyor belt at one location and my bags were brought out at another location.  I was not informed of this and was using the Bluetooth feature to let me know when the bags were coming up the belt.  I quickly realized the bags were behind me about 50ft away at the Airline's baggage counter.  The Bluetooth feature also worked to verify the baggage was aboard the plane prior to take off.  In most cases you can walk to the back of the aircraft and find that you are in enough proximity to get a fix on the luggage.
