Well it didn't work the way i wanted it to, but I figured out a work around. So I wanted this to make it possible to ck the temps at home while I'm at work cause i have heaters connected to Wemo Insight that I want to control. Well didn't work cause the phone has to be in range of Peanut to get any information.WORK AROUND - I uninstalled the app from my phone. Installed it on a no longer used phone connected to wifi at home with bluetooth turned on, logged into peanut acct, connected to the peanut and set temp preferences. Reinstalled the app on my phone and logged into peanut acct. Now i get notifications on my phone when the temp drops below or rises above the preferences I set.IFTTT - Not working for me, at least not yet. I set rules for Wemo to turn on and off at specified temps, but it isn't working. I'll have to play around with this some more.
