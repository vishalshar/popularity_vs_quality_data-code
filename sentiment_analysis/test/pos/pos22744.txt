Since I love Lamas lash tint, I thought I'd try some other products. I use this one before going to bed, so it has plenty of time to soak in. The skin on my hands is thin and starting to show my age (50's) faster than my face. This lotion is not sticky, (which I can not stand), feels nice, and seems to plump the skin on the back of my hands a little. I have tried other higher priced lotions for this purpose, and this  works best for me. It's also nice that it's much more affordable than those "luxury" brands, (that I have used), so I will continue to purchase. My skin is sensitive in general, and this lotion has only helped, never irritated.
