Greatest mug ever!  Well, almost.  This thing really works!!  You can slap the cup with reasonable force and it doesn't tip over.  The secret is the suction on the bottom, and it is effortless to pick up.  I loved this cup so much, it's one of those things that become a great conversation piece, and you immediately start thinking about who else to Gift this item.  I bought 3 more and sent them to different friends.  I wish they came in the double walled insulated thermos style.  I'd pay more for the high quality versions, but this does a pretty good as a regular insulated mug.  Keeps my coffee reasonably hot for 2-3 hours.  I am hoping to find a way of personalizing them for my business and giving them away as promo items.
