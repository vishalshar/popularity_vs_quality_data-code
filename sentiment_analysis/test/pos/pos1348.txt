I have had the light up for a couple of weeks and it works exactly as described and works very well.  The motion sensing has worked great out of the box for me.  Before I purchased the light, I assumed that the way the camera worked was that if the camera sensed motion, that it would THEN begin recording to the cloud.  It's actually better than that.  When it senses motion it records to the cloud footage from BEFORE it sensed the motion (probably about 5 seconds?) and then keeps recording until a minute or two after there is no movement.  The app is very simple but has great options for having the light turn on/off at dawn/dusk, turn on due to motion, or you can set specific times of days for the light to come on and off (and there's a separate weekend option as well).  So far, it's been a 5 star light in that it does exactly what the description says and does it well.  And "just as a light" - the light looks great.  It doesn't feel or look cheap.I'd love for there to be a way to access live footage and recorded clips via a webpage (vs. just the app) in the future and hope the Kuna folks will consider that if feasible sometime down the line (I would even be okay with paying a monthly or annual fee if it was reasonably priced and if I could download clips).  I am very happy with the light/app based on the features provided, so the webpage idea would just be icing on the cake.  At some point, I'm going to add another Kuna light to another entry (maybe there will be a 1080p version at some point).
