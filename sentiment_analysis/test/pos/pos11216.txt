Words alone cannot express the gratitude I have for the founders, management, and employees of Skeeter Nut Free for making products that look and taste normal (read: what my daughters friends eat).As a mother of a 5 year-old with a life-threatening peanut allergy, I live in the kitchen. We make all our meals including breads, ice cream, sauces and snacksonly flour, milk, eggs, meat, and butter comes into my kitchen in a package. Generally, most food that comes out of a package leads to hives that last weeks, or worse, an ER visit.Im happy to bake and cook all the items my kid needs to be nourished AND the fun-stuff similar to what other kids eat. But shes a kid! And feels shes missing out on whatever delicacy exists in those mysterious commercial snack bags her friends eat.So when I take a box of Skeeters mini cookies into her class and the kids choose those instead of their snack package, it is a EUREKA(!) moment that I cannot duplicate in my kitchen.Thank you for these productsthey make for a happy Kindergartner and peaceful mom =)
