These add a great taste to the tap water when using my Soma filter. The packaging did have some issues. Each filter comes in a little bag in which you are supposed to soak the filter in for 15 minutes before using it. The bag mine came in had a puncture hole which made soaking it not really possible in the normal way. The outside packaging was intact so it didn't get damaged during shipping, it left the factory that way. Hopefully the manufacturer fixes this.
