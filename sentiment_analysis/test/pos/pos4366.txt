I really love this device after the trip to England for 2 weeks.  4 different cities including 2 sub-urban and 2 urban cities, GlobalMe performed great with fast to login and getting connected with the network. For the 1Gb package,  it was able to last for the whole trip with ~200mb left that including using google map for walking and directions, some web searching, and making phone calls to local vendors. Advise: follow some online suggestion to turn off certain features on the cell phone so it won't burn data by mistake. I connected only two devices with GlobalMe even though it supports 5 devices. More devices mean more chances of accidentally burn the data,Pros:  - One device for multiple locations. No local SIM required!!  - Fast login and connections to network  - Price for the package is great compare to international plan from mobile companies.  - Looks great (like an iPhone except much thicker of course).Cons:  - Device is little bulky. Glass surfaces on both sides make it easy to crack if drop.  - Wish there's a better user manual to come with the device  - Price is not cheap compare with other portable wifiRecommend: Definitely yes.Update:I was able to do Wi-Fi calling but found out some phone carriers will charge Wi-Fi calling for calls outside of US. Wi-Fi calling is using Wi-Fi not cellular network, why it's cost extra $$ for wi-fi calling overseas. So just beware!!
