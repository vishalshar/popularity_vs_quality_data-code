Bought this kit for my 11 year old couch potato son. It is amazingly got him off the coach the second he opened it for Christmas! He has built a fan, two different styles of remote control cars & a pin ball machine! He loves it & I love that he is not glued to the television with xbox or the computer with youtube. It is truly a great investment for a child.
