This is a super cool Toy. We love it and no, we didn't get a free unit to try. My Son loves it so much that we created a video review of itCheck out the youtube video. just google  search:  "R.E.V air review" by iNathanTo Summarize, the build quality of the car and drone  is so solid for the money and the app works without any glitches on iOS. We tried iPhone 6S and an iPad mini 2 and it works flawlessly.So much fun playing with my son. There is a bit of a learning curve to master the drone skills, if you have never used an RC helicopter or drone, but once you get a hang of it, it's just  a piece of cake.
