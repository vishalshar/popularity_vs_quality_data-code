I used to just leave my phone in my pocket.  However, I just started working as an Uber driver.  So I thought that it would behoove me to always have the phone where I could see--and be secure.  For my first week, I had it propped up in the little tray below the radio of my Ram pickup.  It kept falling.  Now I have this beast!  The suction cup is the perfect size to fit on the top of my radio bezel without using the included disc.  And it's sticking very well!I like that it's right up there in my field of vision because I'm also using Uber's directions (Google Maps).  So it's right there and it's staying there even on these nice Louisiana roads!One-handed operation FTW!  I get in the truck and just place the bottom of the phone on the prong on the bottom then lean it back toward the windshield until the side arms snap into place.  To get it out is also one-handed:  Just pinch the opposite sides of the arms and the arms open up and just drop the phone right into your hand.The opening between the tines of the prong are just big enough for my charger.  So I can leave it charging all day.
