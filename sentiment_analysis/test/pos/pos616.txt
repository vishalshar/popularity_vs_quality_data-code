This is the very best treat puzzle toy I have found.  We have lots of versions, but I like this one best.  It dispenses the kibble slowly, even when your dog has mastered it.  It is SO quiet.  Most of our other food toys are plastic and therefore very loud on our hardwood floors.  It's also very easy to clean.  Holds a cup of my dogs kibble.
