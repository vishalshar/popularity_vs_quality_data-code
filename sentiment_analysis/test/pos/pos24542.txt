I really like the product and the support from the site.  I have 3 that I use and it really does give a good indication of problem areas in the home. My wife has both allergies and asthma and I can literally see her symptoms worsen as the bar graphs go up.The one improvement I'd like to see, and I'm not sure if its more of a router issue with my Linksys router.  But most times when the Awair loses connection it does require for the power cord to be disconnected and reconnected for it to get the wi-fi connection back.  A fix for that would be great.Otherwise this is a 5 star product.UPDATE: 11/22/2016  Just as an update to original review.  The disconnect issue was related to my router and extenders.  Linksys was able to solve the problem with me.  The Awair's now connect flawlessly, I have upgraded from 4 stars to 5.  Thanks also to Awair which reached out to me after reading my initial review.  Happy customer and recommend the product.
