I bought this for my Chihuahua that we adopted. Before we had the in ground fence he would run off and we would have to chase him down the road. Now we dont need to because it keeps him in the yard It only took a few times around the yard and he knew where he could not go. We are so happy we bought it also Its pretty easy to set up.
