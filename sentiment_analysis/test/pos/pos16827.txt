I love love love this product.  I wanted to make my own sealing wax stamp, and didn't want to go through the process and mess of making a plaster mold, etc etc.  The end product is slightly pliable (i.e., it's not rock hard) but it works perfectly for the sealing wax stamp.  I use a sealing wax glue gun to fill my stamp, and then applied it to paper -- and everyone raved.  I may buy more and then sell the wax stamp (it looks similar to the Phantom of the Opera skull stamp, but smaller  - just awesome!)
