Love these mugs, they grip well on any flat surface as long as the surface is clean.When closed, the mug keeps liquids hot for at least an hour or two which is great when you forget your tea or coffee on your desk!My husband had one last year and the transparent outer layer did start to peel off a little around the logo, but it still worked well (you can see the old one in the photo). I have a black matte one from the same brand. It held the test of time better and hasn't peeled off, but I've noticed the silver one has better grip. You can compare the gripping mechanism in the photo.
