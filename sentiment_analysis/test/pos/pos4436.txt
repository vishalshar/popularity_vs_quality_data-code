I was skeptical but saw these advertised and thought I would try them......I love having lots of different cheeses around .....camembert,brie,extra sharp,blue cheese, etc. and wrapping them in plastic wrap did not work.  These bags do work!  And when I finish a cheese I just put another one in until they fall apart!
