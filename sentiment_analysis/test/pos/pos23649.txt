I wrote this comparison because I sometimes wonder what is the best 100 dollar earphone you can find in this price range, and I found it. (Note all the songs and music I listen are in a very high quality file)To start with Shure, I own two of them. One is Shure SE 215 and another one is Shure SE535LTD-JThe Shure SE 535 is come with the very high price. So, it definitely better at bass and high frequency. When you listen, you will hear that the bass will come like a ball that will hit your ear. You can find better review on this in somewhere elseThe 100 dollars shure SE 215 is a pretty good one. It has a decent sound stage. The build quality is perfect. The sound is very very good. However, it is too dark for me. Sometimes I listen to the classical music. The heavier instrument sound (such as Cello) can cover most of the lighter sound instrument. This can be good if you like to listen the music that doesn't need to hear every instrument. It also better on the brand "shure" and the design of it. The earphone stay within your ear. You can run with it, and it look cool too.Now we come to the 1MORE Triple Driver In-Ear Earphone.My first impression of it is it can separate each of the  individual individual instrument surprisingly great. I did not expect the separation this good. It very close to listen in the ATH M50X.  The sound of it is not dark. The bass is there but not that much. They said that it is better for your ear because the bass sound can hurt your ear if you listen it in a long period of time. The best of all is the sound stage. It has a large sound stage. You will feel like you listen in a dome or something that you know it there. The build quality of the earphone is great because it made out of aluminum, unlike Shure that made out of hard plastic. Although the Shure cable seen more durable, I see no point of having a bulky cable. Overall, it worth the price. I don't know how they can keep price at this low. They can charge like 200 bucks, and I still buy it.To conclude,  1 more Triple Driver is the best 100 bucks earphone you can buy right now.
