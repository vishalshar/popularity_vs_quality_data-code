Got my GhostBed yesterday for our daybed in the living room, fell asleep on it last night, didn't want to get up this morning. I think that says it all. This is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on. The video is accurate, the bed expands within a minute or two and is ready to go. I love it that it is rolled up and comes in a box. We are unable to get a king up our steps so we have been struggling with 2 xl twins strapped together, what a pain. We will be ordering a king GhostBed for upstairs and are very excited about not falling in "the hole" between the mattresses or having to mess with the strap that holds them together albeit poorly. Also got a free GhostBed tee shirt!
