I like the size.  Fits in my pocket or clips to my belt loop.  I have it with me when I'm cycling, running, hiking and all my activities.  I think it's loud enough to startle and hopefully scare away an attacker and draw attention when needed.  If you read the label quickly, you might think that it comes with a trip wire.  It does not, it says it has the hooks to attach one if you'd like.  I'm happy with it, it gives me a little more sense of security.
