Our middle dog (in age and size) came to us as a morbidly obese 9 year old.  Within a year we had him almost down to his goal weight (lost 40% of his starting body weight); but, a few months ago he became ill and was diagnosed with pancreatitis.  Our vet told us it can be caused by either bacteria or too much fat in the diet.  While I believe it was bacterial (cleared up with antibiotics) she inisted that fat in his diet needed to be reduced.  Since he was already on a senior low-fat dog food, that meant cutting back training treats.  And this dog still needs a lot of training.  I found these on Amazon and he loves them.  He focuses as much with these as did with the "high value" treats I used before.  The only negative I found is that they tend to crush and turn to powder, which can be a problem if you stuff them into your pocket.  This was easily remedied by wearing shirts with loose pockets for training sessions.
