BEST THING I EVER RODE!!!!!!!!! NOTHING ELSE IS AS THIS FUN & EASY TO USE!!!!! I've used it in some of the toughest terrain and its still roaring through the streets! I use it all day, every day. I love it!!! its better than a car to me there's no gas, no license and nothing stopping me from going on the street or side walk! I can take into class and charge and I can take it into stores with me and places to eat! when I go out with my friends I let them ride it and they love using it !
