The best tech support you will ever get from a tech company. In fact, prior to Almond 2015 I had the original Almond for which the warranty has long expired. Securifi provided me tech support over the phone for an out-of-warranty device. Most amazingly, when I called it was outside business hours for their support, so I hang up. A couple of hours later a tech called me up to my caller ID to see if I needed any help. Quite remarkable.As for the Almond 2015 - an awesome device. I use it as a range extender rather than a router and its the best extender I found, after trying several others. The 2015 model supports home automation too. They even threw in a surprise 'one more thing' in the package (yeah, they actually wrote 'one more thing' on the box..) - a Peanut. Its their wireless power monitoring switch. You sync it with the Almond, and control it via an iPhone app. I hooked it to a floor lamp and now I can turn the light on and off via my phone. Super cool.One caveat - the Almond firmware was a bit buggy and I had to call tech support and get a new firmware emailed to me to resolve the issues. But given the awesome tech support as mentioned above it was a breeze to resolve.
