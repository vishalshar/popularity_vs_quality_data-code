These rollers are great and do exactly what they say they will do: create soft curls and great body. I don't use the handle. I dry my hair till almost completely dry, then section off the amount of hair I want to use with each roller. When I put the hair around them, I use the shaking motion they suggest, so the rollers are snug to the scalp. With the hair dryer on low-hot, I heat the rollers. I then apply my makeup. When I am finished, I remove the rollers, brush through my hair, and I'm good to go. My hair is short, but I do have a lot of hair, so I did buy the small rollers, too. The combination of medium and small rollers is perfect.
