My daughter wanted a fitbit, like mom, so it was great to find this Sqord which comes in her favorite color (purple), operates on a battery (not relying on her to remember to charge it), and is designed for kids with an online game. We are just getting started with it but it was easy for me to set up and we like that the app has a bunch of friends and happy music when we launch it.  So far, she has been checking what gives her points - walking to school for example - and how she can rack up the points. I don't think she realizes it's good for her!
