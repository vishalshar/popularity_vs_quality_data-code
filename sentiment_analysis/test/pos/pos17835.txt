UPS borked my shipping on this one, but that wasn't a Nomad problem, just a statement on the state of UPS's practices in general.As for the product, it is awesome! Works as advertised, and it's saved my butt already when I was running low on juice.  I'd highly recommend pairing this with an external battery pack, like from Zero Lemon.Oh! And remember, this isn't a heavy load bearing clip!Great job on this product guys.
