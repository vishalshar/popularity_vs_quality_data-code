I was disappointed that this wasn't a roll of paper that I could cut to size. Instead it's individual sheets. However it's great quality and works well. Undoubtedly the error is in my lack of attention to the product description. I wish you would create a continuous roll vesion so I don't have to use more than I need. I would definitely buy it again.
