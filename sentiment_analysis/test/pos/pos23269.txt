Day 3 into playing with my CoWatch and I'm having fun!  my CoWatch has a nice, big round dial, but it's not to big for my wrist.  I love the full color display and the touch screen responsiveness is great.  The music app works with my Spotify and inTune.  I can reply to messages via voice which turns into text.  most of the typing must be done with my phone, however, when I was trying to enter my wifi password, it allowed me to use a keyboard on the watch itself.  The only reason they are getting a four star versus five star review is not really fair to CoWatch - I am hoping to see more software updates which allows for further customization of the watch (they are pushing out software updates now which address some requests by consumers).  It's a beautiful watch and I'm very glad to own one.  **if you look at the pictures and notice that the screen looks like it's peeling in the bottom left, it's because I put the protective screen wrong!  CoWatch's great customer service team is sending me another one even though it's my fault**
