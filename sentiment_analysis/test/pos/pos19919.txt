I got this kit for my epicurious 11-year-old's birthday. She loved it...until, following the instructions on the box, nothing grew. Bummer. But then I read all these Amazon reviews and tried soaking the mushroom package again--this time for about 24 hours. Put it in the window and voila! A bumper crop of fabulous mushrooms. We haven't tried for a second crop yet, but will. And even if we don't get one, this was great fun. I think you have to just be willing to experiment a little bit until you get the dampness right. Then they grew like CRAZY! Four stars for not working immediately, five for the ultimate result!
