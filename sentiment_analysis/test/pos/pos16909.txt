I believe that I got my first iPod back in 2006, and up until about a month ago I never, never, NEVER wore earbuds. Besides finding them uncomfortable to the point of being painful, the stupid things never stayed in my ear. Because I am typically moving around when listening to music and not sitting motionless, that made them pretty worthless. So, for the past 10 years I've been wearing over-the-ear style headphones.Recently, however, I began wishing that I could control the music on my iPhone without having to get it out. I was unable to find a pair of over-the-ear headphones with that capability (probably because basically only 3 brands bother making them anymore...) and in desperation decided to give the earbuds that came with my iPhone 6s a try. I should say, the new style of the Apple earbuds are definitely a VAST improvement over the old ones. Because of the more narrow shape, they fit a lot more comfortably in my ears and don't make me want to yank them out and throw them in the trash after wearing them for five minutes. They still have the problem, however, of not staying in my ears if I move around.I think it was by chance that I found these "Earhoox" while trying to find a new option for headphones. Add this to the list of products I didn't know existed but have made my life infinitely better/easier. They work so perfectly--they fit securely on the earbuds and super snugly in my ear (in fact, I don't even really think about them when I'm wearing them). I'm able to walk around now without worrying about my earbuds falling out every 10 feet.Two sets of Earhoox ship with your purchase, which I'm excited about. I've only been wearing them for about a month and a half now, I think, so I don't know how long they'll hold up, and I'm pleased that I'll have a backup pair in case anything happens to the first one.
