I seriously need this device! I have 1 set of car keys that I misplace constantly. I have set up an account and can find my keys from the account or  phone. In fact on several occasions I have used my Tracker on my keys to find my phone. It works both ways. Just know its a neat device and as any neat device you must check on it occasionally but nothing more than pairing a Bluetooth headset etc. Now for me its an insurance policy and I really feel safer with the TrackR on my key set than when I don't. I'm considering buyin more for holiday gifts. They are neat gadget and people love gadgets for Christmas!
