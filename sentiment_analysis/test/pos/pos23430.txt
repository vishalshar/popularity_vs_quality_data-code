This thing can control any device. It was easy to setup and works perfectly. I love the fact that I only have one remote and it's on my phone. This company actually has good customer service as well. I sent an email for a small issue and they got back to me that day and we fixed the issue with my fire tv linking up. There are other products out there that do similar stuff but I love this one.
