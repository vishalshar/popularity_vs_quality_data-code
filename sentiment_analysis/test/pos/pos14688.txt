This microwave is a beast! With the default settings, I don't recommend using the popcorn button. I was able to cook a standard bag in only 1 & 1/2 minutes. One thing I really like is the sleek grey color of the interiorFarberware FMWO11AHTBKB Classic 1000W Microwave Oven, 1.1 cu. ft., Stainless Steel. For once I can cook something without my microwave looking filthy inside after each use.
