Wow!  Super-cool smartphone mount!  Only one hand is needed, so if you only have one arm, this smartphone mount will be simple and easy for you to operate.  I totally prefer this to a magnetic mount for a couple reasons:  1) my wife's phone is set up for wireless charging, and the metal plate that you need to put in your case disrupts the ability to charge; and 2) this securely HOLDS your phone, so you get no twisting and turning of your phone like you do on a magnetic mount.  I've tried those magnetic mounts, and every single one of them cannot hold my phone straight, my phone will always tilt one way or another because of the vibrations in the car.  This mount keeps it straight each and every time.When you place your phone in the cradle, the button on the back of the cradle gets depressed and the two arms clamp and hold your phone nice and securely.  When you want to take your phone out, you just pinch the two levers behind the cradle together and the cradle opens up and you're able to easily grab your phone with the same hand.  Definitely a super-cool smartphone holder, and it is engineered to impress anyone that steps into your vehicle.
