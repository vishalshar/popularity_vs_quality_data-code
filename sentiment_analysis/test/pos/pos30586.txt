I really love this tracker.  It is very accurate and does an excellent job of locating your pup!  In addition, the feature of tallying your dog's active minutes is pretty cool.  Actually made me want to exercise just so I can get my pup's minutes up.  I also have been using it to remind me when to give her meds. (She was just spayed)  I do wish it was a tad smaller and came in different colors.  I also think it should be slightly cheaper for the subscription.  It is 9.95 a month. I  went ahead a got a chip since one can never be to careful.  Overall, a cool lil device.
