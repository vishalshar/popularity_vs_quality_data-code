I bought a his/her Apera fast pack and this has been my life-saver. I have so much stuff to bring to work (an extra change of clothes, my laptop, my books for off-site auditing. I love it. I pack it a LITTLE tight I have a hard time getting my laptop in and out if I over-do it on my gear but overall it is a wonderful bag that i'm SO excited I bought .Lots of hidden pockets. Would highly recommend.
