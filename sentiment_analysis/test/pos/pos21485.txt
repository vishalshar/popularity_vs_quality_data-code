I've been using Thrive Energy Scrub for more than 3 months now and I was very happy to be able to buy it online. I love the coffee grains and the medicinal plants, their smell wakes me up in the morning and I really feel that I'm washing my face with a scrub that is healthy for me. After using it, my skin is soft and velvety clean. Basically, it smells god, it moisturizes you skin, it just has the perfect roughness and on top of that you' re supporting rural farmers and local entrepreneurs from Costa Rica!
