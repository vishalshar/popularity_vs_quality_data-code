The flavors are ok, but for the price, I can get a big container of butter flavored popcorn salt that'll last much longer.If you've got a popcorn lover in your family, this might make a nice gift.There's also the option to try a lot of flavors before you go out a buy a full size jar or seasoning you might not like.It was shipped with a couple extra little packets of seasoning that could be easily brought into a movie theater without paying $5 for their mini jar of seasoning; if that's your thing.
