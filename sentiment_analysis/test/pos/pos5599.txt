Great product. They are big enough to give about 4-5 wipes. If you haven't tried these you definitely should. Depending on the type of poop you have you don't always feel clean after wiping with just toilet paper. These are great for those situations where you feel you need a shower after that horrible explosion that left the bowl looking like a Mr. Hankey warzone.
