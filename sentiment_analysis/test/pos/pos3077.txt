Day one of using this product (Will update review as time goes on). Really really great quality headset. The microphone is better than most headsets I've used. The sound is clear and crisp with the amazing option of having more bass (Which is pretty bassy (On par with my Skullcandy Crushers which are bass masters). If you don't enjoy bass, no problem, easy accessible button changes your bass between three modes, normal, bass, or treble and bass ( I like option two the most ). The range is good enough for me, can be used comfortably with no degradation of sound or microphone quality for about 30 feet in my experience, with a few walls separating me and my computer. What's next? Comfort. It's a very comfortable headset, doesn't squeeze my head at all and doesn't feel like it's going to be sliding off anytime soon.Just a couple of downsides. Not a huge fan of the massive logo on the top of the headset, seems a bit intrusive. And why doesn't this product list that it's compatible with PC? That's all I've been using it for and it works just fine. I feel as if the company is losing a lot of sales not listing PC as a compatible partner for this headset.Overall, very nice headset for the price. Sturdy, comfy, great sounding in both mic and audio. Will update review if anything happens/opinion changes at all.
