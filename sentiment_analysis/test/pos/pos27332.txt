This is excellent dog food.  Our dogs have been eating this for 3 years now and they are fit, trim healthy and shiny!  Cannot beat the quality and the price!  It was recommended to us by the woman who fosters stray dogs/pups before they are adopted.  Kee Holdings Inc. does a great job at maintaining inventory, keeping the price right and delivering on time and in good condition.
