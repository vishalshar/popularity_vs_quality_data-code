I first watched the review for this charger on YouTube and I was totally impressed. Now  that I have purchased one for  myself, I have proven that is was worth purchasing. The charging is fast and reliable. The car locator feature is very accurate. It also monitors the rate at which your car battery is charging and will alert you in the event your battery is low. The is compact utility device and I am loving it. I will definitely encourage my friends to go get one. So it provides Fast Charge, Monitors your Battery Lever and it locates your car. Very nice.
