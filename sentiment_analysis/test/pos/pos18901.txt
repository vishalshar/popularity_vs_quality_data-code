This is my new fav go-to gift for recent moms.  Its adorable, practical, and a bit unexpected. Im a notorious book gifterbabies included.  And recently, every inscribed board book has had a set of Spunis attached.  If you're looking for something unique to give without causing groans for going off registry.... Spuni 'em!!  I mean, come on not only do they look sleek, they are DESIGNED TO MAKE FEEDING BABIES EASIER (by peeps at MIT. Which you just gotta love. I mean... thats insta' street cred!) Tie em to the bow and suddenly your gift is that much more amazing. And appreciated.  Love em.
