I first tried this product roughly one year ago, and I have since repurchased-- I will likely continue purchasing from this brand as long as I am able to. This is by far the best natural deodorant I have ever tried.As far as scents go, I have only ever used "Thyme and Lemongrass" from this brand, so that's the only one I can speak for-- but boy, oh boy, does it ever smell good. It is very subtle and has never clashed with any of the perfumes and body lotions that I use. I would describe it as an earthier, more natural version of those lemon-scented hand wipes packets that some food trucks hand out. The scent is gender neutral and is 100% natural-- the fragrance comes from essential oils. Additionally (and this is important), scent is not offensive to those with fragrance sensitivities-- I am extremely sensitive to fragrances (fragrances often give me headaches, runny nose, and general nasal congestion), but this scent has never bothered me in the slightest.The deodorant itself works extremely effectively, and though it is not an anti-perspirant, it manages to keep my sweating at bay. The "paste" aspect of the deodorant took me some getting used to, but I have grown to prefer it to traditional stick deodorants. For one, paste makes it much easier to manage how much is actually being used at a time-- I was actually shocked to find that this tiny 2 oz jar of deodorant lasted me roughly eleven months. The paste is also much easier to apply than I thought it would be; I just use my fingers and wash my hands afterwards (it washes off easily).I cannot recommend this product enough. Seriously, you have to try it.
