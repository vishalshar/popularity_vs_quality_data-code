I have been drinking DW Snoozeberry nearly every night for almost 3 years now. I had frequently turned to "P.M." pain relievers and Benadryl to make me drowsy, as I don't easy drift off at night. They do make me drowsy, but it's an uncomfortable drowsy. I just don't feel well when I turn to those OTC options, and they leave me foggy in the morning and not fully functioning. Then I was given some free samples of Dream Water. Having been a daily user of energy shots, I was curious if a "down" shot would be as potent as the "up" shots are. At least for me, Dream Water makes me drowsy, and it's a comfortable drowsy. If I am laying in bed watching something, then take one, I feel noticeably tired within minutes. It's not an overwhelming felling like over the counter or prescription sleep aids, it's very subdued but present. I would describe it more as a relaxed/peaceful sensation more than drowsy/can't keep my eyes open.The only drawback as most people claim is the price per bottle, but they seem to be getting more reasonable on full box retails. I have a hard time falling asleep without taking one now though so I can't argue with price all that much. And like anything you take, if  you take it daily for weeks on end it loses it's potency, so I suggest taking a few days a week off, or 3 weeks on 1 week off, etc. So grab a Dream Water, fire up an ASMR video and get busy sleeping.
