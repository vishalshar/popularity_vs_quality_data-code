I originally bought this Superfood for my 9 year old Golden Retriever, who has Fibrosarcom Cancer in her sinus cavity. I was hoping to stop or slow down the tumor growth. I can't say it help with that but, OMG she is doing so good after two weeks on it. She sleeps less, hangs out with us and seems to be more peppy. I was told by my Vet that she has never seen a dog with this type of Cancer live more then 6 mo. She is going on 7 mo. and is doing really good. I will definitely keep her on this Superfood and giving her all my love until I have to saty goodbye to her!
