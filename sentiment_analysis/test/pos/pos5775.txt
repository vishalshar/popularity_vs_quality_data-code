Great source of vitamins, I bought it because it was recommended by my college. It has a nice berry taste but sometimes you can taste the fish oil, which isn't bad imo. I bought this specifically because it had fish oil in it as it has a lot of health benefits. Sadly I don't think I can keep buying this product every month because of how expensive it is compared to other multivitamins, maybe when I graduate and get a real job hah.
