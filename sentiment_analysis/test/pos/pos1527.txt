Great no-tie laces. They fit me perfectly but this could be a tad snug for some. The reason I'm giving this a 4 star and not a 5 is that I have only had them for a day so I'm not sure how well these will hold up over time and am hoping they will not break or snap as some reviewers have stated. In the first photo, I used 3 laces and looped them the regular way. In the second photo, I used 4 and looped them the loose way (per instructions). The third photo illustrates how I looped the loose way.
