Maybe I'm spoiled by my nicer and stronger Nexus 6P, but this phone is kind of slow, lol. But I guess with only 512mb of RAM that's what you get.Other than that for the price, it works well. I just needed it to cover an extra line I had with AT&T and it's seemed to have worked well so far.I've given the phone since to my little sister and it works perfectly for her, as a teen. I liked that it's 4G and still able to run all the apps she needs. I like the color of the rose gold and the feel of it is nice. I also liked that it includes the case and screen cover, that was extremely nice that they include accessories. Overall not a bad phone. For this price range it's pretty good.
