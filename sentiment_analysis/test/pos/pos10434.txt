Love these to store drinks in mason jars. Easy to use but the seal can leak and the cap doesn't always stay closed. I wouldn't use them to safely transport liquid without spilling or leaking but it works great to use Mason jars as storage pitchers or drink from. I will definitely find a lot of uses for them.
