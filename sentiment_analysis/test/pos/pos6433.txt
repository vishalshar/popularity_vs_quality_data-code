I have a 65-70 lb, 10 year old, female pit mix. She has been absolutely TERRIBLE to walk. Her entire life. She pulls so bad that she throws up white foamy stuff (repeatedly) and I always come back from a walk with her feeling more sore and frustrated than when I left. For 3 years now she has been excluded from walks because of this! I have tried martingale collars, back clip harnesses, head collars, etc. and they either didn't help or she wouldn't walk in them and would constantly fight to get them off. I actually bought this for my other dog, but it was too large; before sending it back I thought I would take a chance and try it on my female. Let me tell you... This obviously won't work for EVERY dog, but I am FINALLY able to take MY female for a walk again!! She doesn't pull at all in it and it has made it so walking with her is actually enjoyable! A first in TEN YEARS!. I am so glad that dumb luck helped me finally find something that works for her; we finally live in an area where the dogs can be walked daily and I plan on taking full advantage of this!
