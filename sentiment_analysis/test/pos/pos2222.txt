Wow, this set up is dead simple.  The instructions struck me as a little skimpy, but they ended up being all I needed.  You plug in the powerline adapter (see comment below), you hook the water station wires into the Blossom box, you plug in that box, and then you sync the box to your router/home wifi system.HERE IS ONE THING I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHEN I ORDERED IT  How many plugs do you need and where do they plug in?  My installation is outside and I only had one available plug in my backyard, so I tried to understand but could not find answer before ordering.  Answer is you need two plugs - one for the box that plugs in wherever you install it.  For me this is the backyard.  And a second plug for the powerline adapter which has to be plugged in next to your router and NOT IN A POWER STRIP.  For many people, myself included, dedicating a non-power strip plug next to router is kind of a big deal.  Lots of stuff plugged into computer area, and power strips already daisy chained.  So just know that up front.  The upside is all competitor products rely on wifi and, as my experience showed with competitor product, that does not work for everyone, depending on where your box is, strength of signal, etc.Second Installation Tip - when you go to sync it after plugging everything in, it asks for a number on the back of the Blossom.  Well, that is not very handy because I already installed and did not want to have to un-mount it.  But in the app I asked for help and it pointed out that the sync code is also in the little installation book on a sticker.  So you can use that and not have to check the back of the Blossom box for this code.I haven't played with the interface yet, but I wanted to report back that the hardest part of smart water controller is getting it to connect to the internet, and the powerline feature on this model works like a charm.
