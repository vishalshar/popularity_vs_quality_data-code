Canary keeps getting better with new software updates. Its most useful when I am gone from the house for a trip. It gives piece of mind being able to check on the house and pets. Camera is clear enough during night and day. Temperature and humidity monitoring appears to be accurate. I am not sure how useful the air quality measurement really is as far as giving clear information.
