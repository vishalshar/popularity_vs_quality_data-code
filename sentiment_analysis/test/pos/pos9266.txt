Pro:I love this thing, it looks sharp and does everything you want it to do. I had another tracker before, but it had terrible battery life and a lot of limitations on what I wanted it to track. This one so far has none of these issues. I also like how it tracks data throughout time so that you can see how you're doing.Con:It was a little small on me (admittedly I do have giant wrists) and the band is rubber, so I recommend replacing it. I got a nice adjustable stainless steel band that was a little bigger and nicer looking, and I'm pleased as punch.Considered knocking it down to four stars because, come on guys, it would be easy to put a nicer band on this thing as opposed to the flimsy whatever that comes with it. In spite of that though, even including the cost of the new band, it is still a great value for the combination of style and functionality. Activity tracker that you can wear into a board room without looking ridiculous? That's what I was looking for, and I got that and more.
