I bought this to use with a "newly" purchased Amazon Fire HDX 8.9 (2014 4th Gen) that has a slim port.  One thing I did not like about the newer fire tablets besides their screen resolution is the lack of the ability to have a direct HDMI wired connection.  I connected this analogix adapter to my fire tablet and used an hdmi cable I had lying around to connect to my Samsung 2014 1080p smart tv.  The picture and audio seem excellent.  The adapter works well.I can not comment on the adapter's ability to pass 4k, not there yet myself.The adapter seems sturdy and well built.  I am hoping it will work for me for a while.  I will be on the look out for other slim port enabled devices in the future.  Not the be all and end all for choosing a device but I like this capability when I am travelling.  Most tvs now have an hdmi port not many have casting/mirroring capability and compatibility with my devices.
