This will be a great addition to my mac air- which has an ssd.  Who can't use more storage?  I am thrilled that the prices on flash memory is starting to drop even further. 64 gigs is a not of space. As a photographer that shoot raw 24 meg files I expect to be filling these babies up. I believe I can also take all my other flash drives and combine them onto this one. No more looking for "that drive"
