I purchased these for my husband as he always finds nice 'delicates' for me. Initially, he chuckled and commented 'You've got to be kidding!'.  All I have to say is these are ALWAYS in the laundry. Every week. I believe he (and he has admitted this) finds them to be his favorite. Why shouldn't men be comfortable in their jeans. Plus, I think they look sexy. ?
