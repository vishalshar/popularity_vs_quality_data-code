Very versatile Canary Flex allows lots of placement options in or out of my home.  Camera provides great coverage.  Once the weather improves, we will place this in our outdoor landscaping in front of the house so we can see who's arriving, especially in the summer when we are at the pool.  For the winter, will be using this model to monitor location of previous water leakage indoors.
