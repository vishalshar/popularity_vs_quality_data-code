It's a nanny cam plus laser pointer and walkie-talkie.  I don't like having surveillance in my house, but for long days away it's helpful to check in on Fido in case assistance needed.  Mixed results with laser pointer.  Hard to control on some screens, and, some pets just not into it.  However, for the video and communication purposes, I could see this product as being extremely useful for caregivers of seniors or those with special needs who want an affordable way to communicate with family and check in on how they are doing.  Yes, the audio is grainy and has a delay of a second or two, but it works.  For basic monitoring purposes, I don't see any reason to spend more money on such a device.  Plus this one had a good aesthetic and it was easy to install.  You download an app, then sync with the plugged-in Cube.  I had a wifi timeout on 1st try or 2, but that was more to do with my service provider than the product. The app let me know status of installation and worked as expected once completed. I recommend Petcube.
