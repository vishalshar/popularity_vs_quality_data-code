After a long walk in the sun or a hard workout in the gym, the one wipe that comes in a well-sealed envelope (meaning it will ride fine in yourcluttered gym bag) does a good job and giving me a mini-shower on the go.  I prefer to wash this off when I'm home though.  That's because Ihave very sensitive skin.  Glad that so far, no reaction.  I even use hand wipes regularly that contain this solution of anti-bac.
