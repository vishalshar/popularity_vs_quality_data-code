My 6 yr old loves all of the Oslo sets and she was very excited about this one. GREAT SET! She loved taking the pizza orders and doing the math to accept payments. There are modes for "junior" and regular play. She started on junior mode but quickly figured it out and went to the regular store play.The day at the pizza shop starts with a delivery of pizza ingredients and shows you how much you spent in goods. Then you take pizza orders and as you put the toppings on the pizza you have to pay attention to the customers reactions to ensure customer satisfaction. Once the pizza is built, you slide the pizza to the right like you are sliding it into the oven then you can take more orders or process payments. Showing the pizza go into the oven on screen as you are physically sliding the play pizza to the right is an awesome tough. You can see the queue of customers waiting to order and to pay so the user has to decide which customer to take care of. For payments the user flips the board over to process payments. It shows what the customer pays and what they owe, the user has to do the simple math on how much change they receive. Once all orders and payments are processed for that "day", the user can see what they made, cost of goods sold and their profits. Profits can be used to enhance their store. Great "game" to teach a lot of good lessons while kids just think they are playing.I think it's a great tablet add on that allows for parent interaction to work with the child but it's also simple enough for a 6 year old to play it independently.Wonderful game and I can't wait for Osmo to keep coming up with more great hits!
