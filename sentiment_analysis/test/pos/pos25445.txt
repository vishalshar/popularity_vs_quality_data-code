Excellent product. Worth the money. It's best feature is the accuracy and (nearly haptic) impact of it. Please don't buy based on YouTube videos like I did. Yes, they are exciting reactions but too much so. You hear the pack in every video which is the sound of the reviewer blowing the speaker in the pack by putting intensity to max. Yes, that feeling is sensational but the distortion of it kills the experience (and speaker). The beauty of this peripheral is the integration with the headphones or PA and resulting bolstering of what you hear (and feel). I keep my knob at quarter turn but put the volume past clip on iPhone (only way to get good volume out of my pro cans without amp). I just love this thing. It grows on you. At first I was like yeah it's a vibrating pad, but no. You can discern the kicks from sub bass. Snares pop. I feel like I'm sitting my back against the sub at a rave. My only negs are too small straps for anyone 6' wanting to fit it snuggle against contour of your back. Wish it had built in headphone amp. Otherwise already looking forward to whatever M3 is!
