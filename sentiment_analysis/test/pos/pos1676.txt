I love this product! We used it in place of sugar, and could not tell the difference. This product outshines the others BECAUSE it is made of birch (not corn), it's non-GMO, and it's made in the USA. Many xylitol products that "claim" they are organic are made out of corn, and sourced out of China.....GROSS!
