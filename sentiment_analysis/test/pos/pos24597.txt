Osmo is a really great way to get the kids involved in an iPad game physically rather than just a game on the touch screen.At first, my 3.5 year old got confused how to move the physical pieces around because she was used to playing on the screen.  With Osmo she can learn to relationship between the flat screen and a physical object.Osmo allowed her to understand how to map the physical placement of the tangram shapes to mirror the shapes on the screen.  I loved that because I feel it gives a child a better understanding of the physical world.  She then went on the play the Junior Word game which was great.  It helped her sound out letters and figure see how the entire word is spelled.  We have yet to try the world building game.The kids love the colors.  The wonderful sounds the games make when you get a correct answer.  I hope you can come up with more games.  Connect the dots, tic tac toe, hangman could all be good ones.  We would love to see one where they could learn to write out Mandarin characters in the correct stroke pattern.
