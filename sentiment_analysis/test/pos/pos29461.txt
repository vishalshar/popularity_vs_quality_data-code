So far so good. I could not put one in the very top holes of my shoes because I could not get my foot in. I have no issues with my shoes staying securely in place. Had one issue with the top one coming undone with I put my shoe on (Left Foot). It has since stopped, I guess I learned how to put on my shoes on better without stretching them too much. :) I would recommend.
