I travel East to West Coast and back each week.  It is nice to know that I can plug in and power up whenever my flight has no outlets or the airport plugs are all in use.  Folks have seen me plug in my laptop on my 6 hour flight and are amazed ... I've even let a few row-mates plug in for a quick charge.Great product.
