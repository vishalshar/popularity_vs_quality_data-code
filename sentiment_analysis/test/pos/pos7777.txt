I can't say enough good about the Quad Lock for Bike (and the Sports Armband). The bike mount was easy to install on my Jamis earth cruiser, in just a few minutes. I used both the plastic strips and the elastic bands. The mount is firmly attached. The iPhone case attaches to the bike mount so easily - yet incredibly securely. I assure you, once your iPhone is clicked on the bike mount, it is not going anywhere. No amount of jarring, from small potholes to riding off of a curb onto the street, has ever made the phone come off, and I've been using it almost daily for nearly a year.  My bike is basically my car - I live in downtown Savannah, GA, a great town for biking. I ride a lot, to everything I do. What makes this bike mount even better is that I also use the Quad Lock sports arm band, as I run 3 miles a day, 3 times a week. Same simple click and lock using the same iPhone case.  As far as the iPhone case from Quad Lock goes: I thought I wouldn't like it as much as the very slim iPhone case I had. I don't like a bulky case. I thought I'd be taking the Quad Lock case on and off and using it only as needed. It turns out this Quad Lock case is almost as thin as the case I had - so much so that I have never taken the Quad Lock case off my iPhone, I love it. Quad Lock is such a well thought out product that works perfectly.
