This is my first water filter pitcher. I bought it based on looks, and I'm glad I got it. Immediately I could tell my water tasted better. I don't know exactly what is being filtered out, but I like the taste much better. The pitcher pours very smoothly and is easy to manage - no spills it you have the filter and top inserted properly. Have had this for a couple of weeks now, and so far, I'm very happy with it. I'm also glad to be able to buy something made here in the USA - a rarity these days.
