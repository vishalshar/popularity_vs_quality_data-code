Love these chips. My wife is a coconut freak and doesn't like them (I bought them for her). I am not a huge fan of coconut products, but do like Almond Joy and Mounds. These chips taste like that (minus the chocolate of course). I am happy the wife didn't approve. I think they are delicious and am now subscribing to get them on a regular basis.
