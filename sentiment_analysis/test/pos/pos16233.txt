I haven't used the lunch box yet but my daughter is trilled to have her new OmieBox lunch box. She likes the color and style. She said it is a cool lunch box. I hope the thermos will work good as my daughter likes warm food. I will write another review upon the full use of the lunch box. However, I am very satisfied with the design of the lunch box. The size is perfect for the little kids and love the concept of having a removable thermos.
