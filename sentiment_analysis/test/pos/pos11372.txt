Great little collar. We purchased this collar to go with our sport dog fence, we have a big dog and a small one and didn't think the little guy could handle a standard collar since the correction would be too high. Once we got him trained with the collar he loved it, we were able to leave him outside longer and he respected the boundary and now spends hours relaxing and sunning himself around our large yard.When purchasing this product we read the reviews and were concerned about the negative ones regarding battery life, but we have several other pet safe products that are great quality so we took a leap of faith and it worked out great. So far the battery is still going strong and we purchased and have been using the collar daily for 6 months. The battery needs to be twisted in fully to be "on" but If you twist it back a quarter turn it disengages the battery and effectively turns the collar "off" I'm pretty sure the company does not support doing this, but it has saved our battery life since we only turn the collar "on" when we put it on our dog.
