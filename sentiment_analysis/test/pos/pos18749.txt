I got this as a gift for my sister and she loves it.  We've purchased Henry's Humdingers before and this is one of her favorite flavors.UPDATE:  I frequently make sweet & spicy carrots.  This time instead of using butter, cyenne pepper and honey I used only Henry's Humdingers Grumpy Grandpa.  I put foil on a cookie sheet, put all my cleaned baby cut carrots on the foil.  I put a little salt and pepper on them and then I used a couple of tablespoons of Grumpy Grandpa.  I gave them a toss, folded the foil to make a pocket (sometimes I don't make a pocket) and put them in a pre-heated oven around 350 degrees for around 20 min.  They are soft, but not mushy, and sweet and spicy and so good.
