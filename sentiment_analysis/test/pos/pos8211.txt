Have a grill that has a lip inside where you can hang the tank and it will somehow tell you when tank is low, however am not strong enough to mount the thing in the cabinet to have it work. This unit just fits inside my cabinet and I place the tank on it.  Works good so far.  Of course I wont know for sure til I go through a tank.  But it was very simple to program to my tank, only problem is my husband believing it is telling us the truth. LOL
