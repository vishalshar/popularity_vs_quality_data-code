Great first ESP12 8266 based module! In terms of build quality and functionality, it's really solid. It's particularly great for those just getting started in IoT, or wanting to get a project up and running fast. Set up was quick (15 minutes or less) and painless, and I was off and scanning wifi. I was really impressed by the tutorials at ACROBOTIC's webpage: must be one of the best guides out there for getting started. Really: do yourself a favor and Google them. Plus, ACROBOTIC's support was incredible and they were super helpful with my many questions. Thank you!
