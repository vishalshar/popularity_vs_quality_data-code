I like the Spire a lot! It has helped me identify what in life makes me anxious before I realize it emotionally.  In fact, I have read many reviews of people that don't consider themselves to be "tense" when the spire indicates it, but I think that is because our breath is one of the first indicators of our emotional state.  I enjoy working out, and my spire confirmed how much more calm I am after workouts, and every day as long as I keep a consistent routine.  What surprised me is that through meditation I was able to also gain a lasting calm--just like with exercise.  Very cool product. All my friends were very interested! However, I wish it tracked sleep.  That's my only reason for giving four stars instead of five.
