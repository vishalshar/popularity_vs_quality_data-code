This is a great miniature projector! The key to a good experience with this projector is the same as with any projector, darkness.  The darker the room is the better the quality of the picture.  If you want to watch something mid-afternoon you should plan to use something other than a projector or have a method of drastically reducing the light in the room.  If you watch something with this projector at night in a dark room it rivals the picture quality of most TV's.The only negative things I have to say about this projector is the speaker inside the projector is a joke.  I would compare it to playing a set of earbuds loudly without them in your ears, it's possible to make out the sound in a completely quiet room, but not enjoyable.  This projector has a port to use an external speaker but it's disappointing it has to be connected by wires instead of Bluetooth.On a related note not specific to the projector, RIF6 also makes a an external speaker that matches their projector.  Don't waste your money buying the RIF6 speaker, it is not a quality speaker, especially considering the $60 price tag.Bottom line is this projector is really small and portable.  Is has incredible picture quality when it's used in dark conditions.  It has mediocre to bad quality in lighted situations, but that is mostly true of any projector so it's up to you to know what setting you intend to use this in.
