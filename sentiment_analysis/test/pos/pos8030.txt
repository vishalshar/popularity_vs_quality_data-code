1. Plug in the G10 system.2. Play.That is the full extent of the challenge of integrating the Relay G10 into your guitars signal chain. It works the first time and every time I have used it since. I admit to pulling out the manual (pardon me, the Pilots Guide) to see if I had missed something because it felt like it needed to be more complicated but that was it. The G10 is composed of two parts, the receiver/charger and the transmitter unit which plugs into your instrument. When the transmitter is not plugged into your guitar, it sits in a bay in the receiver to be charged and to pair the frequency of your signal. When gig time rolls around, plug the transmitter into your cord jack and rock.The tone is fantastic as the G10 introduces nothing to your signal. I moved around a fair sized hall and had a strong signal in every corner. The receiver has both a line out and an XLR balanced output so your signal can go to your amp or direct to the board. I route my signal through the amplifier and use the direct out from the amp to go to the front of house mixer as I use the amplifier on stage. It seems to be all Pros for the G10. I looked hard to find the downside and the only thing I can come up with is that the transmitter pack will go to sleep after four minutes and can take a second to wake up after you pluck a note. If you are playing the first note of your set, give the strings a little tickle before the count off and you'll be good to go.
