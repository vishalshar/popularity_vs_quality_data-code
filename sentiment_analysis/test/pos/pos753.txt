ZUS Smart Car Charger with Car Finder App 24W 4.8A [New Edition with 2 Reversible USB Ports] for iPhone 5/5s/5c, iPhone 6/6s/6s Plus, iPad Air, iPad mini, Nexus, Galaxy Note/S Series, HTC and MoreThe product is amazing and works like a dream.It charges my iphone and my daughter's ipad really fast -  4.8A / 24W Car Charger with 2 reversible USB charging ports. I had ordered the Zus Kevlar cable from Indiegogo and both work like a dream.While parking outside in a mall we do tend to forget where we park.. the iPhone app helps you - lets you know the direction to walk up to as well as, the distance.The new iPhone app also allows you to pair multiple Zus to it, so if you have 2 cars you can locate them separately.The new app i understand also allows you to share your location between family members - so better when each of you shop at different locations and want to meet directly at the car.Only upgrade i wish is, if they could have located the car in underground parking - but then that is only because GPS signals are hard to find in underground car parkings (same problem / issue with my Garmin gps).
