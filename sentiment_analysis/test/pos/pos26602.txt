I like this little speaker--it has great output. Before I purchased this speaker I had a Bose soundock that was many years old. When it finally died I decided to find another Bose speaker. Having tried several new ones I didn't find that any of the more recent ones being turned out have the expected Bose quality sound. So I decided to venture outside of Bose and found this little gem. Mind you this is not like the old school Bose quality sound but it does a great job of output in a large room and the sound is crisp and clear. This is a nice alternative and I love the answer call and silence functions. Would definitely recommend!
