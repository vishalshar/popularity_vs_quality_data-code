I saw these bags described on America's Test Kitchen and immediately ordered a package.  I wish I had ordered several more, and will do so.  I have put all the cheese I had and what I have since bought in the bags, just fold them over, and it keeps the cheese fresh and lovely.  I used to have to throw out more cheese than I wished to because of mold.  Since buying these bags I have not had any mold at all!  I really recommend these bags, they are wonderful!  I hope you enjoy them as much as I am enjoying mine.
