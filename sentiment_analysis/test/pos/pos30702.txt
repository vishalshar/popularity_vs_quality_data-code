I am a Graphic Designer and this is a great tool for me that I use daily. The left pages have a dot grid and the right side can be used for notes; this is great because I will draw out my designs on the left side and then make any notes on the right side. This helps keep me organized with my designs and thoughts. I am always a little skeptical when notebooks tell you that it will lay flat, just because most that promise this hardly live up to it, but this notebook REALLY does lay flat and it makes writing and drawing in it so much easier. I would recommend this notebook to anyone.
