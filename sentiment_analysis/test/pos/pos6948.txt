I've been using this gadget for about 2 1/2 months. It's relatively easy to use. The clip on the back isn't very secure and I'm only 5'4" so it didn't work on my belt anyway--I just put it in my pocket and can tag easily.  If I forget to tag, I can see when I review my round that it knew where I hit from and I edit it to put in the club that I used.  I made a work around for my putter and penalties (the club marker wouldn't go on my putter) and I wanted to keep track of my penalties, so I screwed the marker that I designated as my putter into one end of a synthetic wine cork and screwed in round marker on the other end (designated as a penalty) and keep it in my other pocket to tag putts and penalties. There is a place on the website that you can request additional features and I'm hoping that Game Golf implements many of them (the ability to record course conditions, wind speed, temperature, course rating and slope, ball used etc; a place for general notes on your rounds, joining rounds  and lots of other great ideas). I've learned that I don't hit enough club most of the time (except for my short game), I'm more serious over my shots because I'm recording them and have better course management.
