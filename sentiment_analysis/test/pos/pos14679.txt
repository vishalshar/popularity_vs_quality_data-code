I've been a big fan of the Bose IE headphones because they sound great and stay put on your ears with their clever "hook" system. Now, I have exactly the same solution for the Apple EarPods, and it works PERFECTLY. This takes a mediocre set of 'buds and makes them exceptional at a fraction of the cost of the (excellent) Bose.The Apple EarPods now stay put, and most importantly - they sound great, because they are properly positioned. Truly transformational!Huge kudos - if you have Apple EarPods, this is a must-have product.
