This product was a life saver - literally. It made it possible for me to easily collect my cat's urine for testing without the stress of going to the Vet's office or the pain of taking urine straight from her bladder. The only way it could be improved would be to sell it in larger bags because my cat is used to a certain size cat box and it took 4-5 bags to fill the box with enough litter to make her comfortable. The Vet had given us done black pellets to try first and she wanted nothing to do with them - but went right in with Kit4cat. A great product that really saved the day. Wish Vets would hand this out to those who need to try to collect kitty pee at home!
