This is the second time I've needed to repair an iPhone. I've used this product both times. Top quality product, with all the tools and instruction guide you'll need. My caution is that if you don't have patience or don't have good eyesight, you should have somebody else repair your phone. It requires lot of fine motor skills using very small parts.
