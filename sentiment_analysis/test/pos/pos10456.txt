Great product. I don't actually play football so that is not my use for this item. I do however practice Yoga on a daily basis and this is perfect to use for the top of my mat if my hands start slipping or sliding all over. (Yoga is more intensive than people think!) I'm very pleased with my purchase. It's actually really soft and has a good texture to it as a previous reviewer mentioned.  This is perfect to store away with my Yoga mat and my blocks and my other Yoga gear.  It also fits nicely in my bag that I tote my mat around in. I am pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it. For the price, you can't beat the quality of the product!
