I wasn't sure about this quad when I bought it because I hadn't heard much about the 107P, mainly just about the 107C and 107D. But, I liked the fact that it had a few features that I was interested in (altitude hold, for one), so I decided to go for it. This thing is so FUN to fly! The altitude hold worked PERFECT for me even in expert mode, the quad will just hover in the air on its own forever. Really cool. One thing I should note is that I could only get the altitude hold to work if I used the standard battery size that it comes with. I have some larger batteries that fit this quad too (they are blue and sold on Amazon as well), but they must throw off the weight because altitude hold wont work. Not a huge deal, because I have several of that size as well and it comes with one anyway. The other nice thing is it seems like it is a lot easier for new users to fly, especially in the default mode. Once I flipped it to expert I was amazed at how fast and maneuverable it is, compared to my 107D (also a great quad though). Also, the flight time is nearly 10 minutes from my experience. All of my batteries from my other quads fit inside with the battery door shut and many of the other parts are standard and easy to find. Overall, this quad is a HUGE win!
