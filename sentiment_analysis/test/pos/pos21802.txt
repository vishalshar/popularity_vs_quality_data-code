I've tried virtually every iPad stylus before the iPad Pro came out. This is hands down the most ideal for me.No batteries to replace, just charge via micro USB.Nice soft tip that gives friction on the glass and won't scratch.No Bluetooth pairing, just drawing.Like all styluses, it can create wobbly diagonal lines if drawn slowly. But that's totally manageable.If you don't want to invest in the iPad Pro yet. Then this is what you want.
