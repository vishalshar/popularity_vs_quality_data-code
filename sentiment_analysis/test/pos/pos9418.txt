I can't say enough good things about the Sansaire. It's stylish, simple to use, but most importantly, it works and works well. I've cooked everything from chicken to tuna to beef brisket to turkey to eggs (best. eggs. ever. - and the turkey was better than any I've had as well). Prior to this, I was using a cooler, a thermometer, and hot water from the stove to cook in a poor man's sous vide fashion. The Sansaire is infinitely better. Highest possible recommendation!
