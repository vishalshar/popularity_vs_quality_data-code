This device is SO helpful. I'm sad to admit that I misplace my keys or my phone somewhere in the house nearly every day. With TrackR, I can use one to find the other. I already used it to find my keys, which apparently my toddler had managed to shove under the couch. And I love that I can page my phone from my keys, which I know I will end up having to do. Thank you, TrackR, for saving me from lots of wasted time and anxiety looking for my missing stuff!
