I was a little skeptical at first but these are really tasty and they're perfect to just grab and go, I eat them on the bus, subway and in my car with no worries about spilling on myself or making a mess, i'll definitely be buying some more. Like another reviewer mentioned, the texture is a little weird at first but you get over it thanks to the delicious flavor.
