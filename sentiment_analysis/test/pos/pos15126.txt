Great option for dogs who like to chew, or senior dogs who need puzzles to stimulate their brains... that maybe aren't big on dura-bones or similar products.Also, if you're hesitant on feeding your dogs a lot of milk bones... or pulling half chewed strips of rawhide out of their throats while their choking... this may be the treat/toy for you.There are a number of different configurations of these toys, so they are great to keep your dogs guessing!
