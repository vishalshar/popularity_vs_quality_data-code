Loved how fast I got this! Tried them yesterday, and it really makes a difference. For a make up obsessed person like I am, my brushes are life savers, so I have to take good care of them! Takes a little longer to dry, but does really help with the shape so it's worth the wait! Just ordered my second Variety pack, need to stock up!
