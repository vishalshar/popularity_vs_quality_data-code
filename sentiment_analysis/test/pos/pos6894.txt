Really would just give them 3.5 stars. These are comfy insoles that generally perform as advertised. But when it's all said and done, they aren't anything earth shatteringly awesome. Was really hoping for something that would better suit me considering the fact that my feet sweat like crazy when I go sockless. I've read some reviews here where people were sorely disappointed. I'm not one of those people. Would I buy again? Maybe. But certainly not full price.
