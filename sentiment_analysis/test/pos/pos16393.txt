I love it. No password or code needed for me to log onto my computer and it keeps others out. When I boot the computer, it opens and shows my name and the GateKeeper icon, then boots up the system.I didn't know what all to expect of this little jewel. The setup is so easy, it practically does all the work itself, you just need to do the physical things, remove from box, insert battery(included) into fob, insert dongle into USB port, follow instructions to download software.When I was setting the range, I got my husband to go towards the opposite end of the building with the GateKeeper fob until it was out of range and my computer locked. I wondered what would happen if I removed the USB dongle. Would the computer unlock? No, no, no. A message pops up on my monitor telling me to please re-insert dongle into computer. This thing is just too cool. My question is, why don't the big companies that are losing customer's information have something like this on their computers?This came packaged better than most computers. Inside is very dense foam rubber with precision, form-fitting cutouts for each item. Plus, the box was taped closed on two sides for added protection.You could throw it off a rooftop onto pavement and the contents wouldn't get damaged. When I opened the box, all I saw was the fob and I thought to myself, "that's it?" I then removed the top layer and found the rest of the contents in the second layer of foam rubber. To me, that says quality and shows that the manufacturer takes pride in their product.I received this product at a discount for my trial and review. My review is 100% my own. I would give it 10 stars, if it were possible. I am not affiliated with this company, nor have I received any monetary gain from this transaction. Great product.
