Absolutely delicious.  I ordered some to bring to my families' holiday gathering-I am always trying to find a beverage that will appeal to everyone from my 9 year old niece to my 76 year old father.  Being sweet but not too sweet, with only 60 calories (some of us are really watching our weight) it was a hit all the way around.  My only regret was that I only ordered one case of each flavor.
