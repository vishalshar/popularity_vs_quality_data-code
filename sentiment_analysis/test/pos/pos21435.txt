I have had a lot of cases for my iPhone 5. My wife says i have a problem.  But this case maybe the last one I ever buy.  For the price and how well the case performs, you can't find a better one.  just the fact that you get the car mount and screen protector with the case is worth checking this case out.The only negative thing i can say about this case is the red isn't really red, its more of a maroon. But i ordered a different color from the Rokform website and love it.
