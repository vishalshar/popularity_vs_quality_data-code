I bought this Coravin unit a couple of months ago.  I wanted to wait and give it a "test run" before reviewing it.  First, the cost.  Yes, it's expensive.  But, how much oxidized wine do you pour down the drain every year?  If you're like me, a lot.  I'm single, so when I open a bottle I can only drink about a third of the bottle.  I've tried recorking, and using the vacuum pumps, and other methods, but they don't work and the wine is ruined the next day.  I mainly drink cheap $5 bottles for my everyday wine, but like most wine lovers I occasionally open the more expensive bottles and end up pouring a lot of them out as well.  I will probably save at least $200 the first year alone on saved wine I don't have to pour out!  The next issue is bottles that have synthetic corks.  Natural corks work best because they squeeze the hole shut completely as soon as you pull the needle out.  However, I have had success with synthetic corks.  As soon as I pull the needle out I quickly insert a rounded toothpick in the hole as far as possible.  Then I break off the top of the toothpick and use something to pound the toothpick into the hold until it's even with the top of the cork so I can reuse the Coravin on it.  This has worked well for me.  Every now and then I get a tiny bit of leakage but not much and the wines always taste good even a few weeks later.  The company does not recommend the Coravin on synthetic corks so use my method at your own risk.  I love being able to open different bottles depending on the varietal I am craving at the moment, and going back and reusing the Coravin on bottles I have already used it on prior, even weeks ago.  So far the wine has always tasted like it did when I first opened it.  I am averaging almost exactly what the company says you will get, about 15 glasses, before I have to change the gas.  One last thing, when you first get the Coravin make sure the needle is screwed on tightly.  Mine was loose and I would think that could cause leakage of the gas.
