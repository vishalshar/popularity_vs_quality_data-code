I have found this to be an enormously helpful tool in better managing my state of mind and getting better insight into my day. My schedule is erratic and Spire has helped make me more aware of my stress triggers and asking that I tune into my mind and body more often. The breathing techniques and guided meditations (especially the quick ones mid-day) have been very useful.I am awesome at doing. I am not great at just being. Hopefully Spire will continue to help me balance that out.
