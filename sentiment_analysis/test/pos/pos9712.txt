best bike mount for my Samsung Galaxy S4.  Unfortunately looks like manufacturer has stopped developing this product line, which is too bad.  One would think the prices would come down to encourage uptake as the fixed development costs are spread out over a longer time, but that doesn't seem to be happening either.  So five stars for the product line and product quality, but three stars for the price trajectory and apparent lack of continued product development support.
