My son is a year old and has thrown this thing on the floor several times and it is still in one piece.  It is also cute and functional.  It has the silicon for grip and the top comes off easily to fill up, but not so easily that he has figured out how to take it off.  It doesn't leak too badly (my son finds ways to get the fluid out or he spits it all over himself, but it isn't on our floor).  it has a couple see through holes so you know how much liquid is in the cup, and it can be used as a cup when he gets bigger because the top can just come off.  Happy with this purchase.
