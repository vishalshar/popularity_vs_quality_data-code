I owned all 3 of the mountek's (The Snap 3, Snap + and the clamp model)I thought the Snap+ would offer some more magnets for a stronger hold because its advertised as being the 'heavy-duty version' and recommended for bigger , heavier items. Naturally I assumed it meant a stronger connection between the item and magnet. However, I was wrong. The only difference between the 2 versions is the CD mounting attachment.The Snap+ seems to be more sturdy, however, this will go unnoticed for most devices (I own an iPhone 6, and the Snap 3 and Snap+ offer the same experience).The only reason I kept it and prefer the Snap+ in my Mazda 3, is because I have to mount them with the tightening bolt placed above. If it is underneath, it will hit into my power button when hitting any bumps and turn my radio off. And unlike the Snap 3, the magnet part (when the bolt is on top), makes the phone sit much lower so that it is not covering my HUD. The Snap 3 is the opposite. When the bolt is placed on top, the phone sits higher because the magnet is also higher up. This causes the phone to hide my view of my temperature display.Overall, I love the Snap 3 better because of its other uses as a desk stand, or the ability to clamp onto certain objects (thin objects seemingly. nothing like a computer monitor). I decided to keep both. The Snap+ for my car because it is situated lower and because it grips my CD tray better, and the Snap 3 as a stand on my office desk.In either case ,I definitely recommend the magnet mounts over the clamp mount. The clamp mount always came loose and was a pain in the butt to attach and reattach. It even clamped my finger one time. Was not fun :oHope this helps.
