Xtronaut is fantastic, it is easy to learn, and quick to play we averaged around 30 minutes per session.  That said, I want to see more, the game only features US rocket manufacturers and launch sites.  I would like to see an international expansion that includes rockets, and launch sites from other major space programs and companies.  Additionally while the mission set in the base game is fun, it could be expanded to include things like telescope launches, and manned missions.  I forsee one or two possible expansions.  The only criticism I have is that there are not enough rocket parts included in the box, for example there are only enough parts in the game to make one space launch system rocket. It just needs more cards, and a bigger variety of parts.  Overall an excellent game and I would like to buy more.
