These are the best tv-watching snack around! Only ONE INGREDIENT! (except for my favorite ones, the apple cinnamon and then it's only TWO ingredients!) And they're organic! What's not to love? Try dipping in peanut butter, or crumble on yogurt! Really fill the "crunch" need when potato or corn chips aren't on the menu.
