I was a little unsure of how to write this review. I have bought Hickies before from another source, and I absolutely LOVE them. I use them in my tennis shoes and they fit perfectly. However, I ordered these for a pair of lace-up shoes that are not tennis shoes, and they are so much too big I am unable to use them. :-(  It is obvious that they are designed to be used in tennis shoes, where the width of the lacing area is wider than in regular shoes. I am very disappointed they don't fit these particular shoes, but the product itself is great. I highly recommend Hickies. They make all my tennis shoes slip-ons, plus, they look really cool!.
