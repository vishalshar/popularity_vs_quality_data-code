I hate tying laces. And they always seem to come undone when I'm running. So, I have to stop & retie them. OR I have to double-knot each shoe - a pain to untie. But can all that - Hickies are really easy. Slip on - slip off. That's all. Oh, you may need a shoehorn to get them on really quick if they are tight. Hickies save you from shoe's major hassles. And when the shoes wear out, you can reuse the Hickies. Win-Win!
