It does exactly what the manufacturer claims--it keeps the earbuds in my ear.  Installation as easy.  I tried both sizes and the large worked better for me.But--it keeps the earbuds further out of the ear canal than the naked earbuds reducing the bass and making it sound rather tinny.  It also allows more outside noise in.I suppose this is because of my ear shape and not any product deficiency.  I do use it for phone calls but I have other earbuds that stay put and sound better for audio alone.So for meeting its design goal of keeping the earbuds from falling out it merits 5 stars.  Overall I am giving it 4 stars because of the fit to my ears.
