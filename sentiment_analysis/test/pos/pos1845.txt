I have owned this product for just over a month carrying it every day. I absolutely love this brass bullet pencil. The brass is aging nicely from being carried in my pocket and held in my hand. While the pencil is not the absolute best that I've used, it's still a good pencil for every day use, sharpens nicely and has lasted so far. I still have about a 1/4" of unsharpened pencil sticking out of the metal cap and it sharpens nicely with a pocket knife. I highly recommend the Midori Brass Bullet Pencil for a great addition to your every-day carry and use.
