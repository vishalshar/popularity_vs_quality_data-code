I give this product two stars right now for the following reasons. 1.  It's intended use is very helpful. 2.  The tech support tried to assist me on the phone. The product is so new that even tech-support does not know anything about it. I'm surprised they would release a product without properly testing it. It connects easily to the Wi-Fi router and network. Like Brett east said (and his review is spot on) you have to manually open the mydlink home app and check for motion detection. Once they get this product open working it will be a winner. I have tried the app both on iOS and Google. Both with the same result. I was able to see the DCH-S150 on the computer mydlink website so I know I set it up correctly. This is going to be a wait and see project. Dlink did call me back requesting screen shots of my iphone. The design is very nice the sensor can be very sensitive or not sensitive at all. Once dlink figures out how to send push notifications all will be well with this thing. I will update my review upon any changes in the app.July 11- I noticed a 5 star review last night on this item so I figured D-Link has updated the mydlink home app. All I had to do is go back into the mydlink home app and go to the my actions part and put back in the rule stating I want to be notified when there is motion detected on the DCH-S150. Once I put the new rule in, the app works as advertised. You can set the sensitivity and also turn on and off the notifications so if you are home you are not bothered every time a family member passes the sensor. It now works they way it was supposed to.Oct 8. I bought a second sensor for my bedroom as robbers always hit up the master bedroom. This sensor worked perfect right away. D-link is having some problems with the software updates but either version 1.01 or 1.03 work fine. Updates via push notification are immediate. I was in Alaska and when my pet sitter came in the house I was notified within seconds. 5000 miles away and had no issues at all. Takes some getting used to as far as sensitivity. Also once motion is detected takes another few minutes to send push notification. These are best when used with cameras so when you get a push notification then check the camera to see if you have an intruder.
