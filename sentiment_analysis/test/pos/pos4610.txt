We really enjoy eating this cereal.  My family likes it warm, like traditional oatmeal.  I prefer it with almond milk.  When purchased via Subscribe and Save, it's economical and easy to maintain a stock in the pantry.  The packaging is simple and delivery was timely.We store it in the refrigerator when opened.
