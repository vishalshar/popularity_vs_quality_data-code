These are a delicious alternative to potato chips and so much healthier. We definitely prefer the thinner sliced Bare Apple Chips over the much thicker Horizon Organic Apple Chips. Yes, there will be some small pieces in the bag, but I still ate them. We have found over the years that we just waste so much of certain foods if they have a short shelf life. We much prefer dried apples, strawberries, cranberries, and apricots to the fresh versions. They keep forever and offer us the same health benefits with less waste.
