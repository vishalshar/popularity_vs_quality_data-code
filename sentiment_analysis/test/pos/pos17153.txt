I cannot say enough good about this product. Learned about it from Cook's Illustrated, and it has been a real boon in our kitchen. My husband and I both love cheese, but let's face it - if you have many different kinds, some get "hidden", shall we say, and often are ruined by the time we rediscover them - either dried out or moldy. These cheese papers work great to extend the life of cheese. I was skeptical when I first saw them, but trust America's Test Kitchen, so decided to try them. You will NOT be disappointed!
