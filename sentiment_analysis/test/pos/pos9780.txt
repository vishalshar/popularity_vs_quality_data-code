Ive played around with Cozmo for several hours now, and Im suitably impressed.  His programmed animations and quirky personality certainly give him a life-like quality.  While its not quite as seamless and slick as the marketing materials might have implied, it is certainly a fully realized and well-designed toy robot.  Thats right.  This is a toy robot.  Many people seem to be forgetting that fact and have some strange notions about what little Cozmo should be able to do.  This is an interactive toy controlled by a WiFi connected device (* see my addendum,) and Anki has never said otherwise.  Cozmo may recognize and respond to your face, but he does not see you in the traditional sense.  He does not have ears and will not come when you call his name.  He can detect motion, but will not come when you wave him over.  In fact, other than detecting your face or your moving finger in front of him, he doesnt even know you have a body.  He does however know exactly where his blocks are at all times and can discover and temporarily remember a small area around those blocks, and thats where the magic happens.The block system is, thankfully, well conceived as it is your primary source of interaction with Cozmo.  These are Cozmos touch-points.  He only knows his world in relation to the position of these blocks.  Move the blocks, and Cozmo has to look around to figure out where he is all over again.  The blocks are designed for maximum interaction with Cozmo.  They have multi-colored lights, are touch sensitive, have recesses that enable Cozmo to hook and lift them, have rubber corners which allows Cozmo to roll them on smooth surfaces, and they have each have specific patterns that Cozmo can track and recognize.  These blocks are also what you will primarily use to play games and interact with Cozmo.The tap game is genius in its simplicity, but has the ability to ramp up in difficulty quickly if you want a challenge.  Dont let Cozmo fool you.  He may make some wrong or slow moves at first, but he quickly becomes a formidable opponent.  Im also convinced that he cheats from time to time, but I cant prove that.  The game where you try to push a block towards Cozmo and pull it away before he taps it is a little less realized, but still manages to be quite a nerve-wracking bit of fun none the less.  As you play games with Cozmo, you will earn points that you can use to make him do tricks or unlock new games or features in the app.  More points if you beat him in games, less points if you lose them.  Its a well-designed reward system that keeps you engaged and wanting to play to see whats next.Cozmo also has a remote control mode that lets you drive him around with the added benefit of being able to see what he sees.  It also gives you a clue as to how Cozmo is able to detect things, as youll see an outline and a description displayed around things he detects like his blocks or your face.  The mode is currently limited to moving him around, but there will soon be an update released that will let you lift and stack the blocks in this mode as well.Left to his own devices, Cozmo will tool around exploring his environment.  Once he detects the block placements, he will begin to rearrange those or stack them on top of each other.  Hell also learn where objects are in relation to the blocks and be able to navigate his surroundings.  Its interesting to just set him on a desk while youre doing something else and watch him move around and look at various things.  If he detects your face while looking around, hell sometimes look up at you and say hello or tell you that he wants to play a game with you by moving toward you making a quick tap or two.  If you dont have time to play or are busy doing other things, hell get sad or might mope for a bit.  My only complaint about this free-roam mode is that he does not have access to the abilities or tricks that you have unlocked.  It would be cool if he could just start rolling or throwing bricks or flipping over stacked bricks without being prompted to.  Im sure that could be a possibility in a future update.All in all, Cozmo is great purchase, and well worth the money.  Well-done, Anki!  I cant wait to see what you have in store for him next.* Regarding the dedicated WiFi connection and smartphone or tablet reliance that everyone appears to be complaining about:  The only way that Anki could bring this to market at an affordable price was to leverage the computational power of the WiFi connected device.  The Cozmo unit itself has no "brain."  It is essentially a terminal with many sensors that takes hundreds if not thousands of readings a second.  All of that requires a fairly decent processor chip to interpret, process, and then relay back to the unit.  Adding an internal board and chip to Cozmo would have increased the cost by at least $300, if not more, when you factor in the cost of the components (the board and chip make up the majority of the cost of a smartphone, which is why they are so expensive) and then realize that the whole chassis would have needed to have been enlarged to accommodate the circuit board, even further adding to the cost.  The extra power draw from the processor would also have significantly reduced the length of play time before requiring a charge.  The dedicated WiFi connection also eliminates the risk of what is essentially a roaming camera.  Using something like a Bluetooth connection while the phone was still connected to your home WiFi network would have enabled enterprising hacker types to potentially invade your privacy.Anki definitely made the right decision here with the dedicated WiFi connection to an external controller device.  Id love to see a fully interactive autonomous toy robot of this type, but were still several years away from that being an affordable option at this point.
