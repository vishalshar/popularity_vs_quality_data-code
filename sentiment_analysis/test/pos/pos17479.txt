All I wanted was a simple way to open my garage from my phone. I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars of an opener that required setting up another network, or deal with complicated software.Installation was simple. A few tips:- Your garage light will turn on, or off, when you connect the wire.- It might take a minute or two to charge up before you can connect your phone.- The best way to get the longest range is to not mount it on your opener. The metal shield will block the signal.
