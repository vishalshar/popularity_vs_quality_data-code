Love this playmat ! The best thing about it is the thickness. Many baby just started trying to crawl after rolling over and flips over quite often. With this thickness, I do not need to worry about her banging her head on our hard wood floor. Love the bold red color we chose as well. Baby is quite intrigued with the colors and the patterns on the mat !It will be great if Lollaland also makes a baby play fence that can be used to close this mat ! Most play fences available are octagonal or hexagonal on configuration!
