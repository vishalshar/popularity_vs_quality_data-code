I ordered one traditional Tile after my husband misplaced his keys. Used that and found it convenient. So when the slim model came out I ordered s four pack. Have also needed to use them. More than once. The GPS feature is great, as is the fact that an entire online community is there to help. The darling little song works well, but could be a bit louder. I could hear it, but my husband could not. And I have had a lot of fun demonstrating it to my friends. Always recommend it strongly
