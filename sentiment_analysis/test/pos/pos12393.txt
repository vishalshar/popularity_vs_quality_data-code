The product is NOT durable.  I broke my first one within three months.  The second one in about four months.  I never abused them.  The spring and metal part that attaches the two lenses breaks.  Be very careful/gentle when putting back in the case.  It's a great idea and I am still tempted to buy another but they wear out too fast.  I only used them when I forgot my other glasses.  They are perfect for when you need to look at your phone or a menu at a restaurant for example.Also, as I just came back to Amazon to contemplate buying another one, I noticed they now advertise a "Lifetime Replacement Guarantee" which you can read more about here:  [...].  That warranty is a joke.  First, you must register with them within a limited time period.  "Purchasers who purchase by calling ThinOPTICS, use a ThinOPTICS website, or purchased the glasses at a retail outlet and registered with ThinOPTICS within the specified period on the retail package, are covered by a Lifetime Replacement Guarantee that extends the 90 Day Warranty covering your glasses for as long as you own them."Second, it doesn't actually cover anything!  "This Warranty does not apply: (a) to damage caused by use with another product; (b) to damage caused by accident, abuse or misuse, including, but not limited to, scratches and broken lenses; or (c) to defects caused by normal wear and tear or otherwise due to the normal aging of the Product."It seems like they are trying to pretend this product is durable by giving a lifetime warranty, but by the time you need the warranty, you find out it's worthless.What they really should do is sell a dozen for a discount, then I could care less if they broke (assuming a fair price).4/21/16: UPDATE.  I upgraded my review from 2 stars to 4 because they did in fact agree to send me a replacement.  Maybe the warranty wording should be changed.  I will repeat this:  I didn't expect these to last forever, and I know things wear out.  I wish they would sell multiples at a discount.  I WANT to pay for something that's worth paying for.  These are a great idea.  They are somewhat fragile, and that's fine if I can get them at a decent price.
