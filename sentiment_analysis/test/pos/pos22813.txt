My father-in-law recently passed away leaving behind a ton of old vinyl records.  We had no record player, but wanted to listen to his beautiful classics.  I purchased the Victrola VTA-750B Nostalgic Aviator 7-in-1 because of it's antique look.  It arrived carefully packaged and in excellent condition.  I couldn't be any more happy with it.  The sound quality is excellent for just the two internal speakers it comes with.  I have tried every component, the record player, the cassette player, the Bluetooth and the CD.  I have yet to record a CD from a record, but I will be getting to that.  We really enjoy listening to the old records and remembering my father-in-law and imagine how he must have enjoyed listening to this music as well.  The beauty of the antique looking unit adds a special quality to my room d√©cor.  I would definitely recommend this product.
