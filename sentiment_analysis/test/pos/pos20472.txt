This was everything I hoped. I just received it today and will update this if anything changes after using it for a while.- good fit- just the right amount of overlap to protect the front, but not be excessive.- great grip on the rubber- Cards fit perfectly in the elastic- Feels great in the hand- quality feel and appearance.
