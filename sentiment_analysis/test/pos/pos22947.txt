I was diagnosed at the age of 12 with pros. I have never had normal periods. And I was told I couldn't get pregnant I'd have issuesat conceiving.  No pregnacy yet but I have been ovulation normally. Now I'm at least having menstrual cramps. So the medicine is working. I have faith and believe that with God an this medicine I have a chance at conceiving. So I'd recommend this to anyone.
