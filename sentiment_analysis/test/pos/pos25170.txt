Starry is a very unique product. It is a AC class wireless router with Gigabit ethernet that provides that something extra that distinguishes it from other products in its class. The real strength of this router is the ease of setup and use and the useful information that is readily available to the average user that is simply not available from competing products. In reality, there are no competing products. There are plenty of reliable AC class wireless routers with Gigabit ethernet, but this product is a boon to the average, non-geek user. I love geeks but lets face it, not everyone wants to flash DD-WRT or other open source firmware to their router so that they can clone MAC addresses or setup port forwarding (Functions that can admittedly be handled in many stock firmware setups). Most users know little or nothing about networking and are simply interested in having a functioning internet connection. It shows at a glance the devices that are connected to the network. Starry lets you know about the "health" of your interent connection and gives you a better chance to determine if any connectivity issues are in your home or equipment or if the interent service provider is having issues. It shows which devices may be experiencing problems and provides potential solutions. It helps when the average user says "I have no idea why it's not working" The less you know about wireless networking, the more useful this product becomes. Highly recommended!
