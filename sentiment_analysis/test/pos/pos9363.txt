I waited a few weeks to thoroughly test this product before leaving any reviews. I have used the cream for seven weeks as of this review.1. I did not notice any difference the first two weeks, in fact, my spots got a little worse.2. On the second week, I noticed my skin started healing and the skin is no longer pink and raw.3. It's hard to explain it, but my skin became really dry, but when I applied some aquaphor or more cream to the spots, the scales lifted and there was healthier skin underneath.4. At this point, my spots are still there but they are no longer raised, or bleeding and cracking. The dryness is still there but it is more manageable since the skin is no longer inflamed and the flaking has become minimal.I will update again soon. If you want to see my before and after pictures, I am on Instagram under janna_thehutt.
