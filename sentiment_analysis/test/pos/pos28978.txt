This is an amazing little device, for the price you cannot go wrong.We use it to troubleshoot HVAC and Energy Use Issues. Air temp coming out of vent, heat gain in spaces.I found some poorly insulated refrigerant piping and a supply duct with no liner in one section with this camera just skimming a job site while walking. Well worth the money. Also if you have a good temperature differential between inside and outside you can see studs in the wall.Pros:Quick visualization of heat/cold.Quick temperature acquisition of surfaces.Easy to take photos for records.Simple to plug in and open app and go.Cons:Resolution not that of very expensive ones.App sometimes becomes choppy after extended use or quick movements. (Closing App and restating it seems to work).If you have a thick case you either need an extender cord or take off your case, plug is only so deep. With my cheap thin $10 case it works fine.I've dropped it a couple times, still works. We have bought a second one for work because it's so helpful and in demand. Great product.For what we need it's better than the $10,000 ones because it's easier and faster and you can stick it in your pocket. Email / text photos etc. Slick.
