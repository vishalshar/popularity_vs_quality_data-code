We love this mat!! It not only looks and feels great but our daughter loves it. It is very thick and you can tell it is great quality. She does tummy time on it for a long time and rolled for the first time on the first day we used the mat. It also is large enough that the whole family can lay on it! I also like to use it as a gym mat when she's napping :)There was a slight smell at first but it dissipated quickly. Definitely worth the investment if you want something that looks a little different than all the other mats there.
