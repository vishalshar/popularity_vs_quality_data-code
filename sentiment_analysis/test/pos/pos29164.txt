I needed wipes for the days I went to bootcamp and wasn't able to shower before going to work and these wipes worked really well. I have sensitive skin and they didn't irritate my skin at all. The wipes are big enough to use on the whole body. Only problem is that it takes a while for the product to dry on the skin but once it's dry it leaves no residue on the skin.
