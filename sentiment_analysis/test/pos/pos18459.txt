Here are my observations for this laptop:The laptop runs cool and quiet while such as when playing games, rendering and watching videos.The display is probably its weakest link, but I find that it suits my needs just fine.  I find it sufficiently bright, sharp and the colors look to be reasonably accurate.  I hate glare screens, this one has a matte a finish.The keyboard has a nice tactile feel to it.  Although, if you hit a key at the wrong angle theres a minute amount of buckling against the edges around chassis (almost not worth mentioning, but if you are an avid gamer, you may notice it from time to time).  The keyboard backlit is bright and a welcome feature.The mouse pad is comfortable.  The buttons are a bit awkward for me as I am used to physical buttons.  With a little practice, I was able to get accustomed to it.The chassis is made of sturdy material such as aluminum and plastic.  It feels good in the hands.  It is very thin which makes for good portability.  At 4.4 pounds, its not ultra-light, but by no means a brick.  It fits in my laptop backpack with plenty of room to spare.There is virtually no bloat ware installed.All of the ports are easily accessible.  The Ethernet port has a foldable cover that takes some getting used to, but not a deal-breaker by any means.  It has two USB 2.0 and two USB 3.0 ports.  In my opinion, it should have 4 USB 3.0 ports.  Again, not a deal breaker.As other people have mentioned, the power supply is big.  Although, I have other laptops that have bigger ones.Gaming on this laptop is one of its strongest attributes.  I play Elder Scrolls Online.  I was able to get descent frame rates (above 30 FPS) while having the settings at High.  While playing, I noticed that the laptop doesnt overheat.  It stays at a quiet hushing noise.The 500 GB SSD was enough to fit my apps and games with room left over.  It also has an available 2.5 SATA drive bay.It comes with 8GB of RAM which is enough to cover all my needs with web development, video editing, and daily productivity work.  If you plan on multitasking with memory hungry apps, then I would recommend maxing out the RAM to 16GB.  Keep in mind that the installed 8GB RAM is non-removable (from what I was told).The wireless-AC card works well with the LAN at my home.  It is sufficiently fast and meets all of my current needs.The sound is what you would expect from a laptop.  Its not meant to entertain a crowd.  For a single user, it has met my needs with casual game playing, browsing the internet, watching videos, etc.Cons:The laptop should come with a display port.  It has only one HDMI port.The panel should be IPS.  But, after using it for a few days, this isnt a deal breaker.  The display suits my needs just fine.The power supply is big, but so are the other ones on my other laptops (of different manufacturers).===============================I gave this laptop 5 stars for its overall quality as a whole.I would recommend this laptop to anyone!
