NOT FOR APPLEWATCH SERIES 2! Don't buy!It's a great product and I'm sure it would have worked fantastically but it doesn't fit the Apple Watch series 2, it is slightly thicker by 0.9mm so the case won't close all the way and you might break your watch if you try to force it.I'm giving it 4 stars because it has a potential to be a great product and would buy it when they make it for the series 2.
