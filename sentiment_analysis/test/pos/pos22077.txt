This is actually a great product, does exactly what it says, works perfectly, is well made.  I was skeptical buying this when I read the other reviews- however I think that the software may have been updated since those reviews were written.  I don't know if it makes a difference, but I'm using the Wink hub with this in conjunction with my GE Link bulbs and Nest Thermostat.  I have made several shortcuts which control all of the lights, including the outlets on the Pivot Power Genius.  Works everytime.  Also, there are buttons on the side of the power strip to manually control the "smart" outlets without using the app.  I intend to buy two more of these power strips as soon as the price comes back down.
