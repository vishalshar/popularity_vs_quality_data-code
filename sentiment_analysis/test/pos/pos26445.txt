I'm new to using foam rollers, but the concept of self-myofascial release makes sense and I love deep tissue massage, so I thought I'd give it a try. This roller in particular is super because it has a locking lid so I can put my wallet etc. in it when I'm at the gym (I'm a sucker for multifunctional). This would be great for the Crossfit crowd!
