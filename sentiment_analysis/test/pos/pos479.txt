This is the best product for kitty boxes ever!We use it in the automatic box.No smell from urine or poo.One caution:Follow the instructions and do not use in a moisture rich environment or you will pay a fortune replacing the crystals as they absorb moisture from the air as well as from Kitty. Living on a houseboat has proven to be tough on the life of the crystals but still so worth it to have zero smells !!
