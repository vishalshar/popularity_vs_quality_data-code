My dog was first diagnosed with cushings disease..even though the vets weren't "100% sure". The vet prescriptions were making his lethargic and the weight did not go back on, neither did his hair growth come back. I found another natural solution for his weight to come back as we strongly believe he has EPI and so does a few Holistic Vets...but using this alone caused his patchy bald spots to grow back!!! I will always buy this from now on!! This stuff seriously works! I also give some to his brother (litter mate) even though his brother doesn't have any health issues, it is still good for his coat. :)
