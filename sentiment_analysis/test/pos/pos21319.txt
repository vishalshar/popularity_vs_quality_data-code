When my old (20+ years) controller died a couple weeks ago, I asked our gardener for suggestions. He said at least one other customer was using a rachio, and it seemed to be problem-free. Water bills have been going up here, and the idea of being able to mange use, without adding too much to either cost or complexity, sounded like a reasonable gamble.So far, it has worked perfectly. I am normally very averse to messing with anything that's wired into my home, but I had my old controller replaced with the rachio in less than half an hour. The only tools required were a screwdriver and a pair of needle-nose pliers (to straighten and insert the existing wires into the rachio terminals)After connecting the wires and doing the wifi programming, I crossed my fingers and prepared for many hours of troubleshooting and possible additional expenses. None was required; everything worked perfectly on the very first try.The rachio has a lot of options and tweaks - someone with a detailed knowledge of landscaping could do a lot of optimization. Happily, rachio includes a "give access" feature, and by entering my gardner's email address, he was able to set the schedules and periods better than I could.A little math tells me that I could probably make back the additional cost of the rachio (compared to a basic, simple unit) in perhaps a year and a half.  No rebates are available in my area, but if they are in yours, you could do even better.All things considered, I'm very happy with this.On Wifi: I was pleased to note that the rachio was able to pick up my wifi reliably from my garage, which is at least 60 feet (and three walls, one of them brick) away from the base station.
