yummy banana chips it is good to give to military members... we always forget to eat breakfast and keep a healthy diet so this helps a bit.... though not as great as actually eating breakfast it does fill you up pretty quickly and you can have it in the office for weeks without it going bad... the individual bags and the wide verity that it offers is great and they all taste good (to me). These are dehydrated so if you eat these drink water and you will feel fuller. They are good to eat so why not try them.... Please like my comment and leave on too :)
