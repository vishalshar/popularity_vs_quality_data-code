So here's the deal. My sister runs a pet sitting/nannying company in LA. Which means a lot of dogs, cats, rabbits, pigs, a lot of whom are used to pretty good lifestyles. I live up north and go to visit her every few months, and when I do I love to join her at "work" while she "has to" hang out with furry animals all day.I had some dogs and cats growing up. But working with my sister has opened my eyes to a lot of new things. Like how many animals sit at home all day while their owners are away, in various conditions. Some have big cushy couches they aren't allowed to sit on, others are in kennels (which I do not support).They do all have one thing in common: they are alone a large chunk of their lives, or at least with other animals but not their owners. And because they can't speak it's hard to know if they got enough exercise that day, if they're sitting down too much, not playing, feeling sick. I'd tried FitBit and Jawbone Up and all sorts of wearables for myself but I returned all of them.Then we got our own dog. I cannot say how glad I am I didn't return the FitBark like I did with those devices for myself. I realized the difference is I know how I'm feeling but I don't know how Toby's feeling And working with my sister has taught me that animals do exhibit body language, but that can't/doesn't tell the whole story. And working with trainers I've learned you need a degree to parse your dog's body language anyway ;)I will never go back to not putting a doggie tracker on Toby. I don't think I'm the only one who'd pay anything for my dog ;) Any little bit more I can relate to him and know he's living a great life I will do. It did take a bit of adjusting the levels on the FitBark and I keep forgetting about the battery reminders but Ż\_(?)_/Ż I love my Toby. Worth it. Very worth it.
