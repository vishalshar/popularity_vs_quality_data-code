I bought this for my 7 year old daughter. She loves technology, but I was actually worried she might be a little too advanced to enjoy it. All of my fears were put aside immediately....she loves it!  Her favorite thing in the world is dancing. She usually puts the MiP in dance mode, and it jams with her :). The app is updated regularly and is self explanatory. While you can use the MiP without a tablet/phone, you would be robbing yourself of features.There are a few cons. It eats through batteries like crazy. You should definitely invest in some recharable batteries or it will be expensive. Also, if you are using an IOS device check compatability. My daughter has an iPad 2 and it is not supported.
