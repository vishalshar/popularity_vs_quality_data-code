The unit is nice!The first thing I noticed when I opened the package is how wide the Sansaire is across ... about the size of my palm. I was originally going to use my 1.5 gal stock pot but because the unit was so big I had to buy a separate tub. In the stock pot, the water outlet was dead center, which meant there was not much room for food items.My friend got into sous vide cooking and he was using an Anova. I bought this one on purpose so we can compare. His is much thinner and smaller. However the Anova looks industrial, does not sit nice on the counter (so if you remove it from the tub), and is secured with a vice. The Anova also looked like it couldn't take a drop as well as the Sansaire (no drop tests were performed on either) and it does not have access panels for cleaning from what I am told.Then I filled the tub with water and started the unit, it made a beep and the water started circulating. I read others compare the sound level to an aquarium tank, and this one is quieter than the aquarium tanks I have heard.I set the temperature to 135F. It achieved that easily.I tried for 185F because I want to experiment with vegetables. The unit got the water to 179.5 but never any higher. I think it is because the tub is so big around that water evaporation was lowering the temperature as fast as the unit was pushing it up. I will try another experiment with a lid or some covering.UPDATE: I used the stock pot, which was smaller. I tried for 183F. It achieved that temperature easily. I don't know whether it cooked worse in the smaller stock pot -- most sous vide sites recommend larger cooking vessels -- but it cooked what I needed it to just fine.The last thing to note is that the base of the unit is the water intake. So the unit being so wide at the base you would have thought you could let it free stand in the water. Alas, no. It seemed to be happier when there was a little space under the base.PROS:+ great digital readout. Very clear and large. Brighter than Anova's+ good precision with water temperature. At 130-140 the temperature held dead still+ very quiet+ nice controls. I read in another review that it was too sensitive. You'd turn it and you either set it too high or too low. I did not have that problem. I had the other problem with it taking too many turns to go from 130 to 185.CONS:- very wide across- water intake on the bottom/base of unit- too many turns to reach 185
