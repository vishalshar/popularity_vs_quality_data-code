The product is good, but compare to Flushable Personal Wipes - 108 Individually Wrappedhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LV4N32G[UPDATE: This product is currently unavailable, which means that Dude Wipes are the best value on the market. Dec 2015]I buy these for camping and long trips, and have tried both.The Pharm-a-C wipes are 10% cheaper* and 25% larger. The ingredients are virtually identical. Both are equally soft and moist and clean just fine, without a chemical feel or smell.Pharma-C-Wipes: 56 sq inchesDude Wipes: 44 sq inchesThe Pharma-C-Wipes can be torn into large halves (and even reasonable thirds), and the Dude Wipes into halves.If you get wipes smaller than these (such as 5 x 7 = 35 inch), plan to use them at a 1 to 1 ratio.The one thing about Dude Wipes that gives them an advantage is they don't have the word "Perineal" plastered all over them and don't look medicinal. If you are actually a dude using these when you get lucky enough to hook up and are going to have them in your car, your pocket, or your overnight bag and are worried about embarrassment, probably just go with these.Otherwise, go for the value.* I understand prices are subject to change, but if you calculate price per square inch, a few cents per wipe won't matter.
