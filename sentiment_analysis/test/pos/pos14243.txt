These are great. My shoes are always snug with these on. They never come loose either. Only issue that I have is that on the lower part towards the toe box, the hickies seem different sizes. On one shoe they are close to the shoe but on the other it seems as if there is a bigger gap between the shoe and the hickie. I still love them and it won't keep me from buying more in different colours. I will eventually replace all of my casual shoes with these. I might even replace my running shoe laces with these as well!
