I have purchased the Edison kit for my 6 yo, and the Tesla kit for my 8 yo. They will be Christmas gifts, so they kids have not yet played with them and I so I cannot relate the kid's reactions and interactions. However, as with every "cool" toy I have gotten them in the past, I have opened the package and tested it out so that I can give them assistance when they start playing with it and here are my own initial reactions:Pros:Simple components set into a piece big enough that little hands can easily manage them without losing themComponents connect to each other magnetically so no dealing with wires, soldering irons,etcParts can be easily swapped to make different circuitsChildren can learn about input/output, action and reaction and the way circuits work in simple termsAll of these without having to connect to the app, or going to the computerThe website shows different projects that can be done with the components in the set, plus more advanced projects with the programming kit and even shows some parts not yet available (we must have the color spinner and the force sensor, stat!).There is also a community site where people can upload circuits that they created using the components.Cons:Limited pieces makes for limited play for the Edison Kit, even with the appI downloaded the the Android app, but couldn't get it to start on my phoneThe ios app may have worked on my spouse's phone, but we're out of memory, so the app froze before we couldn't play with it. (our fault, but I felt it was useful to know)I wish that some projects had been included in the box with the components, it would have made for an faster start for kids.The website project instructions only work properly in Firefox (which is available free of charge, but another step for anyone who just wants to open the box and start playing right away.I will be printing the project slides from the website and include it in the box for my kids to get started right away when they open them Christmas morning. I hope the Android app is fixed by then so the kids can move on to it to prolong the enjoyment.I for the future, I wish that duplicate components be available in extension kits, at a reasonable price and different input/output components be made available. It is a bit pricey, but I prefer paying a bit more for the convenience of not having to deal with tiny components, circuit boards and soldering irons, or breadboards, and allowing my child to explore the toy with his own hands.This toy has the potential to become a best selling toy, in my opinion. I just hope my kids like it as much as I do.
