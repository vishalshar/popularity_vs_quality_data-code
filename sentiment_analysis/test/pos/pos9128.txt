bought for a hospital unit for safety reasons.  non breakable.  we can use the spoons. forks too sharp -- very nice product.  lots of psych units looking for non-breakable eating utensils that do not look demeaning/insulting. probably not a market you would think.  we cannot use breakable plastic or metal sharp objects.  these are very nice.
