I've slept on the same box spring and just for half my life. My girlfriend said your bed sucks. So I started looking at beds and found this online. It is incredibly awesome! I didn't realize how sore my body was and how little sleep I was actually getting. Laying on it kind of feels firm but after you get use to it. It feels natural.  I've also noticed that I use less pillows. I used to be two or three stacker with the pillows. The price of the bed really isn't that bad comparing prices and the quality is really nice. I did not buy the boxspring I bought a platform. Do make sure you know the measurements of the bed you're getting before you buy it. Apparently I had a full-size bed and not a queen.  I bought a king not really thinking to much about the size. I just want to bigger bed. Best mistake ever!
