As the leader of a company football squad, I and my peers are always looking for a new means of playing better against our corporate rivals.  Being older but still enjoying the game, its fun finding so many new technologies out there that help us get a leg up.  I bought Grip Boost a short time ago because of the great reviews and the fact that it would be a new thing that we never tried.  What it seems to do was intriguing so we gave it a shot; I can now attest that this material definitely exceeded my expectations.  Weve already used it an uncountable amount of times, yet due to only having to use a small amount, the bottle is not even close to being used up.  Also, it dries in a snap and leaves absolutely nothing behind at all.  For anyone else out there that wants a great product that will only further enhance your play, this is definitely something you need to try out.
