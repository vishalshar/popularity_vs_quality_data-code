I would honestly state this device is more like its in Alpha/Beta stage. It has amazing potential and while it has a few quirks, based on my interactions with their customer service, they are constantly working on updating it.The only part I am not sure they will be able to fix is the fact that you can sync all freestyle exercises for tracking. You can only sync 15 at a time, which obviously is more than enough, however when I go to the gym I dont always have a plan on what I want to do. This limit has forced me to plan my exercises the day before and if a machine or area is being used by someone else, I cant switch to an alternative exercise.
