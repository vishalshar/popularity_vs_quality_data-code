Arrived with a dead battery, as others have reported.  Put in a CR2032, immediately wanted to download a firmware update to work on battery drain problem.  Installed the Android app OK, basically works like it should, although not sure how long it's going to hold the attention of a young kid.  Performance isn't quite as good as expected, it's a novelty that will likely end up in a drawer soon.
