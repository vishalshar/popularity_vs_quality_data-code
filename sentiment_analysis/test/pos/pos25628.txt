Well-made and arrived quickly.  I previously purchased an ESP8266 ESP-12E through another company on Amazon.  It came from China, took forever to arrive, was not constructed well and the wifi functionality did not work.  This unit from Acrobotic was a few dollars more, but I could immediately see it was much better quality and the wifi worked without any problems.  I'm very happy with this purchase!
