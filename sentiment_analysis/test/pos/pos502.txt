I purchased the iOttie Easy One Touch Mini CD Slot Car Mount Holder Cradle for my iPhone 6s about 2 weeks ago and love it.  I have driven around town and on a very long road trip and have had no issues with my phone falling out of the holder or the holder falling out of the CD slot.  The holder is sturdy and does grip the phone well and keep it in place.  There is plenty of clearance around the holder, and it rotates and adjusts so you can get it really close to any position you want it. I guess the true test of time will show how well the iOttie really holds up.  Love my purchase.
