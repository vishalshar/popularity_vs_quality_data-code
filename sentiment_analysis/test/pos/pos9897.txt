When  I first saw this product, I was a little hesitant but I bought it. Later on when it arrived I was excited to try it.  I follow the  directions  it applied to my gloves I tested it by going outside and trying to catch the football with one hand. And it did!!  Then I proceeded by trying to catch the ball with three fingers I'm no catcher but I caught the ball with three fingers!!  It did!! Best product ever recommend it to anyone who plays football that's a receiver or anything like that!!
