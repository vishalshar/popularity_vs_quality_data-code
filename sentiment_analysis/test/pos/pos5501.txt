In my opinion, best irrigation controller on the market.  I did a lot of research prior to purchasing.  The other 5 star reviews are absolutely accurate.With the web interface it's simple to get started, yet highly configurable.  Solid, well constructed product - It really feels like you've purchased something of industrial quality.  The support is excellent - knowledgeable and quick to respond - I called once (someone immediately picked up and answered my questions first time-no transfers) and e-mailed another time (received a clear detailed answer about my pump relay/master valve setup within an hour).I really like the fact that all of the processing and configuration is local to the controller.  Unlike Cloud based devices on the market that must be Internet connected, this one doesn't need an active Internet connection to manage the device in case of an Internet outage.  Several months ago I completed a 2 1/2 acre 14 zone installation with a temp sensor, pump relay and master valve and this unit handled it flawlessly. Very pleased.After installing this, it also seems like it would be a simple retrofit for folks looking to upgrade from their old dial based controller.
