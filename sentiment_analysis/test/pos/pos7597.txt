I just had to write a review on this product! I think it's an ingenious idea and I'm so glad I found it in my search for crib sheets. The "set" comes with the bottom portion and the top sheet. The two zip together and completely encase the crib mattress. The top sheet zippers off and on easily for midnight sheet changes. The bottom is basically put on just like a fitted sheet only on the underside of the mattress.After six months of use I can point out a few things I do and don't like about the sheets but overall I would buy them again and recommend them to any new mom. First I love that they are 100% cotton and hate that at the same time. I love it because it's known to be the safest fabric to use for your baby due to it's breathability. I hate it because anything that is 100% cotton will be wrinkly even strait from the dryer. The edges of this top sheet have the heavy duty, easy to use zipper that is covered by about and inch of fabric that extends past the zipper so baby isn't sleeping on the plastic zipper. This area around the edge may take some getting used to if you are thinking of the usual fitted sheet smoothness. May I just say that this lip around the edge of your baby's sleeping surface isn't necessarily a bad thing. It seems completely safe and when you have a baby in the crib that can not have anything to sleep with like a blanket or lovey until one year, this little one-inch piece of fabric around the edge has become somewhat of a soother for my daughter. She sometimes plays with it until she falls asleep. Back to the 100% cotton issue I mentioned earlier, these sheets MUST be ironed. That piece of fabric that overlays the zipper becomes very wrinkled and folds up exposing the zipper. Even with the need to iron these sheets I would still choose them again. I would rather iron when I have the time than pull up the crib mattress to change regular crib sheets in the middle of the night. One other problem I noticed with these is they do fit our crib mattress pretty snug but over time they do stretch a bit leaving a ripple on her mattress which worries me. I removed and washed the bottom sheet and it seems to have tightened back up but I would suggest the manufacturer add extra elastic to the bottom sheet to make certain they consistently remain snug.Like I mentioned earlier, I love these sheets and this idea in general. If you are lucky enough to come across these sheets please consider buying them. I bought two extra top sheets to go along with this set so I would always have extra top sheets on hand.
