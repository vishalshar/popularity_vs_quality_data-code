I bought this lock for my business. We have been using it on a inside door for almost a year now. It has been working almost perfectly this whole time. Installing the lock was pretty easy & straight forward. The included instructions are clear & easy to follow. Setting the lock up was not that hard after reading the directions a couple times. I personally like & use the number pad a lot more than the finger print scanner. The finger print scanner I'd say works 80% of the time. But that may be due to the scanner being dirty after so many uses. So a quick wipe will clear away any dirt or junk covering the scanner. After almost a year the battery still hasn't needed to be changed.
