I had never tried ghee before but recently read several strong recommendations as to the beauty benefits of incorporating ghee into one's diet, so I decided to give it a try. After the initial apprehension, it has really grown on me! I use about 1 tsp of ghee in my morning coffee along with some cinnamon and coconut milk and it tastes downright decadent! The vanilla flavor is subtle but adds so much flavor and comfort to any hot drink. I even added some of this vanilla-flavored ghee to a cup of tea on a particularly cold winter night and it really improved my mood.
