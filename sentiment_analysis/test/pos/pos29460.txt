I use them on my gym shoes, as I tried them on my daily driver shoes, and they did not hold up very well. I broke 4 of them in a week.On my gym shoes though, they are great, get in and out of the shoes fast, no laces hanging around getting caught on things. Shoes are not too tight or too loose, just right. Now, keep in mind I have large feet, a 13-14 triple E shoes. and these work for me. If you have smaller feet, you might have to mess with them a bit to get them to fit they way you want them.
