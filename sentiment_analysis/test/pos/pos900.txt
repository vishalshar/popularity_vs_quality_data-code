Works well for my purposes. Set it up to sound alarm and send an alert to my phone when the motion sensor detects motion. Several different sounds are available as well as length of time the alarm goes off. If your looking for a DIY system to deter a break in or alert you when you are away, this device works. Set up didn't pair with my router as advertised, but the manual setup using my iPhone was easy enough.
