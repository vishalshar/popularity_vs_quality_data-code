I am one, and I bought this game to play with friends who are investors.  It does play like Monopoly, but the Volatility Cards are spot on.  My friends' two granddaughters, ages 10 and 13, had no problem playing the game and enjoyed it.  Somewhat frighteningly, they seemed to understand it!  If they lived nearby, I'd set them up with papertrading accounts and teach them some simple tech analysis rules.  They are safe from me, however, since they were only visiting.  Or maybe I am safe from being out-traded by them!
