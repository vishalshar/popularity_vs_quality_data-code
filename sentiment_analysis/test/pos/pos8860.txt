This is one of the best purchases I've had for a long time. I already have 3 different IP cameras which none of them rotate like this camera. Here are some points about it:A) the camera rotates full 360 which gives me a large view at homeB) the installation was extremly easy. I set it up without any failure on my iphone. Took just a few minutes.C) the video resolution is very clearD) I like the ability to use my SD card and I'm very happy there is no cloud chargeWhat could be better:A) the alerts are very sensitiveB) the app could use more instruction
