Before getting the Apple Watch I was the chunky watch guy. I have 4 Invicta Russian Divers and a few others with leather cuffs. The available Apple Watch bands don't have the size or ruggedness that I'm used to. The Epik fills the void. I've purchased and returned about 4 other watch bands that looked good in the picture but felt flimsy. When I took the Epik out of the very stylish packaging I was more than happily. The bezel and button were a concern but they work fine. Waited for this one for a while. Amazon was out of stock and the price at Linatik was about $15 more. It was worth the wait.
