Personally, it's a pretty nice coincidence that the variety pack has a guard for all my brushes. I love that it keeps the shape of the brushes, but I wouldn't recommend using them to store the brushes, only to maintain the shape after cleaning them. It might be that I'm using the wrong size for the brush, but I find that these are a little too snug for everyday storage and I have to fluff them out a little before applying product. However, I don't regret getting these because the hairs on my brushes were becoming too flared out.
