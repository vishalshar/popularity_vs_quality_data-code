This little machine makes bottled/canned beer taste the way it was originally intended by the brewmaster. That is the best way to describe the difference in taste. My GF and I aren't big beer drinkers and almost never drink canned/bottled beer, but we do enjoy a beer on tap at a bar occasionally. Fizzics brings the bar tap taste and feel of beer anywhere you want since its battery operated, appropriately sized, and light weight. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who drinks beer.
