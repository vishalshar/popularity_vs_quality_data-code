Pros* Easy setup* Short play time* Plays up to 12Cons* Some of the tiles the forensic scientist use can be utterly useless* We found the means and clue cards should have been biggerThis game is an absolute blast! I have Mysterium and we found it somewhat interesting, and have pulled it out a few times, but this game just destroys it. Yes they are totally different, but kind of have the same 'Clue' feeling, trying to figure out who did it. If we have a choice to play only one, it will always be Deception!With handing out the role cards to everyone, and 4 means cards and 4 clue cards to all but the forensic scientist, not game will ever be the same! This is a total party game. The most I have played with so far is 7, and for the most part, nobody was sitting in their seat. They were all standing, or walking around the table to get a good look at each others cards, and it got decently loud with people accusing each other. This game is a must in my opinion!
