I received the Sense as a gift from my daughter. The Sense globe is a beauty. It's like a friend watching over my sleep.On a practical level, it monitors my sleep, i am amazed to see that this little artificial life is able to monitor my sleep, i did not pay attention to my nights before, now I know all that has happened. I appreciate knowing my sleep score, sleep duration and the conditions in my room.I appreciate knowing that the air quality in my room is way below  a satisfactory level, knowing that it is according to the US standard which is 80mug/m3 max, which is its already lower than the EU standard of 120mug/m3 max where I leave.
