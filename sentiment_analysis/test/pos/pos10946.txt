The horn, being man-made, is perfectly fine, as it is exactly as pictured. My problem is with the stand. It is VERY light, and falls down pretty much constantly. It needs bottom weights. If the bottom rim were 1/4 inch, maybe 1/2, the purchaser could glue weights to the bottom, and bot pay for shipping the weight, or the weight could cost 1-3 bucks more.
