This phone is pretty cool. It comes with a case, charger, phone screen protector and headphones. I like this phone a lot for what it does. The only reason I did not rate it with 5 stars is because it is kind of slow but then again it gets all android apps and is probably the best phone I have purchased for the price. The only app I have had a problem with using is Google Maps which is huge. However, considering all the accessories come with including the screen protector and case I would give it 4 1/2 but that's not an option on Amazon lol. It is compatible with my lifestyle as college student and mom. I would recommend buying if you are looking for a phone that is simple, cheap and effective.
