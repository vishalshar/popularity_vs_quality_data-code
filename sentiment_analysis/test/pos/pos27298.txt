This is an excellent product for the busy brewer who doesn't have a lot of time to drag out the equipment and spend the rest of the day cleaning. It's been a great introduction to my friends who aren't brewers to teach them "what the picobrew is doing now"... was easier for them to comprehend. Making some great brews out of this and love the precise adjustments you can make to tweak a recipe. We brew a LOT more often now that we have a permanent place for this. It's always looking at me and begging me to brew. Now I just need to expand my kegerator so I can have more on tap.Customer service is incredible. Had an issue with a piece of the foam trap breaking and they immediately sent a replacement that arrived 2 days later.
