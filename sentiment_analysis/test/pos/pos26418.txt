I love this product.  I use it with my Galaxy Note 4 and it works like a charm.  I can even charge my phone while it is sitting on the Mountek which is extra convenient.  It sits perfectly in my CD holder (no cd inserted) without an issue.  The Mountek also allows my phone to not obstruct my view to the road and ensures safe navigation.  Wish I found this sooner!
