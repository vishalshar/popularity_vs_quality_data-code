While I've only had this a few days, so far it's far better than I expected. A few notes about some issues users report.1. The phone as of 2016-05-18 did NOT work on metropcs, so save your time, at least not in my area. T-Mobile and ATT are fine. I believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs, that's incorrect. It will work on any network that accepts unlocked GSM phones.2. The usb charger is not hard to work around, all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug, take a hardware store razor blade, and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part, it's really not difficult, and there's no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable, I just cut away at about a 45 degree angle and a standard cable fit fine. The case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body, so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other. Without this cable mod, the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable, with it, it's fine.3. Standby battery  life is quite good, but when you use it for anything, the battery drains fast, but that's why it only weighs 52 grams, you can't expect a tiny battery to have a long life, that's not realistic.This little phone is amazing, they've actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device. Typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny, but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingers.In terms of size, this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone I have.I can't think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc, and for me, I prefer this small size, I almost never carry my full sized smart phone because I just don't like that size.I won't know for a year how durable this thing actually is, but honestly, at the price, I don't even care if it fails, you can buy 12 of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy, and they aren't nearly as adorable.
