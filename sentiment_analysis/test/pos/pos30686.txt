Funny and easy to play, good for people who don't like traditional group games. No strategy involved, rules are more of a suggestion, and no one really cares about winning. My kind of game! The hardest I've laughed in a while was when we all just started playing one card at a time, taking turns, building a long comic together. Hilarious!
