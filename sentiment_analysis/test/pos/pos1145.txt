This is absolutely adorable. My seven year old WANTED this so bad if she didnt get it she told me Mom, my life would be incomplete if I couldnt draw my monsters, I need this. PLEASE! Well after I was done laughing at her drama queen antics I went ahead and bought this for her. She has used it every single day. First off it comes in a sturdy box to keep all of your materials in. Then inside this box is a very nice sized creative white board allowing her to draw without worrying about cracks in the floor or little specks on the table that mess up her drawing, followed by this adorable blue fuzzy eraser pouch that she uses to keep all of her markers in, finally it comes with three apps to keep her entertained for quite some time. She loves this set and I love how much fun she has with it, definitely one of the better items I have bought for my family.
