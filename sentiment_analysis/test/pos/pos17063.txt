Since buying the iphone 6 over a year ago I couldn't find a decent mountain bike mount. I've gone through 4 different mounts and several cases arriving at this one. I like that the quad lock is light weight, easy to use, mounts in the center and feels secure and doesn't wobble around. Every other case either broke, weighed too much or wasn't strong enough for the harsh conditions I ride (lifeproof). Only downside is quadlock isn't submersible which most people probably don't need.
