We've been using this collar on our dachshund for about 2 weeks.  It has worked well so far but I think I need to increase the level of correction.  My dog likes to run around the yard really fast and yesterday she was running right through the fence without any problem.  She would also come right back into my yard.  I think this collar is a little less sensitive than the bigger dog collars.  We have had the underground fence for 5 or 6 years with our bigger dog and had no problems.  This collar required us to run all new wire but once we did it has worked fine.  I haven't had problems with the battery but we always turn the collar off when we take it off the dog.  I will definitely try to replace the little battery inside the holder once it dies.  That will save a lot of money so I hope it works for us.My only complaint is the length of the prongs.  I wish there were smaller "nub" type prongs for small dogs with very little hair.  The prongs are uncomfortable for my little dog and sometimes when she is breathing hard (after running) she seems to be struggling with them.  I have the collar as loose as possible with the prongs barely touching her skin.
