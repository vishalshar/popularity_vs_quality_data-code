I've had a subscription to these for a few months, because even though I was bummed about then using folic acid instead of folate, my son did so well on them I put that concern aside.  Just got my new bottle for this month and it came with a huge tag reading "now with active folate!"  Now they are perfect.My son had been having crazy poop accidents that I found out were due to extreme constipation. I tried probiotics and fiber supplements....didn't help. Even since we started these, he's been regular as clockwork, and no longer complains of tummy aches.  And they are so tasty that if I forget to give them to him, he reminds me.Thanks for listening to your customers, Smartypants!  Now hopefully Amazon will get rid of the critical reviews that are no longer relevant.
