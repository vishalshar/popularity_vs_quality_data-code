This is my first time using a thermal attachment for my phone. Since the lens on this model comes pre-zoomed in, it can be difficult to take wide photos of very close objects. This device expands a normally small image to fit a larger HD smart phone screen. Thermal cameras, especially in this price range, are not meant to be HD. Keeping that in mind I have no complaints so far. So far we used it to find heat loss around the house and played around with it a little outside.I attached several images to this review. Two in back/white mode and one in color mode of my son about 150 feet away at night. Two indoors with the lights on, and residual hand print after leaving my hand on a flat surface for five seconds and waiting about 1 minute.
