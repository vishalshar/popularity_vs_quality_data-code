Overall I like this product even i am having some issues with this device often.Sometime OS hung itself by opening or switching application. Need to reboot the phone to make it working again. Happening often.With this price and 64 GB, dual sim and unlock phone, i found it is better then Samsung Galaxy S5 which uses same OS and you pay high price with less configuration.
