The bottle did not work out for me (for some reason the water still tasted like plastic). Clean Bottle got in contact with me and helped determine some other products might fix that issue and issued a refund for the bottle.Really incredible service, and I wanted a review here to reflect that. A lot of other people don't seem to have my problem so it may very well just be me, but I can't say enough good things about the makers of the bottle.
