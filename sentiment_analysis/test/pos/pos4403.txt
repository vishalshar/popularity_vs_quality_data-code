This reminds me of Neutrogena's Lash Tint with more staying power. Didn't survive 4 days but 1 to 2 days OR a nice long shower/bath. It colors lashes and brows decently which is what I wanted. Not much added volume or length. If you want a natural, low to no makeup look this is great. Also great if you're camping or outdoors. If you don't want the hassle of makeup but still want a little eye enhancement that wont run everywhere, this is a very good option.
