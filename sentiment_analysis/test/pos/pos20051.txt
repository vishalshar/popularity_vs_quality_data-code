I ordered Mevo for my food blogging not really knowing what to expect as I was trying to find the best device to stream to Facebook lIve (without going too overboard with the big bucks!). I was skeptical at first since I'm new to the whole live streaming trend on social media, but I cannot be more satisfied with the results. Only slight con would be that I wish the battery lasted longer, but there is a Mevo boost accessory available that gives it an additional 10 hours of battery life which I'm probably going to buy.  But overall very satisfied with this product!
