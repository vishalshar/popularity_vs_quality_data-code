I like the fact that this product is NOT a mascara and it actually does more good for my lashes than harm. It is lightly tinted in a gray tone and it does smear and rubs off easily, also, it does clump if you put on a 2nd or 3rd coat so be sure to brush it out to prevent that from happening. Overall, I am pleased with this product and would continue to buy/use it in the future.
