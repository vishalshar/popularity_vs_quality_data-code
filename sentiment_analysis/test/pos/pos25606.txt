the hands open and close but I've not been able to grab anything yet, maybe with practice.  my son loves it.when you turn it on or off, it Yawns, and stretches.  if you make it hit itself it grunts ouch, some times it sounds like its farting.  I haven't found any real vocabulary yet just grunts and noises.
