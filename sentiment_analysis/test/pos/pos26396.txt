Great game for helping kids understand factors and learn their multiplication/division (and addition/subtraction) facts, plus it's FUN!  The part that initially drew me in for where my kids are was the color coding of the basic primes, and by extension the use of those colors to represent factors in the products.  Then, it arrived and the gameplay was really fun--there are two ten sided dice and you can add, subtract, multiply or divide the number you are on by each die in turn to move. If you land on a prime you get to draw a Prime Card, which you can either use right away or save for later to benefit yourself or target an opponent, depending on whether the card is an Action card or Keeper. The first person to move both pawns to 101 wins.  If you get tired of the standard rules, though, they apparently have some variations here:  [...]  but I have not yet tried any--looking forward to doing so after we've played through a few more times.Oh and keep in mind that it takes longer the more players there are--folks with younger kids might want to keep it to 2 or 3 players so it doesn't go so long, or modify the rules so people don't get sent back to start so often. I'm sure there are cooperative ways to play too if that's more up someone's alley, like it was for us when the kids were younger.
