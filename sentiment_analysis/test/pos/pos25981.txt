Ideal toy 4 sumone weighing 175 lbs 2 have a lil fun getting around. Runs smoothly on propane, adequate acceleration, gr8 top speed but doesn't idle ideally N adjustment screw was cross-threaded so I left it unadjusted. Breaks needed 2 be adjusted slightly otherwise superb braking. Pull-started after juss 5 sum pulls. I reside in North Dakota so snow covered residential streets do not provide an ideal surface 2 ride, highly suggest against doing so...
