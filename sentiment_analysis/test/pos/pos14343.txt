After upgrading to an iPhone 6 plus I couldn't decide where or how to carry it. I tried several different bags that didn't work. This was perfect! I bought it for the Star Wars Celebration and loved having my phone, cash, and Chapstick close at hand versus buried in my backpack. I've since used it on runs, and at swim meets and will take it to Disneyland this summer.
