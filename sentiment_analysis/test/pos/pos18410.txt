Takes the stress out of measuring. I especially like the feature of having it add the length of the measuring tape. I bought this due to measuring blinds for my home. I was stressed because if you're off by 1/4 of an inch, then they don't fit right. I am more confident with this and not having to count the marks and remind myself if it's an 1/8 of an inch or a 1/16 of an inch.
