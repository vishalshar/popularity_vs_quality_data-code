Really happy with these.  Previously, I was unable to use the Apple Earpods as they just kept falling out. I had resorted to spending too much on the Bose mobile headsets as for me these were the only design to stay in place during running.  But the Bose are not very durable and seemed to only last me 1 year before falling apart.  When I saw these Earhoox, I thought it looked like a way to convert the Apple earpods into something close to the very effective Bose design. The result has been pretty much as I hoped - I can now not only use the earpods, but use them for running also.  As an unexpected bonus - now that the earpods are held in the right  position, I found out they sound significantly better than expected - far better than previous versions Apple has made, and possibly even better than the Bose itself.
