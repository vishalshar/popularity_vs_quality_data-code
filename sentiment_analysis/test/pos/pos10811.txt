I have been using LEAF for a bout a month before I decided to purchase it as a birthday present for my best friend; I think that says a lot about this little gem. It's absolutely beautiful: classy, yet unassuming, which is why I got it in the first place. It's silver/natural wood and it blends easily with anything I wear at work, while it also upgrades any old rag I wear around the house! There is never, ever a need to charge it as it's battery operated and so many times I forget that I'm wearing it until I get a compliment about my 'brooch' or my 'necklace' :). I wear many open blouses and it's nice to  have a beautiful, functional statement accessory.I was somewhat doubtful about the specs, but the tracker of my activities paid off in just a few days. It took me some time to learn how to synch it (bluetooth/tapping) and to figure out everything it can do and track: walking (steps), plethora of pre-set activities, sleep, ovulation and breathing exercises. I started paying attention to two things in particular: the chart of my walking activity and my often-interrupted sleep cycle. LEAF app made me realize just how unaware I was of my static condition at times and I learned how to set the alarm to notify me when my inactivity is, well, alarming. I do a lot of work both sitting and standing and I need to be reminded when I have not been moving for a long time. Integrated breathing exercises have helped me calm down at times; they are great for a short meditation and the last thing I do before I go to sleep these days. Although I still wake up during the night I find that this approach significantly reduced me waking up in the first hours of sleep, which was the worst.I'm one happy camper when it comes to LEAF and everything it provides; it completely suits my lifestyle and it makes my life so much easier when I don't need to think about regular updating or charging. It's like a small, silent heart always close to mine.Guess what's everybody getting for Christmas this year? :))
