Before I jump into my review of the car mount, I'd just like to mention how blown away I've been by iOttie's customer service. After having the product for a week or so, I got a phone call asking how the product was working out. Who does this? Not too many people I know of.And now, for the review of the car mount. I use mine for an iPhone 6S Plus in my 2014 Hyundai Veloster. The car mount kit comes with two options for adhering the metal piece to your device -- one for in between your case and phone, and the other for the outside of your case. For aesthetics, I chose to adhere the metal plate between my case and the phone (on the inside of the case). I was a little surprised and disappointed that the magnet wasn't as strong as I expected for a "rare earth" magnet. During the conversation I had with iOttie Customer Service rep, she asked what kind of case I had on my phone, and at the time, I hadn't considered the thickness of my case might be the issue (duh!). I like to use Tech21 cases on my devices, and if you don't know, they're sort of middle-of-the-road in terms of thickness (NOT Otterbox thickness by a long stretch). Anyway, I mentioned my disappointment with the strength of the magnet and she shipped an ENTIRE replacement kit and recommended I adhere the small circle metal plate on the outside of my phone case. I did this and it doesn't look near as bad as I envisioned (see picture) and the full strength of the magnet is now realized and is amazing! Even before the replacement, the magnet held on to my phone over many potholes and railroad tracks in Lafayette, Indiana.This varies CD slot model-by-model, but I also used the small insert that comes with the kit to make for a tighter fit in my CD slot. Finally, I'm using the CD slot for something useful! I recommend this unit to anyone who wants the convenience of being able to quickly mount/unmount your phone from your dash.
