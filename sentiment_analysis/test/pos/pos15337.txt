I would give it 5 stars but unfortunately customer service is quite disappointing. I've purchased it 2 weeks ago and during the last week I've tried to contact them to ask them about some issues with the left earphone (sometimes it disconnects while the right one keeps working and I don't even move from my laptop) and with the app (sometimes it shuts down just after I open it and I have to restart my laptop to get it functioning properly), but they didn't answer me. On the other hand, the device is amazing! I managed to make phone calls with it without issues when I was at home and when I was driving to work. The audio transparency is awesome! I am still getting used to it because I hear any noise around me as if it were just right inside my ear. At least once a week I swim so I will try it to see how it works (although I have my concerns due to the fact that the chlorine could harm the device in a long term, though the website of Bragi gives you some advice on how to take care of the earphones after using it inside the water). The charger is wonderful! The outside cover seems to be made of metal and that gives the earphones a good protection against a possible unintented hit.A little advice to anyone who is thinking about buying this beauty: The instructions says that you have to give the earphones a full charge before activating and using them, but it doesn't say anything about the charger. During that moment I didn't know that the light in the charger changes as its charge level does the same (as with the earphones, the red light indicates a low charge as the green one indicates a good level of charge). I just checked that the earphones reached its full charge but I didn't pay attention to the charge level of the charger (I unplugged the whole set when the charger had had a red light), big mistake! now I've been wondering if the charger is not working at its full capacity because of it.Another big pro of this wonder is that the manufacturers have really thought about everything: from the box (which is wonderful, I won't throw it away) until the sleeves! They have thought of every different ear size. Personally, I find the small size too big for my ears (and I think my ears have an average size), so the extra small sleeves fit me perfectly.A final tip: Even though the earphones fits firmly in your ears (using the proper sleeve), I would recommend purchasing the leash (it is as a pre-order item in Amazon -I don't why! it's been available for a long time- but in its own page you can find it) for the people who want to use it during activities that require a lot of movement. The leash is great, and even with the extra small sleeves it guarantees you a free movement of your head without losing your earphones.UPDATE (11/01): I managed to get customer support through their facebook official page (apparently they pay more attention to it than to the mails send through their website) and they helped me to solve my problems (it was a software problem, so resetting the device was enough), so I give it one more star (it could be 5 stars but they still have to improve their customer service). Last week I used the earphones during swimming and I am more than pleased with their performance! I could perfectly listen to music during my exercises, the touch controls worked perfectly and they didn't fall off from my ears (although I wore the leash just in case).One more thing: consider all the reviews from October to now, since they updated their software in that month. Before this update, the bluetooth connectivity was lame, now you can confidently stay a considerate distance away from the device which your dash is paired with.
