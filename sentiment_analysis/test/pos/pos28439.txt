ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Where has this been all my life???We typically cook with time.  We use a heat source much hotter than we want the food to be. Nobody wants a casserole to actually reach 375 degrees. We all know what happens if it does.We want it to maybe get to 150-160, and then take it out of the overheated oven. Timing is critical to avoid undercooking or overcooking.With sous vide, you cook with temperature, not time. You use a water bath at a precisely controlled temperature.  This is the temperature that you want your food to achieve (all the way through). So you CANNOT overcook your food, because it will never get hotter than the bath. You CANNOT undercook your food if you leave it in the bath for the minimum time. So your food is PERFECT every time.Your idea of "perfect" might not be the same as mine.  Expect to do a bit of experimentation at first. If you cook above 130 degrees (F) then your food will never be unsafe - it is considered Pasteurized, and free from any harmful bacteria or parasites (131 degrees is the perfect mid-rare steak, BTW). Once you find YOUR ideal temperature, you can reproduce it EVERY SINGLE TIME without fail.Tough cuts of meat (typically smoked, in BBQ) such as beef brisket, pork shoulder roast (Boston butt), and ribs will be THE MOST TENDER THING YOU HAVE EVER EATEN.  Rib meat literally FALLS OFF THE BONE (try sous vide baby back ribs - pure heaven). Forget about slicing a sous vide pot roast - it crumbles beneath a knife. The cheapest cuts of meat become tender delicacies that your family can't eat fast enough.This is a revolutionary approach to cooking that is NOTHING like regular cooking.  DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME without some expert guidance.  I am indebted to expert author Jason Logsdon for his book, "Modernist Cooking Made Easy: Sous Vide: The Authoritative Guide to Low Temperature Precision Cooking" which I highly recommend. You will learn about the importance (and the method) of searing certain meats to achieve the Maillard reaction (the same reaction that makes golden bread crust so tasty).I created my own sous vide bath "appliance" using an Igloo 12-Quart Quantum Cooler. The lid has two molded cup holders. I used a 2.5" hole saw to drill a hole in one of the holder depressions. This is a perfect fit for the Anova cooker (the black part must be able to "breathe"). The insulated walls of the cooler make this HIGHLY energy efficient and help maintain the precision temperature.AND HERE'S A FREE BONUS FOR READING THIS FAR: a scientist (me) weighs in on two "confrontational" sous vide topics:1) Sear meat BEFORE you sous vide it, not afterward. The scientific rationale:  We don't want to impart any more heat into the meat than necessary to achieve the tasty Mallard reaction.  We want to impart heat only onto the surface, not into the core. It is TRUE that searing cold meat will impart MORE heat into the core (since the thermal gradient is higher, which accelerates heat transfer). However, this heat should fall well below our intended target temperature, so it does not affect the outcome.  HOWEVER, if you prepare the perfect mid-rare steak at 131 degrees and THEN sear it, you will impart SOME additional heat into the core that you do NOT want.  SOME of the meat (near the surface) will exceed the target temperature, and become overcooked.2) You DO NOT need to get the bath to your target temperature BEFORE you begin cooking. You should always start out with fresh hot tap water in your bath. This will already be 120-130 degrees (F). It is ALREADY significantly hotter than whatever you are putting in the bath. Heat transfer begins immediately.  It might take a few minutes more for the bath temperature to stabilize at your target, but the food has been heated the whole time.
