We live on a 5 acre small farm and our Wheaten Terrier gets to free roam the farm when I'm home so I wanted some way to keep tabs on my sweet Farm Dog Freya! Well I found "Whistle" and have been a poster child for them ever since. I love that it has a "Zone" and when she is out of her safe zone I get a notification to my cell phone and can pop open the app and see where she is. I was concerned when I was looking at this product because some of the reviews were saying that the device was not accurate with GPS but I have found it to be very accurate. I tested the device one day when my wife was bringing Freya into town, I got the notification and decided to "Track" my wife and Freya as they drove to town. This is about a 30 minute drive and I was able to refresh the tracking every 3 minutes and when they arrived it showed them as being in the parking lot. The battery life is great, I get anywhere from 2-3 weeks with a single charge. To charge it I just take it off over night while Freya is sleeping and put it back on the next morning fully charged.The fitness part is neat but I am not a huge fitness nut so I probably under utilize that portion of the device. Though it was nice to be able to see how much activity Freya was getting while I was out of state on vacation, and I even had the peace of mind with the GPS. I can say that the fitness portion is accurate as well from what I tested with it. It showed her activity when I had her out on the farm and even showed her resting state when she was in the house chilling.Another thing that I love is it has integration with the app IFTTT which allows it to interact with other internet connected devices. So I am planning on creating a rule for my home automation that will set off an alarm in the house when she is out of her zone which will be helpful if I am inside and not near my phone.Overall I can say that I really love the peace of mind that the device gives me and I recommend it to everyone that owns a dog!
