I really dig this suitcase. The tech functionality delivers as promised, with an easy-to-use integration between the suitcase and app. The locking mechanism is great (though I do appreciate having the backup TSA lock keys included in the shipment), the weight scale appears to read accurately, and the GPS is nice for peace of mind. I like having the option of switching my suitcase to "airplane mode" so that it doesn't drain battery -- and so that people stop staring at my glowing, space-age bag when I'm trying to fly under the radar at 6AM before coffee or makeup. The exterior laptop sleeve is nice for TSA. Beware, however, that if you've packed the interior of your bag fully, it can be too snug to remove your laptop without unzipping the suitcase.In my opinion, the only drawback of the bag is that it's fairly small in terms of interior space. I own other carry-on roller bags that can pack 30-40% more. That said, the limited space forces me to pare down on the unnecessary items, so maybe that's really a bonus.All in all, the Bluesmart offers great features, great design, and great mobility. I believe it's well worth the investment in a new, "smart" suitcase.
