I purchased my first Clean Boytle at the Honolulu Marathon Expo a few years ago. I love the cleaning concept, with being able to take both ends off the bottle!  When I saw Amazon selling them I purchased another one without hesitation. I've cleaned it both by hand and put it in the dishwasher with no issues at all.
