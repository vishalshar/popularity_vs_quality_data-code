I purchases in middle of Aug.  I really like the but by the end of Oct they were breaking.  And they start to break they go like dominoes.Most likely I will  reorder but I need to research how long the  company says are expected to last.  I was hoping they would last more than 2 and half months.  I would recommend keeping a pair of shoe laces just in case.
