I really like this amp.  I am a casual player and wanted something easy to use and this is it.  Updated firmware through my PC, hooked up through my android phone and I was off.  There are a lot of features I am just starting to get in to, but love the ability to use it to also play my music.  Speakers sound great, no connection issues.  As I said though, I'm a casual player, if you are a serious player read other reviews to get input.
