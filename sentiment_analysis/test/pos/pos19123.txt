I purchased this for a family member after having seen a review on YouTube that was just too unbelievable. Sure enough, the thing doesn't fall over and without breaking the mechanism, I doubt you could force it over. It is truly crazy. I plan on getting another one for myself for my kayak as it will not tip over even in the roughest of seas. Every cup should have this technology.
