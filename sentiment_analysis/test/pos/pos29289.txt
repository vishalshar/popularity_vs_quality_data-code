My friends recommended me this camera as a simple option for "spying" at our cat while we are at work. It was simple to set it up and get the video feed working on my phone. What I was really surprised with is the quality of video that this camera provides. Now I need to figure out how to set up my own YouTube channel for all these cat videos.
