If you have kids and you want to get them interested in computers, don't pass this up. It's not really "building a computer", it's putting a Raspberry Pi 2 in a case and connecting up HDMI, speaker, and power cables. The components to do this cost about the same as the Kano so you could do this yourself.But the Kano offers a great instruction book that keeps the kid engaged, and the software is incredible. It's a fantastic learning tool for kids, and honestly, it could work really well for adults who are curious about programming, as many of the included bits of software focus on learning to code.
