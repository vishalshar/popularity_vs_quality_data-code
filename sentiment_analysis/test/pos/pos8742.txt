Exactly what I was looking for to protect my toddler 's iPad Mini.  The handle  made it even better. A cute factor of 10 out of 10 when she walks around the house holding it by the handle.  She hasn't  yet done a discus throw with it as yet but I'm more confident  that the iPad will survive when she eventually  get around to it. Highly recommended.
