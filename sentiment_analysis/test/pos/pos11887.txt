Bought for a long-time friend's 50th birthday. Sent via mail and got some very entertaining texts and videos ... Nice card, Damn thing won't turn off ... This thing sucks ... I'm throwing it away ... Left for dinner and it's still going when I got home ... Mother of god it finally died ... Best present ever.
