I bought these to use with our Echo, and they are amazing. We have a newborn, and it is very nice being able to give voice commands to turn on our lamps at night. The mobile application is also great, and I sometimes turn on lights before we get home if it is late at night. They were a little difficult to set up, and I kept encountering error messages, but finally got them to work.
