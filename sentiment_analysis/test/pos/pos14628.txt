I bought two of these as a Christmas gift for my manager who is ALWAYS misplacing both sets of keys, and if it's not the keys he can't find, it's his phone. He's not extremely tech-savvy, so I did have to walk him through using the app the first time, but after a few days (and plenty of opportunities to practice, LOL) he was able to fully use all features. He loves the color-coded range display that shows how far away each Honey is; he loves making them beep to find them, or using them to make his phone beep to find it (yes, we can do this with Google's built-in locator software, but it's so much easier to pick up his keys and press a single button rather than have to borrow someone else's smart device and log in and such); he doesn't so much love the "you're getting too far away from your keys" alarm, since he frequently makes our daily bank trips and leaves his keys in the car, and then the REALLY loud siren noise goes off in the bank and security came running toward him... Yeah, we'd like to change the ringtone on that, which the app currently doesn't allow, but one minor thing in such an otherwise perfect product doesn't even merit a half-star downgrade. He frequently says it's the most useful gift anyone's ever gotten him (and he's 50+, so he's received a good few gifts in his lifetime) and it's helped make me his favorite employee. I joke with him that I'm getting him more Honeys for his birthday for everything else he frequently loses, and at this price point, maybe I really will!
