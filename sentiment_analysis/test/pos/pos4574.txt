I bought a set of these in the multi color pack to use on a new pair of running sneakers that came with laces that were way too short. It took a few times trying different methods to insert them to find the perfect fit and get the colors to be symmetrical  (if you go to www.hickies.com there are videos on ways to lace them according to whether you need a tight or loose fit). I have wide feet so i made them looser, so they will definitely work for pretty much anyone. I've run in them quite a few times now and they've never come undone or stretched out. I love these things and I'll definitely be getting more!!
