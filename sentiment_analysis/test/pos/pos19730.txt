5 stars because it works for the basic function I need: wirelessly using a MIDI keyboard with my iOS apps. I don't have any particular need of any esoteric features or MIDI support. The manual could be a lot better. You need to download their app to get it going, and I needed a firmware update before it would respond to being turned off. But after that hiccup it's been smooth sailing.
