This thing is awesome! Finally a little bit of peace of mind while I'm working 10 miles away... It's amazing to have the GPS notifications every time my pup goes on a dog walk... and one when he is back home. It's also quite fun seeing how much he is running and getting exercise... Makes it really easy to not "worry", and better in my opinion than paying for a camera service to watch him. We would always get worried if he was "gone" as he can be crafty... Not anymore!
