I LOVE being able to check on my dog while I'm at work, the peace of mind is so worth this product. Also, the option of interacting with them while you're away makes it extra super cool. The app is super user-friendly, and the camera is pretty decent quality. The audio can be a little spotty and the cookie dispensing feature is a bit loud sort of launches the cookies which was a little startling for my pup and cause her to run away from the unit, but she got in the habit of coming back to find the cookie.
