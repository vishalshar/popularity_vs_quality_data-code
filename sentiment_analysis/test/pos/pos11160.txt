I love these. I had to experiment with different ways of putting it on for the correct tension but they hold my shoes on my feet better than shoe laces and they're very easy to slip on and off my feet. They make my shoes feel very comfortable on my feet every time, unlike shoelaces which sometimes feel too tight and other times too loose not to mention I step on my laces all the time. I have 6 extra left over links I guess if any break. I'll be using these instead of shoe laces for all my shoes from now on.
