I've used the product for a few months now and it doesn't knock over (as promised).The only few downsides is that it doesn't hold as much volume as it looks like it could. The regular "small" one that I bought for my dad fits about a cup of liquid. The biggie "large" one I got fits a bit more than 2 cops of liquid.The biggest downside for me, the reason why it's not a 5/5, is that it retains the smell of whatever liquid you pour in there. I initially used the product to drink water and coffee. I noticed after a few days that it smelled like coffee empty. Several washes later it still smelled like coffee. *Here is my big mistake*, I mistakenly thought that putting mango-peach tea in it, it would over power the smell of coffee and leave a pleasant mango-peachy smell that I can enjoy from now on. Nope. It held both smells and now it smells like a weird, sickly love child of coffee and mango-peach tea. This is my mistake and I have to live with it but hopefully you guys will learn from my mistakes.
