So far, super easy!I purchased this unit because I can never remember to set longer or shorter zone times based on the season, this unit not only adjusts seasonally, but also adjusts daily based on local weather.Once I got the old unit out of the way I was up and running in about 15 minutes. Setup is so easy you do all your programming from your smart phone or tablet. I walked the property as I set up and tested each zone, flawlessly I might add.One thing I have not yet figured out is how long it waters each zone in the automatic mode? But so far grass is green-
