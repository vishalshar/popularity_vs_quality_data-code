The Mega Tiny case works just exactly as described. I actually thought I'd use it mainly for selfies.or reading recipes while cooking. But, I like the fact that it sticks to most table tops & surfaces loosely because I'm always running at top speed & invariably leave my phone somewhere unprotected. With this case, it stays right where I put it & doesn't get knocked off whatever surface I've set it on until I'm ready to get it & go again. Lightweight, too.
