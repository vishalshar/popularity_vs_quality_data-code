Amazing product. After losing 3 cats to coyotes we needed a way to keep the cats in the yard but be able to let the dogs & cats freely go out the dog door. I was a little skeptical but it works amazingly. I ran the wire on top of our 6 foot fence and just set the range to 6 foot. I tested 3 setting on myself and shocked me enough to drop the collar. The cats learn almost instantly & no training needed. I think the reason the product works so well is the warning tone. The cats learn right away after getting jolted that the warning tone means stay away. Both cats do not mind the collar at all and we were able to fit it to the smaller cats neck. The wire has to form a "loop" so keep that in mind when installing.
