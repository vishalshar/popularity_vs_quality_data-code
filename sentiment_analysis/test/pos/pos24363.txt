It looks well-made, but I didn't get a chance to use it. The reason is because it doesn't work with shorter stems, such as my 70mm Thomson Elite X4, because the foot/stem interface of the mount is too long. Measured lengthwise from tip to tip is 2" long (in my pic, the left tip is at the 0 mark, even though it doesn't look like it).As a comparison, the Garmin Quarter Mount (for my Edge 810) fits, but doesn't sit flat.I realize I could mount it to the handlebar, but I wanted it mounted centrally because my iPhone 6 is so large.
