I am so excited to have received my 60 piece YOXO kit!  I was introduced to YOXO by a friend who gifted me a starter kit to help me entertain my 7 year old nephew on a dreary afternoon.  After my nephew and I spent an afternoon in building bliss, I was a bit sorry to part with the kit and decided that I needed a separate kit to keep at my place for future play dates (or, maybe just to play with on my own?).  I was super excited to see that there is now a 60 piece kit, which opens up even more building/sculpting potential!  I love having more pieces of a given color to help define my creations.  (I'm including a few photos here of my trial run with the new kit).A couple of first impressions...  Firstly, the packaging is very elegant.  The kit comes with a cover jacket that includes photos of YOXO creations on the outside and basic building techniques on the inside.  Removing this jacket reveals a minimal sturdy cardboard box printed with the YOXO logo - elegant design.  Secondly, or in addition, I love that everything about this toy is eco-friendly, recycled or recyclable, and made in the USA.  As an involved aunt of 2, and former elementary art teacher, I love that this toy is designed to encourage open-ended problem solving and creativity.  YOXO helps to develop fine motor coordination and is a welcome non-digital activity that gets kids putting their hands and minds together to find problems and solutions.  YOXO also encourages visualization and imagination - pre-seeing a possible outcome before manifesting a physical product.  These are such important skills that kids don't seem to have as many opportunities to develop in our present digital/virtual culture.It also bears mention that the 60 pieces in this kit are only the beginning.  YOXO is compatible with many items in your recycling bin - cardboard papertowel tubes, cereal boxes, cardboard scraps, etc.  So, really the possibilities are endless - to create, expand, and make this toy your own.  Enjoy!
