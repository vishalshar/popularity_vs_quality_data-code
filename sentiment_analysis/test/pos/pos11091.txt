This is a great addition if you have the almond wifi router/extender.  Its easy to connect and use. I deducted 1 star because i think its expensive for what it is or what it can do right now with the almond app and cannot be used with amazon echo. Built wise it seems solid and durable, and although its big, you can still use the other socket when this one is plugged.
