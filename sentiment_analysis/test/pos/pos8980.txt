Great gift for my son. This robot is interactive and can respond to voice and him commands. It is fun to play with and stands about 12 inches tall and can lead itself around the house. My five-year-old is having tons of fun with this guy. I really like that I can control Him with an app on my cell phone to help my son have a good time. I would recommend this to anyone who coul him with an app on my cell phone to help my son have a good time. I would recommend this to anyone whose kid loves robots and science.
