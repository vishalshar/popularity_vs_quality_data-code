I bought this scooter to get around Boston, since I live about a mile from the office, and have no car.  I am over 65 and was apprehensive about many things including reliability, maneuverability and "oomph".  All my expectations were met or exceeded. The scooter is smooth as silk to drive, and stop. It goes as slow as granny walking and as fast as a bicycle.  Some reviews say it is 'jerky' and nothing could be further from the truth! You can accellerate, slow down,  and stop with great precision. If you are looking for a scooter to zip you around town that is friendly in pedestrian traffic, and can scoot you down the road when safe to do so, then definately consider this machine. It is one of my satisfying purchases.
