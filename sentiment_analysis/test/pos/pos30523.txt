I installed my Roost battery easily. The Roost app is nice and simple and intuitive. I did have to hit "try again" once when setting up my battery (I'm not sure why). The battery fits a bit tight in my alarm, but I was able to get it in.I tested my alarm after installing the Roost battery and got an alert on my smartphone. Apart from "retry again" issue it was pretty painless for me. I did not bother to contact customer service. So far I like it much more than Nest Protect it replaces (do not even get me started on that).
