I've been using this bulb for almost a month now and I thought it would be a good time to write a review.The Good:Ease of Use: This bulb is an easy plug-n-play solution for customized lighting without the need for any base stations. Getting started was pretty easy... Plug the bulb in, download the app, and connect. Bluetooth can be pretty touch and go in my experience but I was pleasantly surprised that the app found the bulb immediately. I was able to change the brightness and color of the bulb less than a minute from plugging it in for the first time. Once you choose the color you want, you can set it as the default and then every time you turn the light on, the bulb will automatically go to that color.Color Customization: I used this bulb in a bed side lamp and was able to tune it to a color that was very close to the other lamp using a normal warm white bulb. The app allows for grouping of bulbs so if you have many, you could group them by room and control all at once.Light timer: I'm gone on weekends a lot and the light timer feature is great for keeping my house looking occupied. I have cheap mechanical timers for other lamps but I like the software solution here.The Bad:Price: Definitely a higher priced bulb than I have in other parts of my house but you would buy this bulb for its features and not for value. On the one hand I like the idea of being to customize the colors of the bulb but the cost is a bit steep when the bulb is warm white 99% of the time. Probably not worth having just one but if you had 5 or more, the features would really start to add value.Some Learning Curve: Initially I was irritated that every time I turned the light off, the bulb lost the color I set it to. After a little research, I learned that you need to set the default color. This is partially my fault since there is a big "default" button next to the color wheel in the app.Support Resources Seem Lacking: The knowledge base provided by iLumi is really limited though I'm sure they would respond by email with help. I think a forum would really help here."Shake" Didn't Work: I thought the shake feature would be amazing for controlling the light in the middle of the night. Unfortunately, I was never able to make it work with my android phone.Summary:Cool bulb with tons of features but with some learning curve. The knowledge base is basically empty but they are responsive to email. Easy to integrate a single bulb with your existing lighting and though I only have one, I'm sure it would be easy to integrate an entire room full of them. The colors are really easy to customize and very vibrant!
