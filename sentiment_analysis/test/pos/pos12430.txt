This case is fantastic!  If you find yourself traveling and wished you had a place to have easy access to your ID, a credit card, and some cash for your Starbucks or a quick meal, this case is perfect for that.  Oh, and it has a mirror in it, too, which is convenient.  Every time I pull out my ID or my money to pay for a coffee or another purchase, people ask me about this case.  It's provides better organization and easy access than any other case I've tried for my many different cell phones.  Love it and will buy another one for my next phone.
