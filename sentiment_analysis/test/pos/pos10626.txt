Great product. Never heard of this product , stumbled on it while looking up Toppix. I bought both.  For me Infinity is better than Toppix for the following reasons:  you don't have to use as much, it is non irritating to certain scalp conditions,  finer fibers for more natural look, tiny fibers sift into the hair easier. Yes these sift onto your hair not drop in one spot& clump like Toppix.  I suggest you shake the bottle well before applying  & make sure the surface near you is covered as the fine fibers can get on nearby surfaces (easy to wipe up).  My hair look darker, fuller , thicker. Between the fibers & the spray, my style stayed  for days looking full. .I would buy this again & again. The Infinity spray has great hold even in humidity with or without  using fibers..
