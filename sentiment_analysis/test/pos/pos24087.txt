When it comes to headphones and ear buds, Im very picky. This is mostly because Im hard of hearing and I need headphones that can provide a great sound experience. I also love the design and want my headphones to look great as well as sound great. This can be a tough find when you also require your headphones to be Bluetooth. Fortunately for me, 1MORE racked the balls and broke the mold when with the MK802 Bluetooth Over-Ear Headphones. They provide superior sound in a very unique, classy package.The MK802 headphones are an upgrade to its sister product, the MK801 Over-Ear Headphones. The two sets have the same basic design, but the MK802s are Bluetooth capable. Each version is available in two different colors  Red or Black (MK801) and Red or Blue (MK802). As you can probably guess from my initial description, I have the red version of the MK802s. When I first took them out of the box, I immediately fell in love with the deep crimson color and unique design features. They are non-folding and are cover the entire ear. This is great because it helps to block out unwanted ambient noise and provides a more in-depth listening experience in my opinion. The ear-pads are super soft and the foam covering around the band allows for me to use them for long periods at a time. In my testing, I didnt find that my ears were overheating, which they do with some other over-ear headphone designs.The MK802 headphones were designed with some very specific sound features in mind. One such feature is Optional Hearing Protection, which is very important to me as I have lost my hearing over the years by playing music much too loud and not using earplugs. When I was a kid I would sit right next to the PA System in our school gym and act like a tough guy. I would sit there letting the massive amount of sound blast into my ears where other kids would be holding their ears or shying away from it. I was a stupid kid who thought by showing off nothing that could bother me, other kids would be impressed by it. I guess some were, but others could care less. Needless to say, stupid acts like that now have me missing out on so much due to my hearing loss. 1MOREs Optional Hearing Protection helps to monitor volume levels so that you dont go over a certain healthy level for your ears. This feature is available with the use of the companion app 1MORE Assistant, which is available for both iOS and Android devices. I really feel that this is something that all major headphone manufacturers should implement into their products.Some of the other features include a Kevlar core cable that you can connect to the MK802s for the use of an in-line microphone and remote. This plugs directly into the aux port on the headphones and the headphone port on your mobile device (or computer). This is a particularly useful feature if your headphones batteries are running low. That being said, these headphones have an excellent battery life  5 months standby, 15 hours of music listening, and 26 hours talk time.Aside from the wonderful extra features that 1MORE packed into the MK802s and their exceptional physical style, the headphones are probably the best sounding ones Ive ever worn. They truly provide a superior listening experience. I currently have the 1MORE MK802 headphones and another high quality, but more expensive name brand set on my desk. The 1MORE headphones are more comfortable and better sounding than the much more expensive, elite ones. They have audio functions like the bass boost that provides a deep, full sound like no other headphones can have for me in the past. Bass boost definitely works. With it, Im able to pick up on certain sounds that I sometimes have difficulty hearing without headphones. And, thats one way that I judge what a good headphone is for me.The MK802 Bluetooth Over-Ear Headphones are truly a work of art  in both sound and design. Im in awe of what they have brought to me as a user and think others would find a wonderful listening experience with them, too."This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my thoughts and review.
