Okay, I saw these on Living Survival on YouTube. They looked really cool and really well thought out. So I ordered two pair, one for me and one for my wife. She is very critical about camping stuff and how "easy it is to use". We took them out and tried all kinds of freeze dried food, soups, and ramen noodles. They worked great, easy to clean, and take no space.
