Well, I just received this Elite remote, and I am very impressed. I am upgrading from the very nice Harmony Ultimate.I had difficulties setting up the Ultimate with my Yamaha receiver RX-A3050 and Arris DVR, even after trying to troubleshoot it with Logitech support, so I just ended up using the Charter remote which was not satisfactory, either.Extremely easy to set up once you have your devices brand names and model numbers. Recognized all devices immediately. I mistyped the DVR model number, and it amazingly suggested the correct DVR model number! Then created TV activity very easily.The remote did freeze up once while trying to set up everything with the iPhone Harmony app, which is light-years easier to program the remote than the old very inconvenient wired connection to the computer. No big deal after resetting remote with power button. Stuff happens with any electronic device.The convenience of being able to point the remote in any direction, and not being forced to point it at the device you want to control, is just about worth the high price itself.Many of the most frequently used Utimate's control buttons have mercifully been moved down from the top of the remote to the middle of the Elite's. There are no longer any buttons above the display screen except the remote's power button. Fine.The texture on the back of the remote is subtle and provides a good grip without being annoying. It could be a bit better gripping though.The remote is significantly thinner than the Ultimate's and a little bit taller. Very nice.Beautiful screen. Nice tap vibration to confirm button taps.I will program a few buttons, but most of the buttons work fine immediately. Lots of ways to customize it, which I really like.Will update later if needed, but initially, the is a spectacular remote system, both hardware and software: the way I would have designed it! This is what the Ultimate should have been. Logitech has really done their homework on this kitty, and they charged me a lot for it. Suits me fine, though. I like using the best, finally.  :-)  Again this is my initial impression, but quite amazing to set up and operate.Everything is very fast.
