Just before Christmas (2014) I got a Nexus 9 tablet and a Moto X (2nd edition)...both new devices without lots of accessory options. I took a chance on this after seeing reviews and it's awesome. Both devices fit in their slots...while in their cases...and charge together. The heavy aluminum base means you can do it one-handed too. Great choice.
