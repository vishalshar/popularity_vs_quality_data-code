Hands down, this device is amazing.  It FINALLY solves the problem of tracking sleep with NO worries about wearing or charging a wearable.  Just jump into bed and it works GREAT.  I LOVE how it wakes me up slowly and gently.  Since it is on my side of the bed and it wakes me up slowly, I always wake up in a relaxed way and end up turning it off before my wife even wakes up.  The only negative with it is that it is stationary so I don't get to track sleep when I travel, however, this is GREATLY outweighed by how easy it is to use.  I have found that when I track sleep with an UP, Garmin or the like, I ended up using them less and tracking sleep less often because of the inconvenience of a wearable and having to charge them while I slept anyway.  Also, all the wearable devices woke me up suddenly with a harsh vibration, so I never woke up relaxed and rested.  They also were not as accurate as the Aura has been for me, so they did not wake me up at my exact sleep cycle that was optimal to feel rested.  Also, the Aura tracks your breathing and shows it in a really cool graph the next day.  It is a super accurate device.  If you want to track your sleep, the Aura is the right device.
