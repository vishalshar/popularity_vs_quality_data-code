I got my Kuna just over a week ago and couldnt be happier with its looks and performance.When I got my kuna I was worried that it was going to be complicated to install, however when I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised at the simplicity, all I needed to do was just connect the wires just like any other light and install the app (if you have the camera feature), I was up and running within 10 minutes. The install was made super simple by the two little tools Kuna provided: the gauge used to know where to extend the mounting bolts to got rid of the guess work. My favorite tool was the holder for the light, which allowed you to use two hand to connect the wires when installing. Im going to keep that little holder for other unrelated future products.My opinion on the product:The light is well built and doesnt feel cheap, it feels like its built to last and is made with quality materials.The camera is super clear, it has a nice wide angle lens, the audio on it is nice and clear as well.The app is very user friendly and easy to use, I havent had any issues with it nor has it crashed on me, I like having the ability make a schedule for the porch light to turn on and off, or when I want to receive notifications. There are some features I havent used yet like the alarm, or the microphone to answer the door, I have tested these functions and they work great with no delay. I will give my Kuna 5stars!!!!
