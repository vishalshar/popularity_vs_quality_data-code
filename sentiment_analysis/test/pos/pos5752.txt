Best wheel I have ever put on a skateboard. You can get so much further with a lot less effort. Great all around wheel for longboards. Can take hills, speed and even works on uneven and trashy pavement. Went to their indiegogo page to support them more. They have great perks for anyone interested in all their products. Can't to try out my long board and penny board when they come in.
