Ive suffered from insomnia for years, between crazy work shifts, travel, or a someone with the sickies in the home, there just always seems to be something.  When its bad I use a prescription sleep aid, however most times Id rather use something natural.  I really like Dream water product, its just with travel Dream Water liquid isnt always convenient, so the Dream Water powder singles is a great and much more convenient option.  Another great thing, is the Dream Water powder can be taken without liquid, is travel friendly too, plus at least for me it works in about 20 mins.
