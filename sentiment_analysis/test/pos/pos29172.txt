Using the BTunes with my Sennheiser Momentum M2's.Honestly this thing is great when listening to music. Sound quality is near the same as with the cabled version when listening to 320 kbps file or streaming on the Spotify or Bandcamp apps. Plus with the headphones I use, I get around a couple of hours more than what the BTunes promises.BUT...Video playback with the BTunes is pretty lackluster due to quite significant lag.Overall, the product is essential what I wanted. Its a shame I have to bring the cable along for youtube and other video based needs, but everything else here is near flawless.
