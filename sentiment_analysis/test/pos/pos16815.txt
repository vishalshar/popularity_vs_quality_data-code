I palm all of my mouses so this mouse gives me a nice large and wide area to hold onto and the software that you can download with it does not need to be ran at all times for macros and color setting to work unlike my previous razor mouses. The sensor is outstanding and extremely accurate even on smooth materials, but i'm sure I will be even more impressed when i get my new mouse pad in
