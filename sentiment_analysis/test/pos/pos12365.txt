No problems. Big green box inside another box. 12 bags of chips inside the green box. Easy to open.The first thing I want to mention is that the nutritional info posted on this web site above is different than what is on the bag. On one site, the info is the same, on another it is different. Not sure why. I think the difference is due to the bag size. The individual bags of 2.2 oz each, contains 2 servings. Each serving is 90 calories, all carbs. 25 grams of carbs. 21 grams of sugar, 4 of dietary fiber. Zero protein and zero fat.This size bag usually has more than I can eat at one time and I can usually eat a lot. Most of the chips are crunchy but some are kinda chewy. They are sweet, but no sugary coating type taste.If you have eaten the Seneca Apple Chips, the taste is quite different. I was hoping for a chip with better nutritional value than the Seneca. Basically, the Seneca chips have 7 grams of fat per serving, because they are fried, with roughly the same amount of carbs. Even though the Seneca chips state they have corn syrup and sugar added, the carb content is about the same for both brands. Seneca are more like potato chips, very crispy, crunchy, never a chewy spot. Seneca are also a little sweeter.The BareFruit chips are a nice snack. They are natural, bake dried fruit. The bags state you may encounter stems, seeds or core fragments. I have yet to encounter anything yukky while munching on these.The chips really fill me up. I get a very 'full' sensation after eating half a bag of the chips. I do not get that sensation with the Seneca chips. If you are looking for a diet snack, this may be a good product for decreasing appetite and giving you that "I've eaten a big meal" sensation. Even several hours after eating these, I still feel full and can taste the chips. I almost feel too full.
