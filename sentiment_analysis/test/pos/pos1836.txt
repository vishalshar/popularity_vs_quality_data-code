Oh, what can I say?  It fits perfectly in the hand, and the lead is just right!  Not too hard, not too soft.I fell in love with the product when I borrowed a friends to jot down something while we were traveling.  His was older with the nice aged look.  It tucks nicely into a pocket with the cap over the lead to protect fabric, and against breakage.Lovely.  Very happy.
