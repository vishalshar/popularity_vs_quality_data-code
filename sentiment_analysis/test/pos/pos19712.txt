Having sensitive eyes, I love this product as it is not a mascara, but a tint. The look is natural, however others notice my eyes more when I do where this tint. I have absolutely no irritation when using the product. I actually have hayfever symptoms, so I hesitate to wear anything. Now, I will wear this, and only this on my eyelashes.
