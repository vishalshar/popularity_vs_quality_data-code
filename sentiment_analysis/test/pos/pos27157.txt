I bought this on Amazon after seeing this product line elsewhere at a higher price. Rather than just buying one piece to try it out, I bought nearly every size and shape available. I cook a lot, and get tired of using plastic wrap to cover things that don't have lids. This seemed like a good ideal, so I jumped right in. Spent a lot of money, and got a big box delivered to my door.They do work as advertised. I frequently make cole slaw in a huge bowl that needs to sit in the refrigerator overnight before I transfer it to one-quart deli containers. I use the large round cover for this. Every few hours, when I stir the resting cole slow, I'm pleased that I can't just grab the handle and lift the lid. It does form an airtight seal, which I have to break by grabbing an edge that extends beyond the rim of the bowl. This is the one I've used the most, but I do use some of the others to cover things in the refrigerator. I have not yet used them on the stove or in the microwave, but that isn't really what I bought them for.The only downside is storage. Many years ago, I broke myself of the habit of having drawers and cabinets cluttered with lids to pots and pans, Tupperware/Rubbermaid containers, etc. My pots are neatly hung on a stainless restaurant shelf, and the lids are standing up in the wire mesh in descending order by size, so I can easily see them and grab just the lid I need for the job. I don't keep a scrap of Tupperware or Rubbermaid around anymore. When I bought these silicone lids, I hadn't taken a minute to think how I'd store them. Obviously, they won't stand up no my wire shelving. Right now, they're in a jumbled pile on a shelf, until I come up with a better solution.Silicone is an amazing material with my practical applications around the house. These lids are a good example, but their flexible nature makes it impossible to store them upright. If you're as fussy about organized storage as I am, you should take this into consideration.
