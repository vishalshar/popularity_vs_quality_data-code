The TrackR has been a life saver for me since I purchased it. I was never one to lose items, but on the few occasions that I did misplace things, it always seemed like it was at the most inopportune time. Case in point, last week. Last week I had a doctor's appointment bright and early at 8:30 AM. I'm usually one to wake up bright and early, but for some reason my alarm didn't go off. I woke up at 8:10 and was in a mess of a hurry to get out the door to make the appointment. After I got dressed I went to my key rack to grab my car keys and go...only to find that my keys weren't there. Usually in this instance I would have to tear my house apart looking for my keys, but with TrackR it was only a matter of moments before I was on my way to the doctor. I whipped open the app, connected via bluetooth, and pressed the button on the app to make the TrackR ring. I heard the sound emanating from my room and was able to locate my keys and make it to my appointment on time!Overall, the TrackR is a great product to help you in times you need it most. Set-up is basic and easy and its features are extremely handy.
