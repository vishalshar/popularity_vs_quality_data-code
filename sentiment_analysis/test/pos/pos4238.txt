WELL, A NEAT TOY ROBOT, FAIRLY EASY TO PROGRAM, BUT INSTRUCTIONS ADEQUATE, WITH SOME TRIAL AND ERROR TO DETERMINE HOW TO INTERPRET THE INSTRUCTIONS!  11 YR OLD GRANDSON NOT TOO "TAKEN" OVER IT, WENT TO "SPHERO 2" RC BALL FIRST OVER ROBOSAPIAN!!  DOES HAVE MOTIONS TO ACTIVATE SINGULARLY VIA REMOTE, WAJKS GOOD, BUT SOME MOVEMENTS NOT TOO PRONOUNCED.BOTTOM LINE MAY DEPEND ON CHILDS INTEREST IN ROBOTS AND MAKING IT DO ITS THINGS AND PROGRAMMING.  THIS WAS SECOND ROBOT , LAST YEAR "R2D2" AND NEVER PROGRAMMED, SO, MAYBE GRANDPARENTS SHOULD TAKE A HINT!!  APPEARS TO BE WELL CONSTRUCTED AND DURABLE, NO STRIPPED GEARS, EVEN WHEM MOVEMENTS FORCED WITH OUT POWER UP.  IF LIKE ROBOTS, THIS ONE IS GOOD!!
