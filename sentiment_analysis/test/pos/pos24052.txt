Seriously consider this before buying anything else...  Autel is not a super-well-known brand, but just push that aside.  They are very well-known for their 24/7 US-based customer service.  DJI got too big, too fast, and customer service was never part of the game plan from the beginning. It was with Autel.  You can read long reviews about how great Autel's products are -- the quality, the service, the performance. I'll be brief.I've flown a smaller, cheaper Drones maybe a dozen times, with limited success.  It's not as easy as it looks, it takes practice.  That said, I needed HD aerial video for a project quickly. I bought the Autel based on reputation, and EASE of flight.  One button take-off/landing -- it works amazingly well.  There's a ton of safety features to keep your $1000 investment safe from crashing or flying away.  All the automated flight functions work very well. It has a great removable gimbal mount to remove the camera -- and replace it later with an improved model, but I don't see how it could get much better. Maybe better still images, but they are very good.  Video is outstanding.Final thoughts.  Buy proper guards and an extra battery.  Lastly, I picked-up an iPad Mini 3 16GB for $200 on Craigslist.  It fits on the remotes stand perfectly, and is the prefect size to use while flying.  Bright, sharp screen, bigger than a big smartphone. I think a Mini 2 would work fine as well.  A complete and total novice can fly this Drone easily, and get professional, sharp, rock-steady video anywhere you're allowed to fly!
