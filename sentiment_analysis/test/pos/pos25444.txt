Let me start by saying this thing is AWESOME and I would definitely buy again, but it doesn't quite live up to my expectations.I produce bass-heavy electronic music in my apartment and this thing is a savior for the after hours when it's not so chill to bump with a subwoofer. In those situations, I always used to end up turning the music way too loud in my headphones to hear the low-ends (which I know is dangerous but it would happen subconsciously). So this is great for the purpose of feeling those low ends while keeping your headphones at a safe level, and it really does feel similar to standing in front of a huge system at a concert, so it's pretty awesome just for that real bone-shaking feeling you can't get without a fat woofer.In terms of sound quality though, I don't think it could replace your studio monitor sub if you're really looking for a clean and precise response. It is a little bit different than hearing low frequencies, so it's kind of like comparing apples and oranges, but I wouldn't suggest this for mixing purposes. It seems a lot cleaner at low volumes (it's not as good and seems to distort if you push the volume), and sometimes I want to push it a little louder than I can without hurting the quality.The other complaint I have about the m2 (and it might just be my setup) is that I am getting very noticeable hum/static/whitenoise when my interface's 1/4" output volume is over about 20% (I have a focusrite 2i2). This means it actually sucks to listen to my music loud, and at times I feel like I'm just not getting enough volume at a good quality. This might not be an issue while using bluetooth, but for whatever reason I couldn't get my laptop's bluetooth to connect (trust me I tried, not an issue with the pac since it worked with my phone)..I might try a different aux cable, interface, and headphones in the future, and ultimately this could be an issue with my personal setup and not the subpac, but I'm pretty bummed about this.Hope this helps.
