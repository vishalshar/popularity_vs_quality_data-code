Product works great and has amazing sound.  I haven't tested the recording of the usb yet but if it works as great as everything else I am sure I won't have any problems.  Also, when I ordered it, it said it was going to be delayed and I still got it on time.  Amazon was just late on updating its policy.  It still says on the order when I look it up that it was delivered on December 2nd and shipped on December 5th. lol  I highly recommend this if you are looking for a nice record player with a lot of perks and a nice overall look.
