I have had my Awair for only 3 weeks and totally love it. Previously had bought the Foobot a half year ago. The latter started to have problems with it's wifi connection and found large inaccuracies in CO2 and VOC. So decided to get the Awair and run them side by side, being 6" apart on top the cleared top of the dresser. Note the Foobot only measures VOC and not CO2. It approximates a best guess for CO2. I purchased an simple CO2 meter a couple of months ago to help diagnose my poor air quality. The simple CO2 meter is also next to these two monitors.After a few days it became clearer who to trust. The Foobot kept failing due to it's poor wifi, the Awair kept working. The Awair did loose wifi occasionally but only once every few days, vs the Foobot loosing internet and flushing it's data sometimes several times a day. Data readings varied too. The Awair CO2 readings were close to the simple CO2 meter. Understandably the Foobot does not have a CO2 sensor, unfortunate since NDIR sensors are cheap and fairly common. But saw the VOC readings vary much as well. At some lower levels the two were close, at higher levels above the "good-fair" ranges, they varied greatly. At times the Foobot was close to 3x higher. Without lab equipment and a controlled environment, as retired electrical engineer, I can not be conclusive.But for my home, I see the Awair as the best device for my money and covers the three necessary parameters (particulate, CO2, VOC). Other devices such as Foobot, Eve, etc. do not. That lack of sensors can be highly disrupting to anyone trying to isolate the source(s) of bad air quality in their home.
