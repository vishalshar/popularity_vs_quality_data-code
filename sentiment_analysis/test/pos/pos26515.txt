These are a great crunchy snack that I find as satisfying as chips most of the time (every once and a while you just need fat and salt). I prefer the granny smith flavor to the others because the tartness of these apples gives these chips a brightness that the other varieties are lacking. You do need to be careful about mindlessly eating these as I often experience a delayed full feeling if I eat too many. I suspect they absorb a bit of water in your stomach or something.
