I have been looking for a way to check whether my garage door is closed as well as remotely open it with my cell phone. This product does the job at a very reasonable price. Everything I needed was in the box including a small screwdriver to connect the wires. All items appear to be of high quality. Instructions are clear and the installation is pretty straight forward. I will buy a second one for my second garage door.
