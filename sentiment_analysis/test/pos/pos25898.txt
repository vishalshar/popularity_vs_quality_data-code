The amp is great for my needs. I play sometimes with a small Blues ensemble. The tone is great and the amp is loud enough for our group.I can also play songs or backing tracks over the amp from my Android phone using Bluetooth. This feature is very handy for learning new songs off YouTube or for jamming along. I can also imagine using the amp as a music player for a party. The speakers are full range, unlike a normal amp.The V2.6 app is not so great. That's why I only gave it 4 stars. It is difficult to add tones to your library. The UI for the tone library and editor is not obvious and it does not respond consistently to gestures. Hopefully they will spend some time to polish the app. Then I'd give the product 5 stars.But I'm happy with it, despite the flaws. I would rather have this than a plain old amp.
