Line 6 Relay G10 is very awesome. I had been in the market for quite some time when I saw this being advertised. My friends have other systems and they all have a chord leading to a small pack they wear on their hip. I didn't want the added "baggage' to carry as I also have in ear monitors that have said "baggage". This thing performs through my entire house and on stage. It's a wonderful edition to my gear most definitely CHARGE PLUG AND PLAY. You will not regret it!
