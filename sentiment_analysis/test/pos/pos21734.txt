This mount works great! I have yet to see it vibrate in any sort of form while holding my phone. I've used it in a 2015 Toyota Camry as well as a 2007 Scion TC, both with the factory radios, and I have yet to run into any issues for both cars. The only issue I can see coming up is for anyone that uses a case where the buttons stick out and are on the side, they can and will be pressed when the mount is holding the phone. Although to work around that you can always have the phone higher or lower in the mount and it'll still be fine. Overall I highly recommend it to anyone that's considering a cd slot car mount especially since it can definitely be operated with one hand.
