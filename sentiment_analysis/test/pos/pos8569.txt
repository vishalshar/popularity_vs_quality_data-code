Although I have only used it in Mexico and the US, this thing works pretty well. It does take several minutes (or sometimes longer) to connect. A few times I have gotten an error message while trying to connect. Usually after rebooting, it will work. On one occasion I got the error message repeatedly. I was able to email the company and they responded very quickly. They apparently reset something on their server, had me reboot one more time and the error was resolved.A number of others reviews have complained about it not turning off. A couple of times when I powered it down, it didn't actually turn off. So, you do have to pay attention to make sure it actually goes off.The way that it tracks data can be confusing, as it only shows you how much data you have in your current package. A package is generally 1gb. So if you are down to 50mb on your first package and you buy another 1gb, the 1gb won't show up until you use all of the remaining 50mb from the first package. There also seems to be a discrepancy between what the device shows for available data and what their app shows. It appears as though the device lags behind the app in available data. Their website is also somewhat confusing - just not very intuitive.All in all, I like the device.  It does have some bugs to work out, but it does work.
