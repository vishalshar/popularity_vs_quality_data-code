Could not love this product more.  I work at a waterpark and I often come in early to check the slides, etc.  I always wanted to have music with me but I couldn't have something too loud and if was on my person it had to be water resistant.  The Turtle Shell is perfect.  Now I can clip it onto a make-shift belt and if it gets sprayed with water while I'm on the aquatic floor I don't need to worry about my device.  Super bonus: I pair this to my phone which is in a waterproof case, meaning I don't have to worry too much at all about the environment I'm in.Outside of that very specific use, I love the Turtle Shell at home too.  It can easily fill a couple of rooms full of music or be just loud enough to listen to some music before bed.  I wouldn't call myself an audiophile but I am quite picky about my tunes and this guy delivers.  The only time I've had it not be able to keep up was when it was on full volume and a very low bass part came on in a song.  Couldn't quite take the low Hz on that noise level.  This is a rare problem and doesn't effect my listening at all.Maybe a little pricey but where else are you going to find a drop-proof, dust-proof, water-resistant boom box that can fit in your hand?
