I have been using my brand spanking new urb-e for a week or so now. I work as a home visiting nurse for the elderly and have to park far often due to high population neighborhoods here in Los Angeles. So far, it has been a godsend to use my urb-e. For the size and weight, it's a breeze folding up and lugging in and out of my Honda Civic's trunk, with half a trunk's room to spare - this is despite the 7-8 trips in and out of my car that I do. The ride is sturdy and secure, you feel it more than powerful enough to propel you forward to where you need to go. With such an ergonomically designed machine, it both shows off how aesthetically pleasing it is as well as how humbly practical its services are. It draws attention because of its new and different design, but once someone gets over the initial novelty of its appearance, people are quick to appreciate the efficiency of design and innovation of machinery being so small. The staff at the company are more than willing to help with questions anyone's got, and it's just superb service all in all. The location of the store in Pasadena is prime and if anyone is in the area, I highly recommend to at least pop in and try the ride - I did once and I was hooked!
