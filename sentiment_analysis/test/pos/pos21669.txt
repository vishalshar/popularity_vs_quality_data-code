Wow!  A friend brought me a bag of these, and I was hooked!  One bag of these is a perfectly constructed meal for those of us looking at carb-to-protein ratios and fiber, not to mention superior nutrition!  Who knew kale could be this good?!?  Pricey, yes, but not your "normal" chip either!  I'll be ordering regularly.  I thought this would be a variety pack, but it was all Ranch.  That is my ONLY disappointment in this stellar product!  Bravo, Rhythm Super foods!!  Well done!!
