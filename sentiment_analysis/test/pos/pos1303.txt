I have a young dog who chews up EVERYTHING so this charger is perfect. She hasn't even tried to chew it, unless she did it when I was gone...I wish it were longer, frankly, but I will take what I can get!I ordered this because my daughter's cat chews on her charger cables also, and this one is safe from kitty's sharp tiny teeth.
