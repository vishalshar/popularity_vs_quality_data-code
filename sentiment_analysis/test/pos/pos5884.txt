I don't EVER write reviews. I was too blown away by how well this product works to not write a review. To keep it short and simple, this is the first natural deodorant I've tried where I only have to apply it once and it works all day. Also, there are no chemicals or crap in it. Just Shea butter, arrowroot powder, coconut oil, non-aluminum baking soda, and lavender essential oil. That's it!A natural product that actually works!!I'm a doctor that specialized in the field of chiropractic if that helps add to my credibility. I couldn't recommend this product more!Ps. The only thing my wife doesn't like about it is that the paste gets under her fingernails. If you think that might be an issue for you, or if you're grossed out by using your fingers to rub a paste on your pits, you can always opt to get the stick deodorant but it is more expensive
