I really like the simplicity of these laces.  They make your shoes easier to put on and less of a fall risk.  I highly recommend them for seniors or anyone that is at risk for falls or just doesn't want to tie their shoes every day.  I do wish they made difference lengths to allow for even more personalization of fit.
