While ordinarily I'm the kind of person who goes overboard with physical challenges, the Upright wriggled under my radar to become a healthy habit. What do I mean? Precisely this: at first I was frustrated by the brevity of "practice" time despite the company's reassurance that it truly would work. However, a month or so into the process, I'm hooked. While I still catch myself slouching when not wearing the Trainer, I'm able to catch myself and correct my posture; I can feel this becoming a habit.Further, the company sends helpful tips and reminders via email, which you may choose to ignore if you like. I have found the tips offered very useful, however. It's obvious that a lot of thought and effort went into the creation of this product, and I'm glad I finally gave in and bought one.
