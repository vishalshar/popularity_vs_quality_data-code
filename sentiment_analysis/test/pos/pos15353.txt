Absolutely love this device the latest edition to my smart home. I've been reading about it and decided to finally buy it since my municipality offered a rebate. I took pictures of the old controller and wiring. Installation was very easy. The hardest part was rerouting the sprinkler cable since I wanted an interior mount. I connected it to my wifi and there was a problem connecting to the internet. I went on the knowledge base and found out it was an issue with the latest iOS update. Can you believe that Rachio requested an emergency update from Apple and pushed it out quickly? I updated the app and it resolved my issue. The app is well designed and very intuitive. I was able to easily setup my zones and configure them with the appropriate plant type, soil type, etc. scheduling has lots of options beyond the typical controller. Overall very pleased with this product and highly recommend it.
