...and that God is/are the developers of Grip Boost. I had a pair of gloves that I used last season that had absolutely no tack left, I mean these gloves were so bad to the point I felt like I'd be better off using no gloves or just getting a new pair, AND NEW FOOTBALL GLOVES ARE SO EXPENSIVE! So I googled how to restore the tack, I tried the washer, worked for about 3 catches and the tack was gone, spit worked for about 2 catches, but then I came across Grip Boost. I watched some reviews, which were all good, so I went ahead and purchased the product. The first time I applied this on the gloves, my head exploded. The gloves felt stickier than the day I bought them. I compared it to my teammates brand new gloves and they agreed the grippiest gloves were the ones with Grip Boost. 1 tiny bottle gets you SIXTY applications. So if you do the math, a good pair of gloves cost about 40-50 dollars so for the same money you are getting 4-5 bottles of this 4(bottles)x60(uses)=240, If you apply this everyday you'll practically be wearing a new pair of gloves for 240 days/uses straight. STOP READING REVIEWS AND BUY THIS PRODUCT. YOU WILL CATCH EVERYTHING.
