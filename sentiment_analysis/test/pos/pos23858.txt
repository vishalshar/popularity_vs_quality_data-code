The TICKR X is best heart rate monitor I've tried.  In the last few years I have bought and used a wide variety of heart rate monitors.  I track my heart rate on nearly every run, workout, bike, Crossfit, elliptical, or stairmaster session I do.  I've used the bluetooth chest straps from Polar and Wahoo and the Ant+ Run chest strap from Garmin.  For more than a year I have been using the Scosche Rythm+ arm strap daily and that had become my primary heart rate monitor because it can connect via Bluetooth with my iPhone or direct to my Garmin running watch via Ant+.  However, I found that there were dropoffs in the Scosche readings if I was doing anything involving upper body during workouts and there was always a delay getting a reading during high intensity intervals or Tabata sessions.I bought and switched to the TICKR X and I think this is the most responsive heart rate monitor option with the ability to connect via Bluetooth or via Ant+ separately or at the same time.  So I can have a display on my iPhone or iPad while I'm doing a workout to keep my HR up in a target zone or just record on my watch if I'm running.  I didn't think the memory function of the TICKR X was that big of a deal, but I have found I like having the data downloadable and editable in the Wahoo app, that I can later upload to Strava, Garmin Connect, Training Peaks, or nearly any fitness app I wish.  I can do a training session without worrying that I've synced my HR monitor to my phone or watch.  The TICKR X records automatically to its internal memory.I have bought and returned two smartwatches that had heart rate monitor functions.  They are simply not accurate and consistent enough for workouts if you use your heart rate to measure intensity or the effectiveness of a session.  The wrist readings simply can't compare to the chest strap for heart rate readings.If you are serious about using your heart rate data to measure fitness and workout intensity then this is the best HR monitor to buy because it is accurate and connects to all types of equipment.
