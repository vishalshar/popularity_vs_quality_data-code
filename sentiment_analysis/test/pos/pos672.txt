This is a very accurate scale that can pick up even small changes in weight, supported by an app that Withings has spent a lot of time improving from earlier versions. The iOS / android connectivity helps with easily tracking results over time.On the downside, the wifi on this scale is quite poor - the range is short and I don't know about other people but I don't have a router in the bathroom. The scale will also not connect to 5Ghz wifi networks, it only works on the older 2.4Ghz standard. It will probably work fine for most people, but in a large apartment building with a lot of network congestion it just does not connect unless I move it to the router room, even though my phone connects to the wifi from anywhere in the apartment.Setup for the first user was a breeze, adding a second user took a bit longer - measurements were assigned to an "unknown user" even though a second user had been set up.Yes, the body fat / muscle measurements are not exceptionally accurate and can be affected by things such as drinking a large glass of water, however, they are consistent if you measure consistently, (e.g. every morning when you wake up) - and therefore quite usable.
