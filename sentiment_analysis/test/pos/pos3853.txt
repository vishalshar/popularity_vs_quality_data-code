The concept is great and I feel it's a purchase I won't regret! It is a little slow but I understand that the image is being printed in the instant you press Print. I wanted to buy my gf an instant camera we saw at Best Buy and then I remembered I saw a video talking about this (Unbox Therapy) and went for it. Easy to setup and use. Like I said, a bit slow but awesome results once you get the hang of it. The only thing I don't like is there is no on/off button or battery indicator. While in use it shows your battery but if I don't remember to charge it there is no way to quickly see the battery status. The red LED stays on even when the case is "off" which bothers me for whatever reason. Still recommend you give it a try.
