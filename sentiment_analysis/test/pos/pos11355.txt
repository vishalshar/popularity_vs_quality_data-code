I saw these on Kickstarter but arrived late to the show. Was happy to see them on amazon. I have a mild form of plantar fasciitis that's been acting up lately. I wear a lot of sperry top siders and chacos and have tried both superfeet and dr scholls. I find that Honey Soles are super comfy. I think they have memory foam - it feels like it's molding to the shape of my feet. They said it makes shoes feel like flip flop and it's true. Super comfortable. Let's get these puppies on the oprah favorite things list.
