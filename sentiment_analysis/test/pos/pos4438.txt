These really work and can be used over and over. Well worth the expense when one considers that the shelf life of costly cheese is so easily extended. In my refrigerator right now are five bags holding jack, parmesan, cheddar, Swiss, and Bergenost -- all nicely nested in a lucite basket for easy retrieval.
