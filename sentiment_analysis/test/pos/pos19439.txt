A very good product to be used in conjunction with the massage balls sold by Massage Track. I have been going to the chiropractor to relieve lower back pain but now I can get the same relief with the use of the message track with the massage balls. This product is also great for relief of trigger points in the upper back too. I would also recommend the associated massage balls sold by massage track to use with this product. The massage balls are well made and I consider a high quality product.
