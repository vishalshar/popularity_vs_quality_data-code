We truly do love our August Smart Lock. We are using it in addition with the Smart Keypad. We have not used it with the Wifi so we cannot comment on compatibility. This lock has been great for allowing friends to check on our dog and family members to visit if they arrive early or into town while we are out. It's a great way to secure your house for renters or Airbnb.We love the color of our lock. It was easy to set up and works with the phone and easily with the Smart Lock Keypad. The only complaint is that we have to make sure our door is pulled shut to insure that the lock goes in the hole correctly. I am not sure if others have had this issue.
