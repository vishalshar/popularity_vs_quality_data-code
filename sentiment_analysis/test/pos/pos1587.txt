It is hard to find great tasting gluten-free panko crumbs as most I have found in the past are really more like fine bread crumbs. I came across these Aleia's Gluten Free Panko Crumbs at a Whole Foods store last year while traveling and thought I would give them a try...they were so great & then I couldn't find them again until I decided to see if Amazon carried them and immediately ordered two more containers. My family loves them and I am so happy to find them again. They are so reasonably priced too.
