I've gone through several portable power packs that make AC, and none have performed well enough at their best, or have lasted long before the internal batteries degraded in capacity to the point that the device was useful. The others have suffered from inferior technology and poor quality lead acid or NiMH batteries. None of them lasted long on the market, and my attempts to revive or modify them with better quality parts proved to be not worth the effort. My time is valuable, and I shouldn't have to fix another engineer's bad work. I've been very impressed with the 18650 lithium cells that I use in my flashlights, and that are used in the ChargeTech, so "getting lithium" was the next step that I had been waiting for.It's been only 4 months since I got my ChargeTech, but so far there has been no sign of impending failure. I've used it to provide power to my whole home alarm system that uses a powerful radio (the whole system draws ~40W) on the day that I had my electrical service upgraded, and although it did cut off when it ran out of juice (it was an all-day outage), it did keep running long enough to keep the alarm's internal battery topped up. I was in contact with the alarm company and they said that they never lost contact with my home. After that, I turned the unit back on, and found that there was enough reserve to run a small fan for several minutes before the self-protection once again shut off the AC.PRO  --  This thing really works. If you've tried a handheld AC power pack before and was disappointed, now is time to look again.CON  --  It's not a pure sine wave. Not many devices will have a problem with the stepped waveform, but some "wall wart" adapters have known problems and can be damaged. Other things like motors that need the full peak-to-peak voltage of a sine wave to work efficiently will not be happy. Many other manufacturers have been able to produce pure sine wave inverters, so ChargeTech's use of what used to be barely good enough is disappointing.Verdict  --  It's a big step in the right direction, but there's still plenty of room for improvement. I concur with SonarTech's excellent review, though I can't find the better alternative at this price point yet.  Anker makes a much larger and much more expensive unit that provides a pure sine wave, and when the price dropped from $500 to $400 I snapped one up. But that unit isn't going to fit in my briefcase, or leave much room in my backpack.I hope that other respected brands decide to offer AC versions of their primarily USB power sources soon. Not everything can be charged/run from USB power right now, and there will always be a need to have some portable way to use them when you're away from mins power.
