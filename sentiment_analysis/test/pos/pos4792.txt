We chose to build Muttbot, and with my wife doing the assembling, it was completed in about 90 minutes. It's very much like working with a LEGO kit, except instead of a printed instruction book, you first download a Jimu app that has the step-by-step instructions. (The app is for Android or iOS devices, but not for Amazon Kindle.) And here I have to give some big kudos to Jimu. After Muttbot was assembled, we tried to use the app (on my wife's Android phone) to control the robot, but one of the servos was malfunctioning. So about 9:00 in the evening, we called the Jimu toll-free 24/7 hotline and spoke with a product support lady who knew exactly what to do and she walked us through the fix (it was our error that caused the malfunction). It turned a frustrating situation into quick success. I don't have to mention how rare that kind of customer service is today.Initially, I was not happy over the lack of a printed instruction manual, but the 3-D animated assembly guide in the app was very helpful - even more so than I would have ever guessed. Also, with the assembly error noted above, when we tried to make the robot walk or do other actions, the app recognized the servo problem and described it, making it easier for the customer service person to analyze the problem.The real purpose of the kit is to introduce youngsters (or anyone, really) to robotics programming. The tutorial is very easy to understand, and within a few minutes, my wife - who has no prior robotics experience - was creating some simple programmed routines for Muttbot.We had so much fun with Muttbot that we're disassembling him in order to build Buzzbot, which uses all six servos in the kit (Muttbot used only four servos).
