Does the trick! Comes with all the necessary tools to easily collect a sample and gives results within minutes. I wasn't sure if my dog had a UTI, he showed some of the symptoms like being reluctant to go, and I convinced myself the skin around his parts was red. This product helped put my mind at ease, the results were negative all around. It was easier to collect the urine than I thought too, after letting him sniff the cup a little he let me stick it under him as he peed. He's only 10 lbs and very low to the ground but that wasn't an issue. Plus it's nice to have the pole/ring and extra strip for the future! Will probably end up buying something like these eventually too:Â Urinalysis Test Strips for UTI, Diabetes, PH testing, Ketone testing and more. 125 Urine Test Strips included. Complete 11 Parameter ChemstripsWould recommend, saved me a trip to the vet.If you found this review at all helpful, please let me know by pressing the "Yes" button below! :)
