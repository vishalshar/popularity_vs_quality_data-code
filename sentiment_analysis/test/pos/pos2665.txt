Best pocket pencil on the market or that I have found.  When I was a kid growing up on the farm several companys gave away similar pocket pencils and I always carried one.  Companies don't give these away any more, so I bought on of these and love having a pencil in my pocket again that doesn't get broken or jab me in the leg.  I just love it!
