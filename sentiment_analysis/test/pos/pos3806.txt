So glad we found this.  Even though we have sloping in our yard this product seems to pick up the signal just fine.  It does take a couple of hours to sit up.  We spent maybe 3 days going over the boundaries with our dog before letting her wonder over the boundary.  That was all it took for her to learn to stay away from the flags.  Now our dog has more freedom and is a much happier dog.
