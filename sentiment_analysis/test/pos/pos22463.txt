I bought these at the grocery and they were soft. The packages I received of chic and salmon were hard and crunchy. A little difficult for my three small dogs with tiny teeth but they managed. When there's a will there's a way! They are good treats and they do love them, but I'll be buying them at the grocer so I can feel the texture. I love that they are made in the USA and REAL chic and salmon! Ingredients are very important to me.
