YUMMY! I took these backpacking this weekend. Between me and my friends, we tried each flavor and everyone approved. The packaging was also put to the test since they were being squeezed and tossed around in my bag during the hike. These are very durable for being active. Hard to say how long this kept us hungry because I did a lot of high protein/energy snacking throughout the trip in general. It felt about the same as a bowl of instant oatmeal. Certainly kept me at least as full as some of other snacks like jerky or a protein bar. I plan to get more for more hikes and snowboarding trips.
