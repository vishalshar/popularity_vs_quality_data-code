Peeked in box but wanted to get better water than what I had on hand to use. 5 days later I screamed in shock at the thick mass of mushrooms that had sprouted out and was growing over the handle! we harvested them for a novel addition to our dinner salad that night. They had an amazing, very strong flavor.We have now officially begun the grow. By the way, they grew out of the breather patch!!!
