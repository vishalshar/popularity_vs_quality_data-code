I've never made beer at home and the ones I tasted that were made by home brewers were barely drinkable.  Pico promised ease of use, consistency, and variety.  In fact, the variety they offered on their on-line store was almost as good as what I see at my local beer shop.  So I ordered this unit thinking I could re-gift it if it didn't work.  The setup took about 15 minutes.  The brew process was approximately 2 hours.  The toughest part was waiting the five days for the beer to ferment (I waited an extra day thinking aging would help flavor).  Proper carbonation takes another 36 hours so it really takes one week to brew, ferment, and have it ready for tasting.  I gathered the family around last night and we all sampled the beer.  The beer tasted great!  The accolades from family and friends that this tasted like store bought beer was even better for my ego.  Great job PicoBrew!  Now I need to order some beer packs to make more beer.
