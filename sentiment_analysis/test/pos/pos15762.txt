I bought these as a gift for my 4yo and she can't get enough of them. She just colored a bunch with no layout, and doesn't care that they aren't "perfect." The markers it came with ran out - you really have to color each area a lot to get a good saturation. Also, make sure to have something under when coloring because of bleed-through. Still, these are great and make for a great gift.
