Im an art major and i have been looking to replace paper and pen for sketching. Pencil is by far the best stylus and the app with it together is amazing. Very responsive and the features are so cool. I break it out in class and people surround me just to watch what it can do. I LOVE PENCIL! the price for it is high but its worth the money.
