Have been using it for last 4 months. Installation was easy as I already have a wired network connection in my garage where it was installed. Once on the network, I was able to access its web interface. I assigned a fixed IP and then set up my sprinkler zones and watering cycles.During my use in last few months, I have noted following:PROS-Simple easy interface, making it a breeze to change the watering settings.-Manual watering ability.-Can be accessed from any computer or phone on your home network. Accessing from outside home network requires an extra step.-Solidly built-Slope/clay setting-Physical buttons to program the controller.CONS-No control over rain delay. It will skip the watering cycle if it is raining at the time of watering but there is no option to delay it for a specified time period. There should be an option to delay the watering by number of days and rain delay should be based on weather forecast.-If internet weather is enabled, it checks the temperature at the time of watering and increases the watering by a percentage. I (like many people) water early morning which is usually the coldest time of the day.  Hence, the setting does not help at all. It would be much more helpful to base watering need on weather forecast.  In addition, increase in watering is a fixed percentage but should really be on a sliding scale based upon temperature forecast.-To Access the netAQUA from outside your home network, you need to forward a port on your router and set-up a Dynamic Domain Name System (DDNS) account. It will be much easier to have an app for android/iphone instead going through these extra steps.Looking through the messages in different reviews, it seems that manufacturer has been working on these issues. Last message was in May which mentioned the update in a few weeks.  There was an update in June (Version 1.2.15; Date 2014.06.18) which did not fix these issues.  Hopefully, these issues can be fixed in a future update.Given excellent basic functionality, I am giving it 4 stars. Will be 5 star product after advanced functionality has been added.
