Solves all my IR extender requirements without needing IR! Used to control my Sony STR-DA5600 AV receiver, Optomo HD65 projector, Sony TV and Blu Ray player and Cisco Explorer 8000 series STB from android and iPhone devicesPros:1.No line of sight needed for the IR to work between the Blumoo and the boxes.2.Great Support, Zone 2 didn't work on my receiver. Support corrected this within 48 hours with an update3.Good audio streaming function (used Pandora and iTunes radio from behind a wall over 30 foot away)4.Seamless connectivity when controlled from multiple devices5.Customizing the remote buttons in the app is great.Cons:LED is a little too bright for use in theater settingIn addition I would hope that over time new features could be added like:1. A remote learner function so that particular keys on existing remote can be replicated identically on the device.2. Ability to change the name of the controlled device in the app.3. Ability to customize the skin/color schemes of the app.
