Great product. Works pretty well for me but I have some issues:- connection gets briefly interrupted (series of brief 1/2 second breaks) from time to time...not enough to return...yet- even with the largest ear bud/cover they go very deep in to my ears which is slightly uncomfortable. In all fairness I have exceptionally large ear canals and always have trouble finding ear buds large enough to form a seal.- they are a little complicated to use at first but I can see with time it gets easier.All in all I recommend them. Really great tech and they should only get better with each update.
