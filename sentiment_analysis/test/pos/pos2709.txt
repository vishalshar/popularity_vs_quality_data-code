This little baby right here. Man, talk about good timing. I do a lot of weekend trips in the fall, and this little life saver has already kept me connected to the world 4 times and I've had it like less than a week. I did receive this in exchange for my honest review.It's very sleek, and has that fancy, rubberized coating. It has tint green lights that light up as it's powering on. It's super tiny and discreet so if you don't have a purse to throw it at, you're no longer trying to figure out where it goes. I've seriously had so many of these types of products..... 8 if I count correctly. And this is by far the best!I can get about a charge and a half, but my phone is dying so if you have a better phone with a higher quality battery, you could probably get two full charges out of it.I love that there's no insane cord - age going on with this either. My last one had a wall cord and a phone cord. Talk about too much wire management.If you're on the go like me, and need to stay connected, you have to grab one of these!
