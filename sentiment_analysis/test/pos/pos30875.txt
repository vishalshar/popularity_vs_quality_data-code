The idea for this Back To Roots Water Garden is fantastic: create a self sustaining symbiotic echo system where a fish tank is cleaned by plants who are fed by the fish's water. On paper this is a great idea, and for the most part, the implementation follows along pretty well. The important thing to know is that this is not a "plug and go" system. Like any fish tank or growing system, you'll need to tweak things here and there to make this really work.First, the most minor gripe of this system. It comes with a coupon for a beta fish at Petco, but the coupon didn't cover the whole fish. Small complaint, but not a huge deal. Petco has a 30 day guarantee on the fish, but to claim it you need to bring in the dead fish and water for them to test.The bigger issue is actually getting this ecosystem up and running/ The way that the grow areas are configured, it's impossible for some of the sprouts and seeds not to get swept into the tank. This meant fishing (excuse the pun) a non trivial amount of sprouts out of the tank and off of the pump. Once things get growing this is less of an issue, but it does mean you have to open this all up and do some maintenance (a few times).We also found that the tank is much cloudier than we expected. We emailed customer service for some advice and after a lot of troubleshooting they requested we take a sample of our water to Petco to get tested. Which tested OK. We weren't expecting to be doing water analysis and such with this system that seemed so "plug and play".On the upside, the radish sprouts are growing very well and so is the wheatgrass. Our beta fish "gilbert" seems very happy (even though his water is kind of merky).We're really enamored with the idea of this system, but there's no getting around the reality that you've got a fish and fish tank to contend with, and that isn't just something you can just plug in and forget about.***Updated 1/31***Our first beta fish in the Back To Roots has died. We got the water tested and it was OK. So it's possible the fish wasn't well to start.**Updated 2/4/16**Back to the Roots customer support has been really good about troubleshooting and ultimately dealing with a fish death. They sent a new kit with a coupon for another beta and water conditioners. This was really great of them to do and so far our second time around with our next fish has been better.One key we found was it's good to grow the seeds first BEFORE getting the fish. this seems to set up the ecosystem well before the fish is introduced to it. Also the Wheat Grass does much better over the long haul than the radish sprouts, and you can just trim the grass to encourage growth rather than replanting.
