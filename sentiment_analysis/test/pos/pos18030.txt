These brush guards are very useful for storing and drying your makeup brushes. They will keep your bristles straight and shaped as the manufacturer intended whether you are drying them or tossing them in an overnight bag. They are especially useful during the drying process as you can just wash your brushes (I use a mix of olive oil and dish soap on mine)then after washing you slip on a brush guard and put your makeup brush bristles down into a cup or jar. Let them dry overnight and voila! I would definitely purchase these again and am thinking of buying a few sets to put in gift bags for the holidays.
