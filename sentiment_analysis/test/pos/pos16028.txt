Love this wireless smart plug. The "installation" was a typical Dlink installation. I had to do a manual install to my wireless network. Little annoying but I am use to Dlink. It took just a few minutes. Love the convenience of this device. I can set schedules and turn night lights/lamps on/off with app on iPhone or android.
