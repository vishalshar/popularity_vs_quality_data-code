Bought this game for a trip to the Jersey Shore with my family and four "twenty somethings".  Not only did they LOVE it (and didn't mind carrying it to the beach), but they attracted a LOT of attention on the beach.  The little ones in our group also enjoyed playing with the "big kids".  Great family fun.
