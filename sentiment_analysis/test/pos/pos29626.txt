Really great drone. I've had it for several months and it seems to be getting better with the firmware updates. The 4k camera is just fantastic! It rivals the camera on my much more expensive DJI Inspire 1. It doesn't stay as rock steady in a wind as a higher priced drone but that's not why I fly it. My only complaint is that it will drift somewhat if traveling at a higher speed after the stick is brought back to neutral. It seems to have a lag that you have to be aware of when flying toward objects for a video shoot. It has a very high quality build so I'm not at all concerned about stress cracks or damage from normal operations. The case and package is second to none.
