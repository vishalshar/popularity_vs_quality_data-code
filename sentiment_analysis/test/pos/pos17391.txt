I've been using this product for six weeks now. I believe it is working, although it's subtle - my lashes seem better with it than without it. I used to use Latisse and when I first started, I swear my lashes exploded - there were more of them and they were thicker and longer. But that effect didn't last. Wink hasn't made my lashes explode, but I do believe they are thicker and there are more of them. Not sure they're any longer, but I don't really need that. I use it on my over-plucked brows, too, and that's where I can more easily see a difference, although again, it's subtle. What's been bare for 40 years is slowly starting to come back. I will continue to use Wink for at least six months, to see if the improvement continues.
