Unfortunately, I live in the midwest so it is not really golf season. But I boght the Arccos 360 in preparation for the season. It was very easy to set up. Looking forward to seeing how well it works. I did send the arccos driver to two people as christmas gifts (they live in the south), they seemed to like the arccos drivers.
