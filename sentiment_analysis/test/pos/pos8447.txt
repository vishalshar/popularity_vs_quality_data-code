My husband loves these. We did the "looser" configuration. He finds that he can slip them on and off and still run in them. If they stretch out, we can always reconfigure them tighter. They have lasted over a year with no breakage, although a few of them seem to come unhooked more easily. Not a problem since he just re-hooks them, and that's still significantly less "messing around" than if they were laces (but might be something to consider if you were getting them for someone unable to re-hook the bands themselves). Almost no one has noticed or commented on them - in fact, we've had to point them out to people that we thought would like them! We would definitely buy these again.
