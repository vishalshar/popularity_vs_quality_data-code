I saw this printer on an episode of The Fine Bros Elders React. It is one of the best looking 3D printers out there with a refined design compared to some other printers out there. I saved for a few months to purchase this printer. Unfortunately I was disappointed with my initial experience. Before I edited this review I listed all the problems I was experiencing with the printer such as stringing, the brass lugs slipping out, prints shifting on the Y-axis mid print, and the Z-axis traveling in the wrong direction or not getting close to the bed.After I had posted this review, I was pretty much done with this printer and initiated a return, but I did order another one thinking it was a bum unit. Jerry from Robo 3D reached out to me on my review and offered his expertise on the problems I was having. We had a discussion via Skype and he walked me through some procedures to get the printer to print at its best. After everything was said and done, it was a night and day difference. I re-printed this box I designed for a LCD display and it came out so much better than the one I printed the night before. There are some other modifications I will need to do, such as covering the bottom with heating duct tape to keep the cork from drooping and adjusting one of the current pots for the Y-axis.Before I tried ABS and gave up because it always lifted or turned into a stringy mess. Now I am printing a Raspberry Pi box with ABS. The lid came out great with some slight lifting, but it is a major improvement from the previous result.I really appreciate the support I received from Jerry at Robo 3D and based on all the results I have been getting, Ive decided to change my review. It is a great printer and one of the more refined designs out there, but it may require some tweaking and support to get it to print optimally.
