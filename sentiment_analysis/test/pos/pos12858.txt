I'm on my second jar of this now. I wanted to give it a month before really touting this product. I've been trying to find a natural deodorant that actually works for about 7 years now.I've tried Tom's, Jason's, all-natural Arm & Hammer, just lemon (worked surprisingly well, but wildly inconvenient when travelling), no deodorant, crystals, coconut oil only, etc, etc etc. Most of the branded deodorants just don't work, make me sticky, have a funny smell, and just don't stop sweat. I am a profusely sweaty human (I call them the switts), so eventually I went back to the nasty, aluminum, prescription-strength deodorant, becausde I was embarrassed of my switts (that's sweaty armpits) and didn't want to smell funky (I'm very sensitive to smells).In doing research to make my own deodorant, I discovered arrowroot powder, and wanted to try a product before making my own... Needless to say, while this is a small and expensive jar, I likely won't begin making my own because I love this one so much.As other reviewers have mentioned, your pits could get a little red -- likely due to the irritation of the baking soda. Just don't use more than a pea-sized amount, and start out with a little and work your way up. If you're getting red, you could also mix it with a little more coconut oil before applying. (The base is coconut oil, so it would just dilute it.)I also tried Schmidt's at the exact same time, but it legitimately didn't work as well. Or perhaps my body didn't interact well with Schmidt's Cedarwood-Juniper scent, whereas it does with Primal Pit's Lavender. This is also something to keep in mind when choosing a scent: because of our individual pheromones, some essential oils just won't blend well with our own natural scents. I picked lavender because I know it works for me. (Cedarwood usually does, too, but not this time.)You may sweat a lot or smell a little funny at first, but this is likely your body de-toxing. Aluminum deodorants work by blocking your sweat pores. Thus, you'll have some backed up stuff coming out of there. Try this for at least two weeks before giving up on it. If it's made you red early on, that should stop by then, and if you were stinky at first, that should go away, too.I paid full price for this product and wasn't bribed to write a review. (:
