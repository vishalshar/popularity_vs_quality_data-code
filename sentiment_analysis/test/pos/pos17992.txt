This is a fantastic beginner piano. The LED lights really make learning a lot of fun, for kids and adults. Learning the piano requires a lot of practice. Practice everyday, and dedicate yourself. The LED lights make every lesson fun to learn and play. I have to admit that even with the lights showing exactly what keys to press and when, it's still kind of intimadating and get frustrating when I can't move my fingers fast enough. But practice everyday. And be serious about it. Don't let your anger and frustration get the best of you. Just be patient.DIMENSIONS: Piano is 36" wide, 13" deep, and 4" height at its tallest. Each white key is 7/8" wide, almost an inch wide. The center portion folds up and acts as the stand for a music sheet/book, or iPad/tablet/smartphone.  The bottom of the piano has four rubber feet to keep it from sliding.QUALITY: It feels to be a decent quality build. The keys are unweighted, but it's a beginner piano, and as you progress in your skill level, you'll definitely want a better, more expensive piano with weighted keys. But as a beginner piano, it has everything you need to start learning how to play.  The keys still feel really great for unweighted keys and don't get in the way of learning how to move your hands and finger placement.INCLUDED: Power cord, Thunderbolt USB cable, and micro-USB cable.SOFTWARE: Most of the content is free.  It has worked very smoothly for me on my iPad. Everything loads and plays properly. Download from the App store. There are lessons, song tutorials, LED guided lessons, and games. Each lesson needs to be downloaded, so it takes a minute or few in order to run each lesson depending on your download speed. But you get to choose what you want to do, and can skip anything. The regular lessons don't need you to connect the piano to your iOS device. The Song tutorials, and the LED guided lessons DO require you to connect your iOS device to the piano using the included.  The song tutorials are my favorite as they are songs that are mostly well known and pop songs. Some songs offer different sections of the song, and some only offer the intro, and require you to purchase the other parts of the song (chorus, end, whole song).POWER CORD: Power adapter is included. Length is 4 feet 6 inches, and the plug is a small block, 3" H x 1.75" W x 1.25" D.  On surge protectors, where the outlets are close together, this will block other outlets next to it slightly. On a regular wall outlet, if plugged into the bottom outlet, it won't block the top outlet.  You can also use six AA 1.5V batteries if you don't have access to an outlet.. The cover is on the bottom of the piano.SPEAKERS: The sound outputted is really nice. The sound could be slightly better, but I'd rate the sound at a 4 stars out of 5. There are two large speakers.
