I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  No more tangles from using two separate leashes!  I would have given it 5 stars except it's a little heavy.  Sturdy, but heavy.  We have a lab and a chihuahua so I have to shorten his leash and lengthen hers or else my little chihuahua would get yanked all over the place, poor thing :) I use this coupler in conjunction with the Flexi Comfort Retractable Leash, also purchased at Amazon.  They are perfect together!
