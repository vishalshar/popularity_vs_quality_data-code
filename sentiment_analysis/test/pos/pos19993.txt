I wanted to watch my cats when I'm at work or on vacation and was looking for a camera that would be easy to set up. The more security type cameras have a complicated set up and then you have to pay to save video. This camera set up in 2 minutes with the push of a button. It senses motion and will take pictures or video of the action. It also pans and tilts which was important. I had previously purchased the the "pet cube" and was disappointed in its range and function.I wish that it would zoom but that is the only negative I've found.
