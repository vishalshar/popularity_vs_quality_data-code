I get car sick when others are driving.  My friend suggested trying these Anchor Bars because I don't like taking pills often and I'm not going to take Dramamine every time I get in a car because I feel so sleepy with it on board, so I got the 3 pack to try.  It worked!  I could make eye contact with others in the car instead of having to silently look straight ahead the whole time.  The first bite I really tasted the ginger and then the blueberries.  I liked it - I ate the whole thing.  The consistency isn't like a granola bar, but more like a rice puff one.I also had a couple bars with me after some friends and I had an all night board game night, with many drinks and snacks.  The next morning none of us were feeling tip top and one of my friends had been up in the night vomiting so he was in rough shape.  I gave him his own bar and the rest of us split the second one.  Everyone thought it was fun to try it and my friend who had been sick actually felt remarkably better!  I was so excited it worked!  He said it wore off after about 3-4 hours and he felt gross again.  Wish I'd had another to give him then.Anyway, I'm a fan of these bars now and have ordered the 3 pack again a couple times.  They're great to have on hand for car trips and mornings after game nights! :)
