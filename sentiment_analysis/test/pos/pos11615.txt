I bought this product as a complete beginner and was not disappointed! The Jamstik was super easy to connect and just jump right in to the lessons. The guitar was very sensitive and picked up very minor mistakes that I wouldn't have noticed on my own. The lessons were very simple and easy to understand while the arcade and Challenge modes were great for honing in my new skills. Only downside to this product is the fact that you never really learn any songs. It will teach you a few cords and several notes but I found the lack of actual songs to be a let down. Since completing all the 1st lessons, however, I have made the jump and bought an actual guitar so that I can start playing real songs. Thanks to the Jamstik though the transition has been an easy one so far. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is just looking for a place to start or for someone who enjoys using new technology to learn something seemingly complex.
