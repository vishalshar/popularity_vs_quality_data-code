Part of me almost hates the fact that I am rating popcorn additive and that I like it so much. This really has changed popcorn in our house. Let me explain. My wife will go to the movie just so she can get the popcorn. I will admit that we have gone to the theater and bought popcorn and left. We have bought popcorn salts and other additives but it is never the same. We have even tried air poppers, oil poppers and even had retro movie style popper for a while. But is was never as good. This has all changed now. Adding this to our normal microwaved popcorn is more enjoyable than movie popcorn. I have already saved a ton of money in movie tickets. Now it is just as fun to watch a rented movie at home with a bag or two of this popcorn. It may end up being too much of a thing in the long run, but for now my family cannot get enough.
