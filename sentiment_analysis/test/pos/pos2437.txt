My son (age 5) was having a lot of issues in class.  He was being very disruptive and having a tough time focusing in class.  He would come home with 2 or 3 "bad" notes a week that he had a bad day at school.  I purchased Focus along with SmartyPants.  I give him 1 Focus and 2 SmartPants every morning and evening.  I took both vitamins to his dr to review before giving them to him and she approved and thought the ingredients were great.  He has taken a full both of both Focus and SmartPants and we see great improvement.  His teacher also notices a big difference.  Last week he came home with a good report all 5 days!  I attribute his turn around to these vitamins.  Highly Recommended!!
