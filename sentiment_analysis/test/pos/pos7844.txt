this is a great kit. my daughter asked for it. someone in her class had brought it in to school. i wasn't sure exactly what i was ordering, but now that we have it, i am glad i ordered it. very easy to use. lots of projects in the book. great learning tool and lots of fun. only issue--the sound trigger doesn't seem to work very well and many projects in the book are dependent on it. have emailed little bits customer service so we'll see what happens. even so, i highly recommend.
