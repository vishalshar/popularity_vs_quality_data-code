I bought this for my son who plays wide receiver in high school. The first passing league game that he used them in, he told me that he absolutely loved the tackiness and claimed that he "caught several passes that he would not have caught" without the product.  I know it makes the gloves more tacky. You can see it and hear it. But, equally importantly, it inspires confidence. Highly recommended.
