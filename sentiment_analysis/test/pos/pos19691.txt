Received it today in the mail from USPS, chose 1 day shipping.First of all, I'd like to comment on the slow shipping and procurement process. It has been twenty days since I placed my order for this case. I received the phone on April 3rd, as AT&T put me on a priority list, and, naturally, wanted to protect my $750 (thanks for the extra cost, AT&T) device.In the approximately three weeks without a case, I have gotten multiple scratches, as it was inevitable I would drop it a bit, hence, my purchasing the case before I dropped it for the first time.Regrettably, Amazon failed to obtain and ship this product in a timely manner. Granted, the item did not actually exist for a week and a half since my order, so I concede that. However, there is no excuse for not obtaining the item three or fewer days after the manufacturer ships them out themselves, much less 10 days after. And even when it was available to ship, and there were items in stock for 4 days, my order was ignored until three days ago! With one-day shipping! I am very disappointed, and have deducted one star for that single reason. Do not expect this item in a timely manner, if you are to go by my experiences. I suspect other reviewers will comment on it.That being said, on to the case itself.I'm an UAG fan, as it is. I rocked a Slate case for my old HTC One M7, and looked classy while doing so. That case protected my phone very satisfactorily, and I no longer feared drops or slips.Flash forward two years to the release of the HTC One M9. The thing looks like a luxury watch, but doesn't cling to your wrist. It's rather slippery on its own. The lip does help, but I had my first drop while trying to clean the phone itself. Punished for being a good phone owner.I can safely say that the UAG case improves grip and texture to the phone. While slipperier than the old polymer-style Slate/Scout cases of yore, this case has plenty of ridges, making it easy to hold on to. It feels nice and solid in the hands, and even improves the usability of the power and volume buttons, making them more distinct. Ports are easily accessible, and I find it pleasant to hold. The clear case shows off the aluminum body that, with its hexagon Crysis-esque design, shows off the brushed metal of the back quite nicely. Flashes of gold are visible, too, on the side, and gives a mild layer of refinement to the whole package. Not as brazen, then, but still lovely to behold. It feels nice and solid, but light at the same time.Flashlight is indeed in good working condition with this case, as I am now blinded as I type this line out. It IS slightly off center, but that could very well be due to my manhandling of the case, attempting to eject my phone from the clutches of the case itself.It is slightly difficult to get off, but you shouldn't need to remove it. If you do, just press up on the top of the case lip, and push the camera sight in slightly.Oh, and the "HD Screen protector" is worthless as always. I have an invisiShield tempered glass protector on mine, and it feels miles better than the cheap-feeling plastic one thrown in for goodwill. Though, you aren't reading this review because you wanted to purchase some food wrap. You want a good case. You've found it.In conclusion, this product is another nice case from UAG. It's what we've come to love from the brand, with the few extra touches courtesy of UAG, in the way of clear sidings and textured buttons. You won't be disappointed. Will update the review if I have a bad drop, to document the survivability of the case.
