Delicious! A healthy snack with nothing added. Great on the go and/or when you get tired of eating regular bananas--want the nutrition of banana but a change in texture. These are wonderfully crunchy. Our kids love them too. If you're used to the oil and sugar laden traditional banana chips then you should be warned that these are not those. These are better tasting and better for you but won't satisfy those who prefer the greasy, sweet snacks.
