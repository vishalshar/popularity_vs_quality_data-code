I ordered mine at the prerelease price. I have  live streamed four contemporary church services on Facebook using public wifi and my iPhone 5s. I have it 5ft from the (elevated) stage on a mic stand. I use an external battery designed for a GoPro since I record 2-2 1/2 hrs continuously. I use the built in mic with fairly good results. Auto color balance and exposure are good inspite of frequent harsh lighting. I am generally pleased. I am very pleased with the responsiveness of the manufacturer. They have already released 2 updates. They also respond on the customer Facebook page.Please consider your intended use and MEVO's limitations. Then lower your expectations a few notches. It does much better in good lightgrainy otherwise. It's mic can't work miraclesexternal micing is possible at an added expense. Internet speed (upload>6) is needed for highest quality streaming. It can stream in 2 lower qualities. It is designed to be a one camera solution to streaming a multi cam event. In August 2016, it is in it's first iteration with evolving software. It hasn't met my all of expectations; but, I really like it and look forward to seeing it mature.
