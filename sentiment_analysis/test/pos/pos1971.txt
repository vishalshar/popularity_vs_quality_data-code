We've transitioned our toddlers from regularly using sippy cups to regular cups... the problem is that they are prone to spilling their drinks. I saw this product advertised in a couple of places and, although still skeptical, the review by Unbox Therapy convinced me to give them a try. Of course, the first thing I did when I received them was trying to knock them down. Now, they are very hard to knock down, but not impossible. The point of these cups is resist accidental bumps and nudges, not to resits a nuclear bomb. Now if you, like me, bought these for small children, keep in mind that if you use placemats, the cups will stick to the placemat (as it would to any smooth surface), and bumps and nudges would end up moving the placemat and everything on it... potentially (and I mean POTENTIALLY) causing a mess.
