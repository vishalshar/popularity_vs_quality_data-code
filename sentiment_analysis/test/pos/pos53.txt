This is an incredible door lock. Well built, looks great, easy to install and program. I have never had 4 ways to open a lock before, however, I would love the functionality of automatically opening when my phone (Bluetooth) is nearby without having to do anything else. For example, if my hands are full, I could simply press down on the handle. I understand that people who live in sketchy neighbors wouldn't want that. But I don't. Another nice feature would be wifi connectability so I could remotely unlock the door for a guest. And a third bit of functionality that would be nice is if I could know if the door is closed or ooen. Of course the last two would require Bluetooth functionality.Overall, it's a great lock. I am quite happy. An indoor version would be nice for an office or gun room. Consider that Ultraloq!
