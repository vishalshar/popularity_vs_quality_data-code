I have had the iFetch for a week, and my Toy Rat Terrier loves it.  It seems well-made and sturdy to me.  My dog learned to feed the ball in himself in just a short time, though he does likes it better if I play, of course.  The chute does get slobbery, but I have wiped it out after each play session and all is well.  I have always had to put those little Kong balls away after play or they, too, get shredded, so that is not an issue I blame on the iFetch.  Once a cover has lifted even a little, though, the ball will no longer work in the iFetch. I like the 3 distance settings.  The wind-up does give my dog time to get in front of the machine, and he occasionally catches it right out of the shoot, but this doesn't have enough force to hurt him and he likes that, too.I have another toy dog who is a lot softer than my terrier, and no way she would play with this machine, even though she likes fetch.  Some dogs would be intimidated, I am sure, so know your dog before you buy.UPDATE:Still going strong after 3 months of almost daily play.  My dog gets so excited when I bring the IFetch out!  Some pieces of advice, though. After a bit, even with daily cleaning out with spray cleaner and a paper towel, the slobbery fuzz will build up in the tube and around the launcher wheels.  You need a long-handled tool to get this cleaned up.  I recommend a bottle brush.  Another thing that has happened -- my dog has learned that if he pokes the ball in hard, it will sometimes do a premature launch ... he loves this, but the IFetch does not, and it often jams.  As a result, I have to baby-sit every throw..  I am going to experiment with a funnel device to make the intake tube longer, so he can't do this, and I can enjoy more remote play.  Still love it!
