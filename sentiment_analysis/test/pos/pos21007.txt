The Coolest Cooler is worth every penny! I purchased my Coolest in February 2016, before the Summer boating season. It is the perfect solution for a boat and/or dock.  I used it all Summer, every Saturday for our weekly dock parties.  Using the divider, I used the left side as an ice bucket and the right side to hold the mixers, etc.  Leaving the drain plug open allowed for the ice melt to drain while keeping the items on the right side dry.  The blender worked great for frozen drinks and the battery life lasted longer than I expected.  The Bluetooth speaker puts out great sound and the charge also lasted longer than expected. I couldn't be more pleased with the Coolest!
