I replaced the ABS Flip Thread Chuck that came on my Lezyne. A lot happier with the Swoop product. It took some muscle to get it on the tube but once it's on it isn't going anywhere. I found it pretty easy to use with a little practice.4 out of 5 stars because nothing on this planet is perfect.I highly recommend it!
