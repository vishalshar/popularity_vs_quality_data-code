I was a little skeptical when I bought the SkyBell HD, but install and set up were super simple.  I had to use longer screws than the ones supplied to complete the install, but that was no real issue.  Hooked it, followed the instructions, and it was done.  The whole thing took about 30 minutes.  It operates just as it says it would.  Very happy with the purchase.
