I bought these because I was sick of cheese tasting like plastic from ziploc bags, etc. These bags have kept the cheese from going stale in the fridge, so that's one test passed! They do seem a little pricey - I think next time I'm just going to go with some kind of wax paper instead, but I have found that these bags are durable enough for many uses. So for some, the price may be justified in being able to use one bag over the course of many weeks. I will probably continue to use the same bag until it rips or something, then move on to another. They just seem to be a slightly glorified piece of wax paper made into a bag; that's my only reservation on buying another pack.
