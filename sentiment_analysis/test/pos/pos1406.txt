I purchased it as a combined present for my 5 year old nephew and 8 year old niece. Not only were they both challenged by the project, but the two also showed genuine excitement working on it. Since I'm in college, I had to scrap together the money in my savings to afford this... but lets just say my hurting bank account was well worth the response I saw from the kids. I want to encourage a love of STEM in the kids and this was a great way to go about doing that. Experiences > money every day.
