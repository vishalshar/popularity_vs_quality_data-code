I can finally read the labels on the grocery shelves, when I have discovered I don't have my reading glasses with me. I have mounted my new lens-case onto my cell phone, which, of course, goes EVERYWHERE with me. Since I ALWAYS have that at hand, I now also have my reading glasses with me, as well. What FABULOUS product!!!!!!! Absolutely LOVE IT!!!!!
