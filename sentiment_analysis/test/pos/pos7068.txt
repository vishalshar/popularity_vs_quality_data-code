Expensive product but well worth it!  Syncs and works perfectly with our Guardian Wireless Fence by PetSafe.  The prongs on the collar might be a little short if your dog has very long hair.  The original collar that came with the product has large and longer prongs.  Does the job very well on our boxer dog.  It has 6 settings of correction as well. 1 being just the beeping tone and the others progressing in shock strength.  It does use the exact same batteries as the old collar that we are currently using for out other dog.
