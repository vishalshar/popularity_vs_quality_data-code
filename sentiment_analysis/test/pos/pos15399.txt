I play flag football and just recently got this stuff, with a new pair of gloves to try to help me. This liquid works, but I would suggest that you use it before a game rather than a practice or when you are playing with your siblings in the street. The reason I'm saying it because you will get a lot more passes thrown to you than in a game. I suggest using this before a game mostly, and you may not have to reapply. This stuff loses it full potential stickiness after about 10 minutes of playing in the street, but will last longer in the game. It still is sticky after 10 minutes, but not it's full potential. I use Gripboost gloves, their first pair I believe, and it works very well. I was able to make some crazy catches. Overall I really love this product, but maybe the durability needs to improve. Love this!
