As mention before from others, this review is about the product only. Got Ukeg from Amazon Prime, read the directions and did a test run with water & vinegar. Pressured up and held pressure, ran the mixture until empty. Cleaned up again and filled with Alaskan Brewing Co. Amber. Set the growler in the frig for overnight, pressure held dispensed beer as advertised.
