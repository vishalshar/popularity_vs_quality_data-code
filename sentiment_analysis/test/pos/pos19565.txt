I have three sets of these little guys and I love them. Now I can finally dry my brushes the way they were meant to be dried. There is a variety of sizes in these packages and there is a net to fit almost every brush. The only one there is really not a net for are the large and fluffy kabuki brushes so I have to use a drying stand for them. A lot of us women spend a lot of money on our brushes because the quality is so important so these little guys are worth every penny to keep them clean and dried properly. I would definitely recommend, especially is you have a lot invested in your brushes.
