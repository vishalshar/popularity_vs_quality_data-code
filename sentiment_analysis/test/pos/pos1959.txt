This was a great purchase.  I make and drink an iced latte everyday, and I was going on a trip for two weeks, and didnt want to spend $5 at Starbucks everyday. So I bought this bad boy, and it worked great! In fact, I think the "crema" is even better than my at home espresso machine.  It's rich, colorful, smells good, etc. Worth it! :)
