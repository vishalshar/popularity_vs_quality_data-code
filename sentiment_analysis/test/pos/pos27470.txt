When I first got it I had a few problems using the Roadie.  I found a fix for all of them & now I like it very much.  First off my phones buttons are too small -- fixed by using an Amazon Basics pen.As for the Roadie use itself...  Several times it shut off to save the motor from excess pressure.  This got very frustrating quickly.  Fix -- wrapped tape around the Roadie head so the thumb screw would stay centered.  This helped on several strings.  Then I got frustrated (see a pattern here?) by the Roadie not setting in place at the same angle to hold it firmly.  Fix -- I realized it doesn't matter one bit what the initial angle is because it's going to change it anyway.  Doh!Still was having a hard time as it was shutting off from too much pressure.  Fix -- I realized that my gears and shafts ends on my forty year old guitar were dirty and crunchy.  Used a Q-tip to add a fraction of a drop of PTFE penetrating oil to the gear teeth and the ends of the shaft (which are metal on metal).  When the gears moved smoothly without crunch the Roadie suddenly had absolutely no problem making adjustments quickly.  I mean a couple of strums and done!I deducted one star of the need to hold it manually square to the peg without any framework or brace, and I had to modify it to keep the pegs from slipping out the sides of the head.
