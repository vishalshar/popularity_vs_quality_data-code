This thing works great!  I was doing some power geocaching along a rail-trail with my bike, and needed a way to see when I was getting close.  Then when I got there, I had to remove the phone to walk to the cache.  This setup was absolutely perfect for that!  I did hundreds with this mount and it will be an essential tool for next time.
