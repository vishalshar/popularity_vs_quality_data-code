I love this water filter because it is glass and not plastic. I use glass whenever possible. It filters pretty fast and holds a good amount of water. it is not large but i keep my water at room temperature so it keeps up with my water drinking. If i wanted cold water i might want a bigger container but this works great for me. I like to pull the filter out and pour directly from the glass that way you can pour your water while it is still filtering.  If you do leave the filter in while pouring make sure that it is sealed in tight so the water doesn't come back up through the filter.
