The banana mix is my absolute favorite that is until.....i came across the Pumpkin Spice Mix! Both wonderful mixes and hard to choose just one....so for now it's a tie! Delicious, moist, and at an affordable price. The whole family loves it...and for sure, will order more in a week or two! Thank you Cherryvale Farms :) Highly Recommended with 10 Stars.
