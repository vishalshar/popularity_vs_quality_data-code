I first heard of it thanks to the internet, while browsing on Michellephan.com.As far as I'm concerned it's the best to protect brushes from the dust, but still allows them to "breathe".I also use the brush guards after cleaning my brushes.After squeezing (gently) as much water as possible and letting them for a few minutes wrapped in a sheet of kitchen roll, I slide the brushes in the brush guard and leave them head down in a big glass, works amazing!
