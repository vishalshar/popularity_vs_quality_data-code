This is the third Select Brand Dual Coffeemaker we have owned. We have one at home and one in our travel trailer. Love that we can both have our own coffee. He likes regular, I'm half & half. After years of daily use with no issues our first one decided to quit. We feel as though we got our money's worth and had no issue purchasing the same type/brand again.  Yes we would recommend this machine. We purchased an inexpensive timer for both home and the trailer since it doesn't come with one. We like waking up to that smell of fresh brewed coffee.
