I threw a few of the Noka Blueberry Beet Superfood snacks into my cooler on my way to the Indian Wells (CA) Tennis Garden to watch some world class tennis at the BNP Paribas Open today. I like blueberries a lot, and these chilled Noka snacks really hit the spot in the warm California sunshine at the stadium. These superfood blends taste like a fruit smoothie, are very neat to eat, and are conveniently portable since they are shelf-stable and can be eaten at room temperature, if you prefer. Try them---you'll like them! Great for adults and kids alike. I've already ordered the Mango Coconut flavor and will post my impressions after they arrive.
