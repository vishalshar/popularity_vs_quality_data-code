This brush works as advertised. Comes with a quick-connect hose adapter, and an on/off switch on the handle. Seems to be very ruggedly made. And, for the first time ever, I was able to clean my BBS wheels without getting a blister on my fingertip, trying to get in between the spokes. Also used it on my Elantra's wheels and grill trim. Worked beautifully getting the brake dust and road grime off of the wheels, and the bugs off those hard to reach spaces in the grille. It will not, however, remove heavy grease like the kind that gets thrown up from the road when following a freshly greased semi).All in all, I think it's worth it, especially if you have tight spaces that need to be cleaned regularly.
