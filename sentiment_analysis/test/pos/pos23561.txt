Update 6/22/2016 -- Invoxia followed up and was able to deliver a firmware that fixed all the issues with the speaker phone, sound quality is excellent.  Invoxia seemed dedicated and focused on delivering a great customer experience.  With my problem fixed, I couldn't be happier with the Triby and my Mom is sure to love it.Bought a Triby for Mom for mothers day.  Setup was great and the Triby works fantastic for the most part.  Bought it primarily as a portable speakerphone, and for Alexa and Internet Radio functions secondarily.  It does great for everything except the speakerphone.  Streaming audio functions perfectly (over bt/A2DP)  Internet radio works perfect, Alexa works 'ok' -  but I had read enough other reviews to understand this was not an 'Echo'  and the sound quality generally sounds really good.  However, the call quality for the speaker phone (HS/HFF) is unusable, it stutters, artifacts, and otherwise is generally unintelligible.  I tried pairing several different phones and across all of them got poor audio quality on both sides of the speakerphone.  Have tried rebooting, updating firmware (there was no update available).  I have reached out to Invoxia for support and pending the outcome of that I would love to be able to uprate this product.  If the speaker phone worked even as well as a $20 bluetooth speaker this would easily be a 4.5 star product.
