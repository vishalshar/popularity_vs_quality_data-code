I found the Merge VR to work fairly well.  The phone was easy to get into the device, the headstrap was easy to adjust, and the lenses were easy to get set to where you needed them to be.  Sometimes you'd need to move the lenses a little bit after a bit of wearing the device, and I found that some apps require them to be adjusted slightly differently than other apps.The foam material that they are made from works very well.  It's comfortable and lightweight, and it actually looks pretty good as well.Ultimately, I found them to not be for me, however, because of the fact that almost every app that I tried ended up giving me a headache pretty quickly.  I found this to become worse the more that I used them...not in that the headache would get worse, but in that the amount of time I could use them before getting a headache became less and less.Ultimately, I ended up giving them away.The only reason I am knocking a star off of the product is because I found the buttons to be able to tap things on the screen while the phone was in the headset to be a bit hit or miss.  Sometimes they'd work well on one app, and then the next day they wouldn't work at all on that same app.  I'm not sure if it was something I was doing, but I seemed to always have the phone in the same way and the headset on the same way, so I have to believe it was the buttons not pressing the screen well enough from time to time.They are a good product, and certainly a good start.  I wish I could have used them more than I did, but the person that has them now is enjoying them.Recommended.
