I bought this item last year when Amazon did their black Friday thing over the summer.  This product has met all my expectations and does a really really good job of tracking shots.  It has helped me know how far I hit my clubs on a regular basis and very rarely does it not register my shot correctly.  The only times it doesn't record your shot is if you duff one 10 yards or less and then hit another one, but its a pretty simple fix with the app and is then marked and ready to go.  It doesn't do a great job at gimme putts but if you hover over the ball for a few seconds before putting it usually catches the putt you just have to be very deliberate with the putting.Also I lost a sensor sometime late last year and was hoping it would show up in my bag this spring, but it did not.  So I went on the website to purchase a new sensor and was actually told they would send one for free since it is not supposed to come out of the club.  Very awesome customer service is also a great plus to this great product.
