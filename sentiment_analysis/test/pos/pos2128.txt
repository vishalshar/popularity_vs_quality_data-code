UPDATE:  Amazon has updated the purchase options (Two models: ft/in only or dual-marked tape with cm/mm on side of tape opposite the inches markings).  I purchased (and returned) TWO of these tapes before Amazon offered the purchase choice since the previous product photos showed the ft/in & cm/mm marked tapes which I thought that I was purchasing (unlike the ft/in ---ONLY--- model that was shipped).  Now that I can purchase and have received a metric-marked (cm/mm) model, my two-star rating bumps up to four stars.  A straight cm/mm marked tape would be ideal (since the dual-marked tape has you reading 'inch' measurements off of one side of the tape when you want a cm/mm measurement.  With a cm/mm (both sides of the slide-out blade) marking, you don't have parallax errors when you're able to put either side of the tape precisely against the edge of whatever you're measuring.  (I have a number of cm/mm ---Only--- tapes which promote accurate measurements on either side of the pull-out blade).  The digital functions are a major advance in tape measures and, here again, it's just shy of five-stars since the XY.z cm reading on the digital display can be off by 2.5 mm (the "+-.1" claimed accuracy).  Re-zeroing the tape (simple button-push procedure) can result in measurements that are often 'spot-on' and more generally fall close to 1 mm accuracy which exceeds the product 'spec.'.  Having the cm/mm markings on the tape allows you to know when the digital display of "XY.z cm" is off and a quick re-zero step is in order.The first order of this item differed from the product description. (See photo).  It goes back to Amazon.  The inches/feet (only) model that was received differed from the item that was purchased (dual markings on tape: in/ft opposite mm/cm).  One should not need to have a battery in a tape measure in order to read measurements in metric units and the model that is pictured in the Amazon description can display metric measurements directly off of the extended tape.  'Will re-evaluate the product when the replacement order arrives (hopefully as described, having metric units on the extendable tape).  Repeat inquiries to the email link on the manufacturer/distributor's website sought information as to what model number must be specified in order to obtain the mm/cm-marked tape.  There has been no response from the mfr/dist'r, leaving it to Amazon's generous return policy to keep re-ordering until the correct model is received.
