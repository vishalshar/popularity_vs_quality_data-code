I have probably 15 different battery cases. This is definitely a top 3 the only thing I don't like it that the on/off button is the +volume button which u must press and hold for 3 seconds to turn on and off which means when it beeps to let you know phone is charging it's LOUD. Not crazy about that. Other than that I love it.  I'm torn between my favorite. It's either the Apple smart battery or this. I wish they were more colorful but aside from that I love it.
