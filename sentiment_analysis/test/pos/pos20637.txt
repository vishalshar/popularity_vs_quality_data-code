I had high hopes for this and while it's a mixed bag, the good mostly outweighs the bad.The Good: works as advertised - generally speaking its very successful at tracking the exercises in Guided Workout mode and counting the reps. The interface for adjusting the weight is quick and easy, and the workouts work really well.The Bad: the app leaves a lot to be desired. The best feature is the guided workouts, but there aren't enough of them and they aren't very smart (if I redo a workout it doesn't remember my weight from last time). It also makes it harder than it should be to bring up an exercise form video or history during the workout - rather than knowing what workout you're in the middle of, you have to hunt through a long list to find it.The battery life is also a big negative - it's incredibly short. You'll need to charge it after every workout to be sure. This isn't just something you can keep in your gym bag.Another concern is that it requires an internet connection to work at all - so if you're somewhere without internet, or if the company ever shuts down its servers, you'll be limited to the exercises you have loaded on the watch.But cons aside I'm still giving it four stars.  There's really no other products like it on the market, and the important stuff works really well.
