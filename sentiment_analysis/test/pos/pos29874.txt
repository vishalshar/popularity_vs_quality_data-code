If you're a tech guy/gal, home automation seems to be a natural progression today. Even though it's been around for a while now, it was only available to the 15% from the big names like Crestron and Control 4. For a 3 bedroom home you would have to drop at least $10k for a project with one of those guys. And the tech still had awful bugs that only a certified reseller had access to fix.I lived with my brother for many years who had all his homes fully automated with Control 4 systems. Needless to say, i grew accustomed to it's convenience and cool factor. But once i left the nest and started my own family, i missed the automated accouterments. Having to get out of bed to turn off the living room lights seemed barbaric.My first go at lighting control was with Belkin's WeMo.  It got the job done, but only on a small scale. Anything past 4 devices and it became cumbersome to control even with third party apps. Plus no apple homekit integration. so no siri! Also, the wall outlets and switches were connected via WiFi which is convenient for a few devices but not in a whole home situation with one access point.Enter Caseta....After viewing a demo of Caseta, i decided to go all in! i replaced every single light switch and lamp plug with a Caseta switch.(16 switches 4 plugs) A mixture of dimmer switches and off/on switches(in the bathrooms). It was a very simple project any novice home owner-handyman can do in a day.The switches communicate with a network connected hub via low range RF which means it easily penetrates wall and has a decent signal radius. Perfect for my two bedroom condo. No need for repeaters or range extenders.Also the ability to eliminate two-way switches by using the pico remote instead is a great hack.Adding new switches to the Caseta system is ridiculously easy and the smartphone app is well designed. Adding Apple's homekit integration takes it to a whole other level. You can create cool scenes, and zones (or rooms: a group of switches). Just ask siri to activate or adjust a zone by name and she does it instantly. I feel like my condo is the Enterprise.I've been using Caseta for about 4 months, and it's one of the best investments i've made in my home.My only gripe would be it's lack of "open-sourceness." I wish scenes and pico switch assignments were a little more customizable.
