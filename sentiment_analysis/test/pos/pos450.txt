I received my first 3D printer a few days ago and since then, I'm not an expert yet though I can tell that the quality of the filament is very good and the prints come out beautiful, I did have some failures on a few prints but that has nothing to do with the filament (printer settings needed adjustment).The reason that made me choose this brand and seller out of all the others was the fact that I was able to buy 0.5K and not 1K spools. I was able to get 2 colors which will do the job for now but definitely not the last time I get this great filament.Shipping was extremely fast of course, Thank you for a superb service and product.
