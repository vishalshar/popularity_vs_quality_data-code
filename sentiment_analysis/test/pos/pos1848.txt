The Asus K501UW is a workhorse. The build design is excellent and the material is aluminum. For those who wish to have a sturdy laptop that is also stylish in design, this is a fine option to consider.  I needed discrete graphics on my laptop purchase and this laptop comes with a beast inside. The Nvidia 960M has plenty of RAM and horsepower to render gorgeous graphics with very high FPS. The thermal build-up on this machine is next to nothing for my system. I have it on high-performance and it runs smoothly, quietly and without lag.+ The HDMI output is crisp and clear. The discreet graphics remembers all the displays you connect and their settings so that you don't have to fidget with the settings every time. Always had an issue with non-discreet graphics laptops on this; but this laptop works perfectly.+ The networking on this is outstanding. Very good WI-FI options on the adapter and excellent on-board gigabit LAN. The connectivity is rock-solid with blazing throughput.+ The SSD is plenty fast and sized just right for a laptop. Spare HDD bay makes it nice and easy to upgrade to dual storage.+ The keyboard is not only back-lit, but it is very comfortable to use...unlike many of the other laptops I've used and owned from other vendors.+ The display is crisp, the pixels are tight and the quality is outstanding. No bad pixels in my order.+ The only thing to note is that this display is not the glossy BrightView style that many people are accustomed to seeing on inexpensive laptops from HP.  This is a matte finish display and has a sweet spot for the viewing angle for very dark colors. I'm OK with this as it is a minor concern compared to all the bells and whistles that this comes with.That display is a quality unit with rich bright colors, fast refresh, tight pixels and excellent durability. The matte finish is designed to minimize florescent light glare in the office or schoolroom. When using this for everything but viewing very dark movies (colorwise) you will not have any complaints. Did I mention that the clarity on the text rendering is crisp enough to cut you?It's ready to roll right out of the bag. Excellent purchase and am very happy with the quality of the machine.11/16/16 UPDATE: Just bought another one. That's how great this machine is. After 5 months it's still working as perfectly as the day I bought it.
