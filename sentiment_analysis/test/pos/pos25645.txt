Really well designed, although we get a bit of leakage on both units. It is nothing to complain about for us, as we could care less if we get a drip or two of drink on us - but I know some folks are very careful about not getting liquid on their riding gear. I hated using sports drinks and not being able to properly clean or sterilize our containers. I toss these in our dishwasher in three pieces and run the sterilize cycle - I KNOW they are spotless and bacteria free! I gave up plain water and switched to NUUN for every ride - these make that possible without me second guessing what else is in my drink bottle!
