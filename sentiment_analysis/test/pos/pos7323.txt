I absolutely adore this band I love it, it fits perfect, It is sleek and modern, The watch and date are incredibly helpful! If you have a kid who loves Minecraft and you have no clue what to get them, This is the answer to your problem, the only problem is cost. It comes in a fancy box with a cute Minecraft Redstone on it. Also, comes with a Minecraft gameband sticker. The only cons would be Price and if you put it on wrong it can pinch your skin and hurt. Otherwise, I would greatly recommend!
