I have 10 cats and two of them have UTI's.  Instead of running to the vet to get the "pearls" they sell at an outrageous price, I found this urine collection system.  After the first use, I bought more to keep on hand so when I think one of my kids is having a problem I can get a specimen and take it to the vet without any fuss or added vet costs.  The specimen tube they supply gives me trouble as I can never get the top on it, so I bought specimen cups with screw on lids.  My cats have no trouble using this.  I put them in a quiet room with the door closed and plenty of fresh water.  It is simple and no un-necessary trauma to my cats.  The sand does not cover the bottom of a standard litter pan, but it isn't an issue for my cats.
