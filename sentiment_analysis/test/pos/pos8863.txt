Was skeptical when I received this camera, easy to set up and well made.  You can even see in the dark with this.  I lost a cat when I was on a trip and it's caretaker let it out!  Now wherever I go or wherever I am. I know my babies are safe. I would definitely recommend. I am going to get another one for another room!  Oh yeah and you can even talk and play with your animals!! Amazing!!
