I LOVE THIS!! A friend had one and I really liked that it didn't look like a fitbit.  I find them unattractive and I hated always having to charge it.  The Apple watch is so obvious - I like this because it's super comfortable and does the job - and no one has to know!  I bought an extra band to dress it up.
