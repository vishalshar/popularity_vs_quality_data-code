I am very happy with this.  I am using it as a router.  It was so easy to set up, I could not believed it.  Just plug it in, click the touch screen to start wizard.  It then gives you the network name & password.  Thats it !!!  I did go in to change the name & password so it was easier to remember, which was easy to do  That's it.  I then went to 2 Roku, 2 laptops, Wii, & smart TV to add them to the network.  It is so much faster now then my old router.I'm lovin the on screen weather too.
