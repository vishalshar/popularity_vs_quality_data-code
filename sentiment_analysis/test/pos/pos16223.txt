I give thumbs up for the Levitation. Its truly unbelievable.. My kids luv it.....Having said that I am little disappointed with the sound quality as they claimed. Also the sound while switching on / off is really irritating and the Mobile APP needs lots of improvement !!!!! Hope Crazy Baby Team will look into the same and correct it during the upcoming firmware.
