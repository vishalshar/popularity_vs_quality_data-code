These bags really do work.  Keeps cheese fresh much longer than just keeping in the original wrapper.  My husband is a cheese lover so we will store several cheeses at one time and they last much longer stored in these bags and do keep them fresh and from smelling like other things in the refrigerator.  Happy with my purchase.
