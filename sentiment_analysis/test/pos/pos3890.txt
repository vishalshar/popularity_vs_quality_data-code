At work we use a Fluke TiR32 and this uses similar technology to the Flir One where it overlays a real picture with the thermal image and the thermal resolution is 320X240 and cost $8k. The new Seek compact pro which will be release soon is going to have the same resolution at $500. This camera has 206X156 resolution which is really good for under $300. I debated between this one and the Flir One and went with this one due to the increased resolution, I want the resolution because I will be using this at night so the normal camera will not give any benefit. I am using this with the Inteliscope app as well and will try shooting with it here in another month or so. The XR model is really hard to use closer than 5ft but it is possible. The focusing is very touchy and you have to consider that there is a slight lag between the picture and current viewing. I am going to be using tomorrow at work to compare it side by side to the fluke while we remove a lock nut on a jet engine that we heat up in order to remove it.I attached a few photos and a video but would definitely recommend if you want to spot things at night at a decent distance and just to have a little fun with. I also tested the accuracy of the temperature by looking at a blender bottle full of cold drink and it was reading 66°F and then I took an IR handheld thermometer and it read 67°F which is very close since the temperature outside and while i did all tests and pictures is 98°F here in Kansas.The truck was about 25 yards away. Also It does come with a waterproof case!
