These are definitely a good go-to after a sweaty workout when you don't have the option of showering. They are wet (not damp) towelettes when you first take them out of the pack, but after wiping yourself down you feel like you just took quick shower. This is also a slight negative...it takes a few minutes to air dry which is slightly annoying, but better than being the stinky kid in the office.
