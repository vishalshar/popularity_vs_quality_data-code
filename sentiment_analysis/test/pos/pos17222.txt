I initially looked at the Peak Design mount, and while I love their products, There's a significant price difference between $30 and $70, so I went with the PolarPro mount.The product is great, and does what it is intended to do - mount your GoPro to your backpack strap.If I'm being picky, there are 2 minor items that would make this product exceptional1 - the mount sticks a bit in the baseplate, even after the lock is disengaged. Look, tighter is safer/better, but there's a bit too much effort to dislodge it. I'm sure it'll get better with wear. I may sand it a bit now that I'm back from my trip. I'm sure a little elbow grease will solve this.2 - the screws that lock the front and back of base plate to the strap stick out a bit, and are in the way of the GoPro mounting screw. Not a big deal, you just need to tighten the camera to the mount after you've removed it from the baseplate.As I said, being picky. The product is great, looks nice, and does what it needs to do. And in my opinion, for a very fair price. You won't be dissatisfied if you opt for this backpack strap mount over a more costly alternative.
