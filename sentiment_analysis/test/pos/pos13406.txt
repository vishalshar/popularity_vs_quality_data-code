We needed to free up some space in our garage so we bought a couple myLIFTER's to help us get our bikes up and out of the way. I will add some pictures later to show the finished product. Quality of the lifter is very good. The phone app is well designed and easy to use. It arrived on time and was packaged very nicely. Overall function and utility of the item is well worth the money. I look forward to adding a few more to free up some more space!
