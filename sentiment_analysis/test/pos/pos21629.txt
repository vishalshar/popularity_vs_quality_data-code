If you are looking for a ligthtweight alternative to a Camelbak, this is for you. If you are a petite person (I'm 5' and 100 lbs) frustrated by gear that is too big and therefore chafes and throws you off balance, this is for you. It's easy to put on, easy to wear, and easy to clean. The bite straw is efficient and easily tucks into the elastic loops. You can put a phone in the pack with the bladder if you are in an area with low humidity (due to condensation); just seal the cap well. The only catch-22 is that the super adjustable and sturdy velcro on the straps can snag your shirt if you don't align them perfectly.
