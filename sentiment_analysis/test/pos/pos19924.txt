I purchased one of these from Back to the Roots directly, at the SF Green Expo in November. We read the instructions and FAQ first, and ended up giving it a little more water each day then it called for (noticed it was dry) and we got 2 harvests. I did not soak this in water, we just cut two slits and gave 2 teaspoons of water, 2x a day (maybe a little more). The instructions didn't call for soaking.  Maybe soaking is not good, for those people who didn't get any growth ? Note: we laid the box on it's side, so the mushrooms were facing up. It took about 10 days to sprout...but once the mushrooms started growing, they were so cool to watch! Changed every few hours! I just ordered 2 of these for gifts...so we'll see what happens! It's fun.
