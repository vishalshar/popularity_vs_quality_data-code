Love how small the phone is in this case versus the InterNet I had it in previously. It has protected it from edge drops, face down drips and every other type of drop you can imagine. Between my dogs and my classroom(I work with kids with special needs), it takes a beating! Very good looking and holds up to all surfaces that I have dropped it on, doesn't look scuffed or funky.
