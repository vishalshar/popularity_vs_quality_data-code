I ordered this product about two weeks ago, it arrived within 3 days. I started taking it on my last day of my period. I have had irregular periods and random bleeding now for about 3 years. I am 21. Since taking this I have noticed some cervical mucus which I haven't seen in about 3 years. I also haven't had any abdominal pain in the 2 weeks of being on this product (which is awesome) so I will continue to take this and when the time comes that my partner and I was to conceive I hope this product will also help with that. But for now I am happy with the results I am getting. Ps. Its tasteless for sure, I mix it with my tea every morning and you can't even tell it's in there. I also take prenatals with dha just because that's always been my daily vitamin.
