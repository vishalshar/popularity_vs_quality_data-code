This has been an amazing product for traveling and home use.My family likes to go on frequent camper trips and this product allows us to take our music, whether it be our own downloaded music, or local popular radio channels, we have it at our finger tips. The phone app allows for easy set up and browsing of desired music channels.And all the music is in amazing clarity and sound. The stylish design of the speaker is something I feel comfortable carrying around, with it's assortment of enter changeable handles, and having out on a table at my home.We have enjoyed listening to music as we get ready for work in the morning. I have owned a Bose and a Logitech device and this beats both of them in style and sound.
