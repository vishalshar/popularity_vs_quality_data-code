This is a very very fun and cool little robot. I bought this for my daughter. My son got the bb-8 robot from Star Wars that's $150, the MIP is better, it does more. It can be controlled with the iPhone as long as you have the right iOS. I had problems trying to use the app on the kindle which sucks. One the app you can play with it several different ways and with out the app you can play with it in six different settings. It is a heck of A lot of fun. It takes 4 AAA batteries and it is going to go through them pretty quick. It really is a nice toy. I bought it when it was on sale for $50 and will probably buy another one. For $50 I was very pleased.
