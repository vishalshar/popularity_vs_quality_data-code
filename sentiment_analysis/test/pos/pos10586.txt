Until HDTV glasses are the size of my Ray Bans there is this. Wow, I'm loving this little box right now. The first night I got this up and running I couldn't stop watching and I stayed up till morning... on a work day. Allot of other people gave good reviews on this but I was sold on the idea of having one because another customer mentioned how he and his spouse watch movies in bed by projecting the image on the ceiling, and I thought -  THAT'S F*#$'N AWESOME! And I got to say, it works perfect for me too. I have been streaming my Netflix from my Samsung Note and I am totally satisfied by the performance of this mini projector.  (note: you'll need to have your phone plugged into your charger for this and use cables provided - see YouTube examples on hooking your phone to an HDTV [RIF6 Cube] ).  As you can see its tiny, so don't expect a super bright projection. But in a dark room, that's not a problem its bright enough. The picture focus is adjusted with a small dial on the side. Just realize that the picture sharpness and quality is very dependent on the reflection and smoothness of the background as well as projection size. I project an 50" TV image on my ceiling and it sharp to me. The cabling is simple, two main ports attaches to the unit - USB Power (you will want to plug this in if your watching anything longer than 90 minutes) and your input. I do wish that the cable plug-ins were both on one side. Most of the cabling you'll need is provided, however, for me I had a problem where I couldn't use my laptop as it had a micro HDMI out and they only provided a mini HDMI cable. No biggie, I just purchased an adapter. The tiny fan on it is whisper quiet and if you use earbuds or are hooked to a sound system your not going to hear it. So far no problems, but its only been a few weeks. I will try to update in a few months.
