The adapter for the 45 is a little quirky. It doesn't seem to keep the record on for vertical use, despite calls to tech support and a new adapter, No instuctions on adapter use but should be a no brainer. Other than that, it is pretty amazing. I love listening to the old records and it's fun to watch them spin.
