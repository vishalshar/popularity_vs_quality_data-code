The short review - I am very happy with this and have had no issues. Read on for more info...I decided to buy this despite the negative reviews because I have other Withings products and I very much like the idea of integrated tools. After three nights with it I can tell you a few things.It is easy to setup, it took about two minutes. The app provides very clear instructions and you don't need to do much other than tap next once or twice.The measurements seem accurate. I am also a CPAP user and I have some data from my cpap machine. It takes extra work to get to that data in any useful way so this is much easier. I did compare the data and the Aura seems to reflect the same info in terms of how long and how deeply I was sleeping.I didn't think I would like the built in light but I have to say it seems to work. I can't really say if it is subconscious or not at this point, maybe it doesn't matter if it is anyway as long as it works... I do see to fall asleep faster and wake up with less snoozing.some complaints I have seenC - The sensor is not long enough.R - True, I don't sleep right on the edge of my bed either but Withings says the rounded end (with the cord) does NOT need to hang out the side of the bed. You can put the whole thing under and center it to where you normally sleep.C - Its hard to setup or won't sync.R - I wonder if this was a problem of the earlier software? I had no trouble setting it up.C - Customer service is unresponsive.R- Again I wonder if this has changed overall my experience was great? I contacted support to learn more about the sensor placement and received a response the same day.C - Lack of instructions on which port to connect the sensor pad.R - Personally I don't get this one it was very clear on the 1 page setup document that the group of two usb ports are for the sensor only. Maybe the instruction were not as clear at one point?C - (unclear setup/instructions)Can I or can't I lay in the bed while calibrating the sleep sensor. (this is done once after you put it under your mattress)R - The instructions and app say not to lay in the bed while it calibrates. They are adjusting for the weight of the mattress (or mattress topper)C - It doesn't do XR - They seem to be hard at work to bring more features. Currently the product tells you what it should and has a great clean user experience.
