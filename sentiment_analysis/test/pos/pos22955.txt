awesome...  simply plug and play..  After I received mine, I charged it up and and stared playing. It sounded better than using my cord and the Battery will easly last a hole night of playing.. Its so nice to have the freedom to move around and not have to worry about getting tangled up in your cord..  Ive had it now for about 6 months and have no problems with it...
