This is the best way to store pricey cheeses now so popular from artisanal makers. The standard American way of storing hard cheeses is to wrap them in plastic (Saran Wrap). That's ok for a couple of days, but if you got inundated with left over chunks of cheese after the office/family/neighborhood party, they will quickly sweat and mold after one or two days. Wrapping them in this paper allows the cheese to 'breathe', meaning the natural spores present on the cheese can move out freely rather than turning on the cheese after this process should stop. The sheets can be reused, even better if wiped after use and stored in a dry place.
