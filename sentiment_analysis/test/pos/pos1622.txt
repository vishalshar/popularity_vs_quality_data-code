I bought this for my parents Jack Russell and he absolutely loves it. He sits and begs to play with it when it is put up. He hasn't tackled independent play yet but he is so close. In the mean time we are enjoying watching him play with it. Even when you say Ifetch he gets excited. Also, it has been only on batteries and they have lasted for 2 weeks so far, machine is quiet, ball does launch 10-20-30 feet, balls shoot even when covered in slobber, and the machine has not clogged up at all.
