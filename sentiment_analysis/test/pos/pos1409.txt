Definitely one of my best purchases in the last 2 years !!!!If you are looking for a great gestures gadget this is definitely for you .The setup was super easy and fast , great online video setup on youtube ,I have been playing with the device  for few weeks now and i really start liking it more and more with every dayTakes a very short learning curve to remember what gesture doing what ( specially for me )this was invented for people just like me that loses there remotes ( specially that apple one ) on daily basis...I have sync'd singlecue  with the following devices :1. Apple tv 3Gen - works great!!!2. Nest thermostat - worked great!!3. Bose soundLink III - for some reason with this specific unit i keep loosing Sync4. Philips hue bloom - works great!!!Hope this unit will keep working as it is and that with time more and more smart devices will be introduced to the market .. and sync with it
