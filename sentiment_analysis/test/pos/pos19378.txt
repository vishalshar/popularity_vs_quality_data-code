On the label, give a maximum storage time of the unopened box (in the fridge). An observation not on the label: the shrooms need a bit of light, actually. They grow towards light, and with too little, stay pale and may look odd (trumpets, not hats and stalk). Keeping them in a humid chamber improves growth, and spares the fizzing routine.
