Update. Bought my tank Dec 9th with 2 day shipping. Set it up right away and haven't had any real issues. The only con so far is how the top is designed, the cords going through the top make it hard to get inside the tank for any maintenance. I have one betta and one snail. I also added a  Cobalt 25-watt heater which works great, silk plant, betta log, and a betta hammock leaf. I just harvested my wheat grass and radish plants. I took everything except for the rocks out of the tank and cleaned everything well,  including taking apart the pump like the directions say, also run hot water through the black hose to clean it out. My tank is staying clear and I have one happy Betta! I added a few pics after today's maintenance.
