My dog loves this toy!  He carries it around the house and protects it ... like no other toy in our extensive dog toy bin.  This is by far the favorite, he even sleeps with it at night!  It's been great for the lake this summer and it seems to be very durable so far.  And, we resonate with the mission of this company to help those in need ... more of those kinds of folks are needed.  Definitely recommend the WO|Bone!
