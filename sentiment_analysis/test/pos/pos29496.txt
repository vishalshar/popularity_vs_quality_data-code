I received the watch last week and I am leaving my review after some test. All in all, I am satisfied that the watch is convenient and simple to use.I love how simple it looks and works. The quality is high and the interface is intuitive. I love the fact that I could change faces for different occasions. Some are great for sports and some are elegant for business settings.Right now, I use it to listen to music through bluetooth while I drive, track my running steps and monitor my pulse, and receive notifications, and record interview notes as well.
