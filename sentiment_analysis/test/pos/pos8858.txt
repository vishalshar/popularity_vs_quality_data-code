This is wonderful!Download the app and create an account took about 2 min.Take out of the box, set it up, and get it linked to the app and my wifi about another 2 min (just because it was packaged nicely).This camera is wonderful. I posted to my friends on Facebook how great it is.The laser is fun, it has a manual mode, an automatic straight line back and fourth, a circle and a double circle motion that it will do with the laser automatically for about 20 seconds and turns off if you press the button to use the auto laser feature.  The camera turns 360 degrees which is nice. The camera quality is good, the night vision works well. It has a way to mount it on the ceiling, and if you wanted to you could clip it on something.  I would definitely buy again.The app is simple, you can sync multiple cameras on your app. You can share the camera access with others. You can share, and save videos.  Any time you play with the laser it saves a video on the server of about 7 seconds automatically.  Love this. you can take still pictures manually if you want.
