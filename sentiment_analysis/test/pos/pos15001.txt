I absolutely love this face wash! Since I started using it, I noticed less breakouts and my skin isn't as dry. It has exfoliating beads but they aren't too harsh. And as others have said, it smells delicious! I was thinking that the 4oz wouldn't be that much, but it definitely lasts a while. I would certainly recommend!
