This is my new, favorite sea salt popcorn.  The last two deliveries I received of this were fresh, crisp, and delicious.  It has a light essence to it that is not oily at all while still retaining the enhanced flavor of the oil used in its production.  Also, it is not too salty and does not have any salty aftertaste.
