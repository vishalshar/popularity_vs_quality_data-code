A really well thought-out product for kids!  I have an 11 year old daughter who loves to play Minecraft and aspires to be an engineer someday.  My main concern about this product was that she'd find the game play to be unsatisfying compared to the 'full' Minecraft version.  The product does in fact come pre-loaded with the Pocket Edition of Minecraft (like what you'd install on a tablet) so it is not the same experience as the full version.  But having said that, I'd have to say that the way they integrate their custom missions and content is extremely well-done and offsets the limitations of the PE version of Minecraft well enough.Assembly was detailed, but again, well planned and documented with easy to follow 'blueprint' instructions.  It took my daughter about 25 minutes to fully assemble the kit and power it up (with only a couple of snags along the way where she neglected something in the instructions and had to go back a step or 2 to fix the issue and then proceed).  Once powered-up, the real fun begins with the on-screen tasks revealing limitations in the initial configuration (that the child quickly notices), but then provides solutions to these limitations as part of the game-play.  My daughter was drawn-in immediately and spent hours working through various missions and gaining some insights into electronics and the basics of circuitry along the way.  I highly recommend this product for kids that like to tinker!
