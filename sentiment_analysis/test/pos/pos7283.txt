I'm so glad I've finally found an indestructible cable to charge my iPhone and Mini iPad at my desk again. My new cat loves to chew charging cables, head phone cords, lamp cords; you get the picture. Because it was expensive to keep replacing, I had to hide the chargers in a cabinet when charging, very inconvenient. He investigated the new Titan cable when I returned everything back to my dest and could not make any headway and quickly lost interest. Another nice feature is that the cable is strong enough to allow my iPhone to sit up rather than laying flat. Great purchase for my needs.
