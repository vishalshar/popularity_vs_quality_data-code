When I accidently ran into to on Amazon I was hesitant to purchase but given the price I figured couldn't hurt and I've been using them for around 2 weeks now around 4 hours per day while walking,jogging,working jumping and overall I've been very impressed and my ears weren't sore afterwards. My earbuds have came out of my ears a total of one time and that was because I have the pesky wired earbuds(wireless bit expensive for me)and my hand caught the left wire and pulled the earbud out. Not sure if it was in the description or not but I didn't see it so I was surprised when I opened the package there were 2 pair included although it's one what I guess I large size and one small to medium.ive been told my ears are in the small size but the small hoox are to small so I would guess they are maybe for  children. If you have trouble keeping earbuds in your ears these earhoox are a nice cheap fix
