I drive a 2006 Legacy and tried 3 other types to mount my iPhone 4s in the car. The cup holder version works but it's in a horrible position and not even visible while I drive. The other was one that plugged into my cigarette lighter outlet but it was too low and out of the way to again be viewable. I then tried a vent clip type, which worked, but wasn't very stable and pretty much blocked the vent. I also didn't like blowing hot air onto the phone. Now, all of these devices did work and do what they said they would, but none simply worked properly in my car.This brings us to this cradle,  which is genius in its design. If you think about it, most cd player slots are right smack dab in an easy to see and reach spot. My only concern was "how on earth would it get held into place?" The pictures aren't very clear and there isn't much explanation as to the mechanics of it. (I will post some pictures so you can see what I'm about to explain.)The design is very simple and works like a charm. There is a one inch-ish tab that runs close to the length of the cd slot. It's broken up into 4 tabs and there is a knob you twist after inserting it into the slot. When you turn this knob 2 of the 4 tabs separate from the other two (up and down) making the entire tab "thicker" so it applies some pressure and keeps it held into place. This part that slides into the cd slot (or any other slot you may see on your dash) is made of a soft plastic, but bendable material. It won't hurt your cd player.There is also access to the bottom of the iPhone so I can charge it while it's sitting in the cradle. The cradle is also adjustable so you can get it pointing at you or your passenger. It simply pivots, no need to screw or tighten anything for this. The area where the back of the phone rests on the cradle is a very soft, foamy pad and the parts that grab onto the sides of the phone are also soft and foamy.Anyway, I couldn't be happier to have found something that works so well. It was shipped quickly, priced right, and is well made. I will throw up some pictures later...
