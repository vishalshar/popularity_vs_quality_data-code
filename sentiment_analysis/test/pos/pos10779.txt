We highly recommend this mattress system. We bought two at separate times.  One was stolen in the nursing home. The patient had stage III sacral ulcer and was not allowed to sit more than one hour at the time.  Patient had to travel in the car for 5 hours.  He doesn't have much luck with other chair cushions so although this cushion is not recommended for sitting, we repurposed it anyway for the back seat.  The wound nurse checked the patient when he returned to the nursing home. The next day was a weekly wound care center visit, the doctor frounded when he heard his patient was sitting up 2 1/2 hours at a time.  However, upon examination, he was quite pleased that his patient was healing  at the same rate as previous week.  This product is new so good luck trying to convince the hospital to use it with the air mattress. The last acute rehabilitation,  we had to whip out the prescription by the wound care physician. The tragedy is it was rated highly in a study by Stanford University.  The wound healed a year ago, no re occurrence.
