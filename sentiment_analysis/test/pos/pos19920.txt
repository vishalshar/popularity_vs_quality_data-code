It produced so many mushrooms.  Way more than I expected and way faster than I expected.  They were so delicious.  They had a little spice to them, much nicer than the standard grocery store button mushrooms.  They were really tasty when cooked, but good raw too.  I shared them with all my coworkers and everyone loved them.  So much fun to watch them every day.  Once they start sprouting, they grow so fast it's almost unbelievable.I'm waiting on my second batch to grow now.  Hopefully it will be as good as the first.  I did the calculations, and if this kit produces 1.5 pounds of mushrooms (like it says on their website), then they will be $4 cheaper than 1.5 pounds of mushrooms at the grocery store.  So, even if it wasn't so fun and interesting, it would still be a bargain.I drink a lot of coffee.  It's nice to see coffee grounds going toward something useful.
