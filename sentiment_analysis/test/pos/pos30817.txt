Hi, I thought I'd drop a feedback to support this case and the people who designed it. I don't know what what's promised or happened on indiegogo site, I only noticed this case on Amazon and purchased here.First, I LOVE this case and here's why:This case is well integrated and blends in well with the iPhone aesthetics.It looks like an Apple designed product (except for the largeThinCharge logo on back)Apple should recommend this case as their official battery case.Hey, no UGLY chin like most battery cases.Hey no ugly lips around the screen. Do you really think raised lips will protect your screen?  Get a screen protector film instead. I hate raised lips around the screen because it prevents you from performing off-screen gestures... like swipe up from bottom to access quick settings, etc.The thickness is great, for an external battery case it doesn't get thinner.  Let's hope someday Apple will make the iPhone modular so that we can add slimmer battery slices.The designers put a lot of thoughts into this case, the way the button functions integrate with the existing volume buttons is fantastically well planned.My complaints:Yes the charge port flap is hard to remove. It'll get easier over time.The $129 price point is too high.  $59 is better, if drop to $49, it's a steal!I'm going to buy at least one more case as a spare or for when I upgrade from 6 to 6s.Well done, ThinCharge designers!!!
