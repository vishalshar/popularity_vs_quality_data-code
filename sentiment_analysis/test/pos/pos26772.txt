product setup in minutes .. but you have to look it up on the internet, directions not included in package. That's OK !anything to keep the cost down. you will need good WiFi signal in your garage. mine gets 4 bars , and works just great !I use it primarily when riding my motorcycle , so i don't need to carry a garage door opener ... I can also see if the door is closed and how long it has been closed  ... so far it works perfectly. Now i wish this company made the same kind of devices for my front and back doors ... i'd buy it in a heart beat ! very well designed product !
