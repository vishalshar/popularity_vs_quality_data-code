This is the first mascara I've purchased that I actually love. Normal mascaras feel so heavy and itchy that I always end up rubbing it off, and they all clump, no matter what they advertise. I already have fairly long and dark lashes, so I only wanted a product to darken the tips, but still look natural. The closest product I had found before was Neutrogena lash tint, but it appears to be discontinued. I like this even better. It does not clump at all, looks completely natural and doesn't itch, but still darkens and defines my lashes. From reading the other reviews, this seems to be a love it or hate it product. If you are looking for a natural looking lash tint, this is perfect, but if you are looking for dark/thick mascara, this will probably disappoint.
