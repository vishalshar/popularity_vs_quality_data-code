I use my iPhone as my cyclometer and have tried several different mounting systems over the years. With other systems there has always been the thought in the back of my mind that somehow my phone could work its way loose and go sliding down the street with awful consequences. The Quad Lock is the perfect way to lock my phone on and leave no doubt about its security. The phone clicks when it is in place and there is no chance it will accidently work its way loose. The method of mounting the Quad Lock on my bike is the simplest I have seen. I have used my Quad Lock for almost a year and my confidence in this product has been rock solid since day one and has not wavered. This is an outstanding product.
