I have been doing a lot of research on natural ways to help my, almost, 9-year-old son have an easier time in his third grade year at school and to have more focus. I found that Omega 3's can be helpful for kids with ADHD, which he slightly has. This brand had good reviews and I liked that they're called Smarty Pants, haha. My son is brilliant (I know that most mom's feel this way) and I have no problems with him at home, but he really struggled with having a good attitude about school and with all of the distractions in a classroom. I ordered these vitamins and after two weeks of taking them he finally started to have good days at school with good reports. His weeks leading up to this past one have not been the best with him constantly losing dojo points (students earn points for being respectful, responsible and ready to learn and lose them if they are not). You can see from my pictures that this past week is the first week that he has not lost one single dojo point! I don't know if it is just because of starting him on the vitamins, I also give him 50 mg of L-Theanine in the morning, but after adding the vitamins they seem to have done the trick. Yes, the bottle costs a lot more than the cheapo's you can buy at Walmart, but these have good ingredients, no high fructose corn syrup, low sugar, yes there is a little sugar but there's more in a serving of kids cereal, and the added Omega 3's. Plus, I can't dispute the difference in my son's performance at school. The combination definitely seems to be helping. I will continue to give these to him and have signed up for the subscribe and save. I am beyond thrilled!
