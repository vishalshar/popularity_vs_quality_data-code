Great size cup and my 2.5 yo daughter loves it. It doesn't leak when she knocks it over and feels comfortable and good grips on the cup. The lid does slide down over the orange silicone part on the glass so it does create a seal but when removing the old it does have a strange suction effect and a little liquid does get a little trapped. but nothing to be concerned about.  I will purchase more.
