My son got this Sphero for Christmas and loves it. It has been very durable for what my son has put it through (banging into chairs and rolling in dust bunnies).  He has only tried a few of the apps, but it appears there are quite a few to choose from. Some are free and others have a minimal charge.This small bit of entertainment was well worth the price!
