So far so good! I have an iPhone6 that I am using with this mount.  The two sheetmetal pieces that come with it are small, I thought.  So I went to Home Depot and purchase a 1" sheet of galvanized sheet metal and cut out a piece that would cover the majority of my cell surface that would be touching the mount.  The sheet was only .98 ha! The piece I cut out is between my cell case and sell!  I especially like that this poduct has a swivel head.
