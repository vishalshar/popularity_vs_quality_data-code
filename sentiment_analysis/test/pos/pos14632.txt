Believe it or not we needed a tracker that would find our little robot vacuum cleaner that would wonder around the house and get stuck somewhere hidden. Why the robot manufacturer did not have the robot beep when it got stuck is beyond me, but sometimes it would take us days to find the little bugger. So I researched a bunch of these and select this one because:* You can actually replace the battery yourself and not have to throw away the tracker.* Battery life seems to be longer than the competitive units although I admit I have not had it long enough to say this for myself.* Price!* Also had community find feature (not that our robot wonders out of the house) which might be good for keys* You can have the app beep the tracker and if you push the button on the tracker your phone will alarm even if on silent!* You can find it from a pretty fair distance away. You don't have to be right on top of it to find it.* You can send the ability of others to track your Pebblebee* It can alert you if your tracker gets separated from your phone but I don't use this feature as I often want to leave without my phone!Well it only took me about a week to buy others to add to key chains and other stuff like that. This is a great product! Buy it with confidence, you will love it if you loose your keys, wallet, whatever.If they had one that I could implant into my kids I would be cutting them open right now!
