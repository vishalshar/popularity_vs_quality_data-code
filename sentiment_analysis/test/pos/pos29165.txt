I take these on backpacking trips.  I typically use one every 2-3 days out in the woods, after days of hiking, stream crossing, fire building, and other funk-inducing outdoor activities.  I've got to say, one of these handles 3-day's worth of grime like a champ.  Face, arms, pits, hair, etc., I can cover all the important bits and feel human again.  If anything, I'd think one of these would be overkill for a quick post workout wipe down, but I'm convinced they'd leave you feeling clean and refreshed considering how well they work for a hiker.
