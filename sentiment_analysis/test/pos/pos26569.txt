Bought two of these.  Set up with the app was straight forward and relatively simple.  Units worked fine for about a week then I got a app message saying the batteries hadn't been heard from for awhile.  Pulled the batteries and attempted to reconnect to wifi and both failed.  Contacted Roost support and discovered there was an update I should have done over wifi before installing them.  They sent me two replacement smart modules (part on the bottom of the battery with the wifi radio).  I reconnected the batteries to wifi and they seem to be functioning normally 12 days later.  I don't mind having a problem with a product when the vendor provides this level of support.  Think I'm going to add one more for my detached shop.
