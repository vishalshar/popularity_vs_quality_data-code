I kinda love it! First of all, its beautiful and I get compliments all the time! People seem shocked when I tell them that this is actually my fitness tracker and what it can do!The step tracker seems accurate, Ive been comparing it with my other devices and it is never more that 50ish steps off. Sleep tracking is really giving me some useful insight, I realized that I never really go to sleep when I should and I have now been trying to change this habit. Also, breathing exercise - NICE!!!! its a lot easier to fall asleep after doing those \ even though I never actually though Id have much use from them. Well, that was a pleasant surprise!It is missing some features too. Period tracking is very simple and it doesn't really show any useful correlation with the other health data. I mean, currently the data that you get is very raw and there are no actionable insights. I have written to their CS and they promised a bunch of new features - so lets wait and see. So far so good.
