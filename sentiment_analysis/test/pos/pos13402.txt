This was super easy to install, we had it installed and running in less then 30 minutes.  We have a really tall garage and it had plenty of cable to lift our bike we attached to it to get it off the floor.  We used the long power extension cable and had it stretched half way across the garage and still had enough length to reach the other side of the garage if we needed to.  The mounting plate makes it really nice to mount the unit as you only have the small plate to hold over your head to secure it to the ceiling and then the pins connected the unit to the plate quickly.  We did use a ratchet to mount the plate, but you could have used the included wrench if you really wanted to. The app worked great, we had it working on two of our android smart phones.  We liked the settings for the auto stop for the raising and lowering so you can tell it to raise or lower and not worry about the bike falling to the ground.  It's a great motorized lift.
