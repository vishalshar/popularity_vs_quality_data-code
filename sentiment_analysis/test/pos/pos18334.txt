I have been doing a lot of research on budget phones as they call this and I decided to go with the posh titan bc it is, on paper the same, if not better than the expensive phones we are paying with contracts with. I am with at&t and currently paying for a Samsung 6 but one day it just vanished. I couldn't afford the 200 replacement fee (why do we pay for insurance if we gotta pay 200??) So I put my Sim card in an old phone I had. It has got me by for a year now and I am STILL paying for the galaxy. My old phone was a glitch mess and shut down on me all the time. Apps failed, dropped it in oil..still works though :)I decided I was ready for a new phone and had a budget of $150. I knew I didn't want to go through at&t bc I can't wait till this contract ends and I hate contracts. So after many nights of comparing and searching I decided on this posh titan.If you are an android person already, get it. If you hate iPhone apple life, get this one.It came in mail and first thing I noticed is its super light!! Even with the battery which is included in box.I wanted to put my personal experience with it bc I'm sure ppl are wondering should I get it? I'm a petite person, small hands so this phone is pretty big yes but I like the big screen style. The keyboard I'm getting used to bc its wide, I go to hit the spacebar and I hit a b or a v. There is a notifications light near your ear speaker. Its blue. The call quality is good. The ear buds that come w it don't have any bass or anything to them so sound is blah but whatever, we all have ear buds lol.At the bottom where we see the home button, back button etc...it does NOT light those up. I have been spoiled there. I was hoping it would... Its not too terrible bc you get used to the buttons quick. My old phone was 3x smaller than this one so the position is different. Its super thin. Very fast and my sim card popped right in and the phone registered it quickly. Very fast setup. No botware, nothing you you don't want. It comes w a clear case. Nice! I got the white phone. Its very clean and sleek looking. The camera in rear (13 mp) does have hard time making the pictures perfectly clear. But I shake so it could be me. I'm working on it. With my hands its hard to hold and type. Its so light it kinda flips like teeters...the resolution on the screen is very good. Crisp. I haven't watched videos but its fast so I think it'll do fine. Also it is 4G. I've had it for few hours but as of now I really love it. Just so happy to be able to open apps, take pics and not lag :)I'll include some photos I took with it.UPDATE: So since using my phone for a good day...which is a lot when u have a busy schedule. I have noticed the battery really lacks in the keeping charge department. I have been on phone for 20 mins just texting no data usage...and it has lost 15% of battery already, that's just this morning. Its a huge thing to me. I did watch 2, 1 hour shows on my phone last night. The battery got down to 30% from 99%. So yeah. Also the quality of sound is NOT good. I mean it gets what it needs done. Music has so bass, no lifting in tones or sound like speakers. They are muffled. I have to cup the back of my phone for the speakers to really work. From about 75%-100% is where the most sound comes from. From then on down, its like the sound isn't even on. The pixels are really obvious. You watch full screen and its not great quality. I am used to the HTC life. I had an old phone that had better than this one. Mybhusband has a M9 and wow....the speaker quality is night and day compared to this one and a lot of phones honestly. It has souround sound and it really does! I love that phone, the HTC ONE M9.I needed a phone that would take pics for my business and get online quick, not lag and hold battery. I did sacrifice a lot here now that I'm really using this thing....
