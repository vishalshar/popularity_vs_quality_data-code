For me , this product has been perfectly fantastic - it came packed in an almost bullet - proof carton, open it up - plug it in and you're in business. No BS with the set-up, its one complete package - be sure to read the instructions for recording - other than that I couldn't be happier. This item is perfect for those who don't need a high tech stereo system - just want to flip the On switch and go - the sound is good to me, but who knows I may be Low tech - it looks good & sounds good.
