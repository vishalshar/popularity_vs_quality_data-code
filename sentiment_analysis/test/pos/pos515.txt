I absolutely love my ringly. I purchased it with the intention to become less rude with my phone. I was tired of having it on the table at lunch or a meeting. And this completely solved my dilemma. I've only had this ring a few days and I've already had so many compliments!  It is so simple to use and pretty to look at. I honestly love showing it off! I like your packaging too. It was fun to unbox!
