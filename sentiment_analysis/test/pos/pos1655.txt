I have been wearing my Lumo Lift for about a month to help improve my posture.  The device itself has helped me considerably. A coworker has commented that my posture has been very good lately.  My 6 year old has taken notice and will randomly yell out posture to remind the family to sit up tall.The first day I wore my Lumo Lift, it kept buzzing me every 2 minutes as I sat at my desk.  I quickly noticed that I kept looking down because my monitors were too low.  I raised them up and the posture reminders decreased.I wear the Lumo Lift on an undershirt each day.  Typically this shirt seems to be tight enough to keep the Lumo Lift close to my body allowing it to function properly.  There have been a couple of days where I didnt get the Lumo Lift trained properly only to realize it thought I had good posture all morning or that I wasnt meeting my posture goal.I worry about the light flashing throughout the day.  I wish the light would only flash when you interact with it, but I have seen it flash in the mirror when I get ready in the morning.  I have also had one co-worker notice the Lumo Lift when I had a black dress shirt covering it.The Lumo Lift lasts me about 2 days wearing it 15 hours a day.  By the end of the second day, I have about 20-30% battery life left, depending on how much I was buzzed (I do have the coaching sessions on for 12 hours a day).  The Lumo Lift does charge very quickly.As a result, I would give the hardware 5 stars as its benefits far outweigh the LED light (which could be covered by tape).The app has room for improvement and I would give the app 3 stars.The app is fairly simple, but could provide a much better user experience.  The user experience is behind the times and is limited in terms of what you can do.The app is getting bug fixes, but there are only a few documented enhancements.  I have had the app lose the link to the Lumo Lift twice (the last time was yesterday, after I started writing this review).  I tried signing out of the app to try to get it to sync.  Im surprised it doesnt remember your email address to make it easier to sign in.  Both times I needed to reset the Lumo Lift while having it on its power station (click & hold for a while until the lights start changing colors).  Interestingly, even though the app said it hadnt synced since 8 am, it had data into the afternoon.I like the test functionality in the app and used it to see how well I trained the lift.  I think it could use some additional features like showing some of the measurements on where your posture is at or being able to see or adjust the acceptable range.The goals in the app could be much more customizable.  What is 40% good posture?  Why cant I say I want 60%? Why can I only change the number of hours and not the percentage?  The same applies for the number of steps, but I consider this an added benefit to wearing the Lumo Lift.  Although Im very skeptical of the calories burned.Even more importantly is the results.While the Lumo Lift is not a magic pill, it effectively raises awareness and reminds you of your posture.  It has helped me improve my posture dramatically.  While it alone hasnt been able to reverse the damage I have done by excessive sitting, I believe it is going to help in my recovery and beyond.  I started using the Lumo Lift and going to physical therapy at the same time.  It has been a slow process, but I am starting to see improvement.UPDATE 11/14/2016Lumo Lift updated their app to version 2.0 today.  It looks better.  I will see how it works in the days to come.They have also recently updated the firmware of the Lift.  I like this release better.  It is good to see they are still working on developing this product.*** Please rate my review as "Helpful" if it helped you because it helps me too!  A month after I purchased the Lumo Lift, they asked me to provide a review.  My opinions are solely mine and are NOT influenced by anything other than the QUALITY and PERFORMANCE of this particular product.  Thanks! ***
