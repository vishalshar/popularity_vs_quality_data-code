I enjoy eating one of these bars every morning between breakfast and lunch. They have 4 g of protein and just 100 cal. The bars have a chocolatey, peanut buttery flavor and the Chia seeds add a bit of a crunch.Other snack bars with this amount of protein generally have more calories and taste artificial. These taste natural and delicious.The bars are small. See my photo for a size comparison. However, I find them filling.You can add these to your subscribe and save order to save money per box. I hope you enjoy these bars as much as I do!**I have relied heavily on reviews for years, since I do most of my shopping online. I've finally starting trying to return the favor by writing reviews of products I love. I hope my review was helpful to you!**
