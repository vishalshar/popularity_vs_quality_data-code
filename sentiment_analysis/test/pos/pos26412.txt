So much fun! Playing with this is like being a mad-sound-scientist. Right out of the box I played with it for 3 hours! The only bad thing about it is that you will immediately want more parts to throw in there. Glad to find out they sell additional bits for more customization. the only thing I want now is a bit that would allow me to connect it to an amplifier, like a 1/4inch out jack. Nice work, Korg :)
