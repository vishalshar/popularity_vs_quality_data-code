So far so good with this game as long as you use it at home or in a campsite. If  you were counting on using this on a long hike, forget it. It is too heavy to carry it backpacking. The board is actually a think piece of plastic like material. It doesn't seem durable. However, it is still well constructed. The game, itself, is fun and you can learn as you go. There is nothing wrong with it at all, but if you were counting on it to take along backpacking, then change to a deck of cards.  Don't misunderstand--this is a fun game!
