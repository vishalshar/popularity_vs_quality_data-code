I would give this a 5 star, but they are a little tight on my head for now, and my ears get super sweaty from longer play sessions. Other than that, these headphones are a great value for the sound, and mic quality they provide while being wireless.Use them on my PS4, and had no issues setting them up without reading the manual. Very straight forward design, but feel free to look at some youtube reviews on these. I plan on picking up the LS40s when they come out some time next year I presume, as those will have 7.1 surround sound support. These only support stereo, but don't let that discourage you. They are fantastic for what they are.The only Cons I will say for these is that it seems to take a little time for them to break in, so feels tight on my head for now, and my ears are a little big for these, as they just touch the top and bottom of the cushions. They don't really effect me for a while, but after more than 2 hours, they can get irritating with sweat.
