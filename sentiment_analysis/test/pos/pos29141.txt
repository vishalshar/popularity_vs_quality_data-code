Quality check line. Good grip when I step on it. Reviews criticizing the buckle or saying their dog chewed the line are just ridiculous. This is a check line not a leash. A heavy buckle just calls the dog's attention to it. It's also not a tie out. Don't allow your dog to chew it. If you don't understand the concept, hire a trainer.
