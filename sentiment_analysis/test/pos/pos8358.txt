I use these both for my 19 month-old granddaughter AND my 84 year-old stroke victim mother. They save myriad spills and make things easier and more 'normal' for Mom. We use them at home and dining out. They will work with any straws ( I rarely use the silicone one supplied). The only problem with the actual product is if used on an already wet glass, they don't stay on. You must begin with a dry glass exterior for maximum adhesion. Amazon had these mislabeled for awhile and people were getting sippy tops instead, but the straw top PRODUCT is great!
