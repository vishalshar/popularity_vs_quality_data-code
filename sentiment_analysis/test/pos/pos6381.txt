The purchase was for my 12 year old son. I remember the old Hot Wheels when he was 3 that never seemed to stay on the track.In that regard, Anki is awesome. He played it non stop for about 2 weeks. I'm not sure why he lost interest, but at 50 bucks per car it is an investment. We have 4. Also, the games requires 2 or more friends that play extremely well together.
