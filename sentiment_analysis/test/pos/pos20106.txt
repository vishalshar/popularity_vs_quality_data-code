This is a great phone.  Unlocked for all GSM networks.  Fast LTE, fast CPU, awesome sound, very comfortable and light in hand.  Very nice color, and stands out in the crowd.  The finger print sensor works very quick 99% of the time.  Great device for enjoying multimedia.One thing I don't like is that the price varied around $30 dollars within a week and Amazon isn't responding to that.
