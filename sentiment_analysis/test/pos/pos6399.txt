So far so good. Used broom to clean up construction or more accurately destruction debris from tearing down some old plaster walls, and the broom performed phenomenally well. Less dust than a straight bristle broom, and less sweeps needed to collect debris. Broom is very lightweight. Nothing to complain about so far.Handy Camel are not the manufacturers or designers of the Renegade Broom, just a reseller. This broom is known outside of the U.S.A. as the Schmutz Haken or Dirt Hook.
