I have used it for 2 days and it is excellent so far. Easy to install. App is easy to use - also easy to  "Arm" and "Disarm" the sensors. The notifications and emails are very quick to receive when sensors are triggered. The alarm is reasonably loud when inside the house but could be louder. Recommended.
