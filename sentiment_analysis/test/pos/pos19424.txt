Love the look and the sound. Takes a little reading to set up but no more then other Bluetooth items. Haven't turned it up full volume yet, but there is enough bass. Would buy again. Hopefully they will make a carry case.update 1-14-16Got to use this in a group for meditation.....excellent outcome. It is so hard to get sound throughout the room without having multiple speaker, not something I can do in a jail setting. Either the music is to loud for those close to the speaker or not loud enough for those father away. Solution- Mars! It fills the room with an even sound for every participant. I am truly happy I brought this.For the one star raters...please resell your! Several of us would like to buy them at a fair price.
