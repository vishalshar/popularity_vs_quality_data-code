This pencil works like a dream. It feels absolutely amazing in your hands. There's just something amazing about holding walnut wood in your hands that makes you feel totally awesome! It glides across my iPad Air's screen with ease. As a standalone stylus, it's ridiculously beautiful and works very well. Combine it with Paper by 53, and it's a dream come true. I would HIGHLY recommend this product, just realize you're going to have to mess with it a little to really get it to work as described.Pros:1) Feels and looks amazing. Very sturdy2) Amazing stylus, even better with the app  "Paper by 53"3) Magnet is very strong, I've had no issues having this "snap" to my iPad cover and stay put as I move about.4) Comes with replacements tipsCons:1) Expensive (for a stylus...)2) slightly gimmicky. Again, once you fiddle with it though, it's amazing.** Troubleshooting *** I had to replace the eraser tip with the extra one they included* I also had to take the pencil tip off, clean, and put it back on as tight and snug as I could.* I had to rub my finger along the gold USB charge plates to get it to charge
