I've been using these as meal replacement bars when I travel and they're just fantastic.  They taste great and they offer great protein, they are also low in fat and, importantly, low in sugar, and there's no chocolate shell to get on a suit.  I don't normally get motion sickness, but as a frequent business traveler I'm often reading email/looking at a smartphone while traveling in a car from airport to office where I have felt mild motion sickness and I have none after I've eaten one of these.
