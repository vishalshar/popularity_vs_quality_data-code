Its only been on for an hour, but I like it so far!  It is quite sleek yet very rugged.  I especially like the added grip I get from this. I am, however, disappointed with the screen protector.  I peel back the film to place onto my phone and there are little glue boogers on the sticky side of the protector.  There is no way to remove these without scratching or smudging the screen protector because is is a sticky surface, not static cling like other protectors. On the other hand, I wasn't buying this case for the film. It only would have been an added bonus.In closing, great case, find a better (separate)screen protector somewhere else!
