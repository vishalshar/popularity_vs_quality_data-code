This is my second Quitbit, and I'm not a smoker. What?!I've found that this is a cool, gentle, and effective way to help friends curb their smoking habit. It's way more fun & acceptable to hand a friend a Quitbit v. lecturing them about smoking. Then, they are able to start tracking usage and slowly start reducing, all without the pressure.And, the product itself is solid. Very slick physical lighter, and the iOS app is a nice companion.
