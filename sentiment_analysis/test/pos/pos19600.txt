At $150.00 this is probably best bang for the buck phone at the moment.  It fits my needs since I only use the phone for browsing/calling/texting and do not game or use social media apps on this phone at all.  The build is solid and the cameras are quite good for the price paid not to mention the screen is 1080p with pretty good coloration.  Very little to no bloatware that I'm concerned with and does not install random/unwanted apps on its own or after updates (like Huawei or ZTE).  Android OS Nougat 7 is just around the corner so that's a plus so I don't have to worry about not having the proper security updates.  Dual front facing speakers is neat for this price range.  Unique packaging so it's good for gifting a friend or relative if needed.  No crashes or incompatibility issues yet.  Only downside is that it doesn't come with a charger but only a charging cable so make sure you purchase one (Quick Charge 2.0).  Time it takes from 0% to 100% full battery is about 40 minutes (due to a small battery) which is unfortunate since you may have to charge twice a day if you are a very demanding user.  If you're near a charging outlet a lot then that's not a problem although I wouldn't recommend this phone as a daily-driver if you travel often and away from power outlets as well (unless you like to bring an external battery pack or some sort).  This phone has its drawbacks but I think it really comes down to the screen time needed per user to user basis as all other specs are really well balanced and implemented for $150.00!
