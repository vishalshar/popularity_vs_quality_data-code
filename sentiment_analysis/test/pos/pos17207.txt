These taste great, and my toddler eats them without any problems every morning. The instructions say to go up to 4 gummies, but I kept him at 2 because that seems to work fine. And we get more out of the bottle that way. I like that there are Omega 3s in the product as well. He is two years old, so we supervise him to make sure he chews them carefully.
