I started sleeping with a box fan in my 20's (40+ years ago) while working night hours at my place of employment.  I had often wondered if a "sound machine" might work for me but really had no interest in listening to crickets chirping, birds singing, wind in the tree sounds or ocean waves breaking on a beach.  We originally purchased the standard size LectroFan and loved it so much we also purchased this Micro version for when one or both of us are traveling.  These machines work very well and we found a "fan sound" that was very similar to the sound of the fan we had been using and is much more economical to use.  I particularly love the wireless bluetooth features of the Micro.  Additionally, it has plenty of volume especially since the speaker raises up and can be rotated in the desired direction.  I've found it's very handy to keep in my home office to mask the sound of the television down the hall and love that it can be used to sync with my phone or computer to play music.  The small speaker has a decent sound as well.  I highly recommend this item!
