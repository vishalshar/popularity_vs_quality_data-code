The concept of this product seemed cool, and the variety of ways you can use it caught my attention. I'm a big biker so naturally for me it's going under my bike seat for some added peace of mind. I wasn't sure how I was going to stick it under my seat but in the packaging there's a 3M double-sided adhesive pad along with a small metal ring too for keys and stuff. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the first TrackR I received didn't seem to turn on, my guess is the battery was bad. I shipped it back and received a new one within a few weeks. Turned the new one on, synced it with my iPhone and was good to go. Setup is easy and straight forward and the instructions are a breeze. My only regret is that I didn't order a bundle pack because thinking about it more, there's other places and items throughout my house I'd like to use them on. I'm going to see how this one works and hopefully order more in the future or as the holidays approach. Overall, product build, look and feel are impressive. I thought the product was going to be heavier, but it's light.
