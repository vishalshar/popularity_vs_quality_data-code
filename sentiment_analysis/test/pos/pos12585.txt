sounded amazing. I almost kept it despite th fact it kept dropping wifi and bluetooth conections. almost as if it couldnt decide which one to go to. Was using iphone 6s plus and spotify. So not sure what the issue was. But dang they sounded nice when they worked. Also the long start time was annoying when it would auto turn off and then take 2-3 minutes to turn back on to reconnect.
