At first I was hesitant to buy this water filter as the price is well above other filters on the market. However, I do not regret buying it as it does what it claims: it gets rid of the chlorine tastes in my water, it's easy to fill without having to remove the lid, and it's not too heavy when it is filled up. The only con is that I have to keep re-filling it as the filter only takes in so much water at a time. If this bothers you, then you should get the pitcher version. The only down side to the pitcher version is that it's plastic. I find that glass is better as it does not leave a plastic taste.
