I purchased the bose soundlink mini and this to compare and in the end I ended up keeping this.  Each has their pros and cons but here's my take on why I ultimately decided to keep the fugoo.Sound:The Bose has a much fuller richer sound with deep bass and definitely fills any room very well.  It's on par with the wave radio and will definitely impress your friends.  If you listen to a lot of music that goes "thump" you will like this alot, I used it when I was doing some workouts and enjoyed the volume, sound quality, and the strong bass.  However, it does not work well with music where you want to here the mid and high sounds, pretty dull when listening to anything other then "thumping" music.  It also is terrible if you use it for talk radio or ebooks.The fugoo lacks deep bass although it has a couple small woofers... I have played with room placement and found that if you place it in the corner of a room or in a tight space it will reverberate off the corners and produces a much richer sound that is very pleasant and almost as good as the bose.  The fugoo also takes the cake when listening to anything other than rap or workout tunes, it sounds fantastic with ebooks and talk radio too.  I even used it on a flight in an empty first class cabin and the sound filled the space quite well even with the wind noise.  Currently (June 2014) there are two sound modes availble, normal & loud.. The loud seems to be a beta mode that they are testing and improving.  I found it to not provide any improvement in sound but maybe slightly more volume.  I get the impression that they are working on further sound modes for upcoming firmware updates.Features:The bose has a very basic feature set, just volume buttons and mute.  There's no speaker phone function or any other bells and whistles.  The battery is rated at 7 hours I believe but real world gets you 2 hours if you're lucky.The fugoo is as advertised! I love when claims can be backed up and the 40 hour battery life is legit.  Also it has a whole host of killer features, waterproof, shockproof, speakerphone (works amazingly), siri link, play, pause, skip, back, volume, aural battery indicator, and USB charging, are just a few.  It's very customizable too say if you don't like the voice alerts... you can change them to different voices or turn them off.I could see fugoo coming out with an app soon too so that you can make EQ changes, voice changes, monitor battery and perhaps some other cool features.  These guys are hip and trendy, something that bose lacks.  Bose is years behind most of their competition.Overall, It took me several weeks to reach a decision but I really think I will get more use out of the fugoo.  I travel a lot and enjoy taking it with me and not having to worry about the battery.  I also like the speakerphone for travel.. I can literally take calls in the shower if I want.  If you do anything at all outdoors then this is the speaker for you, water, dirt, sand, snow, heat, cold... doesn't matter it'll work.  Try it for yourself, I never thought I needed one but after having it for a short time I don't know how I've lived without it.
