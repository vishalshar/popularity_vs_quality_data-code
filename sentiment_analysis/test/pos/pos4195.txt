I am DJI Phantom 3 owner and I really enjoy the stability, the control and the performance of my big drone.Beside long range flights I also enjoy the drone to flight indoor on my living room.Can't do that with my Phantom,...just to big for home.I ordered MOTA JET JAT ULTRA and I have a great indoor result from this drone, a lot of fun and fast to re-charge.I suggest for beginners and especially for drone lovers like Me.
