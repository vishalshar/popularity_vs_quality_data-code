UPDATE 29 MAY 2016Like I said it keeps getting better. I am raising my review to the max 5 stars. Here is why. Replacement drone arrived perfectly. Began flying right off the bat. Challenging at the begining? Yes. By the third day things were much better. This is one tough drone because after a couple of crashes all was intact and everything was working perfectly. This is my first drone and judging by what other friends who have other drones compatible with the XStar are saying and the challenges they are having, I have faced the same and we're still flying while they have not been as fortunate. This is a solid product, well made and sturdy. It is top of the line because all of the added perks that other drones in this category do not have (which leads up to drone survival). Most important the Autel tech support is great. They stand by their product and deliver to the customer that most important thing called service.UPDATE 23 MAY 2016The replacement drone is supposed to come in today so I am expectantly expecting it. I really need to write this update before it arrives to publicly say that the people at AUTEL are a fantastic support crew. They stand behind the customer and really go the extra mile to make the word service a reality. They answer all the emails and phone calls. No disappearing acts from anyone and the tech support personnel are truly amazing. I am raising my review from 1 Star to 3 Stars just on this alone. WILL UPDATE GAIN once the drone arrives and we can get it to fly. For now it's TWO THUMBS UP for the AUTEL support crew.ORIGINAL REVIEWBig disappointment! The unit came in and after getting everything set...NO VIDEO LINK! Motors would not start and had all kinds of problems with the linkup of the aircraft to the RC unit.Spent about 45 minutes with tech support (Thomas) who was very nice but came to the conclusion that the unit was bad and now has to be turned back in so that it can be replaced. Not the outcome expected. I will check back to update once the process has been completed to see if in truth this unit is as good as it had sounded up to now and to let everyone know if the company backed its product. For now it is just a pipe dream.
