I like the case. It's solid and protects the phone against drops exceptionally well. I have no fear of my phone getting damaged. Furthermore, I like Rokform's system because it allows for using only one case for multiple uses: I can go from general phone use to mounting it on my bike (bike mount sold separately), to placing it magnetically on any handy metal surface, to using the included stick-on magnet and placing that on my car dash and even next to the shower. All without changing the case. Also, while it is a very rugged case, it adds very little bulk to the phone. At least nothing near what other cases do such as those made by Otterbox. I've owned 2 Otterbox cases and while they start out fine, they don't last long. I've had this case now for 4 months and there is no hint of wear. I fully believe this case will last as long as I want it to.That's enough for me to live with the downsides, which are: It's expensive. It's also heavy: the inner shell, aluminum outer shell, and RMS insert combine for a total of 3 ounces. This plus the S5's 5 ounces makes for 8 ounces (half a pound). I don't fault Rokform for this, the S5 is already heavy and metal cases in general are inherently heavier than other cases. One last note: The case does not come with a screen protector, so you'll have to get that separately if you are worried about that.
