This is an amazing must have for postpartum!! I had read the reviews and contemplated but decided to order after all!! The price was high and scary but once you get this and use it it's definetly worth the price !! I couldn't decide on the size and was worried I'd get the wrong one but I didn't !! I was 169 when I delivered and I'm 5'2. I ordered a medium and the extender bands as well. I used the sizing instructions on their website and I'm glad I did ! I put it on 3 days after delivery and The medium was snug at first and I had to use the extender bands but the next day the bands weren't needed! The ice packs are a plus and amazing !! I have had once x section and 2Vbacs and I really wish I would've known about this product with my other two !!! I will definetly be sharing and adding this to any postpartum list ! Thank you for this coming up with this wonderful product! It out beats them all on the market because it has everything needed !! Also, some of the cons that I had read about weren't even an issue so don't think twice just order it and you'll be glad you did!!
