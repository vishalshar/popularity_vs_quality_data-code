Typically I don't write reviews but I'm so bummed about returning this bag. It was great. I received it and it fit my Phantom 4, laptop and iPad 12 easily. It didn't feel cheap at all. Why did I return it? It didn't fit my DSLR and a lense. Only reason. It could have used an upper pocket for that. I returned it and got one that I'm Lara's satisfied with because it fit a DSLR. However if you don't need to fit a camera I HiGHLY recommend this. You won't regret it.
