I have an adult male Welsh Cardigan Corgi who LOVES to play fetch 24/7. I've been looking at the iFetch for a long time and decided I would give it a shot. When I opened the package extra iFetch balls that I ordered along with the machine,  I was very concerned about how very small the iFetch balls are in comparison to a full size tennis ball since he could easily put an entire ball inside of his mouth and swallow it. I decided to order the iFetch Too since it uses a standard size tennis ball. After trying out the iFetch and the iFetch Too side by side, the smaller balls were not as big of an issue as I anticipated. He didn't attempt to chew them like I thought he might. There are also some pluses to the larger, newer model especially how quickly and quietly the balls launch from the iFetch Too but my dog seems much less intimidated by the size of the smaller model. Given that, I decided to return the iFetch Too since it is almost twice the cost of the smaller model. The other issue is that we have hardwood floors throughout the house and after just using the product once, there are lots of scratches from the dog scrambling after the ball. Hopefully, they are easily buffed out! May have to put runners down on the floor when he plays with it.
