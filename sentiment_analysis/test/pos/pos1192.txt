Speaker did not work but Little Bits sent a replacement that did work. It's a little awkward playing with the modules but you can create some pretty cool sounds. Very cool idea. I can easily spend a couple hours playing with different module configurations and I bet you could combine other Little Bits modules to make some really interesting instruments (like integrating the light sensor module).  I rated down one star because of awkwardness and sometimes the magnets don't keep the circuit together when modules want to twist due to the connection wires. This could probably be fixed with some custom connection board.Update: the review above is really for the Korg Synth Little Bits kit. The starter kit is very cool too though I haven't played around with it as much as the Korg kit.
