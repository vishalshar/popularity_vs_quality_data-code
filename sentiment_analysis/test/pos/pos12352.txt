The vibration is a bit weak. Lights are easy to read.I have had my Shine 2 pop out of the bracelet if I snagged it, but it only happened once. I'd like to see some new bands, as well as a different clip; the plastic clip allows the Shine 2 to move around more than I'd like.I'd like the API to be more open to use the triple tap for extra options. The IFTTT feature is nice, but doesn't have options I'm looking for.Other than that, it's been a solid tracker.
