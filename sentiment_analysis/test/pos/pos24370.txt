These bulbs work very well for me.  They pretty much stay connected for me and a restart of the app is all that is required for me if there is an issue. It did take me a little while to get setup and claim the bulbs on my account.  I am using these in conjunction with the Echo Dot and I like the voice control.  You can't control all the colors with the Echo but you can control some basic ones.  I like that I can choose not only different colors, but different white temperatures.  If I am working on something that I really need to see and get an accurate color, then I can use a daylight temperature.  For evening and in my bedroom a warm white is wonderful.  I can dim these and turn them on with voice control.  Make sure to enable the LifX skill in the Alexa app if you want voice control.  When Amazon was out and I wanted another bulb, I ordered directly from the manufacturer and I got the bulb in 3 days.
