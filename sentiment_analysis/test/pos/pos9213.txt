I've purchased this food for Galen in the past (May), and he's liked it and tolerated it well, so when I saw it on Vine, I told myself, "why not?"  and went ahead and selected it, so my perspective is both as a person who has purchased it and who has received it from Vine.The ingredient profile is very similar to that of Tripett, although I can say that Galen does like the Tripett just a smidgen better.  Tripett also has Subscribe and Save, which was my ultimate deciding factor within the two.First of all, these Tripe formulas have a 1/1 calcium/phosphorus ration, with percentages under 1.2%, so it's suitable for all ages, including large breed puppies, where calcium and phosphorus must be carefully watched to avoid bone growth from being too rapid and causing skeletal disorders.  Tripe is a highly nutritious protein source, and provided it isn't cooked, or minimally cooked at very low heat., it also contains natural stomach enzymes that are great for digestion, and may actually help those dogs that have sensitive stomachs.  Due to the presence of the digestive enzymes, dogs that may normally be allergic to a protein source, are often able to eat that same protein source as tripe with no ill effects.  It's shown to have problems with IBS, among other things.Do not get washed or bleached tripe... while not as smelly, it also has lost many of the nutrients that make it a beneficial food.  Likewise, fully cooked tripe is less nutritional, for the heat disrupts the protein structure of the enzymes, inactivating them.In all, this is an excellent dog food.  I simply chose another brand over this one due to the subscribe and save status, and also because this one has certain fillers, such as Carrageenan.  Petkind Tripett is just a little bit more pure.
