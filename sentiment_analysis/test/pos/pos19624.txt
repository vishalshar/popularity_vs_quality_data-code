I've had mine for about two weeks now, and it's still going strong. It did take me a while to get it entirely setup due to very vegue instructions, but I did. I also got the fob since I am using it as my work locker and I'm a lifeguard. And I'm very impressed the fob is water resistant at the very least, but overall I think it is a great lock
