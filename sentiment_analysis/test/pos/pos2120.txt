The mirror is very nice. The case is good quality and it has a nice feel to it. It has a soft feel to it. I am always forgetting my driver's license and now I keep it in this case and it's always with me. It adds a little bulk to it but it's not a problem for me. It's light and it's no more bulk than a survivor case or otterbox defender case. Apple earbuds will not fit in it. A few cards will fit and a few more things. I am very happy with it.
