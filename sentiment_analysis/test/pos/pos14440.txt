I'm a mom who pumps for her baby, and I use these to store breastmilk in mason jars, and avoid going through 300000 milk storage bags everyday. These are only hard to take off if the jar is cold (fresh from the fridge) because the plastic constricts. To solve this issue I just fill the jar with hot water, and the lid comes right off without any drama. These only dribble if you pour super slowly. Anyone who has pumped milk knows that spilled wasted milk is pretty much the most infuriating thing on the planet, and these tops save me from that daily agony. I love this product and would absolutely buy it again. I recommend this mason jar set up to all my pumping mom friends who are trying to be more eco friendly.
