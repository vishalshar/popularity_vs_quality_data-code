We purchased 7 of these so far and I am very pleased with the ease of setup.  I am also equally impressed with the responsiveness and level of customer support I have received from the folks at Airtame.These devices have saved me valuable time.  I would have had to run and install HDMI wires, and switches to be able to accomplish the same service the Airtame provides us.It has been easy for our employees to use and allows them to collaborate with one another much easier.I now have a new tool in my bag of tricks to solve AV issues in the future.
