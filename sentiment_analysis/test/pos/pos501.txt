I've been using this with several different rental cars and an iPhone 5. It feels very minimalistic for keeping in my luggage and love that it sticks to the dash.On my first use, I did have a really hard time getting it off the dashboard and was a little concerned. However, it didn't leave any marks behind and has kept working with other cars. They recommend washing the suction cup with soap and water and I found that helps keep it working well when I switch cars. (The material reminds me off the little sticky bouncy balls that you get out of gum ball machines and stick against walls).
