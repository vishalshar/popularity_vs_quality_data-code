Likes:-  EASE OF CONTROL - controlling the drone with the phone is simple and convenient. Anyone who can use a phone can fly this drone! Seriously easy.- SAFETY FEATURES - The built in safety features put my fear of crashing at ease. If the battery is getting low the drone will return to home position (where it launched from) and land itself. very cool. If the drone loses connection with the phone (in mid flight) it will go into hover mode so you dont have to worry about your drone just falling out of the sky. (close the application (don't worry your drone will stay in hover mode) and reopen and it will connect again)- CUSTOMER SERVICE - Because this is the first drone I have ever used I called a few times with questions and Customer service was phenomenal they were there every time I called.- CAMERA -  I really like the Ehang brand camera, it shoots in 4K and it's compatible with Go Pro accessories.Dislikes: you cant see what the camera is filming while in flight mode. you have to buy either the VR goggles or a third party monitor.Recommend: get the Ehang back-pack to carry your gear in, it makes taking your drone out much more convenient.- OVERALL -  I highly recommend this drone to any first time droners who are looking for something that is tailored to the consumer. you don't need any experience, seriously, to fly and capture AWESOME video and photos. The fact that your phone is your controller is perfect for the consumer market and the customer service completes the experience and sums up why I give this product 5 stars and will recommend to anyone!
