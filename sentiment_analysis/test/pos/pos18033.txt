The more you keep your brushes protected, the longer they'll last. After cleaning my brushes, I use this to dry them, store them, and overall keep them safe. My brushes still have their shape all thanks to the brush guard! And not to mention, it really is worth the price to invest in something like this. I love, love, love it.
