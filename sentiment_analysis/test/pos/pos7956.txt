I've been looking for a dog food brand that my 18 month old pug's stomach and skin agrees with and this is it!  She started showing signs of allergies around 12 months. Fortunately for us, she showed signs of her allergies only on her skin; large pimples on her chin and lower mouth, as well as dry skin on her head.  Grain-free worked for a little while but then the symptoms just came back and it was worse! I started cooking her food for her and found out that she's actually allergic to potatoes!!!  *FUN FACT* Most grain-free dog products use potatoes as substitute!  When I found this brand, I was excited for her to try it!  She loves it and her face and skin cleared up about a week after trying it!
