I was never a big fan of dried fruit but I saw these on Amazon with great reviews and the price was right and I am on a diet.  So I figured what the heck.  I tried them last night and they are delicious.  I ordered the 2 bags and they are quite large (at least larger then I thought they would be).  They really remind me of eating potato chips.  But of course they are apples!  No crazy ingredients- just apples, only 52 calories per serving (which is about .8 ounce), good fiber, they taste delicious, and they really hit the spot for me last night as I am a total late night snacker.  I see they are currently unavailable.  I hope they come back in stock because I am sold!
