Initial first impressions: Just received this laptop today. Overall very happy and really like the look, fit and finish and how fast the SSD and i7 make this run. Set up was a breeze and quickly loaded some of the software I use.Pros:SpeedBuild qualityFit and finishLight weightKeyboard (others have commented that key spacing was to much, but I have large hands so it is good for me).SSDPrice  I really think this is a great value for the price paid for the specs.Cons:Track pad  I agree with others that have said the track pad is not smooth and easy to use. It is not terrible, but certainly could be better. I expect with time I will adjust to this.Power Brick  as other have indicated larger than most laptops of this size. Certainly not a deal breaker and this appeared to be charging pretty fast even while I was loading files onto it.
