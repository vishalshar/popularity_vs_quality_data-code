Fantastically light and packs small.  Requires constant tending to maintain fire, but this can be a good thing as it requires you to "connect" with the flame and your food.I have the Esbit denatured alcohol burner, as well, and it teams up really well with the Emberlit.  It also heats water really well when using an Esbit fuel tablet.I wish they made a stainless version of this stove, because, honestly, it is freakin' expensive!!  Were it not for the expense, I'd give it a solid 5 stars.Bottom line, this is now my go-to stove for bike & back packing.
