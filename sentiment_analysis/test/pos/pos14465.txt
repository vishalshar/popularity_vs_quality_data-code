Honestly, I was sold with the promo video. I just got it two days ago, and I've been using it to do some sketching using a couple applications, namely one called Sketches and the Paper app by 53. The pressure sensitivity is so great as is the eraser feature. It makes me feel like I'm using an actual pencil. I really love everything about it. The charging was easy and no hassle, after about an hour it was ready to go. The pencil itself feels great in hand, after using it for hours and hours my hand didn't feel tired or cramped. Anyway, I'm in love with this stylus and I can't wait for more apps to be developed with the capabilities to use this pencil.
