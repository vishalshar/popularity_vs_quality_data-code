This product achieved exactly what I wanted it to accomplish for my bedroom recessed LED lights:1. Integrate with Amazon Echo and be able to dim to an exact percentage ("Alexa, dim the bedroom light to 10%").2. Integrate with Siri and be able to dim to an exact percentage ("Siri, dim the bedroom light to 10%).3. Use the bedside remotes or the Lutron app (so you can control the light when you don't want to use your voice, like when someone is sleeping).I found the installation to be straight-forward:1. There is no neutral wire.  Just two black wires and a green, ground.  It doesn't matter which black wire goes to which black lead.2. The only thing I needed to do was re-pair the remotes after I installed the bridge and enabled Lutron skill within the Amazon Echo app on your phone and enabled iCloud Keychain on my iPhone (which is required for Siri integration).  I installed the dimmer first and paired the remotes to ensure it worked with my Cree LR6-DR1000 recessed can lights.  It worked fine but when I enabled the smart functionality, the pairing apparently was deleted with the remotes so I had to go back and pair them again.3. I plugged the Lutron bridge into an ethernet switch (TRENDnet 24-Port Unmanaged Gigabit Switch: https://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-24-Port-Unmanaged-GREENnet-TEG-S24DG/dp/B0044GH27U/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1476643299&sr=1-1&keywords=TEG-S24DG ) instead of directly to my router and it installed without a hitch. Unlike others have reported, there was no complicated wireless setup with opening ports, etc.  It was completely plug-and-play.Functionality:1. Works great.  I upgraded from the Lutron Maestro dimmer.  The Maestro dimmer uses the same 5-button Pico remotes and those remotes work fine with Caseta.2. As others have mentioned, there is no "memory function" on the wall switch.  You have On/Off and the up/down dimming on the main wall switch.  However, with the smart functionality and the remotes that have a favorite button, there are other ways a favorite setting can be achieved when you turn on the lights.3. You can adjust the "low-end" and "high-end" trim on Caseta.  Low-end trim is important if you use LED lights that may turn off or flicker if you dim them down too low.  To adjust the low-end trim on the Caseta, hold the "ON" button and "Dim down" buttons on the wall switch for 6 seconds until the LED flashes, then adjust the dimming level until the lights are at their lowest without flickering or turning off.  This may take a bit of back and forth.  After you have achieved the dimming level you want, hold the "Off" button until the LEDs stop flashing.4. Amazon Echo and Apple Homekit (Siri) voice use require you are connected to the same wifi network as the bridge (so neither will operate the device outside the home).  However, the Lutron app works well with Off/On and Dim Up/Down functionality and has a slider for dimming percentage.  It works well and does not require wifi connectivity (you can use it outside the home).  It also has fairly quick feedback.  If you use Echo to turn off the light, the Lutron app shows the light off within a second or two.Opportunities for improvement:1. This product is intended for use within 30 feet of the Lutron bridge, according to their tech support.  That seems a bit limiting to me.  Lutron stated that it may work outside of 30 feet but they could not guarantee continued connectivity.2. This product will integrate with the Maestro line of accessories like the  LRF2-ocr2b-p-wh occupancy / vacancy sensor *BUT* you lose Amazon Echo / wireless functionality if you use the accessories other than the Pico remotes.  I see this a significant opportunity for Lutron.  I'm not clear why consumers need to sacrifice wireless functionality with use of accessories/sensors.  I went up to level 3 tech support at Lutron and they suggested that this was an engineering choice and not necessarily a technical limitation of the Caseta system.  If so, I don't understand that engineering choice.Finally I will add that the Lutron Customer Service is flat-out amazing when it comes to technical support.  I had called, pre-purchase, to compare and contrast the Pro version of the switches (which can do 3-way) and the Pro version of the bridge (which can integrate with some other limited manufacturers like Control4).  Interestingly, the Pro version of the switches does not require a Pro version of the bridge.  I also called post-purchase to discuss accessories as I detailed above.  The main point I wanted to add is that Lutron technical support is fantastic if you happen to hit a wall or have esoteric questions.
