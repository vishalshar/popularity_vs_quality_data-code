Love this cap for turning a mason jar into a mug. I purchased this for use in a lunch box, but it turns out it's not quite leak-proof so I use it for coffee to go instead. The first few times we didn't experience any leaks, but it did start leaking after about a month of use for some reason. It's been hand washed only so no reason to warp or shrink, but for some reason it is leaking.The flip top is a bit annoying as it's right in your face while trying to drink, but it still works if you want to turn your mason jar into an easier-to-drink cup. This would work very well for turning a mason jar into an easy-to-pour jar. I have no need for that, but did have use for it as a drinking cap.I don't think I would purchase again as a drinking cap, but if I find need to pour things out of mason jars at any point, this would definitely work well for that purpose.
