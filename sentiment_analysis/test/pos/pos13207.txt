Love what it does to beer. Definitely enhanced aroma and flavor of most beers.Would have given it 5 stars, but it seems like the quality of the parts could have been a little better. The tap handle is plastic and feels very cheap. I noticed on the Fizzics website that they will be selling an aluminum handle for it soon, but that's something that would have been nice to have included initially with the product. I was a little worried because the tap handle wasn't dispensing the foam when I pushed forward after a few uses but once I pushed it forward and slightly to the right, it began working. Seems like a quality control issue. Also the Fizzics logo on the front of the dispenser is just slightly heavier-duty stickers. I brushed up against the waytap after my 3rd day of owning it and the letter "C" in Fizzics fell off of the logo. I'll have to glue it back on or something.I love what it does but wish more thought was put into these little nuances. Will wait to see if it holds up. Comes with a 1 year limited warranty.
