AWESOME...!!!!!  Bought this for Vietnam Veteran husband who has dementia from Agent Orange...Took him a little bit to work it; but he did....and he LOVES it....!!!!!  It is great for hand and eye coordination...His favorite is Masterpiece.  In the past, he was able to draw and sketch anything.  Now with Parkinson's, it's difficult.  Masterpiece gives him a little of that back.  And of course, our Grandkids like playing it with Poppy...!!!!  <3
