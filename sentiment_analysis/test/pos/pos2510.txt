My wife and I bought 2 of these for our little girls for lunch for school.  They are very sturdy and heavy and seem like they will last long.  We have not yet used the thermos option as the girls are too young to bring food like that to school.  We have only been included sandwiches and things like that.  The lunch kit also contains a removable divider to help separate the foods and you can place it wherever you may like.  It has advantages and disadvantages.  Advantage, keep the food separate and remove it if you need to.  Disadvantage...one kid lost it the first day at school so now we don't have one.  Shocking, I know.  All in all a good sturdy lunch kit.  The top is so heavy that you can't open the lunch kit all the way without it tilting the bottom part up.
