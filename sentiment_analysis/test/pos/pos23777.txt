Whether this system works or not is totally dependent upon the sensitivity of your dog.  Our shepherd is a sweet, sensitive dog and all she needs to do is hear the warning tone...the invisible fence has worked well with her for years.On the other hand, Dingo, aka: "stop-it-you-little-bastard" is a little wild-ass terrier mix who has at least three feet off the ground at all times.  I ordered him a collar...haven't had it a week and it ain't gonna work.  If he's walking, he'll hear the tone and sit down or turn around, but if he's chasing something, he'll tear through at 30 mph.Anybody want to buy mine?
