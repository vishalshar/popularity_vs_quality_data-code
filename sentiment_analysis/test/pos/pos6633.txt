This avocado oil is the deal! I have been attempting to make home made mayo to avoid the nasty, harmful oil and junk in store bought.  I tried olive oil and macadamia nut oil...neither worked, taste of the oils was overpowering.  This is very mild and worked perfectly.  I'm sure it would be great drizzled on salad.  It also has a high smoke point, so quite versatile.It comes in a glass bottle that was well packed...no leaks.  The label says it does not need refrigeration after opening and the expiration date is a good year+ out (mine will be used up way before then!)If you're looking for a great multipurpose oil, this is it!
