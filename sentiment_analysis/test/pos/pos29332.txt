This is pretty good. It tastes light and savory.I love avocado oil. It's amongst the healthiest, if not the healthiest cooking oils you can use. It can also handle higher temperatures, so I use it in piece of my usual olive oil when dealing with high heat dishes. Or anything where a subtle flavor of avocado is welcome (Mexican and Greek food!).Honestly though, I'll probably go with a cheaper brand next time because the significantly higher price tag is not Worth it.
