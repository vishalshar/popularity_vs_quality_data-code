I flippin' love this thing.So quick story from my childhood: My brothers both wanted these really impressive remote control cars for Christmas. They were expensive so they were also, of course, really impressive. Fast, quick to charge, long battery life. All of the things a traditional remote control car that you'll find at the stores is, has, and does. I didn't ask for one because.... I don't know why I didn't ask for one. My parents thought I'd feel left out so they still got me a smaller, less expensive remote control car. It was called "The Chipmunk" and, clearly, this experience left an impression. The thing was small, slow, felt super cheap, and would have broken when it hit a wall if it could have gotten moving fast enough. In short, I got what my parents paid for. And I had fun with it! ... Love you, Mom and Dad!Anyway, the Ollie might seem expensive but it is, as far as I'm concerned, a bargain. I got what I paid for and more. It's fast, it's sturdy, and it's fun. Having played with Orbotix first product a lot (I love remote control cars so how could I not get a remote control BALL!?), I knew what to expect with regards to the iOS app. Accept that since this doesn't look like a car, you will need to wrap your head around which direction it's going and, on occasion, re-calibrate the direction your iOS device says the Ollie is rolling in. It's not difficult; this is not brain surgery. And it's certainly not something that is going to define your experience. It's just part of controlling Ollie. You know what happens with traditional remote control cars that doesn't happen with Ollie but that people DON'T complain about? Remote control cars flip over. They wind up on their roofs and you have to go over to them and flip them back onto their wheels. Nothing's perfect. But I tell you what, I'd rather have to re-calibrate my Ollie while standing still than have to walk all the way to the other side of my old cul-de-sac to flip over my gas-powered remote control truck (I upgraded from The Chipmunk when I got a little older).If you're a bit older, there may be a learning curve for driving Ollie but, once you've got the hang of it, it makes complete sense. If you're looking at getting Ollie for a kid, well, like with all new technology, they'll take to it like a duck to water.
