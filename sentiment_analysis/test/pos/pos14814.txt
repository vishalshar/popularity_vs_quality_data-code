This is a fun little gadget. My geek friends are impressed, and I guess that's really the point, isn't it?  ;-)  I have successfully used it this winter and last to find the drafty parts of my log house and seal up the cracks to save energy and stay comfortable. Works most effectively indoors when the outdoor temperature drops below about 10 deg. F, particularly when I use it to examine the interior walls on the windward side of the house. The cold regions really pop out.
