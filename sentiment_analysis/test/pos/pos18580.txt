I bought the Lynktec Apex Fusion Fine Point Active Stylus Pen with TruGlide Fiber Tip Technology because I like to take notes for almost everything, but I hate the old school method of pen and paper for everything.When it comes to certain things I prefer an ink pen, but there are a lot of times when I want (or at least wish) that I was able to easily digitize my notes  in one step rather than trying to take a picture or scan my hand written notesThe Lynktec Apex Fusion Fine Point Active Stylus Pen with TruGlide Fiber Tip Technology includes a number of features that are quite nice in my opinion.To begin, the stylus pen is made of high quality and very sturdy, not to mention lightweight materials.The pen stylus tip is replaceable which is an awesome feature to me because it makes this stylus a green option compared to other stylus pens that you would simply discard when the tip wears out.Also, the stylus pen tip is extremely fine tip when using it. Even though the tip looks as though it would create broad lines  it actually created crisp clean lines just as a fine point ink pen would create.The stylus pen runs on an internal rechargeable battery which means no extra purchases are needed. Once the stylus pen runs out of juice or charge, you simply plug it into its included charging cable (which is a micro usb cable) to charge it.I would rather spend a little more money on a product that will last for a long time (or forever with proper maintenance) than to purchase a cheap option of the same or similar product. So that led me to want to buy this stylus pen. I like the look of this pen, and the price point, over all the designer stylus pens that you can purchase at office supply stores for $50 and up.The Pro of the Lynktec Apex Fusion Fine Point Active Stylus Pen with TruGlide Fiber Tip Technology is that it is an inexpensive option for a really nice looking and functional stylus pen. Also, this stylus pen is an Active Stylus which means it works with my Macbook and my iPad which is a HUGE Plus.There really is No cons for the Lynktec Apex Fusion Fine Point Active Stylus Pen with TruGlide Fiber Tip Technology.I would Highly recommend the Lynktec Apex Fusion Fine Point Active Stylus Pen with TruGlide Fiber Tip Technology due to its high quality and price point.I have to add that I received this item at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion in the form of a product review.
