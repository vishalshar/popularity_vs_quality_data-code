I purchased the RokForm bicycle mount because it mounted directly to my bicycle at my stem cap (no zip ties or rubber straps), and allowed for different viewing angles.  It's a very clean look, which I found desirable.The mount arrived and was trivial to install on my bicycle - it took me less than a minute.  The mount comes with two magnets, one to install on the mount itself (a little superglue and I was in business) and a magnet insert for the Rokbed Case.  I'm not sure why the magnet wasn't already installed on the mount.  Maybe some people don't want to use the magnet so they ship it but don't install it?  The Rokbed case insert magnet was also easy to install, just popped the old insert out and popped the new insert with the magnet in.The mount itself is a combination of metal and plastic.  I didn't notice anything amiss with the metal, and everything seems machined well to my untrained eyes (everything was smooth and fit well, no rough spots).  The plastic part looked equally sound.It is easy to mount and dismount the Rokform Rokbed Case to the bicycle mount.  You simply line everything up, seat it, rotate to lock it in place and you're set.  I chose not to install the lanyard, though it was also included.I went for a 15 mile ride and found the mounting was secure.  At no point did I feel my Samsung 4 was going to come out of the mount.  I was on my road bicycle, but some of the asphalt I was riding on was a little rough.  I found the mount wanted to stand "straight up" after I went over some bumps (instead of lay down where I could see it).  I simply pushed it back down and it wasn't a big deal.  Adjusting the tightness on the lever point screw might alleviate this problem, but I was afraid to over tighten it as it mounts to the plastic stem cap.  I expect the mount wanting to stand straight up after rough terrain (for a road bike) is just a fact of life with the RokForm mount.  I don't mountain bike, but given the issue I had I *would not* use this particular mount for mountain biking.  I would instead choose a mount that that does not allow for various viewing angles.I did notice the road vibrations from my bicycle were passed right up to my case, and my case made a constant vibration sound the entire ride.  It was quiet enough that I was mostly able to tune it out, but loud enough that I wondered what was wrong with my bicycle (until I figured out it was from the case).  Once I touched the case/mount, the vibration (sound) stopped.  I think I'll try to add a small piece of compressible foam to absorb the vibration.After one ride, it appears to be a good, solid product and I expect it will last me at least a few years (presumably more).  Overall, I'm pleased with the mount.  A fixed viewing angle is probably preferable for me and I will consider using loctite to prevent the mount from "standing up" if tightening the screw doesn't work.I can't imagine it costs them more than $10 to manufacture the mount so charging $60-$70 seems a bit steep, but I knew going into this I was choosing one of the more expensive mounts.  Hopefully the extra expense means that it will last longer.
