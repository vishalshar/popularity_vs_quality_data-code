Pros- Forget the fold out printed Lego instructions This comes with an app with a 3-D rendered model and step-by-step animated instructions! Even my four-year-old can follow along.- Full end-to-end experience from building to robotics to programming where your child can focus on the element that is of interest and do just the basics on the others. For example my son still got the instant gratification after spending multiple hours building his dog robot to be able to tap pre-coded actions such as jump and walk forward without having to do any programming yet.- detailed commands to help make sure you are successful  such as saying use the specific part in this orientation so you "don't run into problems."- simple Bluetooth set up to your phone- stunning packaging with colored individually package boxes that all nest together within the larger cardboard out of box complete with magnetic closure and a slot for the instructions to fit in and never get lost as a designer myself, this might be my favorite part of the product. :)- the translation into English leaves some charming oddities such as the dog action "coquetry" for playful flirtingCons- parts are labeled with a number of pieces of data  stars, squares, circles, as well as part numbers like "01" as well as A and B sides This results in initial  confusion with assembly as it is not clear how precisely you must follow the visualized 3-D rendering versus only pay attention to part numbers that are explicitly called out in the written text that accompanies the step-by-step animation. Once you figure out that it is the latter, assembly was much more quickly.- lots of tiny parts so not great for kids with a younger brother or sister eager to swallow them.- this is not your quick fix type of product  definitely multiple hours of investment to get to the fun playing with your creation. But good attention span building.
