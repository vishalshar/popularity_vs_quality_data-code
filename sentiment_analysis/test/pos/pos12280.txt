I absolutely love these socks! I initially ordered one set to check them out. I was so pleased that I ordered three more. They are soft and comfortable and obviously of high quality. I have yet to see how they fit after washing, though. I guess don't understand sock sizes. I wear a size 9 shoe, and no matter how large the socks I order are, they always seem too tight. What do people who wear size 12 shoes do for socks? These socks were not loose on me, but not tight either. I just hope that they keep their size after washing. If they do, 5 stars.
