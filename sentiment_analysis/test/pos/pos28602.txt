I am a repeat buyer, not because they don't last, but because I want to put them in more shoes. Over the course of a year, a couple of my Hickies will break (always the ones stretched the longest). This seems like an excellent reliability rate. My newest (black) Hickies are for my work (semi-dressy) shoes.
