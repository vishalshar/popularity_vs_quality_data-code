These are made for adjustability!  I was able to slip my Dji backpack foam right into this and now I have the best of both worlds!  It fit perfectly and I can still utilize all the nooks and crannies and pockets of the Drone Trekker backpack!  It is way more comfortable than the dji backpack and has so much storage! It is an amazing product and one of the best accessories that I have purchased for my Phantom 4!  I love it!!
