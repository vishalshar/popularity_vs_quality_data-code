This filament is the best I've used. After using cheaper stuff I went with a better brand to see what the fuss was about and now I know. Raft broke off cleanly with minimal cleanup. Print was smooth with none of the "Pilling" I was seeing with the other stuff. Is now my goto PLA filament when it's time to order more. My only regret was not getting this sooner.
