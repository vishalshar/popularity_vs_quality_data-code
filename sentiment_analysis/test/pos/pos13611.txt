This is one of my better decisions to covert to a remotely controlled irrigation system. Very easy to set up and took two attempts to sync with my home wi-fi network. Love the android app as well as access via my laptop to set up, control, start/end my sprinkler zones.  I can't say enough about this brand as your way to replace your out-dated controller (my was an Hunter brand) with a user friendly interface.  It would have cost me over $100 just to purchase a remote accessory for my Hunter controller and paying a little more gave me the remote capabilities plus a whole lot more.I have 10 zones and got the 16-zone version.  Just follow the instructions including labeling the wiring before pulling them off your existing controller unit.
