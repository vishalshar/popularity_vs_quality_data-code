My dog "Clarence Wiggum" (pictured) is trained to use this.  The only time he misses is if he's stolen some of my booze while i'm not watching.  He will walk clear across the house to do his business on this thing.  One warning is it smells terrible but i just deal with it.  I don't use the stupid deodorizer or liners as they're kind of silly but who knows?  If you're prissy that can't handle the smell that comes with animal ownership and want to go to the extra effort then give it a shot or better yet do society a favor and use bleach and inhale deeply.  I don't know how or why but the thing does seem to leak a little.  I recommend putting a piece of linoleum, tarp, or some kind of barrier under it.  Hail Satan!
