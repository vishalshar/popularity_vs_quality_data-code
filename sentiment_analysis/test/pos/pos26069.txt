Love this case! I backed the first iPhone 6 jimmycase on Kickstarter and it finally fell apart after 2 years of use. The new design for the 6/6s looks like it addressed the problem I had which was the bumper separating from the back piece.It is perfect for carrying 3-4 cards and some cash for a night out so you can leave the rest of your wallet at home. The elastic is a bit tight at first so getting a single card out can be tricky, but it does loosen up slightly with use. Luckily it doesn't get so loose that you're forced to keep a certain amount to prevent the cards from falling out. Highly recommend!
