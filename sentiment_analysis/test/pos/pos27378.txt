Introduction:I have been into earphone hobby since 2011 and collected 20+ earphones that worth my attention. However, earbuds are not included in my collection. I personally hate them mainly because they do not fit well nor provide at least a slight isolation. But there is only one earbud that I still keep as a childhood memory and that is Creative EP-880, a premium, sleek-looking earbud I first had back in 2004 and it is still functional.Still, I cannot use the EP-880 for a daily use because the earbud fails to stay on my ear mainly due to large speaker diameter by earbud standard ( picture #1). Yet I have tried various products that would help the earbud stay in my ear; but they fail to at least get them fit into the earbud.Then I found a silicone fin named Earhoox which is designed mainly for earbuds. The fin reminds me of the fin stabilizer from Dunu's DN-2000 which actually works well; so I choose Earhoox.Review:There are two important questions I would like to address:1) Do Earhoox fit to an oversized earbud like EP-880?2) Do Earhoox help the earbud stay, or at least fits comfortably in my ear?And optionally, Do Earhoox improve the isolation that earbuds?Actually, both of the questions are yes, they do! Except the last question; Earhoox will not improve the isolation of earbuds. Although the earbud appears to fully cover my earhole, a single tap and typing sound still can be heard.Picture #2 shows how big the earbud, EP-880, compared to the Earhoox. The Earhoox can be stretched, though it needs some careful time and adjustment to the fragile earbud, like where I want the fin to be located ( #3). Furthermore, I have shown that the earbud fits comfortably into my ear (#4). The fin stabilizes the earbud and prevents it from falling off from the ear.  I test its stabilization  when walking around the house and to outside and it works just fine.However, it needs some techniques to properly insert the earbud; however, the instruction manual does not provide clear information to show the trick (#5) . The way I do it is by bending the fin with your point finger while thumb on the earbud (#6) when inserting it to your ear, then release the fin once it stays to your ear. You may have different ways of inserting it but don't give up, it takes some practices.After thought:The Earhoox proves that it helps earbud stays comfortably in the ear.  Now I can listen to the old earbud EP-880 and taste the sound from my childhood. Yet, I can compare its performance to the earphones nowadays but I find the earbud sounds disappointing - it is still a million years away to outperform the earphones I have.I do recommend Earhoox for earbud-users who look for a way to stabilize earbud fitting and those who have trouble fitting-in the earbuds. However the Earhoox would not improve the sound quality nor noise isolation of an earbud.  Those who seek for better sound quality ( and better isolation)  should try out in-ear earphones instead as there are plenty of good "budget" in-ear earphones in the market like the Xiaomi Piston II and Phillips SHE3590.Thank you for reading and I'm outta here!-Sam
