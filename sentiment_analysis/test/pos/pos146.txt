Finally a natural shampoo that actually cleans your hair! Works great, I have fine, curly hair. This cleans my hair but does not over dry. Leave it clean and shiny. Hair does not break like it used to. Highly recommend. Used with the conditioner. The packaging could have been better, the plastic it was wrapped in ripped in shipment, and the cap was a mess, but did not look like much product was missing. All-in-all a great product. I have noticed a change in one day.
