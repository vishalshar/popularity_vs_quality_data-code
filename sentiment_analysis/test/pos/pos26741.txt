I bought two of these - one for each car.  I was amazed how easy the set-up was (each car took less than 5 minutes).  The app is easy to use and understand.  I would say it is like having a subscription-free "on-star service" (it will call 911 for you and connect to your phone if you're in an accident, as well as notify three contacts), mixed with Google Maps and and a smart home.  I have integrated it with my Nest and Alexa.  It is nice that the Nest knows I'm home, but the overall benefit is minimal (it goes on "auto-away" and "home" only a little faster).  I find the most handy thing to be having Alexa tell me how much gas is in the car.  Then I know if I need to leave extra time to fill-up.  However, it only works for one of my vehicles.  My Toyota Sienna is not compatible with the gas-reading feature (probably because the gas gauge is a needle rather then electronic).It is a neat "smart" home product.  I'm hoping new uses for it will be added as time goes on...
