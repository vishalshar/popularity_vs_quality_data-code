Perfect! Absolutely no lag. I purchased this to use with a surface pro 64 gig I picked up cheep. After the OS and updates the surface had only 20 gigs left of memory. With this drive plugged into the USB 3.0 port I now have another 256. I set up windows to recognize it for all file handling and I make sure it is my default drive for program installs. The only drawback with this set up is the drive Velcro 'd to the back of the surface, bit hey for the price of the entire system I can't complain. Apps have to be installed on the primary drive. If that ever becomes an issue, I could load the OS on this little baby and boot from it. (There is a boot protocol for external drives on a surface pro... Google it) any way. Not a problem. I have run Photoshop from it and a few other programs, way faster than spinning platters. I have a Samsung SSD on my main system. I am sure this thing probably doesn't bench mark as fast, but for practice application I can't tell the difference. Highly recommend
