I am very pleased with the Mountek Snap+ so far. I drive a 2008 Prius, and it has been hard to find a usable cell phone mount due to the shape of the dashboard and the location of the auxiliary outlet. The Snap+ was easy to install and the magnet is strong enough to grip my phone (but not too strong that I can't remove it easily). Great product!
