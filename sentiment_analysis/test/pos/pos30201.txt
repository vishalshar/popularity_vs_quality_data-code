Bought this for my cousin's son since it's such a unique item and they like to bond over new gadgets. What's great is Ollie is  entertaining for the both of them. Seems as though initially it took some getting used to the controls but once they got it down it was only a matter of time they had Ollie doing tricks.  The company also focuses on how to leverage their products for educational purposes so thats a great aspect as well!
