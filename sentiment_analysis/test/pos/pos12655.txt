If you are looking for a fairly healthy snack, these are a good bet. They are quite tasty and crunchy not to mention pretty good for you as well. I removed one star only based on the fact that they are quite expensive but if you are willing to pay for them, you do get what you pay for. Will be re-ordering more.
