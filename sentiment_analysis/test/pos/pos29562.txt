This MYNT Smart Tracker is really Great. I own another Bluetooth tracker (Not MYNT) which does not function well. And so I was skeptical of this MYNT tracker too it being the Bluetooth device.However to my surprise this functions exactly as it should be and much better than the previous one.It comes with a easy to follow quick start guide with instructions to setup. The package has a QR code on its back from where you can download the required app. It supports Android as well as iOS devices.The setup is quiet easy and self-explanatory. Once the setup is done, you need to do anything other than use the app to find the item.Most useful features:1. Separation Alarm: If you left the item behind to which the tracker is attached, your phone beeps to remind you after certain distance that you are separating from your item. This is really cool feature. The distance depends on your phoneÂ’s Bluetooth signal strength. For my Galaxy S6 I received alarm after 120 ft.2. Bi Directional tracking: Another amazing feature is that you can track your phone if you misplace it with the help of this tracker. You just need to press the little button on tracker and the phone will ring.Some additional feature:I am also surprised seeing what this little thing can do.1. Presentation Clicker: Connect it to your laptop through Bluetooth and this can be a very stylish, clicker to impress your audience. I am planning to do this in my next presentation in the office next week.2. Remote Shutter: Wow, I always find myself in setting up by camera in self timer mode and running to my spot to get in the picture. This little button can be used to click the camera (Bluetooth enables) shutter and take pictures at convenience.3. Remote control for music: This tracker can also be used to change the music tract of Bluetooth speaker / Phone. Very convenient in a party where you need to leave your place to change the track.I tested this tracker on my Samsung Galaxy S6 and it works fine.This is also very lightweight and thin (Only two quarters thick and fits perfectly in my wallet. See pictures. This tracker can be inserted in a key ring or can be attached to any item with the help of provided 3M stickers.It also comes with an extra spare battery so you need to go searching for another.Overall this is a solid built Bluetooth tracker which I recommend everyone should have for various reasons as described above.Hope this helps . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . !!
