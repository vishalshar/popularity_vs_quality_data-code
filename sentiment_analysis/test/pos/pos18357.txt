As a Asian Studies major with a Japanese minor at my local University, my friends and I enjoy this game as a sort of practice in Japanese sentence structure. We would love for there to be additional cards to update the sentences. We could have quite a bit of fun making silly sentences if another addition is made and we would be first in line to purchase it.
