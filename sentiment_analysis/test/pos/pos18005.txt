This is not really necessary if you already have the osmo gaming system, but the white board work great for sitting right up next to the base without causing an annoying line on the screen. The markers are ok. The orange marker doesn't erase easily and while trying to get it to work in the beginning sprayed orange ink everywhere. The brown marker doesn't work that great either. I think regular dry erase markers would be better, just because they are less messy.
