I bought this little projector on Prime Day, almost on a whim, although I really did need a small portable projector for some local genealogy classes/presentations that I am involved in.  I hoped it would do the trick, but I never expected to be so pleased with it.I'll start with only two "Cons".  1)  The speaker volume on the projector itself is poor; however there is a headphone jack that works nicely with external speakers so if you need good sound, it's an easy fix.  2)  The battery life (which I haven't yet tested) is only 1.5 hours, but that's also an easy fix provided you're near an electrical source because it works while charging with the included USB cable and adapter.  I'm planning see if the projector will charge with my solar iPhone charger - it will be a big plus if that works.Now the "Pros".  1)  Tiny, light and easy to transport.  2)  Well constructed.  Feels very solid as do the accessories, though it would be nice if the remote was just a little sturdier.  3)  Surprisingly clear picture for such a small little unit.  You can change the size of the picture by placing the camera at various distances from the projection surface (wall, ceiling, screen, bedsheet, etc.) and fine tune the clarity with the tiny focus wheel.  4)  The bendy tripod stand is ingenious.  You can literally bend the thing to any configuration you need, including around poles, etc.  5)  Slot for a microSD card included - content on the card (Powerpoint, photos, movie, etc.) controlled with the included remote.  6) Comes with a variety of input options - HDMI, and micro-USB.  iPad/iPhone works beautifully if you add the Apple Lightening Digital AV Adapter.  I'm using mine with my laptop (included HDMI cable), my iPhone and my iPad (included HDMI cable and separately purchased Apple Adapter).Included with the projector is the cool little tripod, the remote (uses 2032 button battery), four cables including the USB charging cable, HDMI cable and micro-USB cables mentioned above, and the charging adapter.If you need a neat little mobile projector for camping, outside movie nights, small presentations/training sessions, etc., you'd be hard pressed to find a better solution than this little projector.  Very pleased with my purchase.
