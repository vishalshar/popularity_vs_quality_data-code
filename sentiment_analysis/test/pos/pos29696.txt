Got this as a birthday gift to use to go to and from the beach which is just over 300 yards from my house.  It is fantastic!  I zip around the neighborhood just for fun, and use it during the day to come back to the house for lunch and restroom trips.  We fold it up and bring it right over to our beach blanket with us (there are no bicycle racks or anything for us to lock it to).  But, it's not trouble to quickly fold it up and carry it to the blanket or back to the walkway when someone needs to make a trip back to the house.  It feels very sturdy and gets going pretty fast!  Other people are quite envious of our new little "toy" or "beach accessory."  Would highly recommend for fun, for efficient means to get to places close by, or for commuters (as it was designed).
