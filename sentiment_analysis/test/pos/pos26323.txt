I've had this printer for 5 days now and wanted to give a review for others who may be interested in buying it from initial setup to the first print.When I first opened it up, I saw the top of the printer where the slot for the filament goes through. It was crudely cut, it almost looks like someone took a router and roughly cut it. So that gave me a red warning flag.I then downloaded the latest version of Matter Control (software used to print) from the Robo 3D site and installed it on my Mac. That wentsmoothly. I removed all of the packaging material and loaded the sample PLA filament that came with it. The feed spring to get it into the extruder is a little tricky but once you get the hang of it, its fairly simple.Now my problems began.I connected the printer to a 10 foot USB 2.0 cable and then tried my first print. The extruder was 5 inches too high even after doing an adjustment of the Z axis with a piece of paper.I called technical support on a Saturday and talked with a tech who said the Z mount needs to be adjusted. They sent me a pic of where they should be but it was for the R1 not the R1 Plus - different models. I ended up calling back and was told, "hmmm, we don't even have that printer available to review so not sure if I can help" and suggested I schedule a meeting with one of their techs during a weekday to review the issue.I eventually figured out that there are two orange switches on the Z axis bar that need to be depressed otherwise you will get a triggered condition in the software and you won't be able to print. X, Y, and Z should all say "Open" after sending a M119 command in the Gcode.Once I adjusted the brass nuts on the threaded rods, I was able to level and the first print started coming out but wasn't sticking to the glass base.At this point, I was getting frustrated and frankly was ready to return it to Amazon.I searched through the forums and tried the included glue stick which didn't help much. I then tried Suave extra hold hair spray and reprinted and the print came out amazingly well.The next issue came when I tried to use a new filament. I was unable to feed it but heated it up the extruder and slowly pushed the new filament in after I manually turned the gear clockwise to get the old filament out.That was fairly simple.So here's an assessment who this printer is for:If you're ok with getting "under the hood" and getting an idea how this machine actually works, then you'll be fine. It is definitely not a plug and play printer.Many think (including myself) that it would be simple to setup such as a laser or ink jet printer. Even with a tech background, this was somewhat challenging.The support is available 24/7 but once the call queue starts to back up, you'll be rushed off the phone. You do get a native English speaking tech which is a definite plus.Overall, I'm pleased with printer now but am dinging it a star for the fit and finish, support is basic and initial setup was frustrating.
