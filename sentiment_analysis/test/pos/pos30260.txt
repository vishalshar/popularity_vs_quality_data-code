So far I really like this phone.  The issues that people have had with sound and some other items seem to mostly have been fixed with their last update.  I just got the phone and had 2 large updates that had to be processed so saw the before and after of some of the issues.The last phone I had was a Nexus 6 which was way too big.  I wanted some smaller but it had to be unlocked and work w/ T-Mobile's Band 12 VOLTE.  This fit the bill and is now only $300.  Definitely buy the additional charger though.  Charging this from a computer is slow.
