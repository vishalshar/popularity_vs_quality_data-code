Holy cow this thing is a huge chunk of awesome! It has become a permanent fixture on my stove top!I have had it for about 6 weeks and have been throwing it through the gambit.  So far, it has performed flawlessly and passed every test I have thrown at it with flying colors.I have primarily been using it for holding lids and an elevated spoon holder.  It has been excellent for that! No more mess on my stove top or counter.The thing that impressed me the most was that it holds my crock-pot lid.  We have had a few parties and my crock-pot lid usually doesn't have a place to go while someone is dishing food out of the base.  This trivet has been perfect for being able to put the lid on the top section and the used spoon on the bottom.I also use it as a cooling rack for cookies.  It worked like a dream and gave me a little more counter space. The best part about using it as a cooling rack is that I didn't have to transfer the cookies to a cross-meshed rack. I could keep the cookies on the original pan and the Trivae allowed airflow to get under the pans.  The trivae saved me from dirtying more dishes and kept my stove and counter top cookie crumb-free!I have also splayed this flat to use on our wooden table for a roaster full of lasagna.  It held the 8 pound pan without an issue.The coolest thing I have done with this trivae so far has been making a large pizza and using it as an elevated server. My Williams-Sonoma Pizza pan is 18 inches across and takes up a lot of space on the dining table.  I set up the Trivae in it's elevated form and put the pizza pan on top of it.  It was a perfect solution to serving a large pizza at the table and still leaving enough room for salad plates, drinks and place settings for everyone.This is a true space saver and kitchen multi-tasker. Thanksgiving is my favorite day of the year.  I call it the Superbowl of Food. This trivae will make the day even more epic.  It will be by my side all 7 prep days as well as the main event and dinner. It can hold utensils, lids, be used as a multi-level platform for keeping dishes warm as well as holding a platter of turkey. Some people fear Thanksgiving, I say bring it on!This trivae is expensive for what it is.  But, I guarantee that you will use it on a daily basis. You will find tasks that it will be able to assist you with.  I have always been told that you calculate the value of a product by how much it costs and how many times you use it.  If that's the case, it will be the most valuable product you purchase this year.
