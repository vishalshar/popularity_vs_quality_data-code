The unit took less than 30 minutes to install it was very easy and simple.  The app set up easy as well with no issues.  I ran a manual test on all zones for one minute.  Looking forward to seeing it work in the morning.  I should have gone to the manufacturer's web site first as they were offering $40 off for July 4th.  A little disappointed i paid more than i should have.
