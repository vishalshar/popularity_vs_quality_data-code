This was a good purchase. When the volume is kind of loud, it gets a little tinny, but it's pretty loud for the price. I take it into the bathroom when I shower so as not to steam damage my phone, and it works well. You'll lose the connection about 20 feet away from your phone, which hasn't really been a problem for me.
