This pencil holder was purchased as a gift. It comes with a small (short) pencil inside. The pencil is actually held by that little silver cap, so it must be short enough to fit inside the brass holder (the body of the case). I guess if your favorite pencil is short enough, this is the perfect pencil holder then. The eraser is real. I don't know if it is replaceable though, so maybe only use it occasionally.
