Backup phone. Tiny. Comically tiny. It's like one half of the tiny flip phones that use to be around. Works with Project Fi Data-Only sim & Hangouts integration for voice and SMS. Awesome for me as a "going out" phone. Tiny and hardly noticeable. Keyboard is functional, but very small and can be cumbersome at times. You're probably not going to want to send many or long emails or texts. This is a minimalist phone to the extreme. Everything works as expected. That's a Post-it note under the phone in the picture.
