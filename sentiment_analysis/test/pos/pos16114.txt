My 7 year old (fairly advanced, but still) and i love this game.  It's very fast, which is a huge perk.  And it's super educational and super fun.  Definitely deserves its awards.  I didn't think my son would be able to do it since it uses a lot of multiplication, but with the included chart, it's very simple.  Probably the best educational game ever.
