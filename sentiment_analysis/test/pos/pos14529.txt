Used by a two year old more than me.  Light and excellent cleaning power.  Bought for my deck and it stays out in the weather, so far without issue .  Would have given five stars but the collapsible handle comes loose as I'm pulling the broom because I'm right handed.  When I switch to left hand use it tightens.  Small detail and I can always change the handle.  Overall happy with the broom and it's aggressive but gentle cleaning power.  Given that I purchased in winter I'm eager to see how well this works on something other than cedar decking.  Will update as appropriate.
