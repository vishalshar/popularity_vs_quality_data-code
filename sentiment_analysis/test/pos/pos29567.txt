My husband has a smart tracker for his carkey/fob and he loves it. so I decided to buy another smart tracker for myself because I regularly misplaced my wallet and I'm getting tired to look for it every time, before I leave my house. MYNT smart tracker is an oval device about 2" x 1" across and 0.2 inch thick, made of stainless steel. It shipped fast and it came in tiny cute box complete with the complete instruction how to use this device,  a lithium battery, a few round shape adhesive and a little string. This time I choose the gold color one, it is look very elegant and well made. A tiny round opening in the top left corner lets you attach a keychain, lanyard, or similar tether.Once a MYNT is paired with your phone, its ready to go. There are a few different ways this device can be used.First, if you lose track of the MYNT-equipped item, you can see its location, if its currently within range in the app. While in range, you can trigger the MYNTs alarm to play; depending on how far away you are, you may get a message on your phone screen to help you to find your MYNT-equipment item.Another cool option is, You can also find a misplaced phone, if its within Bluetooth range of course. Using the MYNT by Long pressing the middle, LED part of MYNT will triggers a tune to play on your phone at full volume, even if the volume is otherwise turned down/vibrate.The best part I like from MYNT is... its replaceable battery, this device use a lithium CR2020 3v battery. I received this device for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. This MYNT is definitely a cool gadget to have, it is very useful for someone whom regularly misplaced their stuff just like myself ;)
