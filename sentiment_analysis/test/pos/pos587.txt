I wear a size male size ten shoe.  Work exactly as advertised.  The top sickies are tight.  I need to use a shoe horn to get my foot in my shoe.  This is not a bad thing as your shoe will definitely stay.  I had to cross the lower ones to get enough tightness.  The way that I placed the lower Hickies is an example of the flexibility.  If you wear a shoe size larger than a ten this product may be difficult to get on but I suspect that you can leave out a couple of the upper lace holes.
