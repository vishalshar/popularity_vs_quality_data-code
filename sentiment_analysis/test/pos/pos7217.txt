I was gifted an automatic litter box. Although I'm thrilled with not scooping, the litter pans are crazy expensive if you have more than one cat. I figured I'd try this reuseable one to reduce waste and save some money. It definitely achieves those goals, but keeping it clean is kind of nasty. During the warmer months, it's no problem to take it outside and hose it down to clean it, but once it gets cold outside, I guess I'll have to switch back to the one-time use trays. (I'm not about to try to wash this in my sink). Assembly is easy and everything fits together perfectly, though.
