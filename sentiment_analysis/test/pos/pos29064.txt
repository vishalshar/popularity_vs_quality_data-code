The key to making this work is to make sure your phone or Tablet is slimport compatible.  There are websites that will tell you so google It.  Also, you must get a portable power with at least 2.5 amps to power your phone.  Shows exactly what is on your phone so your screen has to be on while you view it on the display and this sucks power from your phone or tablet.I live on the beach and wanted to watch movies from my phone on a projector so this works great and there is no need for wifi...just a good cell signal and a plan with unlimited high speed data...then you are all set.  Great for camping or on a boat!
