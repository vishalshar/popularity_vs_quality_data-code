I have been trying to find a good center console mount for my 2013 Lexus RX 450h. If you're an owner of this vehicle, you know that the CD slot is recessed which makes it difficult to find a good CD slot mount that actually fits this vehicle. While I'm not completely sure if this thing is latched onto the CD slot or the plastic frame leading up to the recessed CD slot, it seems to fit! It definitely took some time and trial/error for me to get this thing working (I've had it for maybe a week), but it seems that after repeatedly tightening the thing and pushing it toward the CD slot, and tightening it again after it gets loose from driving, the thing is now pretty sturdy! I still need to see how this works long term but for now I love the convenient location of the mount and the magnet makes it really easy to slap the phone there when I'm driving and remove it when I'm done.I usually use my phone in an upright position (iPhone 5, yes I know it's old) and once tried to move it to landscape on this mount and it started slipping off. The phone should weigh the same no matter how it's oriented so maybe I just need to balance it a bit better or adjust the magnet location on the phone, but this is something to keep in mind in case you definitely want the phone to work well sideways.
