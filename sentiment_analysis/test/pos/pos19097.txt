If there is one toy that I have in my techie toy box that surpasses the others, it is this.  I have had nothing but fun with this thing since it arrived.  I have only found a few formats that it will not play or possibly provide sound, but that has not been an issue as I have my movies in multiple formats.  We have done as others have described, laid on our backs in bed and watched tv on the ceiling, and it was awesome.  I can only imagine what uses I will come up with for this thing in the future.  I am currently creating a small projection screen to hang on the seat in front of me on the plane.  I just need to find the right heavy gold chain to hang this little beauty around my neck like a clock!  :-)  I purchased a mini HDMI male to standard HDMI female to use my roku or chromecast with this that did not function properly.  I would recommend that in the future they provide a cable with a female HDMI input as many types of "sticks" are out there.  I will be buying a female to female adapter instead.  all in all, fantastic product that is brighter than expected and provides a clarity that I would never expect from such a small package.  I highly recommend this product for anyone in the market for a pico projector.
