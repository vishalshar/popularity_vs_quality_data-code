I don't normally provide reviews, but the satisfaction and sheer joy of getting as close to "flying" is truly a great option now with the X-Star.I had previously dabbled in the drone market with the $50 - $75 non-GPS drones with the "HD Camera" attached. You get really good at your reflexes on a calm days only to have it fly off on you a couple times. Needless to say it was getting expensive to replace these cheaper "fly off" drones to the point that I wanted something that I could develop my confidence with and have for a while. Enter the Autel X-Star Premium.First off, I love the Orange color. So easy to see in the sky and as you need to fly with line of sight at all times it doesn't blend in with the clouds when it's up high or out at some distance. Immediately upon reviewing the videos on the Autel's website to get started, I charged up the battery, installed the props (which was a first) and charged the remote as well. 30 minutes later I was ready for launch. Reflexes ready I pressed the "Start Engines" button, and then "Take Off / Landing" Button. Both feeling like a NASA launch controller. And effortlessly the X-Star rose up about 12 ft. and just hovered. No input needed from me. The same basic controls used from the previous "cheaper" drones but with a lot less effort and very accurate controls with slightest pressure on either stick. The first time I've used First Person Viewing from the camera was a real treat. For someone that has dreamed of flying his entire life, this is as close that I've come. Now 2 months later it travels with me in my trunk with the included travel case and foam cut outs for extra batteries and gear which is awesome. I've captured so many great moments and scenery that I have people asking me to help them capture different things around town for their unique moments. I might just make a business out of this...well after the Part 107 testing of course. I'm also excited about the expanded offerings Autel might have in the future since the gimble is detachable and looks like you could put some other payloads or upgraded cameras that may come out in the future, so that is also a great option.I'm also excited to use the training function with my daughter to connect both controllers together and have her learn and an override if needed when she's flying.Now $899 is not a drop in the bucket, but I have reviewed, researched, compared, and watched just about every video, website and review of this product against the DJI, Yuneec, and other name brands out there and for my money and value, this is truly the correct choice for that intro, beginner, intemediate and pro for your GO TO UAV.
