We play a lot of Cards Against Humanity in my house, so when Cyanide and Happiness made this - it was a no brainer. We've played this countless times before picking it up and it was the perfect surprise Christmas present for my boyfriend!If you aren't familiar with the game, it follows similar rules to Cards Against Humanity - except the overall goal is to create an obscene, vulgur, funny, etc. comic strip. So 1 player will play the first 2 panels (1 card from the deck, 1 card from their hand) and all the other players will submit a card they think best completes it. Then it's up to the original player to choose which ones the best.Great for parties, or your friends who say the most hilarious things at the absolute worst times.
