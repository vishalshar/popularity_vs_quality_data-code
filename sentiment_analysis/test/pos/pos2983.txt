Didn't get a 5 star because it some problems with the trackpad, sometimes works as expected sometimes just does goes accross screen.I'd give it a 4 star if I used the trackpad, most of the time when working I use a mouse so I've got not much problems regarding that.IMO, the price is great for a 512 SSD with 2gb graphics card.Wish it had that 4 core CPU. Overall great hardware for great price. Totally worth a buy. ++ Its weight is just perfect, VERY light on backpack ( old computer started giving back pain).
