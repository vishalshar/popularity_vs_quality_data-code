I have had my Bragi Dash Truly Wireless for over 2 weeks now and I am glad I made the purchase. I have been watching the company for almost 2 years waiting and wondering would it ever be as good as it seems, I must say yes in my opinion, YES. I took my time to get the best fit by trying all the fit sleeves, getting accustomed to the features and it is very impressive. I use them when commuting to and from work and during the day at my desk listening to music via my cell. Anyone I speak to using the Dash they can't tell the difference, I think the music level is good and it allows you to go past the preset safe limit, overall the quality is good the highs are there the bass is enough to feel the music. Due to the placement and fit of the Dash the sound is full with a little "ting". I like the transparency mode along with windshield along with the convenience of the touch controls and the tap your jaw to access Ok Google!!! This is more than just a wireless bluetooth headset, this is leading edge technology with more features on the way. The portable charger, they do stay in place securely. The fitting is the key. My only grip at this time is the "white noise" that you hear with transparency mode enabled. Great product, I did get the Black Friday deal and it is worth it...oh yeah Stable Bluetooth Connectivity, it was not even an issue and I almost forgot to mention it...
