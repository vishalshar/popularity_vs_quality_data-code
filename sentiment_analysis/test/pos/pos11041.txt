Haven't had this for very long but I have absolutely no regrets. The point system takes some getting used to but it's a minor thing. I love that I don't have to charge it every few days and no need to activate anything for sleep tracking. I have also been through about 3-4 Fitbit trackers over the past 1.5 years because they have stopped working/charging/holding a charge. The Ray also looks much nicer and doesn't come off like the Fitbit bands. Absolutely no regrets with my Ray!
