So far, FIVE STARS on these socks. I was concerned about sizing, as I wear an 11-Wide shoe/boot, and have found many size Large socks are too small - or become too small after the first washing. NOT SO with these socks. The material is soft and comfortable, and they seem to be very well made. Instructions say to wash them in warm water and tumble dry. I wash everything on cold, and hang/ air dry all socks after giving them a little stretching. I find this eliminates virtually all shrinkage and extends life of the materials. Indeed, there was no shrinkage, the socks still fit fine and they are as noted very comfortable. I'll be buying more.Update: Thoroughly pleased with the first three pair, and purchased another 3-pair pack. I conclude they are the best made and most comfortable low-cut socks I've found, and very much worth the reasonable price.
