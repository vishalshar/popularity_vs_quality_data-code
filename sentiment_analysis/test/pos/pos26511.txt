I try not to drink out of plastic, so finding this was awesome (even though it is plastic). I personally have had no leaking problems like some reviews.I would give it five stars, but, sometimes I have to use hulk-like strength to twist it off.Not sure if is due to the o-ring or if I am a super human when twisting it on.Also, it really makes my co-workers concerned to see me drinking cold coffee from a jar. So that is a plus.
