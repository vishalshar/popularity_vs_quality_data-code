Having an allergy dog, I have a hard time finding foods that he likes and that don't cause his allergy symptoms to flare up.  He seems very happy with this food, as does my other non-allergic Aussie girl.  It's not greasy like other kibbles, and just the right size kibble for medium and large sized dogs.  Very glad that I tried this formula!
