This feeder is really great because it allows me to travel and feed my pets while I'm away. I used to bring my cats to a kitty hotel when traveling. But now with this feeder, they can stay home and I don't have to pay the outrageous cost for someone to watch and feed my pets. It's a bit expensive, but to me, it's well worth the investment if you don't have anyone that can feed your pet (like a neighbor). You can put a voice message for your pet like ("time to eat!") and they will recoginize your voice. You can set an eating schedule on the website or feed your pets manually. It's actually quite fun to do it manually. All you need is access to their website and make an account. You can also watch your pets eat with the webcam that is included. It really is a great idea and works really well. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it was a little challenging to setup with my wireless router. If you're not technical, you might have a problem doing this, but their tech support seems to be really good and I'm sure they'd be able to help you out.
