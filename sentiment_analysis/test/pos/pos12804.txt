I was looking for a nicer diffuser and this one suits me. I like the fact that the reservoir is able to diffuse for three times what my other, smaller units could. Plus, it puts so much more into the air; and it functions as a humidifier for us too. Its that powerful. The light show is a bonus; hubby loves that. It even plays its own music and Ive even played my own music by inserting a usb drive. Wow!  The timer functions well and its easy to set. The con:  if you do not line up the triangular marks in the rear... It wont function and i pulled out my hair for a day till hubby figured that one out. It was just a matter of a 1/8th inch twist and then all the touch modes worked flawlessly. As for price; yes it was three times the price of smaller units. But none of them could diffuse for half a day, play music, put in a subtle light show, turn on by a set alarm, and put a good amount if moisture into the air when needed. So 99.00 is a fair price.
