Great label with the 'good stuff' at a price that won't break the bank with 3 dogs. My doberman literally 'attacked' the box when my boyfriend brought it inside...he couldn't get it opened fast enough to the dobe's liking so the doberman started 'kicking' the bag with his front paws, nose flared, eyes wide open.....waiting.....once the bag was opened for enjoyment he moved my boyfriends hands out of the way and began eating out of it like it was a trough. I wish I had a video of this.....LOL!
