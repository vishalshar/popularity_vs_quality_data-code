This product perfectly suits my needs for a beautiful, functionality, and easy-to-integrate security product. I own the original Canary and the Flex helped me get an extra angle on my front doorÂ—it's a perfect partner to the original device or as a stand alone unit. The design of the device is super high-quality, the flexible mounting system works well, and the magnetic connection is strong and swivels seamlessly when rotated. The camera quality is great and the wide angled lens covers a large area for such a small device. I love the look and feel of the Flex and the fact that it incorporates well with the aesthetic of my home.The set up and integration with my original device on the app was quick and super easy. It's nice to be able to swipe back and forth between my camera views and you can control each device's settings individually from within the app. For example, if I can set one device to away (armed) and one to home if I want to control them separately.Canary instantly helped me feel more secure. I can easily check the app before coming home or check in when I'm away on a trip. I like the assurance of knowing I can always check in on my place even when I'm not there.
