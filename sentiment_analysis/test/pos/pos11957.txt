I just purchased a new 15" MacBook Pro with four USB-C ports. I did purchase the conversion cable from Apple, but also wanted something smaller that would be less obtrusive. In addition, I wanted an adapter that was small enough for travel without having to carry another cable in my bag.The nonda adapter fits perfectly into the USB-C port(s) of my MacBook Pro and holds the USB 2 and 3 devices I plug into it securely. So far this includes a Seagate USB-3 portable drive I use frequently for backup, a Samsung USB-3 thumb drive I use as an alternate boot drive, and of course my iPhone. When the adapter is plugged in, a small blue LED glows to confirm it's connection. This light is not connected to the device you plug into it, just the adapter itself. It might have been nice is the adapter had a second color to confirm the device connection, but really, that's a picayune complaint considering how well this small adapter works.The nonda adapter is a definite must-have for your arsenal if you've purchased either the new 13 or 15" MacBook Pro. Until Apple and other manufacturers come out with USB-C native cables, you'll find yourself using this adapter every time you reach for a USB 2 or 3 device.
