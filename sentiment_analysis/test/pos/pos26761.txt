I have spent the last few days with the Libratone Zipp Mini, and I am very impressed. I downloaded the app for my iPad and Android phone, both pair easily and work great. The sound quality is amazing, especially for its compact size. I am listening to Spotify on it as I write this, and it sounds great. My fianc√© has the full size Libratone Zipp and we have been pairing them together for a dynamic surround sound experience. I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a high quality and portable speaker.
