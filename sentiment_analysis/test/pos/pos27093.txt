Thought these were too good to be true. WRONG. I have been amazed. I live alone and love to have a variety of cheese and really hate to see some expensive cheeses get moldy before I have a chance to consume all of the wedge. Keeps every type cheese for many weeks. Best food saver I have ever purchased and have done my share.
