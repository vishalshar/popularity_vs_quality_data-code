I love the Instant Chaga, at first the taste was a little strong, but I got used to the earthy flavor right away, after 2 weeks of drinking it daily, I can feel the difference in my body, I feel less sluggish. A cold has been going around my office and I didn't catch it. If I skip taking it one day I can feel my body 'asking' for it. I add some Goji berries to it and is a perfect taste and health combo!
