I purchased this product to meet the new California law that prohibits all hand-held cell phone use while driving. I got it a couple of months ago to allow me time to get used to it before the new law takes effect in 2017. Here is my take:1. Follow the directions. Seriously. If your phone holder fell off after mounting it, you probably forgot the last step of pulling down the lever to secure it.2. I did not mount it on my dashboard because: a) my dash is textured and that may affect how well it sticks. b) based on previous reviewers I didn't want to risk damage to my dash. So I mounted it on the windshield to the left of my steering wheel.3. I use my mobile phone daily for WAZE GPS and phone calls.PROS:It took while to get used to my phone not being in the cupholder to my right. But once I got used to it, I preferred it for these reasons:- The telescoping feature is everything. I can position it exactly the way I need it, even being mounted on my windshield.- The phone being eye level makes my phone easier to see. I never need to look down. It is part of my dashboard.- I feel like a safer driver because I use the phone less. Having it mounted causes you to use the phone less. You'll see. You are on blast whenever you use it.- It it easy to slide my phone in and out of the holder. You simple squeeze the side grips to insert and to release the phone.CONS:- I prefer to use a USB cable rather than bluetooth in my car. So I had to purchase an extra long cable to reach my USB port. I don't like having the long cable, so I need to figure out how to secure it out of my way.Overall, I recommend this product. It supports my phone securely and at eye level, and it adjusts to suit my needs.  I wish I'd discovered it years ago to be honest.
