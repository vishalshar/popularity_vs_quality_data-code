My Rif6 Cube projector is my new favorite toy. Its compact but sturdy design asserts its quality. I have now used the projector in a few settings. In low-light, the projector produced a large (10Â’) watchable image but in a darkened room this projector really shines. Because of its small, portable size the Cube does not have the power (in Lumens) as some of the other projectors out there. But for what it is, and what it costs, this little gadget is truly amazing.Pros: portability, value, design, ease of functionalityCons: speaker very weak (I used headphone jack with Bose Soundlink II speaker), comparatively low powerOverall rating: A-I have received a discount for this item in return for this review. This is no way affects the review itself.
