One of my cats was recently diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease so I had to transition him off of a dry food diet to canned and then a raw diet.  It can be extremely difficult to get them to eat other types of food when they are addicted to dry, but a holistic vet told me about crushing these and sprinkling them on my cats' food to get them to eat the new consistency food and it worked like a charm!  Now they are off of the dry and happily eating a completely raw diet.  Occasionally I give them some small pieces of the Whole Life treats just as treats and they go crazy for them.  They are good for cats, too, being 100% meat with nothing else added.
