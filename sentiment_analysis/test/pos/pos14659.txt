These are GREAT because the case that holds them is perfect.  They pop in and out of the case and they're well protected THUS I haven't lost or broken them (this is unusual in this house).  They are fun because they are unique.  There's no arms that go over your ears.  They just hold onto your nose.  However, I use "reading" glasses to work on projects that I'm bending down to look at and these glasses slide around.  If you're just using them to read they're perfect but you can't tilt your head down or the glasses shift.
