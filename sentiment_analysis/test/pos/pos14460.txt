Great meter for the price. You get a quality meter that some with a decent zip case, leads, multipurpose adapter ( for caps and k type thermocouples etc) and a temp probe.The unit works great by itself ad only takes 2 x aa's. When a piece of equipment uses logical batteries, this hits big with me.Also, the unit has great build quality and do not feel as if I should treat it any different from a fluke. Fluke is made in China now so they are getting some inspiration now.Also with this being a foreign product, they like to put a few functions into one device. This is what makes this meter priceless. You can use it lie a normal meter with the lcd display (which does have a nice backlight) or you can use your phone remotely.AND it does data logging with a real time graph. This meter will handle commercial use with more residential type jobs.I would recommend buying a nicer lead set and case and you have a winner still for under a hundred bucks.The included case does not have any more room for storage but is very compact if you are pleased with what comes with it.The unit functions flawless and now with a fluke case and leads, I can rely on this unit making it through the day.I have tested this unit on my rv solar setup and it is robust being able to read up to 20amps dc. It will read 1000v volts but limited to 20a DC current.Not complicated to use and would recommend to any electrical or ee. I bought this with my own cash and do not recommend garbage.
