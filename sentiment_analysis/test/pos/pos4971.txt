If I were rating these on flavor alone, this would be a 5 star review. I was pleasantly surprised at the taste (which was fortunate, since you receive a case of 12 bags). I bought these because they seemed like the best way to get more coconut, and a "good ingredient" sweet for a high fat, lower carb diet. (There are only 3 ingredients: coconut, "coconut nectar"--whatever that is--and unsweetened chocolate.)But the reviewer who complained about the high sugar content is right. While they do not *taste* overwhelmingly sweet, one 28 gm serving has 13 g of fat, 2 g of protein, but 12 g of carbs (4 g fiber and 8 g sugar). And they pull the same crap as other food labelers and pretend that once you open this bag and realize there's only a handful of product in there, you are somehow NOT going to eat the whole bag. So here are the real metrics. One bag of this snack contains:238 calories18.2 g fat16.8 g carbs (incl 11.2 g sugar)2.8 g proteinThen there is the cost. Even supposedly getting a break because you're buying a whole case at a time, the current price here on Amazon works out to more than $3 per bag, which might still be okay if you could use it as a meal on the run, but I don't find that they abate hunger for that long.They are still worth trying if the cost and nutritional info above are acceptable to you as a meal, and they plug that hunger hole in the middle of the day on the run. That would be how this product shines best.
