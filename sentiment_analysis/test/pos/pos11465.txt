I like this device, it's responsive and fast I use it with the dlink smart plug, as well as with IFTTT integration with HUE lights. The one thing I'd really like is some kind of trigger to fire if the motion sensor DOES NOT detect motion after a certain amount of time has passed. To make it easier to trigger a smart switch or an IFTTT event to turn it back OFF after 5-30 minutes etc. That would make this device extremely useful for home automation integrations.
