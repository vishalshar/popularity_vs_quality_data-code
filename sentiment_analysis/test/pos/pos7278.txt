I like the Tile. Many of the complaints on here seem to come from unreasonable expectations. Of course omething that costs $20 isn't going to be able to tell you exactly where it is at all time!!  Don't buy this if you want a full-time GPS tracker!But if you think it would be nice to know where your lost item, wallet, etc were last located when it saw a Bluetooth signal, from you or any other users' phones, then Tile is for you.  To me it's helpful to know if my wallet Was last seen in my car or house, versus falling in a store somewhere, at work, stolen, etc.  many times I've looked for something important all over the house only to find out I left it at work.  Now with Tile I just open the app and it says it was last seen at work.  So there's a 99% change that's where it still is, and I don't need to waste an hour searching the house and everyone's cars, calling the gym, etc.
