First of all, the packaging for this game is a bit unique with the box being a "book", cool!  The game is fun and engaging. We've played twice so far with 4 people and had a great time. We all think that more players would definitely add to the whold experience, but playing with 4 wasa lot of fun too. I definitely recommend this game.
