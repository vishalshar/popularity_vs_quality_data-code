This is the best tape measure I have ever owned! The digital aspect of it makes taking measurements so much easier! When I have to measure corners, I am able to switch the setting so that the measurement is taken from the back of the tape-measure. Definitely see the video of the tape-measure in use prior to purchasing. It shows all the great ways this tape measure can be used.  I use this tape-measure for all my building projects.  Because I am doing construction often, the ease of this tape measure makes getting the job done much quicker! The tape measure also can quickly half the lengths for the user, which makes hanging things on walls in the middle a breeze! This tape measure is good for everyday use or people like me who are doing construction often.
