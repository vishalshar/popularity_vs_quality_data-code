There is only one word that describes this headset: unbelievable. Both my partner and I agree that these headphones are absolutely amazing in every way. Excellent sounds, intuitive controls, nifty little carrying bad, beautifully made. I can't praise these headphones enough. Time will tell if they hold up, but I have zero reason to take away stars.
