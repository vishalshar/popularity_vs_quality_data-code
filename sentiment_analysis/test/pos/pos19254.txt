This is a very detailed device.  The picture quality is incredible, especially at night.  The video was choppy but I don't know if it was my wifi or the actual device, as I had nothing else to test.  If you have a dark environment for night security this would be perfect.  But if there is any light at all from headlights on the street, neighbor turning on their lights outside a window, or even an automatic light coming on in the room you have this item, it will send an alert to your phone.  Daytime it is just fine, but the night end still needs a bit of work.
