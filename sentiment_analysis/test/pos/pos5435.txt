I was skeptical about purchasing this product after reading all the reviews and seeing all the horrifying rash pictures. I'm your regular average everyday consumer looking to transition from chemical to chemical free products. Here's the thing, this product DID NOT cause that rash, stopping use of the aluminum and other chemical filled deodorant you were using is! That stuff clogs your pores with so much toxic sludge that once you stop, your body's natural lymphatic system has to filter all that crap out, hence the rash (which lasts about a week or so) depending on how long or how much you use that chemical filled crap!Here's what you need to know and what I did:1) before transitioning to natural deodorant, stop using deodorant altogether for about 7-10 days. I know, I know sounds gross right? I did it through the holiday season and managed just fine. Wash your armpits a few times a day with a gentle cleanser to help with odor. You will experience a rash during this time. It will be red, itchy and maybe even painful. This is your body naturally detoxifying itself. You will quickly see it is NOT caused by transitioning to natural deodorant because you're not using any!2) get yourself some bentonite Indian healing clay and around day 7, do a mask on your armpits mixing equal parts bentonite clay and organic apple cider vinegar (Braggs is the best) do not use a metal bowl or spoon to mix as it pulls metals from the body and using metal will lessen the effect. Let the mask dry (about 20 minutes) then rinse in the shower or with warm water. Can get messy! Bentonite clay is a powerful deep pore cleanser made from volcanic ash loaded with negative ions that pull the toxic positively charged metals and toxins from your body. Good to do this at night as it will make you lethargic. Keep hydrated during the mask.3) start using your Primal pit paste and love every minute of it! It's smooth, smells great and lasts all day! Easy to apply, just use the wooden stick it comes with to spread a pea size amount to your underarm and watch it melt like wonderfully scented butter! Enjoy!
