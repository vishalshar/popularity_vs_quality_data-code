Great product!  I purchased one for a coworker and one for the Wifey....they both love how durable the utensils are, including the cool little toothpick.  The bottle opener built into the knife was a huge plus.  After a quick rinse & drying, they both like how they no longer have to use napkins to wrap up/cover the utensils because of the provided case.
