I have had this watch for a week not and love it, just enough smarts into a watch but still usable as a watch!  I like how the notifications push to my to my wrist and I can just clear/ignore/delete them at ease.  Battery life is better than a lot of the smart watches on the market, and the price is amazing.  There are still some minor issues, example: if i say "call Lesley" the watch says "leslie doesn't exist" or something along those lines, but that seems like a easy update fix. All in all great watch, highly recommend it, and hope they come out with lots of aftermarket bands soon!
