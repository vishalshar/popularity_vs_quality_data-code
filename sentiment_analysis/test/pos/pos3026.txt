This game is hysterical, my family loves it! It's easy to play, kind of like a visual take on Cards Against Humanity. If you are amused by crude, dry, and awkward humor, combine it with a drink or 2 and you'll have a blast. Don't keep it where kids can get into it though, unless you'd like to have some very strange "what does this mean?" conversations.
