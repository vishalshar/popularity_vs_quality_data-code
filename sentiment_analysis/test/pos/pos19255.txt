I was comparing a Nest and a Canary. At the end of the day, i got both for different use cases. I got the Canary since i don't have to pay an annual fee to use it and it works well in my living room. The performance is good and each subsequent upgrade to this improves its performances. The thing i dont like about it is that i cant reposition the product anyplace i want it and the iOS app takes longer than the Nest app to load.
