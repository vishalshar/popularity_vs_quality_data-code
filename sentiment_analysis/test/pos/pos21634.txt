I absolutely love my DolfinPack! It's comfortable to wear and does the job I need. I mostly use it for Spartan Races, but have taken it on canoe and kayak outings, as well as runs around the neighborhood or on trails. The water bladder holds enough to get me through all my evens. It is easy to clean and doesn't hold smells (like from preworkout or BCAA powder). The neoprene pack washes clean after each race! I can throw my keys, snacks, or anything inside and am not concerned about losing them! I highly recommend this pack!
