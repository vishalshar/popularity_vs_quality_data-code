I was skeptical after reading other product reviews.  I'll say this much, the app (incase you're not aware, you need an iOS device like an iPad or iPhone for instruction) is pretty limited.  It helps you walk through about 8 creations or so (create a buzzer that buzzes when you press a button, create a current tester, create a light dimmer), but the app also "scans" your setup to test if there is proper flow between the components, which is pretty neat. When using this product, think of it like this.. would you buy Lego's and only follow the instruction sheet, or instead take a bunch of blocks and build stuff?  Some negative reviews stem from the former, most positive reviews stem from the latter.The limitation of the 8 creations on the app is why I only gave 4 stars, namely because there's only so much you could do with the few items in the box, but regardless this item is still pretty cool.  Using the iOS projects as a starting point, my 5 year old had a heck of a time swapping components in and out ("lets replace the button with a light sensor!" and "what happens if we take a wire away!?").  Her head almost exploded when I took her leftover Hershey kisses wrappers and used them to complete a circuit.. although that could have been from all the chocolate.You can tell this product was just "good enough" to launch, there's no crazy bells and whistles, there's no super special app to unlock more features, but that's fine.. I think the concept for the components and supporting app took a lot to conceptualize and build.  I hope they can keep this going, I'm certainly interested in their similar products.  However the moral of the story is, if you're going to use this product to follow instructions and nothing more, then don't waste your money. If you want to use it as a starting point to play around, you can get a few hours of fun out of it.  You won't play with it non stop, but you will take it off the shelf every now and then and say "hey, let's try this thing again".
