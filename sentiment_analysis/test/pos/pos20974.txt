I've bought a few of these for friends as gifts because they all loved mine so much.  One of them was defective but I exchanged it easily enough.  The pink one isn't very bright where as the blue one is way too bright in my opinion it's actually distracting in the car at night..  However it is the coolest color :)  it's always a conversation starter every time I pull it out someone is like Whoa where did you get that ?
