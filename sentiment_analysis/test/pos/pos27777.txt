I love this power strip!!  It has 7 ports (5 schedule & 2 always on) + 2 usb ports.  Works amazing so far and should pay for itself down the line with the standby power that I'm saving.  Super easy to set up and the app is easy to use as well.  2 things I really like about this strip so far:Wifi extender is amazingOur router is set up on the opposite of the house.  I usually get about 1 bar, 2 on good days, of connection, but after connecting this strip with the router, I'm getting full bars!  I'm actually able to browse and stream videos from all my devices.Scheduling feature is extremely handyProbably the coolest thing about this strip is that you control when your devices receive power.  I've connected my radio, lights, fan and TV to revolve around me.  I wake up when I hear music in the mornings at 5:30 AM.  Everything is scheduled to turn off at 6:30 AM so I'll know when to head out without checking my phone every 5 minutes.  When I get back at nights, my lights and TV are on right when I walk through the doors.  Now that the weathers heating up, I schedule the fan to run halfway through the night then turn off.
