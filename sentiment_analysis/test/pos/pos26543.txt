Got this for my dad for Father's Day. It just took him about 20 minutes to hook it up and now he's running around the yard taking pictures of the zones! I think he's too picky to allow some "smart watering" system control his yard, but he loves controlling it all from his phone! I'm going to buy one for my house now. I'll experiment with the smart watering and let him know how it goes ;)
