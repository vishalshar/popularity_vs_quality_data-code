The finicky cat cannot get enough of this, which is fantastic. He's a street rescue who had to have most of his teeth removed last year, and has had trouble maintaining, let alone regaining, weight since then. Since we've started him on this dry cat food, he's put on nearly two pounds, which is really wonderful to see - and as an added benefit, his loose stools have firmed up AND become less of the toxic stink bombs they were before. Pretty much win all around!
