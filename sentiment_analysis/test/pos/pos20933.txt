Really nice and modern ice cream scoop that works as intended.  I actually bought the silver as a gift and the black for myself.  Makes for a very nice house warming party gift.  Well made and I did not mind the little counter weight insertion point that is barely visible in the silver version.  I don't see it on the black version.
