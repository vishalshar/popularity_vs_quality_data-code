I haven't used this device outside of the U.S. so my review is just based on usage in the U.S. So far I like  the idea of the G2. The initial setup for me was a bit painstaking, either I was not following instructions clearly or the instructions are just not good. You initially have to sign up online and add money to the G2 to get it to function, which I didn't see in the instructions, I just figured that out.Upon setup you'll find plans are a bit expensive. For example as of this review data cost .05 Euros or $.06, so 200MB cost you $12US, T-mobile gives you that for free on a tablet. T-Mobile also has a lot of good plans like 5GB for $10 for the year plus 200MB free for use between Canad, Mexico and the US. For the record I use AT&T which this device doesn't appear to connect to.Once you've got a good connection it's pretty fast. It appears to connect to the T-Mobile network in the areas I've been so far. I've tested it at my job inside the building and couldn't really get a signal as is the case for most on T-Mobile in the building. Being a newb to the device I did make mistake I first added $12US to the device and that was gone in a matter of minutes because my phone when connected to the device downloaded 200MB worth of updates, so be warned, turn off automatic updates and anything else that may use excessive data without your permission.I can give a more detailed description, but I'm only mentioning things that stuck out to me, such as the device is very thick and I know that is because of the 6000mah battery but I wish it were more slim, I'd even sacrifice the battery capacity. I also wish it had more bands, the ability to connect to virtually any network in the world. The latest iPhone for example has almost every band for carriers throughout the world.I do like the options to use sims as the sims I have deliver much better pricing. I hope the device's interface (which is lacking) and features are updated very soon and frequently. This is the only device of its kind that I'm aware of so I don't really have anything to compare it to, because of that I gave the device 4stars. And that's all I have for now. Hope my observations and opinions are helpful. Regards.
