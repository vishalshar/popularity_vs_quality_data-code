FANTASTIC laptop!  No bloatware (besides Microsoft) and MUCH lighter and thinner than I expected.  Some ideas for potential buyers:1.  Install all Windows updates...ALL2.  Add another 8 GB of DDR4 RAM.  Crucial8GB Single DDR4 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFD8213  It took 10 minutes and was SUPER easy.  Gently pry up back cover after removing screws...lift little silver rectangular box on PCB and install RAM.  Make sure seated 100%...check settings/system/about and make sure it says "Installed RAM 16.0 GB".  Still says 8?  RAM not seated...check before reattaching back cover.3.  Update BIOS from 300 to 301 using Asus WinFlash on your app list.  Soooo easy.4.  Right-click on desktop to pull up Nvidia Control Panel.  Adjust as needed from "Integrated Graphics" to "High-performance Nvidia processor" as you see fit.5.  Goto "hidden icons" bottom right taskbar and right click Nvidia icon.  "Check for updates" to update graphics display driver.6.  Settings/system/power & sleep/additional power settings.  Here set either balanced/power saver/performance.  Gamers know to use "high" at cost of battery...balanced fine otherwise.Enjoy!!  I am VERY impressed so far.  I dare you to find a 15.6" HD laptop with similar 64bit Win 10, Intel i7, DDR4, and Nvidia 960M for less...good luck.  10/10 bang for buck even after 8GB RAM upgrade.
