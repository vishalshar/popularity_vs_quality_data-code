My child loved the idea of a robotic pet.  CHiP responded very well with a little tweaking of the voice commands.  He dances , does yoga, fetches and plays with his ball,follows you , barks ,sits,wags his tail and much much more.  I loved the idea of the wrist band remote. Makes a great gift for all who either wants a virtual pet, or likes interactive toys.
