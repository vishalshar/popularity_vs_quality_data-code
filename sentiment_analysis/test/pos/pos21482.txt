Definitely helps my hands and has a nice scrub. The only things I don't like are that the scrub seems to disintegrate pretty easily, and I'd rather something that really scours, and then it leaves very oily-looking skin behind. It's not actually oily, it's moisturized, but it looks weird. However, aver about 20 minutes, my hands look 100x better, smooth and not alligator-like anymore! :-)Overall I have to say there are better products out there for the price, but if you need some deep moisture, this might be the product for you.
