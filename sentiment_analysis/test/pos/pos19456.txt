Outstanding performance.  Simple to use.  This is the one to get.Never used a 3D scanner before.  I did some reading and some learning.  I learned that lighting is important.  Background is important (flat black foam board worked for me) and combining 2 or more scans is important.My results on the first day are shown in the image.  The image on the left is the original figurine I wanted to scan, the image on the right is the final combined scan (3 scans) converted to a mesh.Can't get better than this, in my opinion.Todd
