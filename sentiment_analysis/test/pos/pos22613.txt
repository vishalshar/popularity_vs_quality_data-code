This product is neat! I believe that is what they were going for. It is very much not more useful than a normal measuring tape, and it is limited to the nearest 1/16th of an inch. But on the other hand it is a normal measuring tape that looks cool and get the job done. So why not splurge and have the coolest measuring tape on the block.
