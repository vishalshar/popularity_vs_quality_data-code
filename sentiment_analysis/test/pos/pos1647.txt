I had the pebble time and gave up on it after too many glitches. After reading reviews (not Amazon) I decided to give this one a try. So far so good. No software issues like before. If you're looking for a simple smartwatch that provides reliable notification this is it. Plus it's waterproof. It's not an apple watch but it does the basic blocking and tackling. All I need.
