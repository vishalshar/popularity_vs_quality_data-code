The Starry router is a beautiful piece of technology. It looks like nothing else on the market, and it works flawlessly. It's extremely fast. Comparing speed test results with my old Fios Gateway is a night and day difference - Starry is finally giving me the speed I pay for.Packaging:Usually I wouldn't mention the packaging in a review, but I feel obligated to with this unit because there was so much care and attention to detail put into it. It comes in a cool triangular box. The whole unit pulls straight out of the side with all the cables coiled neatly at the base. Really Apple-esque, which is a big compliment.Hardware:It's a glossy white triangle shape with an oval screen and a proximity sensor on one side and a metal backplate on the other. It feels really solid and well-constructed. The touchscreen is high resolution, and the sensor is quick to notice that you've approached the unit. The only negative is that the fan noise it makes is quite audible. Without the TV on, I can hear it whirring from 8ft away on my couch. Just keep that in mind if you're planning on putting it next to your computer. Not a deal breaker, but certainly noticeable. The device does seem to keep fairly cool so at least the fan is very functional.Software:Here's where Starry really shines. The touchscreen on the unit looks great. The interface is simple and it's very responsive to touch. The installation process is completely painless. It's so much easier to install than a regular router because all the information is right there on the screen. Overall it's intuitive, easy to interact with, and provides a lot of great information about your network. This is what all routers will look like in the future. It also has a wonderful iPhone app that works great for adjusting settings.WiFi Performance:Blazing fast. We're getting 20Mbps more than from my Fios router. So far it's been speedy and reliable. Extremely pleased with the overall performance. We haven't had any connection issues at all.Overall:Great looks, intuitive, and consistently fast. The only two issues are the fan noise (more of a minor annoyance) and the fact that it's one of the most expensive routers on the market. Whether or not it's worth the price is up to you. If you're on a budget there are other options, if you want a beautiful and fast router with a cool touchscreen interface and you're tired of resetting your crappy old router, then this could be for you.
