Today was my first time using GAME GOLF.  I fully expected to miss tagging my clubs before every shot and I certainly did some.  You just get caught up playing and forget.  Expecting this, I took notes on my shots and kept score on my Garmin.  I was able to easily go in and edit my round to match my Garmin stats.  I think once it becomes part of my pre-shot routine to tag-and-go, I will not want to golf without it ever again.  Just think about all the stats I'd be missing out on!  I tagged most of my shots and they were very accurate it seems.  The web interface is clean and easy to navigate.  The only gripe I have right now is that the website should recognize you as owning a system once you've uploaded your first round and remove the "Buy now for $249" banner at the top of the page.  Other than that, I think we are going to see more of these types of devices in the future, and I bet one day golf clubs will all just have NFC chips in them from the factory.  It really is that awesome.
