I'll start off by saying that I love this product and hope that amazon continues to carry it on prime as it has become such a godsend for my dog.For some background information, my dog is about 6 years old, half great dane, half labrador retriever, with lifelong skin allergy issues. All her life she's been dealing with seasonal allergies that would cause the skin on her back to flake. Along with the flaking skin, tiny hunks of hair would fall out. Each season we'd go to the vet, treat it with antibiotics, and be done with the symptoms for maybe a few months before the cycle would begin again.About 6 months ago, she started to lick at her paws, a behavior she had never exhibited even when the skin on her back was itching and flaking. She would lick them until they were raw and bloody and I thought at the time that she would have to live her life in a cone. I was desperate to change something. During this time I had her on Natural Balance Limited Ingredient Diet Fish & Sweet Potato formula--I was certain that I was giving my dog the best food for her, as it was a limited ingredient, grain-free formula--looking back I wish I would have thought to switch sooner. Anyways. While she ate the Natural Balance and ate 100% grain-free, I also supplemented her diet with Vet's Best Seasonal Allergy Support Supplement, which, when we didn't miss a dosage, worked WONDERS for her irritated paws. However, whenever we would slack off and miss a dose (crushing up those tablets and mixing them into wet food twice a day was a task), she went right back to licking her paws raw. Around this same time, I also noticed that her stools were getting worse and that she started to develop dark sores on her belly.I realized I may need to rethink her dry food and went to my local Petco and saw Solid Gold. The packaging was flashy and I can't lie, I'm a sucker for glitter...But as I started reading the ingredients and doing some research on my phone while in the store (I seriously stared at these bags reading for nearly half an hour), I became more and more convinced that this product was much healthier than what I had been giving her. I picked up a 12-lb bag of food and took it home to experiment.After the first day I noticed a remarkable difference in her stools (they were normal, a sight I hadn't seen in months) and as the week went on I didn't notice her licking at her paws at all. Her coat steadily improved, the sores healed up, and we've yet to have another vet trip concerning her allergies. I've been giving her Solid Gold Sun Dancer for about 3 months now and although the price is not something I'm crazy about, I will do absolutely anything to make sure my dog is comfortable and healthy. I hope that she continues to do well with this food and will update this review if anything changes.ALSO: The price on amazon prime fluctuates to the point where sometimes it's cheaper to buy (2) 12-lb bags than (1) 24-lb bag, so just make sure you're always getting the best deal!
