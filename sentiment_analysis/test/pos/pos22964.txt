We played this with my 8yo and 10yo yesterday for the first time. It's a great game. Both kids loved it, regardless of the ability to multiply/divide. I think it will actually help them learn (yes, my 10yo still struggles with multiplication facts). The colors on the dots for the multiplication are actually pretty ingenious. I don't know if we'll use them as intended, but it's a really neat concept. I like that the prime numbers are red - they'll stick out more in memory. All in all a fun game and everyone enjoys it. Will definitely play more.  The documentation/rules booklet is extremely well written. Very clear instructions and FAQs that actually are FAQs when playing.
