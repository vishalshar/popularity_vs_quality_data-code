I've gotten more positive comments about this water filter than anything else in my kitchen. People love the design. Now, I have no idea whether it's actually making my water healthier -- for all I know, it's totally worthless in that regard -- but it definitely makes it taste better. And in that sense, I think this is one of the best $40 health investments I've made, since it's made me drink way more water at home instead of sodas or juice. I live in an old building, and the mineral taste in the water was really off-putting... but it's completely gone now that I'm using the Soma. Plus, I'm still on my first filter, and it's been almost a year! I know I should replace it with a new one, but I can't detect any degradation in taste -- they really do last a long time.
