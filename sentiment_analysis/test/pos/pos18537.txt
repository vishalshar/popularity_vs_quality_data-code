Sugru fixes everything! I use this stuff all the time now. My shower caddy was tension-style and kept falling - Surge fixed it.I did that Pinterest thing where you mount a tension pole horizontally and put your spray cleaners on it. Of course the tension pole didn't hold up to the weight of the cleaning products - added Sugru and it worked!The little rod on the hinge of my trashcan always slid out - I put two globs of Sugru on either side and now it stays in place.I made a lamp and wasn't sure how to connect the plastic to metal - caulk didn't work - Sugru did.You will find a million little uses for this product. I bought a multipack in black and white. Next up - colors!
