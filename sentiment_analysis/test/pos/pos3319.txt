Great kit - with some drawbacks.  This is a great little kit that lets kids build lots of creative things.  The pieces interface with LEGO bricks, allowing for more things to be made.On the downside, they are FRAGILE.  Upon opening, one of the power connectors was broken (good thing I can solder), and one of the wire bits was broken (too small to solder).  My daughter (10 yo) has trouble getting the parts to stay connected to the large plates that form the foundation of many of the projects.  This seems to be a manufacturing issue.That being said, I will likely purchase more to add abilities to this kit.
