This was the best device I could have added to the cab of my truck! I use it primarily to hold my 7" Galaxy Tab 3 and on occasion my Galaxy S4 so that I can easily operate the devices for accessing text messages and operating Pandora, YouTube, etc., without having to hold it in my hands. I shopped online and in stores for several months when I finally settled on this wonderful gadget. It doesn't really get in the way, is very sturdy and swivels easily although it does make it difficult to use the cup holders. But that is what you get for the convenience of easy device access while driving. One down side is that the main bendable stand is a little difficult to work with and I feel like I'm going to rip it out from under the seat to readjust it after a nosy passenger gets their hands on it. The holder and main tube are clean in it's design, functionality and it clears the center console of my 2008 Tundra just fine. I may not recommend this for someone who has a smaller truck or car as I think it may sit too high in the air.
