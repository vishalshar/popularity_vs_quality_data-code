This is a great Tripod Adapter. It fits the Lytro camera perfectly. The rubber pad on the inside really help to hold the camera tight and didn't shake loose when carrying or setting up the equipment and shooting. Great price for something specifically designed for a hybrid camera and Amazon was about the only place I could find one.
