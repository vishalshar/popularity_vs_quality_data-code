Ive been waiting a long time for a product like this and I have looked at and tried others but none did exactly what I wanted them to do.  I have a 14 yr old jack russle with terrible problems in her back joints and arthritis and I travel a lot for work.  With fitbark, I can not only keep any eye on how active she is, and if my dog walker is walking her as much as hes supposed to be, but I can also tell if she has had her medication that day.  If she hasnt her activity levels are way down and her rest is way up.  Last week I even got an alert that Pippie is resting more than normal, is she ok?  She had already had her medication that day so, I made an appointment with our Vet and showed her the Fitbark app and Pippies play and rest times.  First, my Vet asked where he could get one and I also showed him how I could share Pippies information with him to help keep an eye on her.  He adjusted her medication and my girl is back up to her normal playful self.  Pippie loves Fitbark, thank you!!!
