EXACTLY like how it was advertised & marketed. Really well done, Bragi. The Dash changes the way i listen to music completely!!1. connectivity to my smartphone's bluetooth was excellent. I can put it in ANY pocket (front, left, right, back) and it will still not have any drop-outs.2. i placed my smartphone 5 to 6 meters away with line of sight and it will still be good (unless blocked by a wall)3. sound is good, and getting better with the firmware updates. I received mine at 1.3, i skipped 1.4 and went straight to 1.5 and it is sounding EVEN better with more bass and also loudness :)4. the breathing LED light when i wear them is really cool.. i get many head-turns :)5. battery life is 3.5 hours on bluetooth connection and even MORE on internal player (continuous usage, yes!)6. waterproof, indeed, as advertised. I shower with them every night to my favorite tunes :)7. very solid and classy build! The case is SOLID metal! Love it!8. I only charge the case like ONCE every 4 days (if i remember)9. it's NOT just an earbud, really,... it can be UPDATED with firmware... i would call it an IN EAR COMPUTER, really, with all the sensors10. Some users say their units have lousy connectivity or dead after a week of usage. My opinion, i suspect those were the very first batch. Four of my friends gotten theirs NEVER had any such problem. Bragi customer service have been very responsive and offers replacements. I have friends who already receive their replacements and they love the new units. So those with the problematic first batch, quickly send them back to Bragi and get replacements... YOU WILL LOVE IT :) So, do not let those earlier batches of bad reviews scare you away.11. I end up exercising MORE and lost 2kg in 1 month because i now enjoy my runs so much :)12. Even my dog is happier now, since I bring her out more often just to get to use the Dash outdoor (Zero dropout outdoor too)So, yeah, go ahead and get yourself one, update to version 1.5 of the firmware and you will love it :)
