I really like this phone for the price. My iphone broke,so I  looked into cheaper, unlocked phones. This one is great, I can use all the same apps I had before. I didn't give it 5 stars because,1. Even though I got the SIM card directly from AT&T, I had to tape it in, to get the metal to make contact with the phone, for the phone to detect the SIM card. I bought 2 more of these phones for my tween kids, they work great, did not have to tape the SIM cards. Easy for the kids to use, too.2. Camera needs A LOT of light or else pictures look very dark.3. The time is set to the wrong time zone, and if I try to change it, it also changed all the existing appointment times on my calendar! I figured out that I had to also change the time zone on all my existing appointments individually, to fix the problem. I was a bit of a hassle.4. Had to sign up for voicemail service with AT&T and pay $2 a month for it. I didn't need to do that with my iPhone.
