Excellent item. This was easy to install and program. It works great and let's me know via my iphone anytime any of my doors are open. I know exactly when my kids come and go while I'm at work. It's great to be able to set the alarm from my phone too. The best part is there is no monthly fees. I finally feel that my home is secure and I don't have to spend an arm and a leg to do it. I am waiting for the camera's and more sensors to become available as that will make this a complete package. This package will pay for itself in less than 4 months compared to a monthly alarm bill.
