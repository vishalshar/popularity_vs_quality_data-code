I have a regular Easy Walk harness that I've used with my dog for years with great success, but it was getting old and grungy and was in need of replacement, so I thought I'd try the deluxe version.  I love that the deluxe version has the neoprene lining on the straps, as I'm sure that is much more comfortable for the dog.  And I already knew I loved the Easy Walk harnesses generally as it has really helped address my youngster's bad pulling while on walks.  So why only 4 stars?  Well, it's a color issue.  I ordered the harness in Rose.  I expected something that was either red or a shade of pink. One reviewer noted that she expected the rose color to be red but what she actually got was a pink harness.  I was fine with red or pink so I ordered the Rose color, but I wasn't fine with what I received - the "Rose" harness was actually an orange-red color, sort of a dark coral, that I didn't like at all.  Clearly function is what matters with this harness, but I just couldn't stomach the thought of looking at that orangy-red color every day, so it's going back, and I'll either get a regular Easy Walk or the deluxe in gray.
