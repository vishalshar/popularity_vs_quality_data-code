Had a few days with the phone now. The hardware is fantastic for the price ($300 at the time of this review). Games play smoothly with 3GB and Snapdragon 808. Very light phone if you are concerned about weight. Display is lovely. No app drawer in marshmallow is weird, but a launcher can fix that. Not sure about the cloud storage idea, as I haven't had to use it. The design of the phone looks nice but isn't very practical. The power button, also the fingerprint sensor, is flush with the side of the phone, making it harder to use. The phone material is so smooth (and the phone is so thin) that it is hard to pick up if you set it on a flat surface like a table, so you will need a case. Unfortunately there aren't many cases available. Also, make sure you have a nano sim for it and type-c cords or converters ready if you like to have chargers available at home, with, car, etc.Overall it's a great phone, but do your homework before buying.
