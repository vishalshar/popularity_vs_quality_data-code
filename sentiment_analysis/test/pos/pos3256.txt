This is voodoo magic to me.  Both my wife and I enjoy cooking a great deal.  We purchased this item as a recommendation from a client of my wife's.  Neither my wife nor I had ever heard of sous vide cooking.  We made the purchase, ordered a cookbook, and browsed the internet to get a better understanding of what sous vide cooking is.  We have cooked two things with this item, so far, and both items (1 1/2" Ribeye steaks and Salmon) were cooked to perfection.The item is very easy to use.  Pop it into a large pot -- or rectangular polycarbonate tub (our preference), plug it in, turn it on, and rotate the silver ring to the desired temperature, and you are on your way to a great meal.  Time time it takes for the water to reach the set temperature is not too long.  I did not check the time, because I was prepping other things, but the bath was ready by the time I was.  There is a cover on the back of the device that is opened to clean the heating rods periodically.  The cover seems pretty flimsy to me, and on the one I purchased it does not snap closed properly--either that or it's a design flaw.  However, the cover does not do anything as far as cooking goes, so I wasn't too concerned.
