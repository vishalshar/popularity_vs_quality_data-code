It's like a docking station for your Dell. With 2 USB3 ports another SD card slot and a MicroSD card slot, it makes a great companion for your XPS. You can use the Juiced 5-in-1 to pass through USB power if you have a capable adapter, or you can continue to use the Dell Power cable. I'm personally thinking about having one for work and home it's such a nice little piece of hardware. The Space Grey isn't an exact color match for the Dell, but since you rarely have it connected while the notebook is closed it doesn't really matter. Only wish Item I would have is if Juiced made their little piece of hardware a bit more dense, it feels a little hollow and plasticky even though it is metal. One additional comment, if you're charging through it, it will get warm, some additional use will need to see if that's a problem over the longer term.
