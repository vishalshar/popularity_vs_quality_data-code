I'm very excited about my new sprinkler system! It works great, BUT THE INSTRUCTIONS LEAVE A LOT TO BE DESIRED! I followed all the directions, but there was no way to connect to wifi (instead of Powerline) without the help of tech support. I spoke with a very nice person who apologized for the poorly worded Start Up guide.I absolutely love controlling my sprinklers from anywhere. Once I've watered my lawn thoroughly for a bit I will switch over to smart watering.Two thumbs down for the instructions. Two thumbs up for the product & tech support.
