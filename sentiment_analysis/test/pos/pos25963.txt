awesome; would not want to be without this - I bought two so both my sons could go wireless.  It's so much better not to have a cord.  They can stand up, walk around the house, and practice wherever.  I also bought it for performing.  I would use this for the street, or small venues.  The range proved good to at least 50' in my residential area before it started to cut out.  But with a clear line of sight it will go farther.  For me, the value is being within 20' of the amp.  I can see the potential for interference in some environments.  I've had one of the two cut out on me.  My son said one cut out on him as well. I've done live sound engineering on a pro level and I would be skeptical that this would replace a Sennheiser bodypack and transmitter that costs three times as much, but who knows?  If you get away with it, you get away with it.  Based on my experience, I wouldn't risk it if cutting out would be a big deal.  The Sennheiser (EW G3 series) has proven itself to me in live sound for many hundreds of hours.  If I were to try the G10 it wouldn't be at a big venue.  I think it could work if you had the receiver on the stage end of the snake, and there wasn't interference.  I've used the Sennheisers at the FoH mixing desk with no snake, but for a lot of medium and large venues that would exceed the range of the G10.  But if you just want to be free of the cord on your instrument, or the worry your 1/4 TS will get pulled out of your bass and blow-up the double-stack of 4 x 12's, then get one of these.  The auto-muting feature works great.
