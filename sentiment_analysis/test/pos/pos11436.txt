This is a review based on first impressions. Took a few minutes to get it out of box and set up. Did an initial flight check" seems to be very straight forward.Will edit and add more information once I get more experience. The only negative that I see right off the bat is that the prop guards have to come off if it is to go back in the case. Seems like no big deal, but you have to remove the motors to install them. So it's a hassle.
