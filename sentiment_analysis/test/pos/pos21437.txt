I received my case today, a day later than the promised arrival date but I'm not going to have a conniption. It's the product just as advertised. My previous Rokform iPhone 4S case held up beyond my expectation and I foresee that in this new case as well. Very sturdy build. I love that they include a new cushioned/soft backing on the interior of the case so the plastic doesn't scratch the aluminum phone housing. It looks really cool and my friends refer to it as the "Spider-Man" case.
