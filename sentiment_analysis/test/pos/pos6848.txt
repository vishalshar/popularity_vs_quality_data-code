This little stove not only met but exceeded my expectations.  It weighs about as much as a standard Benchmade Mini-Griptilian which for a multi-fuel stove is amazing, it also folds flat so it doesn't make much of a print and is pretty much stowable anywhere. The Fireant's biggest attribute is it's versatility in that it is a multi-fuel compatible stove, you are able to use solid fuel tabs such as Esbit/Trioxane bars, I have an Esbit alcohol burner and it works perfectly by locking the rim of the burner to the top slots of the Fireant, and obviously it burns wood.  Really it is a firebox stove that you will be able to use if there are fire restriction in effect so its kind of an end all be all solution.  Using the Fireant with a wood as fuel surprised me in the fact of how efficient the stove not only burned the wood down to ashes but how well it transferred the heat up to the cooking vessel, I was able to bring water to a boil faster in cold conditions using kindling sized wood sticks than I was using either the compressed fuel bars or the alcohol burner in moderate conditions.  It is simple to get your fire going with very little tinder and kindling and once you have a nice bed of coals you can start feeding bigger fuel wood through the side port.  The titanium takes on a beautiful anodized color with use, and it also cools down quickly which is great for day hikes when you just want to cook up a quick meal or beverage.  The only negatives I can think of are that if you're using wood you do have to tend the stove a little bit but really you should be tending any fire you make.  Sometimes with really dry seasoned wood the fire trickles down the fuel wood when your are feeding it from the side port but it helps if you keep the port door pretty full.  If you are like me though tending a wood burning fire is part of the outdoor/bushcraft allure and I find it relaxing.  The Fireant is also really compact so I is not the best solution for cooking/boiling for more than two people.  I am very satisifed with the performance of this little stove and for backpacking/hiking trips it is a perfect companion. It is also made in the USA and that means something to me.
