My kids LOVE this game! My 12 year old did not want to play at first thinking it would involve too much thinking and be too hard to play. I convinced him to play and now asks all the time to play. It can go quick and last minutes or it can go on and on. If it goes on it's almost like a race to the finish line. Fun family game.
