This is a great product if you're travelling internationally and want to be connected. I used it so far in the US, UK and Sweden with great 4G network connection. The cost is about 50USD/Gigabyte data. Not sure how it works, but no additional sim cards required, easy to top-up if you need more data via their homepage. Highly recommended.
