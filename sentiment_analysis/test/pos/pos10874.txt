Cozmo is everything that I imagined it would be. It is a fun, little AI bot that makes you feel like your dealing with another sentient being. Whether it be recognizing you by name or pouting after losing a game, Cozmo brings a unique personality to the table. Since this product was just released the features and games are somewhat limited. I can easily envision how this might lead to sudden boredom for some people. I believe Anki will continue to build upon Cozmo's features to make it more dynamic. Cozmo is a crowd pleaser for all ages.
