I had planned to use this under my desk in my home office but that didn't work; my knees hit the drawer bottom.  I moved it to the living room where I watch TV and it worked perfectly.  The rubber disks to stabilize a chair weren't needed for a chair but are perfect for the front of the cubii.  Now it doesn't slide on my hardwood floors.
