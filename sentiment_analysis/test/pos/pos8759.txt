I purchased these wipes for my husband. He goes golfing early morning and then heads to the office. He doesn't have time/or a place to shower so I bought him these. He really likes them. They are not very fragrant (which is good because he doesn't care for smelly things) and they fulfill their purpose well. We will be purchasing more when he runs out.
