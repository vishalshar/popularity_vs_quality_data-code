Why didn't anyone think of this sooner?! I love this case. Initially, it didn't play nice with my clear skin. I use the somewhat "grippy" vinyl skins  (bestskinsever) and the slider didn't glide well over it so I removed the skin and replaced it with a tempered glass screen protector. That solved that issue for me. The rubber case itself isn't the best and it isn't the least bit pretty but I imagine that will improve over time with subsequent releases. It's EXTREMELY flexible and won't provide too much protection for the phone but I'm so tickled with the camera coverage and I'm so careful with my phone, I don't mind it much. I look forward to seeing this product evolve!
