I bought this for my wonderful girlfriend who has ADHD and loses or forgets her keys on a regular basis.  We tested it in her apartment, and I hid her keys in obnoxious places and we found them every time.  I love that there is also a proximity function that allows for an audible signal when the device and the phone it is paired to separate by more than a given distance, so my companion, who Never forgets her phone, will never forget her keys.Performs as expected and more.  Great little device.
