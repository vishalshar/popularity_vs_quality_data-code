I have been going back and forth between the Wahoo iPhone 5S case and the Quadlock iPhone 5S case.  I have the Wahoo case for iPhone 4S but obviously I can't use it now.  I loved my Wahoo case for the 4S and was very satisfied and I was very close to purchasing the new Wahoo case for iPhone 5S, which I am sure I would have been completely happy with.  However, I took a chance on the Quadlock and I am VERY HAPPY with my decision.  The case is super slim and I can use the iPhone screen which I prefer over the screen protector the Wahoo case has.  I love the lock feature on the QL and stays in very stiff.  I used the bands to hold it down and they are very sturdy.  I cannot rave about this case enough.  I can use the apps without lag, pause workouts and pull over and take a phone call, where the Wahoo case is a little bulky.  I am definitely going to invest in the arm band and purchase a secondary QL case for my second bike, because I am too lazy to switch it over from bike to bike, but it will be worth it.  I am considering getting the universal attachment to put on a Lifeproof Nuud case....it seriously looks promising.  If you are a Wahoo fan and you want to get the Wahoo case for iPhone 5S do so.  There are a lot of pros to that case, but if you are frugal or on a budget the QL case is the way to go.  I bought a used one with minor blemishes and it's completely worth it.
