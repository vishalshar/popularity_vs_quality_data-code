I live in a high rise in Chicago and was looking for something my bulldog puppy could use when I couldn't come home at lunch and/or when it is too cold to go for walks. It's been a total lifesaver! He was having some housebreaking issues using puppy pads (aka he would chew them up) and the pet loo has totally resolved that!To train him on it, I enrolled him in a 2 week puppy training camp here in town. The owner of the training facility said this is the best fake grass / puppy potty he has ever seen and will be recommending it to his clients. The tray beneath the fake grass channels the pee into the removable tray below. Would definitely recommend buying the powder that absorbs the pee and the enzyme and replacing every 2-3 days. (Any longer than that and your dog won't use it.)Training tip - If you are looking to train your dog to use this, contain him to an area with his crate and the pet loo with minimal "extra" space. Gradually increase the size of the area after the first few days. If your pup starts to have accidents in the extra space, reduce the extra space for a few days and repeat. Good luck!
