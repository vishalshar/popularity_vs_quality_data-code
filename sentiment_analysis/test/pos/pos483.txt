I've started using this a few weeks ago. I use this in a regular cat box and give it a stir a couple times of day. The cat likes it, it tracks a little outside the box, but my sheets don't feel like I'm at the beach like they did with regular scoop cat litter. My cat is 17.5 and tends to squat too low sometimes so this also does not stick to his butt.
