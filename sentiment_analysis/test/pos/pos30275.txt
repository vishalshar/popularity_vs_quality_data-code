It's a nice little secret santa gift if you have someone with a dog (or a lizard).  I cannot tell you how many times my family and I have argued over is someone fed the dog or not that morning, lots of calls to work.  It's pretty heavy duty and the buttons are tough, but the silver film that covers the front is just a tad cheap.
