I've certainly had better quality earbuds, but not for this price.  These are surprisingly high quality earbuds for the price. Sound is very decent, earbuds are very attractive, packaging is awesome and there's a case for storage.  Also very comfortable in my ear, I can wear these lying down on my side.  The only thing I can't comment on is longevity, only had these 10 days or so.  I've had many other earbuds that were great while they lasted, which was only a month or 2 max.  These come with a warranty and hoping they live up to my expectations.
