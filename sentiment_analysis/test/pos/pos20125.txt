I bought this as a gift for my brother and thought it was a great idea.  It arrived with mushrooms blooming out of the top of the package.  I couldn't give it as a gift when it was already blooming through the packaging!  Amazon sent an additional kit straight to my brother and I tried to grow mushrooms with the original kit.  No more mushrooms ever developed from the original kit and my brother told me months later that his kit got really moldy (but never grew mushrooms) and he had to throw it away.  Very disappointed and would never purchase this product again.EDIT:I wrote this review about a year ago. I recently contacted customer service again and they gladly (and quickly) sent me a new kit at no cost. I am happy to report that the kit has since been more successful in growing mushrooms than the other kits I had received! The company provides wonderful customer service and I would not hesitate to order more kits from them.
