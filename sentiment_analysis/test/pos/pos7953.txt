When I found out my corgi was allergic to grain, sweet potatoes, turkey, dairy, and peas I became worried I would never be able to find her a single food that would support her dietary needs. This food does just that! Being grain and potato free is a hard combo to find, but Great Life has it.FYI: The packaging is different than the picture shown. I've ordered it twice in the past 4 months and it has been two different packages.
