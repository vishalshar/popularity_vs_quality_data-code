I've had this in my new Nissan Frontier for a year now, it works great. I got the stabilizer & recommend you do the same. Its strong metal, one you get it into a perfect spot, just leave the middle clamp halfway closed and you can pull / push it over your lap when you are ready to use your laptop without fiddling with the adjustment clamps anymore. I researched alot of mounts, this one was a perfect choice. Anything cheaper is not worth buying.
