I've seen YOXO popping up everywhere lately, so finally decided to give it a try. Now I'm wondering why I didn't get it sooner! My kids (ages 4 and 2) sat and played with this box of fun for so long today! There are endless combinations of structures to make. It was so fun to see them try and figure out how to piece together the parts and create different things. Even the two year old liked it and was able to play along no problem!I highly recommend this kit, and I can't wait to buy more. Good thing Christmas is coming :)
