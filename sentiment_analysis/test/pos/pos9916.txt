These are tasty cookies made with super high quality ingredients. Yummy AND I can feel good about feeding them to my family.I made one bag with chocolate chips, and the other with dried cranberries and white chocolate chips. I added in a few tablespoons of honey also. I think the honey really helps with the consistency. Or you could try molasses. They give you dairy-free and vegan directions on the package so I can make these for my friends who are gluten-free and vegan. I'm looking forward to trying their other baking mixes and flour. I think I'll try their scones next.I also like that Bona Dea is a socially conscious company. I buy from businesses I believe in. More than just a cookie!
