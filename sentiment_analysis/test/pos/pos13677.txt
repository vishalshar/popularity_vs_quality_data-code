I would give 5 stars but I had to correct shoddy assembly practices for the unit to work properly. My first use revealed that it would not heat beyond 144.5F. I tried increasing the set point, as others have suggested, but nothing changed. Here's the solution:Remove the silver housing to expose the heater coil and thermocouple (tc).Make sure the tc is not clamped to the heater at the bottom of the tc. This causes the tc to shut off the heater prematurely.Loosen the hose clamp and reposition near the top of the heater. Gently bend the tc away from the heater so there is no contact when you re-tighten the clamp.Now the tc will read the water temp instead of the heater temp.
