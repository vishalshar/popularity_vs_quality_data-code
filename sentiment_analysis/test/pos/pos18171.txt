One of the best carry on suit cases on the market.  I travel every 10 days to Europe and back to the U.S. and was looking for a carry on that functions as mobile office infrastructure while waiting for a connecting flight at an airport.  I love the 2 USB chargers that allow me to charge my phone and iPad at the same time.The design looks great and it's perfect size as carry on on all airlines worldwide.  Some European low cost airlines are very restrictive with their hand luggage policies, but I was never running into any problems with my bluesmart.Also the tracking option is very helpful.  Two weeks ago I traveled to Rome and checked in my bluesmart suitcase.  When I arrived at Fiumicino airport my bluesmart was not on the luggage belt.  After 30min. I used the track function and noticed that it was still on the other side of the airport close to the gate where our airplane was parked.  I went to the Alitalia lost luggage counter and showed them the bluesmart app and location where they lost my luggage.  They sent someone and within 20min. my bluesmart and I were reunited.I would like to refer to the review of Adam Lake.  He is posting photos where he is trying to put big boots into the bluesmart suitcase to show that it is too small.  Please allow me the following comment:  The bluesmart suitcase is not made for adventure backpacking travel.  It's made for business travel and people who want to be independent from airport or train chargers.  I always pack one pair of running or dress shoes, 5-7 Italian shirts, underwear, socks, 1 pair of extra pants, and toiletries and my work out cloths (shorts and t-shirt) in my bluesmart and it fits perfectly - see photos below.However if I wanted to go backpacking in Latin America, I would not travel with my bluesmart.  I would leave my Italian dress shirts and elegant shoes at home and get hiking boots and a backpack.The mission of the bluesmart suitcase is business travel.  You don't need all these gadgets on a a hiking trip.I am very happy that bluesmart seems to be the first company in the luggage space that is innovating and shaking the industry.  Hope many others will follow.  But VERY GOOD JOB BLUESMART team!!!!!
