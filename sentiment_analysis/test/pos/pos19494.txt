I purchased this webcam/treat dispenser to check in on a new foster pup to see how he was faring in our absence, as we suspected separation anxiety. The Treat Cam arrived quickly, was packaged well. The process of setting up the Treat Cam, downloading the app, and syncing to the Treat Cam was surprisingly simple. 5 minutes tops! It came with a package of milkbones so there was no delay or struggle in dispensing treats.The camera image is clear. I was able to check in on our new pup and learned that he settled after a short period, and was not in distress as we had thought. Such a relief to see him relaxed!To dispense a treat, there is an icon on your phone that is the shape of a bone. You touch the icon and voila, out pops a Milkbone!The only drawback to the Treatcam is the chime that comes on when the phone connects to the Treat Cam. It startled our anxious pup from his sleep and there is not yet a way to disable or mute the chime. I emailed the Petzi support team about it. They responded quickly, and offered that a solution for this is coming to the app in a couple of months that will allow the chime to be muted or disabled altogether. Then it will be perfect.
