really surprised by the high quality of the materials.I really appreciate the clip in the middle that can hold your knees together. I didnt realize other people had that problem, but its really nice.I don't know why they market this as a posture improving device. This is a sit comfortably anywhere device.I have serious back problems, I get injections and many meds, but with this thing in was able to literally sit on a rock at a local park no problem.this is worth a try
