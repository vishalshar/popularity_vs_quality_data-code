A good extra boost that I put in my morning shakeology and use in addition to my prenatal vitamin. My doctor said I would need two packets a day to get the recommended doses of the two vitamins, and their are obviously tons of other stuff that is good to take as a supplement. It's not a one stop product. I'll post again if I get pregnant this month. Then, it may be a miracle booster.
