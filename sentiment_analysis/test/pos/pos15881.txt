I've been riding skateboards for 17 years now, but never have I been so comfortably stabilized on concrete before when attempting new tricks. When I was a teen, I remember dragging my board over to the grass to do that I wouldn't roll away. The SkaterTrainer 2.0 changed all of that instantaneously and they're still fairly easy to take on and off of your wheels.Even now, friends that have never been comfortable or have never even ridden a skateboard before, verbally stated that they instantly felt comfortable learning to hone their balance and master the board basics.
