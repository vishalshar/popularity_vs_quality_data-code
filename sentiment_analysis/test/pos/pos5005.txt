Purchased this feeder after purchasing two others.  I have a diabetic cat that I need to feed six times a day, two of them while I am asleep.  The two previous purchases I liked because they had ice compartments in the bottom.  My cat needs wet food because he is diabetic, the dry is not good for him according to the vet.  But, small compromise to make.  This feeder is the absolute best.  My smart cat knows there is food in the other compartments and spends time trying to break in.  The first one he couldn't get into, the top rotates to separate compartments, but he kept me up all night trying to get into it.  I kept hearing the feeder twang as he tried to break in.  The second one was so light (2 compartments) he pushed it around all night and could turn it over.  I had to tape ankle weights on the bottom of it so he wouldn't turn it over.  Again, he kept me up at night trying to get into it.  The design of this one rotates the bottom, not the top.  It is large enough that my cat can't push it around.  He does scratch at it but I think he knows he can't manipulate it in any way so he eventually gives up.  The added bonus is the camera.  The family has a blast watching him eat, we get notifications wherever we are and can pull it up on our iPhones, iPads, computers.  You can schedule many people at once to see his feeding not just one person.  We do not use the automatic voice pet caller (you can call your pet over to eat) because it would go off at night and the reason for buying is to sleep, not to be woken up.  This pet feeder is expensive but having already waisted money on the other two feeders, this has definitely solved our problems and so far is worth every penny!
