Very cool design, and a lot more fun then an electric Razor scooter. We have the Junior size also, my 40" tall 4yr old rides the Jr and my 48" tall 6yr old rides this regular size comfortably. The handlebars have a lot of adjustment for kids to adults. Also, being able to have this model change from the pumping action to just a flat board scooter is nice. **note the Jr size does not do this.Very happy with the purchase!
