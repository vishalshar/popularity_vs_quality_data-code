I was in the market for a new carry-on and was debating between a standard bag (like the my old Victorinox pictured here) or a smart bag. I opted to give the Bluesmart a try - I'm a sucker for good design and have been burned more times than I can count by airports with insufficient  outlets. The tracking and locking features were an added benefit, though I doubt I will use the scale often given the bag's size (more on that below). In all I'm really happy with my decision and think a Bluesmart should be a staple for all business travelers.QUICK WARNING: if you are a heavy packer or need a suitcase for long trips, this is probably not the bag for you (or not the ONLY bag you'll want in your arsenal!). If you are a savvy packer you may be able to fit 4-5 days worth of clothing, but it really is ideal for 2-3 day business trips or weekend travel. I recently used it over a 3-day weekend and had no problems. The bag is not significantly smaller than my Victorinox, but you do lose some space with the wheel design and the easy-access outer sleeve (which is a good tradeoff in my opinion).PROS:- peace of mind of never having to sit on the ground next to an outlet while waiting for your flight. 2 USB ports will make your travel companion extra appreciative- super easy access to your laptop, iPad/kindle, and other essentials. This is key for going through security and eliminates the need for a computer bag or backpack altogether- sturdy wheels - typically not a fan of bags with 4 external wheels, but these are designed well and protected by the bag itself- never have to worry about your bag not fitting in the overhead - something I sometimes ran into with my Victorinox- design is great. I got asked about it twice sitting at the airport- I've never locked my suitcase before but this bag makes it so easy why not? Can't hurt right? If someone really wanted to they could cut their way into the bag but I think this is meant to act as deterrent for an opportunistic thief- several built-in compartments make organizing easy, which is key for a smaller bagCONS:- You need to remember to charge the bag before the trip, which had not previously been part of my routine- For longer trips you need a different bag or learn how to get really creative. If you fill it to the seams it gets hard to remove the laptop- the app is not super intuitive the first time you use it, but easy enough to get the hang of- you can check this bag, but I don't think you'd want to do it all the time. It's ideally suited for the carry-on lifeOverall great bag that finally has all the features you've always needed but made due without. If you understand what it is you are getting you will not be disappointed!
