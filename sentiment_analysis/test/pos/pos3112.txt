LOVE this jacket.  I was supposed to get black but got green?  I'm okay with it though..I actually really like the green.  Have gotten complements almost every time I wear it.  The material doesn't seem completely waterproof, but I stayed warm and dry my entire time in Scotland and Ireland.  The sleeves could be a bit longer, which seemed to restrict mobility of my arms a bit.  All in all...I love this jacket and would definitely buy again.
