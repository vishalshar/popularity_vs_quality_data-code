This was a rough one.  Long story short; the product works great and as advertised.  BUT, for some reason, when I went to install the Pear software; it didn't work.  I had to remove the drive, and do some serious hacking in my Mac.  Life got worse as my Mac wouldn't restore properly from a time machine backup.  Then reinstalling the OS didn't work either.  An entire evening was spent on this.  Finally had to erase my hard drive and start from scratch.  Reinstall the OS, restore from time machine, reinstall missing software; then I could finally install Pear again; thanks to the superb help with Tardisk customer service.  10 minutes on the phone with them and all is well.  Couldn't be happier with the new larger hard drive my Mac is seeing.
