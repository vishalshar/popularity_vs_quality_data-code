This is a great GLASS bottle.  It's covered by silicone so that it's not so breakable.  I have to say, though, that the spout seems a bit more difficult to drink out of.  It's also a little on the heavier side.  I understand it is glass but some glass can be think (like the medical grade) and some bottlers out there have managed to use it.  This is, as said, a little heavier.
