Upon receiving my Mevo, I downloaded the app, synced the Mevo up with my iPhone and I was streaming within minutes.  I first used my Mevo to record a guitar lesson. It was pretty intuitive to get started and before my student arrived, I tested out Auto-Pilot which was super cool as you instantly get the effect of a camera team without anyone manning a single camera. However, in the case of the guitar lesson, I found it was better to give the control to my student. Within the app I simply set up three camera angles that gave shots of both hands together and each separately in order to capture specific techniques. From there, my student toggled between the shots, in real time, giving them close ups of each hand to give them the perfect practice companion (one that I wish I would have had growing up). As you would expect, the videos are super easy to share as well. The audio is totally satisfactory for my purposes, but if you want a mic closer to the source, I found that you can also use your iPhone microphone or, if you want to get fancy, you can use an external mixing board/mic to get high quality audio into your stream!
