As a homeschooling mom, I am always looking for fun ways to reinforce learning, especially when it comes to facility with numbers (something I lack!), so I was excited to find this cool new game for my son.  He is almost 13 and studying for the SHSAT for next October (2016) and this game helps with operational math (adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing) in a strategic way, with chance added because it is dependent on dice rolls... so we started to play, and it is really fun!  It is not hard to learn, but it's definitely hard to master!  This means it is challenging for everyone involved!  I imagine a younger less adept (math wise) student would also love it, because you can play without a lot of math chops or experience -- and you could even win that way (I do!) but as you play you are definitely increasing your ability to think mathematically.  So far, we have played five or six times since we got the game just two days ago.  That means we are playing repeatedly -- that is a great thing!  I am not asking him to play -- he is asking me!  I could not be happier, and I will be recommending this game to others on our homeschool listserv.My son says, "it's fun, interesting, and it makes me think!  I like it because my mom thinks it's a learning game, but to me, it's just fun."
