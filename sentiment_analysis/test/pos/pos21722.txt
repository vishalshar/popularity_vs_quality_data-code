When we want to give our dogs a longer lasting chew, bully sticks are just the answer, and its the dogs favorite treat.  In the past, Ive purchased a different brand, but after trying these, were making a permanent switch.  There are about 18 pieces per 14 oz. bag, and although the package says the sticks vary from 4-7, Ive found our bag has mainly larger sticks near the 7 range.  Theyre chunkier and meatier looking than the ones we used to buy, and our four dogs eyes light up when they see me reach for the bag.  Bully sticks have their own distinctive odor; these emit the same smell with no rancidity.  The dogs dont get these special treats often, but from the looks on their faces when they do, theyre well appreciated.  Pawluxury pizzle comes from various source countriesBrazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico or Turkey.  We have had no digestive problems when giving these sticks to our dogs.
