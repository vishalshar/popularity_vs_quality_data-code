I do not typically write product reviews but since this item exceeded my expectations I felt i needed too... For over a year I have wanted a pizza oven. I looked at building a brick oven and also looked at purchasing a $1700 unit. I decided on this one because it was cost effective and I wanted to see how i would like making pizza before i spent a lot of money. This unit is perfect! Last night i made my first 3 pizzas with no issues at all. I have a 4 burner grill and this fits perfectly on top. The instructions states to not close the grill lid but i did and it heated up in 15 mins!!! I highly recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a pizza oven.
