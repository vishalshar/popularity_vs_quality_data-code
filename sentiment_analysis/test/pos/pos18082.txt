This drive is super fast! I have an all-in-one touchscreen computer that has a 5400 rpm laptop drive inside. It had gotten so slow, even after de-fragmenting and fresh installing Windows 8, I was considering replacing it with an internal SSD. But they were fairly expensive.Then I came across this drive. It is much cheaper, per gig, than any of the internal SSDs I had found. It took some finagling, but I was able to set it up as a Windows To Go drive. The difference between the SSD and the 5400 rpm drive hosting Windows 8 is night and day.The USB3 cable that comes with it is quite short. :-/The one drawback I've had with the drive, which may be more of a computer issue rather than drive itself, is that when restarting the computer, it does not always get acknowledged by the BIOS. Since it is hosting the OS, I have to restart the computer a second time. After that, it has always been picked up on the second reboot. Thankfully, the drive is so fast, it's only a few extra seconds.
