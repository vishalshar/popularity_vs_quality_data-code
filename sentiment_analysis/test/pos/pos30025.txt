This is my first 3D printer so I can't compare quality, speed, etc. to other devices.  However, I'm quite happy with the quality and speed is largely limited by the filament and the object design, so a "faster" printer isn't necessarily going to do any good.I have about 50 hours of printing through the device.  I've learned quite a bit from trial-and-error as well as internet searches.  I've printed PLA and ABS and am looking forward to trying Nylon and other materials.  There's a lot of finickiness in 3D printing in general, but all of the print quality issues I've had have been resolved by adjusting settings."It's a 3D printer. It works for me and the price was right."
