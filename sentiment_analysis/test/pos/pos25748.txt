This is my mom's second Jitterbug phone. The original phone model was great, but this one is even better. The phone is heavier but not so much that it is cumbersome or oversized. The numbers and screen are much bigger. My mom loves that this has a camera and she can send/receive photos. Great Call has amazing customer service as well. Amazon delivery was right on time and perfect as usual. I highly recommend a Jitterbug phone for any older adult who wants to try technology (text and cell phone) but doesn't want anything complicated or unnecessary.
