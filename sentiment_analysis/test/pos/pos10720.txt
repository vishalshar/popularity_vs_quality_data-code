Hickies are a shoe lace system, instead of using traditional laces.  I am disabled from a stroke and have no use of my left arm and hand.  I have been using Hickies for quite a few years and totally love them.  With Hickies, I can wear regular tie sneakers instead of slip on shoes.  The Hickies expand/stretch very well.  I highly recommend them for anyone disabled or elderly.  Hickies help me maintain some independence.
