I live in a rural area, and keep a compost pile out in back. BUT, I don't like walking out to dump the scraps from the house several times a day. I was reusing plastic produce bags as compost holders, which was not a great system. Then I discovered these compostable bins. I LOVE THEM! They hold a fair amount of scraps, and are sturdy enough that I can go for a couple of days in the summer before having to dump them. And even if they're a little wet, a bit in the sun dries them out to reuse.I hope they come back in stock, and refills of bins only, versus the starter set would be even better.
