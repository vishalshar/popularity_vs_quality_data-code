This was a gift for my 11yr old son - and it is AWESOME! The whole family has the app on their phone so we can race :-) These are MUCH more sophisticated than regular r/c cars.....found the same item in Target for almost $80 and was going to pay that price! If you are looking for a fairly inexpensive, but WAY cool gift, this is it. You'll be the coolest gift giver around!The cars are extremely responsive and very fast! The range is exceptional as well. Very pleased with this purchase.
