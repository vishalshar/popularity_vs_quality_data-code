Facts: There are 18 pieces, three of each kind as listed on the back of the package.  I have attached a photo so you can see them,Pros:Makes playing with all three building sets (of which we own all of them) more interactive.Having a Hot Wheels track connector that fits to a Lego plate makes it much easier to attach Hot Wheels to any surface.  We had a few clamps that Hot Wheels designed for this, but they would only open up so much and were plastic and not all that sturdy.  Now the track can be attached to a base plate, and the base plate can be easily clamped using regular plastic clamps from the hardware store on both sides, making it far more sturdy.This greatly expands the possible types of construction that kids can make and leads to much more creative use of the toys.They fit the off brand Legos, Mega Bloks as well (tried it)Cons:The plastic is not the same quality as Legos, although better than the Hot Wheels.These are really expensive at almost a dollar per piece.  And your kid is going to want several packs (but may have a preference for a particular type depending on what they want to build).  Hoping they come in other assortments in the future.Left out one construction set type, Erector sets.  Would be cool to add another Lego brick with a flat part sticking up with two holes spaced for Erector struts.I am still giving these five stars, because they expand the play value of toys most of us already own.
