Dangerously good. I used to buy this at my local grocery store but they stopped carrying it. I'd go through a jar a week though, so my girlish figure isn't that upset about it. The crunch is awesome. Not very "sweet", but when youre used to it, you won't go back. Careful when first mixing the separated oil- it can make a huge mess.
