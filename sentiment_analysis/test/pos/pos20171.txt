Outburst, the NSFW edition! Tonally on par with games like Cards Against Humanity, but because it's Outburst the game play is far more engaging. The new categories are awesome!! The perfect game for a night in with friends, and such great timing as the holiday season heats up. I can't wait to keep playing and discovering all the hilarious Top-10 lists.
