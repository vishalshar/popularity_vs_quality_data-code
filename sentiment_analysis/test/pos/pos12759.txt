I took a chance, based on the mixed reviews and really like this scale. I got it on Cyber Monday, so the steep discount made up for the price, which I think is a bit high for any scale. I am getting consistent readings that seem fairly accurate for weight, body fat, bone, water, etc.  I am not having issues with obtaining a pulse wave measurement when standing on the center of the scale. I suppose if you have Sasquatch sized feet, there may be a problem. I typically weight myself right after my morning shower, so maybe my damp feet help in getting an accurate measurement?At any rate, this was a good investment for me as it allows me to monitor health measurements on a daily basis.
