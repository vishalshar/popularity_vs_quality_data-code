I bought this for my husband for Christmas,he needs some sort of sound or fan running all the time, and having a fan blow on you in winter isn't fun. When I first opened the package I was a bit disappointed and skeptical, it is tiny, I knew it was going to be small but not as small as it actually is, I thought to myself "there's no way this thing can be any good being so tiny" Boy was I mistaken, it cranks, so much so that I sometimes have to tell my husband to lower it. It's simple to use and has a great sound with a nice bass to it, on the fan modes you almost expect to feel some breeze coming out of it, it's that realistic. I love it and it isn't even my gift.
