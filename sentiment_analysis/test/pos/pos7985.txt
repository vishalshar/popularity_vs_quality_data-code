The strap is really comfortable, but sometimes no always as nice as I'd wish. It's really long even at its shorter setting and hangs low. The excess strap material also means that you have to finagle it into any camera bag you have and figure out how to fold the excess material. Detaching the strap is simple but then you have two small straps that hang from the sides flopping about. Best recommended use would be to use this strap for taking just your camera out and leaving the case behind or on you back. I'll use it, but may look for a second strap as well.
