This is my favorite baby "gadget" to date! As a busy mom of a toddler and 4 month old, propping a bottle is sometimes necessary. Not only does it free up my hands on occasion, my little one is already starting to hold it herself. I use Playtex Vent-Aire bottles and they are wide and an angled shape but this product still works well with it. The only catch with the angled bottles is that when it falls on its side, it's possible the nipple will touch the ground. I loved the hygienic aspect to this product, but you give that up with an angled bottle. Awesome gift idea, especially for a second born...
