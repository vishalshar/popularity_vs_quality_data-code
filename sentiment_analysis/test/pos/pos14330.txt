I love this thermometer. I got in early when this was a kickstarter campaign. The thermometer really is instant read which is so nice when you have a fussy sick baby. Being able to sync with your phone is also fantastic. It's hard to keep track of what the previous temperature readings were-- and not you can just look it up on your phone. This is my go-to baby shower gift!
