GREAT price!  Good quality.  The winding is smooth and the diameter tolerance is good.  I've used a lot of this in my Zeus and it has been very consistent.  They have it tuned perfectly for their machine, and of course it works in many other printers.  They have a good library of colors which is helpful.
