This wallet is very well made and holds everything I need to put into it.  I've tested and confirmed that the RFID blocking works as designed.  I am very pleased with this wallet.  I carry the wallet in my front pocket and it fits well in most of my pants.  Only suggestion would be to make a wallet that is maybe an inch smaller in width to fit better in the front pocket of jeans.  My jeans are a little more form fitting and I like a smaller wallet when wearing jeans.  Not a complaint, just a suggestion for a future design.  This is a full size wallet, but slim when folded.  It's very well constructed and it looks very nice.  If it's good enough for the military, its good enough for me!!
