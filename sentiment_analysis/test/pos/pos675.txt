I received this scale as a wedding gift after adding it to my registry and I absolutely love it. I had the older version so I knew what I was getting into with Withings. Their ecosystem for tracking your health is fantastic. I love that it integrates with My Fitness Pal to help track the food intake portion of your health and diet. The app that goes along with this scale is fantastic and I love that I can just step on the scale and have my weight and body composition tracked and stored automatically in the app for future and past analysis. This is a great tool to help you transform your body. As with any EMI body fat measurement, you must be consistently hydrated and try to weigh in soon after reaching your hydration baseline, but this scale makes it easy and fun. I plan to use Withings products for years to come to help me achieve my overall fitness goals.
