I personally am pretty lazy and donÂ’t like going out of my way to get tested.  This is a very convenient way to do it. It feeds my laziness.  It comes in the mail and you can do it in like 5 to 15 minutes, depending on fast you can read directions.  It was pretty easy to use and the directions were quite clear.  Quite frankly, it is pretty nice to be able to test at home with my partner and get results online. No looking for parking at a clinic and no waiting room boredom.
