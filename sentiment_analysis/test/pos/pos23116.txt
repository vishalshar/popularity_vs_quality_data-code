I have the big LectroFan and still use a Marpac sometimes.  This thing is amazing.  It's like a James Bond device, way smaller than I imagined and it cranks out the white noise almost as good as the big model which can block out anything.  I just hooked it up to my S6 Edge and played some tunes.  For a 1.5-2" speaker it's not bad at all.  It also has a mic and you can answer calls from it (haven't tested that).This is now replacing my big LectroFan for traveling, its so damn small, unbelievable.
