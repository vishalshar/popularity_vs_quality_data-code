As a long time smart watch owner, I've been VERY impressed with the Ticwatch 2. It's by far the sleekest and best looking smart watch I've owned so far, and the functionality is perfect for me. Already received tons of compliments and not a day goes by in which someone doesn't notice it.I chose to try the Ticwatch because I was never a fan of the Apple watch's square design. When I wore my Apple Watch I felt like I was wearing just a tech gadget (was never jazzed about the square look...), but the Ticwatch actually passes as an elegant timepiece.As for functionality, it does everything I need well. Run tracking, notifications, music, and a lot of watch faces. But by far, I'd say what made me a fan is the look. Highly recommend.
