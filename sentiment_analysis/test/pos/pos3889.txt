The Seek Thermal camera for iOS is really cool and works well.  Seek had some issue with Apple over the release of this camera, but they eventually worked them out and they started to ship in Dec '14.  The camera connects via the Lightning connector and can be faced either way, depending on how it is inserted. The Seek Thermal application is nice and easy to use.  The pictures you take are stored on your phone and you can see the thermal information in the picture.  I have used this to help identify some drafty windows that need to be caulked, as well as used it to check my furnace for air leaks.  The camera will quickly pay for itself in energy savings - as well as the geek factor.
