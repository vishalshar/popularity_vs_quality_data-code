I am conflicted on this review. It is really good and a little weak. Strengths: The case is very solid and sturdy (a little heavy if you are looking for minimum weight) which I like. The look is very professional and finished. Magnetic feature is so nice to have mounted in car and works great on my motorcycle as well. I would recommend the case to anyone and with the attachable accessories, I have the belt clip, you can handle most situations easily. Weaknesses: buttons are a little hard to use because they blend right into the design of the case. The kevlar piece of material is only attached to the metal with a clear adhesive sticker which is a little lame considering the amount you pay for this case, which is my next item. Cost is a little high for this considering my last comment and following one. The swappable adapter mount which is supposed to fit snugly into the metal rectangular cutout is loose and doesn't snap in. I am going to contact Rokform to see what they will do about it. I read a few other reviews who had the same problem so it appears to be a design flaw they have not fixed yet.
