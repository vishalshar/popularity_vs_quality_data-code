We had gotten this at Costco and my elderly mother in law just loved it - then they discontinued it.So, we were happy to find it on Subscribe and Save with Amazon! She will never again run out of her favorite lightly sweetened caramel corn as long as Amazon continues to carry it. If you have not tried this - try a bag. Lightly sweetened and just a light coating of caramel - just perfect!! :0)
