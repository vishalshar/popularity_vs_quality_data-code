My 18.5 yr old cat was having digestion problems and to not get too graphic was having a hard time going to the bathroom normally. After giving this product to my cat, he is now regular and eating normally again. He actually stopped eating normal meals for a couple weeks which was extremely alarming. Even boycotted cat food for awhile. Thankfully this product did the trick and helped his tummy! Thank you for creating it! I highly recommend!
