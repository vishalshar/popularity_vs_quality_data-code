Great pen, but has a bit of learning curve.  For all of those posting low ratings, it seems that you expected this pen to magically create all kinds of cool art.  It doesn't. What I truly believe for all of those using the pen who are frustrated, you didn't do your diligent research and review of the owner's information either online (FAQ's) or the operator manual.  Personally I have spent hours working with my pen and have made a lot of junk, with a few rewarding pieces.  That's part of the learning curve.  But I have had very few problems with the pen.  As an airbrush artist, I have noticed when I don't maintain the brush, then it does not work well.  Same with the pen.  Be patient and learn what the pen can and cannot do.  Take care of it.  Play it soft music.  Ok, maybe not music...but understand that I have had no issues to speak of other than maybe a filament that stops.  Guess what...the online manual or included manual tells you what to do.  No problems keeping this pen running if you follow directions.I attached a little bridge that I just put together last night...Not great, but had zero issues with the pen.
