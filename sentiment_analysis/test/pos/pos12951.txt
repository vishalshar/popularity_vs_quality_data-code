I was looking to replace our old Brita, which was so poorly designed that if you overfill the chamber then the water would overflow into the handle and just collect there.  I would have to empty out the filtered water from the Brita just to get that overflowed water out, and if I didn't then overtime the handle would turn all moldy and nasty inside.  THEN I BOUGHT SOMA, and life is good.  So well designed, even the way the water comes out of the spout is a welcome change from Brita.  The wood handle is a nice touch.  Overall a well designed product that is way better than the competition.
