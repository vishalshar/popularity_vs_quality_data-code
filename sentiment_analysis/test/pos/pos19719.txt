I'm the sensitive type, so, unfortunately, this too caused me eye irritation.  However, I am using it to cover stubborn grey hairs on my head (I'm otherwise light golden brown), as well as lightly using it on my brows and smudging it on purpose there.  I'm happy with the way it looks compared to other hair tints that don't blend well.
