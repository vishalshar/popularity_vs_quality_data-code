Got the Immunity formula a bit too late to help my kitty with breast cancer. However, I've been giving it to my 14-year-old male cat, as well. He has been jumping more easily, and his fur is soft and free of dandruff after less than 2 weeks. Hopefully this will help him continue to be the picture of health for a very long time. He's about 18 lbs, so one package will last a good while. The included scoop is handy, but you kinda need to guesstimate for smaller animals.UPDATE ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1/22/2016I've been continuing to give this to my cat daily. His fur is even softer. Dander is minimal, and his eyes are clear and bright. He has begun chasing his tail again, which he hasn't done in years. He's much more energetic and playful. If I didn't know better, I would think he was a much younger cat. I will continue to put this in his wet food, and reorder when I run out.
