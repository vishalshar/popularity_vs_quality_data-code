Pros: Very great ergonomical grip and the strap mount is awesome for a quick put away or POV angle on my camera bag.  The strap mount also has a very tight grip when screwed onto a strap.  The grip also floats well and the detachable compact grip comes in handy. I don't have a Wi-Fi remote to use with my grip but it would be a very nice addition to this grip.Cons:  The bottom of my grip doesn't stay completely sealed in water.  The first time I went swimming with it water leaked through the bottom seal, I did not have anything in it when it did but I know now not to use the storage when swimming.  Also the grip floats but not that great compared to bobber style grips.  There is no specific slot for an extra battery.  Either you put the battery (hero4) in one way and it slides around or you put it in another way and it gets stuck. I didnt get a chance to try with the older batteries yet so that will be updated later.  Finally the only con I have for the Strap Mount is that the screws are WAY too long.Overview: This combo offers a completely new and unique mounting system for your action camera.  The grip itself is very comfortable and convienent and makes for an awesome stabilizer.  The storage compartment is a great idea but it just wasn't executed all that well.  The Strap Mount is a great companion for quick mounting options, the only down fall is the ridiculously long screws. All in all I really like this combo a lot and I'd recommend it to other action cam junkies.
