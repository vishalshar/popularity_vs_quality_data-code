I bought this to have on hand for miscellaneous repairs, and finally got to use it for the first time yesterday! I fixed a toy front-loader that my son loved to pieces, literally. I followed the instructions on the package, let it cure for 24 hours, and today the piece that had separated is very securely glued right back on the body of the toy. Really easy.Two notes: 1. These mini-packs are VERY mini, which is good if you have a small project like mine (I used one packet, and there was no waste). 2. The package states that the expiration date can be extended by putting it all in the refrigerator. I did so right when I received them, as I wasn't sure when I'd be using them. Unless you have a backlog of many projects, I'd buy in small amounts. My expiration date says August 2015, which is about one year from when I purchased.
