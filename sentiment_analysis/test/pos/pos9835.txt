I have been using Solscense for awhile now.  I chose it because I have been trying to lessen the discoloration and fine lines on my face and my very expensive anti-aging treatment was not making any difference.  I am happy to report that Solscense did the trick and my skin looks better than it has in years.  I love this cream.  I use it every morning and every night - a little goes a long way.  Not only does my complexion look MUCH better, but my face looks and feels dewy and radiant.  I have also started to use it on my chest and hands as I have started to notice sun damage there.  All in all, a great product!
