I have a dog with renal failure and she needs the highest of nutrition.  Stinks to high heaven but she gobbles it up and she was refusing to eat at all.  She is never going to get well but she isn't going to starve to death now that she has this stinky stuff.  It is suppose to be of the highest nutrition quality to feed a dog.  It stinks but they love it.  I feed her it and a Tums and her phosphorus is in the normal range now.  SubQ fluids too.
