I bought this feeder so my dog can get his medicine at the correct time everyday while we might be away. It does cost more then other feeders, but no other feeders compare to what this one can do!!!  I have it set up so he gets fed at 3:00 since he needs some food before he gets his medicine. I love that I can then check from my phone to make sure he's eaten all of it before sending a automatic feeding to reveal his pill tucked into a treat. Im not only totally impressed with this invention, but the company as well!!!! I'm not very tech savvy and even thought the step by step directions were very easy, I couldn't get it connected to my wifi. I found a live chat on the feed and go web sight and chatted back and forth to try to resolve the problem. The person on the other end said they could call me and walk me through the steps. The person who called was actually the inventor/owner or the company!! The problem was my wifi itself and not the feed and go. He still walked me through my wifi setting so I could get the feed and go set and ready. Now thats a great owner of a company!!!! AWESOME customer service and an AWESOME product!!! It has so many cool features and well set up web sight. YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!
