We play with the extra green card as a "Seance": Everyone alive closes their eyes. Person playing seance opens their eyes and asks one dead player a yes or no question. The dead player answers with a thumbs up or thumbs down according to what they experienced while alive (can't give away witches they only learned about after they died). The player performing the seance can obviously lie about the answer, but everyone will hear the question and know who they asked. They might, for instance ask if the dead player had a witch card. They might ask if so-and-so was a witch. etc. Works best in 5+ player games where there's usually a dead player for a good portion of the game.
