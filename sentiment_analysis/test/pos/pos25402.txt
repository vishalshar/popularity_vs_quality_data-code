A lovely, silky cream that's non-greasy with no offensive odor.  I highly recommend it as an all-purpose moisturizer.  I have areas on my face with large pores and it doesn't clog them at all.  I put it on at night and my face is very soft and bright in the morning.I did have a little problem with the seller emailing me twice, once before I'd even received the cream and again about 2 days after I'd received it. Unfortunately, I found this to be intrusive. However, after posting this review, I received a message from the seller that they were going to issue me a full refund for the product due to this inconvenience.  I asked them not to because the cream is so excellent I wanted to pay for it.  This is customer service above and beyond.  I highly recommend the cream and the people who distribute it.
