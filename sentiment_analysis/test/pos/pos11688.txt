My kids love them and I'm very happy with the ingredients but they are so messy, my kids hands are always covered in sticky dark goo so I really don't like them eating them unless i have a wipe ready or we are outside but the mess is only a one wipe deal. Otherwise they are great for kids who need extra greens hidden in their foods.
