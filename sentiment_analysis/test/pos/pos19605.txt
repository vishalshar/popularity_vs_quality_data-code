This might be long review but I hope it will help you. I bought the Nextbit Robin on Saturday, May 11. It was on sale for $299(great deal). It got here on Monday and was working great. After an hour or so, I clicked the button to update the robin to 6.0.1(it is a big update and make sure you do it). It was going great but it was taking hours. I contacted Nextbit support that night and they said I was stuck in a boot loop. They tried a couple different ways to get me out of a boot loop, but nothing would work. They gladly sent me a RMA label. I just sent it back and they are sending me a new Robin. There customer support was great. It was like when you walk into an apple store, but you're online. I can't really speak of the performance because I only had it operating correctly for an hour, but a snapdragon 808 and 3gigs of ram should handle almost every task. If you are worried about buying a phone from a small start up company--DON'T BE. Nextbit being a small company actually makes it a more personal experience compared to a big company like Samsung. One last thing, don't be afraid to buy this phone because of the problem I experienced. All phones can experience this not just Robin's. I will add more to the review once I get a new Robin. Hope this helped!#NextNow
