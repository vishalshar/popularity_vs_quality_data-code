Absolutely LOVE our Petzi camera system!  The ability to watch and dispense treats from anywhere is just awesome!  Makes another product I bought seem worthless.  The Petzi saved me an awful lot of worry for our highly people-needing cats while on vacation  and when it's simply been a long day away.  And they have actually started to like the force the treats shoot out at.  They block it with their bodies to avoid having to share at times.  Set on "auto",  I  think the infared comes on a bit early,  but basically it's perfect!
