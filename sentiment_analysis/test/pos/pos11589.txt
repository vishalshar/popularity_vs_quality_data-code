I backed this on Kickstarter long time ago. I gave it to my love one. So I had to buy another one. I use this for running and it so hilarious people will actually thought there is a bike behind them and scared the heck out of them. This thing works like a charm if you don't like to slow down during your run to avoid the crowds that blocking the path.
