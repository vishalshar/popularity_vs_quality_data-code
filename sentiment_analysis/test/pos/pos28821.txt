The concept is great. The size is perfect, but my Pet Loo leaks and makes more of a mess than before I had it. I wish there was a way to reach someone from Amazon to see if there is a manufacturer issue on this product. I didn't save the box so I am not sure I could exchange it for another since maybe mine is just defective.
