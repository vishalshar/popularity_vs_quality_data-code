I have a long history of anxiety and am just coming out of a pretty stressful few years of life.  I ordered Spire on a whim, hoping it would be even a little helpful, but knowing I could return it if it was a waste of time.  I have worn it daily since I received it which was 15 days ago.  I have found it to be extremely helpful for me.  It can be set to notify you through your phone and by vibration when your breathing patterns are tense, when you seem focused, when you're calm.  Not only is it important to know that you're tense, it's just as important to recognize the feeling of calm.  For me it has helped me begin to be mindful of both feelings, and to be able to break those tense moments by redirecting me.  An added bonus is the activity tracker portion so I know that I'm getting enough exercise in each day, an important part of managing stress.  I found Spire easy to begin using and continue using.  I did have a little difficulty the first day or so knowing I was tense but not feeling that Spire recognized it.  I contacted customer service by email and they were extremely helpful; all I needed was to adjust the location I was wearing my Spire and that took care of it.  I like mine so much I've recommended it to a friend and am considering purchasing another one for my teenager.  Thank you Spire!
