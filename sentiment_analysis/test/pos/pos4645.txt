The over all design makes it where you may not get the perfect viewing angle. BUT if you are like me and quick ease of use is your number one priority then this is the perfect car phone mount for you. With a quick slip into the holder you are good to go.  Would be nice to be able to adjust viewing angle based on car but that doesn't seem possible with out adding moving parts which would defeat the purpose and ease of use. Over all I love this  product and will buy another for other car.
