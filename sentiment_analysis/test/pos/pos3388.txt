We are loving our security system.  This was just to replace a camera we dropped from about 16 feet (and broke) during the initial installation.  We have not only enjoyed reviewing footage ourselves (and the ability to see what "really happened" between kids when they were out of direct line of sight, but the local police have been able to use footage taken in front of the house (i.e. cars driving by on the street) to help in aN ongoing homicide investigation.  All three detectives remarked on the quality and clarity of the feed as well as the ease of finding/obtaining the information they were looking for!
