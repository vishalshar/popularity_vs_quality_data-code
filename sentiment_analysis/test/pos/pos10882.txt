Have had them less than 24 hours but I'm giving this product a definite "buy."These really do stay in your ear.  I haven't exercised with them but that's not the reason I got them.  I have some doubts about them staying in my ear while jumping rope, but again I haven't tried that.I bought them because I often have one of my iPhone earphones in my ear almost all day, taking calls or listening to podcasts.  The typical battery life on a Bluetooth wireless earpiece is terrible, so I've chosen to stay wired.However, before I bought these, my earphone would often fall out when it was tugged just a little bit, getting caught on a zipper, moving too fast, catching the cord in my own hand, etc.  But these earbuds provide a great solution to that problem.  It takes a strong tug to dislodge these.  Or perhaps, more accurately, you have to angle the hook slightly to remove them, which you don't do with your normal everyday movements.If you're one of those who wears one earphone in your ear for much of the day, I think you'll really like this product.
