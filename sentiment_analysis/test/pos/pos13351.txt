Update: after 2 months, the credit card slots have loosened up just enough, cards slide in nicely. Still avoiding the top-most slot on each side to avoid bending any cards.After recently having a credit card skimmed I decided I should get busy and replace old decrepit leather wallet. Ive tried another leather wallet that my grandkids are supposed to fight over when Im gone - but that was way too thick. Also tried a tiny ID wallet, too hard to get the money out. Im definitely a bi-fold wallet guy.This wallet has a nice feel and a good size. Fits easily in front or rear pocket.Credit card slots are a little snug but I suspect they will loosen up after Ive had it a while. Possibly related to the tight fit, I noticed if I put a card in the top slot it will bend noticeably and would probably cause it to break. Luckily I only need 4 slots so Im avoiding the top slot on each side.Craftsmanship is excellent. Neat corners, clean stitching, looks great.Made in America is great!
