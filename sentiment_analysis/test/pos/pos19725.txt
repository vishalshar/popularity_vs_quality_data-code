After numerous suction mounts loosing their stickyness I wanted to go with a more mechanical mount.Thought I would try this one out. The connection to the CD slot is solid when engaged, but the surface area of the back of the cradle is not wide enough and my iPhone 7Plus wobbles a bit because it only has an inch of material supporting the back of it.I dont think that it would harm anything (other than when a phone is not int he cradle) to have the cradle be a bit thicker in width to allow more surface area contact with the phone.
