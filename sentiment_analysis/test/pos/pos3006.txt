I tried this on my trip abroad.  It works better than taking melatonin tablets by themselves.  I was able to fall asleep pretty quickly and did not feel groggy in the morning.  When I happen to wake up in the middle of the night, i had to take another half dose to fall back to sleep.  I recommend this product.  It would be better if the price was lower.
