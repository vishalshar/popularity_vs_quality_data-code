I've been a Canary owner for a couple of years now and this new Canary Flex has not disappointed.  It setup in minutes flawlessly with my existing cameras throughout my house and the picture quality is terrific.  The magnetic base is very strong so there is no worry of the camera being knocked off the base accidentally.  Its also very easy to place in many different locations given how small it is.  I worried about it initially but the battery life has been surprisingly long once you adjust the sensitivity to your specific needs and the location of the camera.  All and all Ive been very satisfied with the camera and its a great addition to my Canary monitored home.
