I was looking for a sturdy case that would clip to my belt securely, without needing a holster. I've had too many holsters break or wear out on me. I bought this one and orders a belt clip to go with it. It was easy to assemble, and the belt clip fit perfectly.That the case doesn't have a built in screen protector is bit of a drawback, but I installed one easily enough.It took some getting used to, having the phone facing outward, but otherwise it works great. I can access my phone easily, and clip it back when I'm done.Some people have complained about the silicon part stretching and not staying on the case, but I've only had it come off once.
