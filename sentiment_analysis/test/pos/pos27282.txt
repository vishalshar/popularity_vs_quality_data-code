I originally purchased the first generation pod tracker for my two dogs.  The units worked fine although battery life was short (about 3 days or so).  I upgraded to the Pod 2 and unfortunately had issues with the casing for both pods.  The case suffered cracking and splintering where the battery twists on.  I never had these problems with the first generation pods.  The material seemed to have a different texture from the first generation.  They did send me replacements and they also suffered from the same fate. Recently, they made changes to the pod (battery locking mechanism) and sent me replacements with the latest version.  I noticed immediately that the casing material seemed closer to the first generation and have had no problems to date (about 6 weeks so far.)Overall, I am pleased with the first generation pods and the latest revisions.  Customer service is outstanding.
