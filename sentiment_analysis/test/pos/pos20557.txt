Bought this for my wife to keep in the Tahoe.  We are surrounded by water here in the New Orleans area, and therefore many of our roads--including our most heavily traveled highways and even interstates--run over, under and alongside waterways, whether natural bodies of water or man-made.  And because of this we naturally have a higher-than-average likelihood that you could end up in water if you were to be in an accident.  And this is an extremely scary thought, because no one wants to survive a car accident only to drown afterwards because you can't get out.  Which is exactly what happened to twice, to two separate young mothers and their children.  This was a wake-up call for me, and so that's why my wife now has one on the sun-visor in her Tahoe.  And we also had a very serious family meeting with our 10-yr-old girl and 7-yr-old boy explaining exactly what to do if they are ever in an accident like this.  We went over removing seat-belts, getting prepared to exit ASAP, unlocking the doors by hand if they are shorted out by the water, as well as staying calm while waiting for the car to fill up before taking one last huge breath before breaking the window and swimming out to safety.  We even showed the kids how to use the seat-belt cutter and glass-breaking punch in case, God forbid, they should ever need to use it themselves.  I think this should be mandatory equipment that is actually "BUILT-IN" to all cars, not just cars for people that live and drive near water.  Because no matter where you live I'm sure you will be driving over, around or near water at least part of the time.  It's just a good piece of safety equipment, and it gives me piece-of-mind knowing it's there.
