I don't normally leave reviews, but this trap works great.  I have a chicken coop, a larger than normal one, and mice of course were eating feed, making nests, etc.  I couldn't use a poison or sticky trap, so I tried this.  A mouse every night.  I put it on the floor, near the wall, and attached a piece of plywood to the wall to cover the trap, as the chickens would sit on it, poop on it, etc., so it was protected.  Chickens didn't mess with it at all.  Even if they tried, they couldn't stick their heads in far enough to cause them any harm.  This is a great item if you are trying to get rid of mice in a coop, barn, etc.
