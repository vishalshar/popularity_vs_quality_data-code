As an owner of the LTE Galaxy Nexus I was extremely disappointed with the OEM Car Mount available from Samsung and Verizon and went on the hunt for another in-car mounting solution.I am so happy that I stumbled across this product. The construction is very sturdy; the operation, simple; and the mounting solution elegantly ingenious.The design allows for quick insertion and release from the dock. Press one button and the arms pop open, then close in a balanced manner (both arms move the same distance when closing) insuring that your phone will be centered on the dock. Soft foam supports on the sides allow you tightly grip the phone (mine fits easily with a hard-shell case left on) without putting undue stress on the phone or support arms, and the space in the arms and the bottom support are great for cable management.If you don't have access to a true "Dock" for your device (one that triggers a Car Mode), I could not recommend this mount more!
