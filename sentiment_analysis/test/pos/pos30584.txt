I live in a very remote area in the CO High Country. Initially, there were a couple things about the Whistle service that I wasn't a fan of (monthly fee & the frequency that I received updates), but after my dogs took off today and I found them in less than 30 minutes, I felt like I should leave my 2 cents.The monthly fee isn't bad, but the description on the PDP wasn't quite clear. They should fix that.Regarding the frequency that I receive updates, when in tracking mode you get them roughly every 2-3 minutes as opposed to 30 minute updates when in the whistle zone. The short-interval updates were awesome when I was looking for Fenway. She's a runner, as evidenced by the tracking record attached.I got within yelling distance, called them for a bit, turned around to get closer to their last known location, and they were trotting down the road w/ huge grins on their faces. I might get a second one, but this setup should work nicely. If you have a dog that runs and is stubborn, this product is fabulous.
