This is an awesome speaker.-It talks to tell you when it's powering on and off or to tell you the status of the battery-Battery lasts 40+ hours-Really strong if you get the $230 version with the hard case, you could drop this thing out a window and it wouldn't break-Awesome sound quality, at full volume someone thought it was the home speaker setup from our TV!I shopped around a bit before making a purchase and I'm glad I picked the Fugoo!
