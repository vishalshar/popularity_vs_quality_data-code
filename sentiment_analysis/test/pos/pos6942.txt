Aside from swing analysis video this is the best way to see and improve facets of your game. The visuals and statistics are revealing and as helpful as any a PGA pro would get (there are a few subtleties like putting distance and creative use of clubs). I would like to see updated aerials for the courses, I suppose newer course are more accurate. Post round editing endures accuracy of your round (signing your card). Posting, following friends and see how others play a course are just a few things that will send your enthusiasm for golf through the roof!!!
