I like it, I wanted to love it, but it's not perfect though probably still the single best car mount I've tried to date, and I've tried a LOT.First off, there is a lot of focus on how great of a grip this thing has and does but only if you understand how to set it up correctly before using it with a phone. The instructions are pretty slim but the "trick" for it to hold in place and not fall off after the first usage or first hot day is to wet the suction cup of the mount and the included mounting plate, set it and lock it down how you want it then don't use it or touch it until the next day. Failing to do this will ensure my results are repeated and your phone while attached to the mount will go tumbling off at a really bad time while driving and pose a safety risk.I recommend specifically to apply the mount in the evening while the sun is down or setting as doing so when it's a hot sunny day will also result in it just falling off before you even use it.As long as you wet it and set it while it's not super hot and let it dry in place over night, it'll hold very well and never come off while in use and driving and also hold tight on the hottest days of the year.Understand that gravity and the cars vibrations while driving are your enemy with this thing if you are not aware of it's weaknesses. There are thumb screws on multiple points for this device. One to lock it into place for the length position another one on the side to lock the vertical position one to lock in the "feet" that hold the bottom end of your phone in place and one at the back of the phone holder part to lock in the position of the screen when attached. Any and all of these will fall out and be a potential pain in the rear to put back correctly if you do not crank them TIGHT into place once you have everything positioned how you want it. I would even recommend using some Loctite to secure the thumb screws in place while still being possible to break lose would you need to.As long as you understand some of the areas that can pose a challenge and are the cause of others complaints in their reviews and address them up front, its really an awesome solution that really should work for nearly all cars and configurations.
