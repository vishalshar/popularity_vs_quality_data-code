I bought these Hickies for my son, who has been wanting them for what seems like forever!  He picked the color and everything, but when they arrived they didn't work with the weird way his current sneakers lace up.  Bummer!!  When they arrived they came in a nice plastic container that fit the 14 Hickies perfectly.  There are some vague directions on the back, but honestly they weren't all the hard to figure out; if you can lace a traditional sneaker lace, you can work with these Hickies.  If you find you need a little help, you can just hop over to their website and there are guides there too, so don't despair.  Not wanting to send these back, I figured I would pop them into my sneakers with a traditional lacing set up.  I have pretty big feet for a girl, but despite other people complaining about them being far too tight I wanted to check them out!  I have 7 lacing holes in my sneakers, but I never use the top one.  I laced the first 4 Hickies according to the directions, but wanted  a little extra space on the 5th and 6th holes. I got a little creative on those, I laced the Hickie through the 5th holes and left it, then laced one the opposite direction through the 6th holes, from there I connected the Hickies on the outside of my sneaker.  See the photos below.  I have to say that these are very comfortable. I don't find them too tight or even too loose where I went rogue.  I like them a lot, I just wish they offered larger sizes for the non traditional lacing situations.
