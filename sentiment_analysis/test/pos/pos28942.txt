When this arrived in the mail I felt I wasted money on a silly gimmick.  And while this is definitely not for everybody, if you need to measure a lot quickly, this measuring tape will help make the entire process easier and faster.  I work at an art gallery and the process of hanging art (measuring, writing down measurements, and doing quick mental equations) is tedious to say the least.  This product is intuitive and takes out a lot of the headache by simplifying the entire process.This measuring tape is easy to use, does everything it says and works well.
