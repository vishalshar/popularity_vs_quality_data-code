We got this bike for our 4.5 yr old and it is as great as we'd hoped it would be based on reviews.  He had outgrown his 12" and the local bike store fitted him for a 16" which he really struggled with.  Returned it and bought this one in a size 14" for half the price.  Although the bike weight is almost the same, he can maneuver this one so much better because the sizing is so much better for him.  Yay!  Love that it has a hand brake as well as the foot brakes, love the tires.  Love everything about it in fact.  EXCEPT, just in case someone from the company reads this, how many 4.5 yr old boys want to ride something with ROYAL BABY written all over it???  The branding is literally on every part of the bike, even on the treads of the tires.  I'm going to try to take care of some of it with a Sharpie and the rest I'll cover with stickers.  It's a fantastic bike but I do hope they'll get feedback on this and make the branding more subtle!(sorry - I apparently was reviewing this under the red 18" bike because I'm considering buying it for my daughter!  This review technically applies to the green 14" but I can't seem to edit that!)
