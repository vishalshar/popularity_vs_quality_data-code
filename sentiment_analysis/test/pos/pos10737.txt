I'm addicted! These are so delicious! And at only 15 calories, and 100% made from whole, nutritious foods, they're completely guilt-free! I pack one or twi everyday when I go to work and they're the perfect snack to help me keep my appetite in check between meals. They're naturally sweet and they don't taste like dirt the way some health foods do. Will definitely buy again!
