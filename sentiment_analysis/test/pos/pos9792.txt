As good as or better than Gen 1  units costing a lot more.  Easy to set up and very useful.  I cn't match the advertised range but I can see my neighbors horses at about 600 ft.  Not as horses but as large heat sources.  At about 400 ft I can see that they are definitely horses.  Well worth the money.  I bought it as a toy but it has really turned into a tool.
