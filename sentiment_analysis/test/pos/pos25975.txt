I received my MOD-t a few months ago and have been thoroughly enjoying it. Set-up was super easy. I was printing my first object in 30 minutes. By the end of the evening, I had successfully printing something from the New Matter store, something downloaded from Thingivese, and even something I extruded into 3D from a custom Illustrator file. Since then, most of my prints have run successfully and without incident. The nozzle did clog a few times, but it was fairly easy to unclog.The only significant issue I ran into was when a small piece of filament clogged the nozzle and I couldn't dislodge it. But the support team was GREAT to work with. We traded a few troubleshooting emails, but none of the suggestions worked. So, they suggested we do a Skype call and they could walk me through disassembling the head unit. The tech walked me through everything step by step, and by the end of it we had successfully cleared the nozzle. Then I was back to printing fun, cool stuff.Because of the nozzle issue, I would have given it 4.5 stars. But my overall experience with the MOD-t has been much more 5-star worthy than 4-star. That's why I gave it the rating I did. I would definitely recommend the printer for great casual, home use.
