Setup wasn't as easy as I expected (I have a moto x). I had to make sure I wasn't around any other bluetooth equipment for it to work (that is my guess anyway). But eventually I was able to get them setup, the first one had the biggest issue (I have 4 of them).  I really like how I can expand my network by just adding another luma devices.  I had originally pre-ordered the 3 pack and received those first and then received the 1 a few weeks later.  The luma app is pretty limited (but I expected that given it was just released).  The way I have it set up, is that I have the first luma plugged into my other wireless router (I just turned off wireless on that one). One thing I have noticed is it seems to take a decent amount of time between the handoff when you get closer to one luma your wireless device will still be talking to the luma that is further away for a while instead of the one that is closest with a better signal, hopefully that improves soon.  All in all, I would recommend them, they should only improve as time goes on!
