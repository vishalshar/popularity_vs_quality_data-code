We already own 2 yumboxes for my two older children, but my rising kindergartener makes things more complicated. He is 5 and has special needs. He will require some help when it comes to eating so opening/closing wasn't much of a concern BUT he is extremely picky and only eats a handful of things (outside of chips, pretzels, more chips and more pretzels...) I also needed it to all fit... easily... and go into his backpack that he indeed carries. Finally, I had to have a "hot"option that wasn't plastic. As far as healthier food groups that don't fall into "snacks" he will only (at this time) eat baked chicken nuggets, Chipotle (hilarious I know...) and his vegan nutritional milk. Fancy that? I am able to bake and pack his chicken nuggets in the thermos section, pack his nutritional milk and occasional Honest Kids juice in the side, some fresh fruit (yippee he eats a few of these) on top and still have a space for either a squeeze pouch or something crunchy such as veggie straws or cheese bunnies. I am a happy mama. We have only used this for 3 days now but so far, so good. I have a little protective pouch it sits in case of spills but so far, no spills... but I also don't pack any opened liquids. My only concern at this point: it is heavy... so when it sits opened, it doesn't sit quite flat. The kid makes it kinda rock back but we're talking a minimal amount AND my lip appears to be EVERY so slightly warped... there is a slight curve to the lid as it shuts BUT it does appear to be closed and sealed. I may try some liquids in there this weekend just to see how tight my seal is - but for my son, that isn't a concern.:) Way to go OmieBox! Now if only I had a secret compartment for ketchup...
