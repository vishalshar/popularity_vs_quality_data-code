Its a great toy for the pup, although our pup is a five year old Lab.  He plays tugg a war with his friends and this product held up. It does not fly a far as his frisbee but it floats in water.  I can see this toy lasting for a long time.  I just ordered another one for our other car so we always have it with us.
