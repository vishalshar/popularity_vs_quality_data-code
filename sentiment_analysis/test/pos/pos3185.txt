I was hoping I would be able to use one of these to find my car in a parking lot (as reviewers claim) but I can only see a spot on the map that is very broad (I already know the car is IN the parking lot).  You can't of course hear the finder beeping inside a car, so I have to rely on the map.  Someone mentioned having a direction would be helpful (a big circle on the map is not helpful).  Also having you get 'hotter' or 'colder' as you move towards the item correctly OR move in the wrong direction would be a  big help.Having just had a bike stolen from my garage, I was hoping to paste one under the bike seat as shown... but I can't imagine how that would lead me to the bike since the image on the map is not only dated (not real time, but last recorded place) but a broad broad spectrum.  To be honest I have not tried the 'find it' using anonymous blue-tooth.I do find for little things, like keys, it works great.  I synched my phone so I can go online and make my phone ring, which is nifty.  And if I lose my keys and find them instantly because of these tags even 2x a year, they are worth it.I like that I can change the battery.Because they only go a short distance (100-150') I could have gotten 1 finder, put onto my keys and synched my phone and been done.  I did sync a second tag and plan to put it into suitcase, or attach to camera or put into purse and hope that if I leave those things behind, I will be notified.  I've had it about 50' away in my kitchen while I write this and I keep getting alerts it is out of distance.
