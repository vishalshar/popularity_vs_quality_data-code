I'm a newly-minted family doctor with an interest in environmental health, so I love to see creative ways to educate the larger community about leading healthier, more balanced lives.  The design and interface are simple, polished and user friendly.  It gives more info (total VOC, CO2, PM2.5, temp, humidity and combined Air Quality Index) in one device than anything else in the same price range, and when I had a question the CEO, Jacques, emailed back within hours with a detailed answer.After the initial "learning" period of 6 days (during which the VOC, CO2 and PM2.5 readings become progressively more consistent) the Foobot seems to accurately trend all of the values it measures.  I have a formaldehyde meter set up close by and the Foobot total VOC value trends up and down in parallel with the formaldehyde meter readings, which is exactly what I would expect.  Temperature and humidity readings were accurate from day one.Keep up the innovation!
