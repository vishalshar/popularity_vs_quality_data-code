I received your chicken LifeBites last week and I just want to let you know that not surprisingly my cats love them - they love them as a meal - mixed in with other food or as a snack to hold them over.  I am so pleased with this product - I love that it's made with only all natural ingredients.  My older cat is overweight and this should help her to maintain a healthier life as she is not eating the canned food she used to any more.  Thank you for your thoughtfully produced Farm to Friend pet products.
