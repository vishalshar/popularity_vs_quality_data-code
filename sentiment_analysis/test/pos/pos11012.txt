I bought these for my husband and he LOVES them! They are durable and adjustable. Now only that, but he likes them so much when he comes home from work he puts them back into their case. Which is nice for me because I don't have a bunch of bent up collar stays all over my counter top. We threw all the other brand away. This was a great Christmas gift and I plan to buy some for my father & brother in law as well.
