If you or someone you love is into extreme sports you're going to LOVE this pogo stick.  It's not your average pogo stick - that's for sure.  It's got a height and speed advantage that will blow your mind.  The ability to control the air pressure used to create the bounce allows the user to learn at their own pace.  It's an amazing and unique gift.  When it's brought out for use there's always a handful of people who have never seen one before.  My son absolutely loves his.
