This product is very simple to use and works exactly as advertised.  My vet recommended it as a non-invasive and less stressful alternative to cystocentesis (inserting a needle into the bladder to withdraw urine).  The package includes hydrophobic (water-repelling) sand, a pipette, and a vial with a stopper.  The urine puddles on the top of the sand (rather than being absorbed by it like regular litter), so it is very easy to collect a sample with the pipette and store it in the vial for delivery to your vet.  If you have a large litter box, buy two bags since there is very little sand in each bag.  In order to collect a usable sample, the hydrophobic sand must be placed in a clean and empty litter box.  My cat's litter box measures 22"L x 17"W, and two bags just covered the bottom of the box with about a half-inch of sand.  My cat used it without hesitation.  The package did not include instructions, but I found a very helpful instructional video on the Kit4Cat website.
