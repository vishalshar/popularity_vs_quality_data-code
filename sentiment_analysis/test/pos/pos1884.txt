I suffer from chronic depression and anxiety, so there was no way I was not going to give it a try.I bought Thync a couple of months ago and have been using often (I am probably one of the first people outside the US to get it). Some weeks I use the energy strip everyday of the week before work and my day becomes more productive. I use the relax less often because the effect is not so strong, and there are great substitutes for the calm strip in the form of tranquilizers. But is is an option for people who dread taking pills, since it does have some effects. I didn't quite get the promise of "distancing myself from stressful thoughts", which would be wonderful, but at least the lack of tension in body stops reinforcing them.It is a good idea to tinker with it a lot in order to find the best application for you. For example, it suggests a range of 65 to 80% in the calm, but I only get benefits in the 44%-46% range, and it took a while to find out. Go figure. And ten minutes is not enough for me, it has to be 15-30 minutes. As for the energy, 10-15 minutes at the 74% is plenty. I don't really see any good alternative in the form of non-dangerous, non-addictive substances (though things like green tea help some people).Thync is getting a lot of negative reviews because the app is not available for android. That is a very fair criticism: some people felt ripped off because they just can't use it. It is a shame, since the star rating went down. Bad move on the manufacturers. I have a galaxy android, but fortunately my wife has an IPhone. I can't use without her help anyway, since it is hard to put the adhesive just at the right place without help.The other limitation is the limited life of the adhesives, and the need to spend money on then. That is more understandable, from a design point of view. If you have a band-aid, how many times will be able to re-use without losing stickiness? But most people can squeeze multiple uses of each strip, if they really try. I just bought 3 extra packs of energy.But the iphone-only thing was a big mess up. It was better to wait a few months before releasing.So thank you guys for inventing this stuff and giving non-chemical options for people! In the modern world, stimulants and relaxation can be a must, since there are so many demands, and our brains, as you know, evolved for hunter-gatherer life, not the modern life.Finally, I will go into a sensitive topic here... it does seem to help with depression, at least for a few hours, sometimes for a whole day, maybe even for several days, so if you are depressed give the energy a try, especially if you are having a hard time meeting the demands of your life when in a crisis. The company will not endorse this use, for legal and regulatory uses, but there is no reason the users cannot experiment. Maybe it will be sold this way after several years of doctors getting feedback, and eventually peer-review studies validating it (working double-blind studies with active placebo will probably be the toughest barriers). I understand their restraint, but give it a try!
