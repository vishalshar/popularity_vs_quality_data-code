I love this keyboard.  Before I purchased the Mionix Zibal 60 mechanical keyboard, I was using a Razer BlackWidow mechanical keyboard.  This Mionix is much more reliable as the Razer's shift key wouldn't register all of the time.  The Mionix requires zero software to get going.  The Razer has an entire software suite to download that runs in the background 24/7 to allow you to use all of the keys.  The Mionix is just a great keyboard that works 100% of the time.  I paid $130 for the Razer and got the Mionix for a mere $87.The back light glow is adjustable, and there is a setup to suit most people.  The USB port works great!  I love the wrist guard as it fits me just fine.  It stays locked very well.  I haven't had a problem with it since I bought the keyboard in November of 2015.  I can't find a complaint.Next upgrade will be a Mionix mouse as I hear that they are as good as the keyboards.
