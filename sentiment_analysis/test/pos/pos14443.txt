I adore the reCAP lids!  I know that mason jars are falling out of favor lately as shabby-chic is less desireable for decorating, but I just really prefer mason jars for drinking glasses.  I have two of the black wide mouth lids and one red.  I use them EVERY DAY.I have no issues at all with leaking.  I wouldn't recommend turning it upside down and shaking your cup or anything like that, but if you are just going to set it on a desk, carry it with you (in your hand) or put it in your car's cup holder, you should have no problems.  I wouldn't recommend tossing your jar into a bag - it could open up.I use these with this amazing leather sleave for my jar -Â Leather Canning Jar Travel Mug by Holdster, 16oz, Genuine Vegetable Tanned-Leather Insulating Sleeve with Built-in Handle with Hand-Sewn Stitching -Ideal for Travelers, Office Use- Mason-Jar Included!.
