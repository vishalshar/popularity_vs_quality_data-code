I was going back and forth between this and the DJI P4. I did lots of research, watched lots of user videos, and finally decided to give this one a go. I could not be happier. This thing flies really well in the wind, really smooth controls, and a very noticable quality build. The case is came in is perfect and organizes everything really well. The controller is simple and built well with really nice grips and lanyard. The cherry on top is that I saved 100s of dollars getting this over the phantom. People say that the dji has a slightly better camera, but this camera is pretty dang nice. I would highly recommend this to anyone considering getting a nicer drone.
