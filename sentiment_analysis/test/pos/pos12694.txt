I am very impressed with Grip Boost !!! My football had a our first game this pass weekend an my WR were pretty nervous, but i told them, just to play their game an have fun. Well Needless to say the team we playing against was much bigger than us but not faster. Once i seen then the mismatch I wanted to take a chance down field an we did score. Grip Boost helped building the confidence in my WR/DB's ending Score 53-0 my QB threw for 450 i had 4 WR with 1+ yards . I would refer Grip Boost to any team
