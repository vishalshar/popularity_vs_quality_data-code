I love this unit and it works flawlessly.  I run this from a small midi keyboard and stream the blue tooth to my iphone where I have soft synths.  From there I run the iPhone out into a DI box and run that to the PA.  A very portable and easy to use solution that doesn't get in the way of my normal gear.  I've run into no issues with this live ever....the Puc + does exactly what I need/want it to do.  AWESOME little unit
