The phone has flaws:Notification light is pretty much pointless, on the bottom edge.Auto-rotate sometimes gets confused and stops rotating unless forced by an app.Fingerprint sensor on the power button is neat in someways (and it's super quick and responsive) but it means any time you want to just check the lockscreen, it tries to unlock and vibrates as it errors on the fingerprint read.Good phone for the price though, haven't needed the cloud storage yet, so no idea how well or useful that is.  With google photos, not really sure how people are filling up 32GB of space with apps.
