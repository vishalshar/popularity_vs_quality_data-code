I thought I had wasted $50 for football gloves for my son, because after 5 games the stickiness had worn off and were no longer helpful. So I bought Grip Boost as a stocking stuffer and boom! The gloves are new again, nice and sticky. The bottle is small and convenient to attach to his backpack for pick up games after class.
