I was skeptical with all the good reviews but after purchasing this laptop, I was blown away.  Some people do not like the display but i'm totally fine with it and the graphics actually look better on this laptop than any other laptop I've had.  Everything sets up fast out of the box.  There is like no bloatware at all other than Microsoft Windows 10 downloading 200 gb worth of patches when you get it but that's because they like to make everyone's machine their own personal terminal.  That's the most annoying thing of the whole set up process.I've never been happier with a purchase than I have been with this one.  Also I never write reviews but for this laptop, I felt compelled to share how awesome this computer is.Gaming wise, it will run pretty much anything on high to ultra (at least the games I play which aren't very many).  Also, the ram is upgrade-able as well but I have not upgraded it yet.  Very solid, well-built laptop.  Asus just made me a customer for life.
