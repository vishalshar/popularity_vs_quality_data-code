The brush guard looks like a plastic mesh finger trap toy. It's useful in drying brushes without damaging the bristles; if you dry it with the bristles facing up or sideways, the water will get into the glue and loosen it. If you dry it with bristles touching the ground, they will get smashed. This way you can dry brushes the proper way: upside down, without damaging the bristles or loosening the glue. It's very easy to useWhen you put the brush guard on, choose one that looks smaller than the brush handle. Slide it from the brush handle, so that there's a few millimeters between the top of the bristles and the top of the guard. Stand it upside down in your makeup container. When it's dry and you want to take the guard off, slide it off in towards the bristles so that you don't damage the bristles. The brushes dry quickly and the brushes look almost brand new.The variety pack is great because my makeup brushes are different sizes, and they have an assortment of sizes that matched all my brushes.
