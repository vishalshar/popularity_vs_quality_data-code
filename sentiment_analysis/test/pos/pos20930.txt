I love ice cream and over the years have purchased many different scoops but until I bought the left-handed Belle-V I did not realize how effortless it is to scoop with the correct tool.  Being left-handed one just uses the universal tool not realizing how great a tool is that is made for you.It is also beautiful, light and easy to clean.
