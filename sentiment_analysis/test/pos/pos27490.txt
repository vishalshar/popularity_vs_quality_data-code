I bought this to use the outside measuring feature to cut some stair treads and risers to size.  Sometimes the measurement will get "hung up" so to speak.  You'll have to pull the tape out and let it back in to reset it back to zero.  A few times I had to repeat this more than once before it would reset.  But overall it's a good tape measure.  It got the job done.
