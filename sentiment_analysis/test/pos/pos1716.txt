The last one to arrive in my group of friends buys the before dinner cocktails. I was unsuccessfully looking for my purse upstairs until I remembered I had a TrackR in it. Seconds later I found it downstairs in the mud room. Now, I'm on my way, and as second to last, "L" paid for my glass of wine. :)
