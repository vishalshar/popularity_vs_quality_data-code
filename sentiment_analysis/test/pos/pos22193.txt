Awesome to keep on your key chain in case you are in need of a charge and you forget a cable. The usb & micro usb connectors are the toughest connectors I have ever used. The key is completely flexible, you can plug youre phone into an external battery pack and then set your phone on top of it and the key flexes good enough to stay plugged in. I have even plugged it into a laptop and let my phone hang off the side plugged in and it stays plugged in!
