This has got to be the Best Innovation Yet.  The sound is actually good for a speaker this size and levitation is unbelievable.  The quality and workmanship is TOP NOTCH!  I would say the materials and quality is up there with Bang and Olufsen.  I was so excited to get this and now I am even more excited that I actually have it.  I thought it was going to be some cheap plastic thing and low quality.  Definitely NOT.  The base is very heavy (I assume because of the levitation)  The orb is made of high quality materials and the ring lights are a nice touch.  There is an app for this which i setup and you can control the volume, ring lights, levitation among other things.  There was definitely a lot of time and thought put into this product.  I will update further once I play around with it for a while.  Don't hesitate to get this if you are into the wow factor.  Don't compare it to a BOSE system because it was intended to be a BOSE.  I'm blown away with it.  Keep up the good work MARS Crazybaby, this is definitely a winner.  This review was for the Space Gray.
