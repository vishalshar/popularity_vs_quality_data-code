It's not what I expected, but I like it a lot. If you have used a Rokform case before, do not plan on using the snap on the back, it's very stiff (does not come with mounting device, you get a magnet instead.) The magnet is pretty strong, I actually enjoy it more than the old Rokform twist on method. It's about as durable as any other case, protecting my phone from a few falls already. Overall, I'm very pleased.
