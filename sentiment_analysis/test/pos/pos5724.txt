I love this bottle!I was hesitant to order this bottle after reading some people reviewing this bottle reporting smell and leakage problems, so I ordered only one to begin with.  After using this bottle for a week, I plan on ordering more!  The bottle had a slight odor upon arrival, one wash in the dishwasher removed the "new bottle" smell.  I assembled the bottle, making sure the bottom was screwed on as tightly as possible, and I've have not had a single drop of leakage from this bottle.
