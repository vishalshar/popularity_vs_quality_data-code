This thing is AWESOME!!! I am in love with it!!  I replaced an outdated Rain Bird system that was the bane of my existence in trying to work. It took me about 30 minutes from beginning to end to install this in it's place. The instructions were clear, the app so easy to use and funny enough, the unit is beautiful on my garage wall. It even helped me figure out that one of my stations was dead due to a dog chewing through the wire!Amazing product. The wife loves it because now she can understand how to use our sprinkler system when before, the Rain Bird was just too complex and non-intuitive. The app is extremely user friendly and so easy to program. I see a few negative reviews on this and I have no idea how that could possibly be??One caveat for me, I don't use the Smart Water automation, I prefer to control my own days and times because of the CA drought restrictions. Some people complain about that Smart Water but are you really complaining that the sprinkler system doesn't automatically water exactly how you like without any input from you?? Just program the thing yourself!  Plus you can sit there and walk around your yard now and periodically test each station to see if a head is broken without running back and forth to the garage. Amazing!!If you love the Nest, you will love this. I could not live without it now.
