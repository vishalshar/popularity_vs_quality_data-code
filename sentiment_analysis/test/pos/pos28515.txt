These treats are 100% Scooter-Approved! We're still training, and I have to admit - the strips are a little thicker and harder than other jerky treats,  so I'm not able to rip into teeny tiny pieces, and it hurts my fingers a bit. But really - these are great. Just ordered 2 more bags. AND  they are 100% made and sourced from the US. AND AND they are just wide enough that, if you squeeze a red kong, you can slip one strip in, and my pup works for HOURS (no exaggeration) to get it out. Great buy for our house.
