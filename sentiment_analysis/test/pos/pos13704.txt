I purchased the original toys ( Chewzie DogÂ™ Durable Chew Toys & RefillsTreat Holding Toy) and my little Maltese, TwinkleBelles, looks forward to having one EVERY SINGLE MORNING!The company that manufactures them, Radio Systems) was WAY OVERCHARGING for the refills at stores such as Target and various outlets (including Amazon) so I was trying to wean TwinkleBelles off of them.  I e-mailed the manufacturer several times to try to purchase in bulk (each refill package lasts only a week and cost was prohibitive).  They NEVER responded to me so I just decided not to bother and to just give her a half of a refill (one disc) every other day as, again, cost was RIDICULOUS!Finally there came a day when I went to Target and called pet supply stores and they told me they were discontinuing the item due to complaints about cost (between $60 - $70 per month for the size A... that is, for tiny dogs), so people were not purchasing them any longer.  WalMart told me they had plans to carry the line but by that point I was fairly infuriated at the company for not bothering to contact me after several emails but THEN, while perusing Amazon, happened to find this brand "PetSafe Busy Buddy" (made by Radio also but obviously PetSafe saw the need to provide these treats at a more REASONABLE cost (still high but FAR more reasonable than Chewzie Chewz)I'm SO HAPPY and so is TwinkleBelles to have found these on Amazon under this newer brand name.  She JUST LOVES THEM!  They come in several flavors and what I like to do is add one flavored to one end of her toy (I named the toys "Green Twisty", for which she'll come running for) AND THIS ONE, A RING OF THE CHICKEN FLAVORED DENTAL CLEANING ONES to the other side and she just goes to town!THANK YOU, PET SAFE, for bringing the treats to us at a more reasonable price than Chewzie Chewz!  AND... we can actually FIND them now!:-)
