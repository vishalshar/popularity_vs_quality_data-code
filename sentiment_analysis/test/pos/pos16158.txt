This was bought for a Christmas gift for my daughter.  While the teas have not been used/drank yet, the gift box that holds the tea containers arrived with 3 of the 4 corners damaged and ripped.  The box does not stay together and because of this,the presentation is ruined.  I would not mind if I had bought this for myself but it is a gift.  I am disappointed.  For $90 I would have hoped for a nicer container.  I just hope the teas are good. I would not purchase this for a giftEdited:  This company contacted me within 24 hours and replaced my tea collection. The teas are wonderful and delicious!  Great company that stands behind its product and offers superb customer service.
