Worked the first time I tried charging my Pebble 2. Very very solid build quality.  I can still see machine scratches -  that to me is proof of hardwork.Glad that it uses micro USB cable as well. The $60 price tag is pretty understandable  for startup businesses and I'm sure that this is customer focus.Treat your Pebble right and avoid being cheap and buy this ASAP.  ?
