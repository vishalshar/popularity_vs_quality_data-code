This game is F.U.N fun! You can play it with anyone because it is only as inappropriate as the group you are playing with. I find that the more literal definitions are often times the funniest. Also, I like to make all of mine have a recurring theme. It seems to be a hit with everyone.The best fun to value game I have.
