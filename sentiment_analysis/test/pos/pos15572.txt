I use this every day in a factory and not only is it loud enough for me to hear over machinery and earplugs, the battery lasts through the entire ten hour shift. At the end of the night I simply flip it over and knock off the water, metal shavings, and other accumulated crud.On the con side: it occasionally loses connection, but I can't tell whether it's the fault of the speaker, my phone, or the interference in the area. Also, the buttons need work. The volume/advance combination works but should be improved upon.Altogether I say that this is the best bluetooth speaker I've used.
