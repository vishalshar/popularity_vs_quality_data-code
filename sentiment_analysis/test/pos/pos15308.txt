I heard about this case from KTLA's Rich on Tech.I thought that's really cool!! So I took a chance,I stuck it to my dashboard, it worked great!Then I stuck it to a cymbal stand, it held there too!Then the side of the case started to separate.So, I email the support department at Mega Tiny Corp,they asked me to send some pictures of the problem.Their response time was amazing. Josh handled the situation like a pro.He backed the product and is shipping me a new case and no charge, they even cover the shipping.As I said in the email, " Mega Tiny Rocks, you have earned a customer for life"They stood behind the product and took care of me.That level of communication and customer service, made me feel valued and appreciated.Thank you, Josh @ Mega Tiny Corp.
