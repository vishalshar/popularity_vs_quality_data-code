Pros and Cons listed below for the blue (non dye-free) crystals, but I also tried the dye-free option and wish it was listed as a separate product. I'd give the dye-free 1 star. Not because it's dye free, but the box that actually holds the litter is totally different. It uses velcro to secure the flap/lid to the box. This design somehow ripped off every time I went to change it out, sending litter and all the other kitten treats found in litter everywhere. The whole design just seemed flimsy. Strongly reccommend sticking with the blue version.For the blue version,Pros: Very easy to chang out. Just be sure to save the top part as it will be your lid when it's time to throw out your old trays. The box's plastic coating is great for completely holding in #1, #2, and anything in between. Crystals do an okay job at capturing and eliminating smells. Of the varieties, I does best with urine. Poo can get a bit pungent if it sits on top. Automatic "flushing" is amazing. Whatever the crystals can't absorb, the lid does a good job at containing smells (at least for the blue crystal version). Wish I could set the delay time though. It seems to be about 15 minutes after the cat leaves the box. Fortunately, there is a button you can push to manually flush.Cons: Expensive. With 2 cats, I easily go through 1 set of 3 litter boxes per month. These are basically a $40/month subscription fee for me. I reccommend subscribing on Amazon. Every little bit of savings helps. Just keep an eye out for potential price increases.Conclusion:Don't buy the dye-free version until they fix the boxes. I'm all for reducing excess materials, but the construction is just flimsy. The blue crystal boxes are excellent, but a bit pricey. If you have the money and live in a smaller space, I highly reccommend these. You're senses will thank you.
