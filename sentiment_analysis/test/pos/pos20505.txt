Works great with Universal adapter for my Sony Z3v. Very good lock, won't drop the phone. I used to attach my phone to my handle bar, instead of the stem, so my phone wouldn't be so near my other wireless bike computer. I had to do this because my phone kept interfering with my wireless computer when they were close together.If you use the universal adapter, I would suggest adding super glue to the adhesive surface to prevent it from unsticking. I did this and it is now very strong.Overall great product. Very light, but strong.
