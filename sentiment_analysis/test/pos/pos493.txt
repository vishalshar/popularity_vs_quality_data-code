I bought this battery and, after a few tries, got it set up in my Kidde Nighthawk alarm. Kidde alarms have a yellow plastic strip in the battery compartment to make it easier to remove the battery. I noticed that the Roost is lighter than a normal 9-volt, so the yellow strip was pushing it out of the compartment. I thought I'd gotten it to sit right, though, and put it back up on the ceiling.A few days later (or less?) the battery went offline. It was about a week after that before I had some spare time to try and set it up again. When I opened the battery compartment, I saw that the yellow strip had pushed it out of alignment. I couldn't get it set up again (kept beeping twice, wouldn't stop until I separated the two pieces), so Roost sent me a replacement.This time when I set it up I cut the yellow strip out of the battery compartment first. Got it set up, got it into the alarm no problem, and it's been online for a week with no issues! I firmly believe the battery removal strip was the issue.IMO, this is the best option for having a "smart" alarm that meets our state fire code (MA), which requires ionization alarms anywhere not near a kitchen or bathroom. The all-in-one smart alarms don't have ionization sensors. And you have to be up to code to sell your house or refinance your mortgage.
