Having a lot of fun so far. Actually bought it mainly for Masterpiece. I'm trying to get better with my Prismacolor markers and it's so easy to grab a photo from the web - save it to my iPad Mini and then start drawing with Masterpiece. I'm almost 30 and still really like this setup! Would love to see some tutorial function built in to some of the pre-configured images! I had some trial and error of looking up and down at the paper and device. I recommend looking down to put the tip close to the paper and then look up. Start with outlines, fill in later!
