I love this case. It is the 5th different case i have tried. I have an iPhone 6 .Pros: * Fits the iPhone beautifully * Buttons are easy to push. The mute button is exposed but the volume and the power buttons are covered but very easy to push. Being older (weak hands) this was a problem for me with other cases. * Very comfortable to hold. Some of the metal cases i tried almost cut into my hand after a while * Beautiful Horween leather, slightly waxy feel * Should develop a nice patina - i like this although some don't. I don't mind scratches, changes in color, etc. As i have aged i have come to appreciate patina...Cons: * None thus far.I bought this from Amazon - full price - no incentive from the vendor.
