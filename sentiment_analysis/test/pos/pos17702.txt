Awesome product. 30-min install out of the box. App east to setup and use. Would highly recommend.I had to install two controllers, wished there was a way to link them in the app so instead of switching between controllers, it would just recognize them as a single unit. Otherwise, very happy and glad I didn't wait until it was Apple HomeKit compatible.
