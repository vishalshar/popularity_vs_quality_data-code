Love it. I am a mouse enthusiast (I call myself that because it makes me feel better about the drawer full of mice that have yet to fulfill my appetite for the "perfect mouse"), and have owned a mionix avior 7000, logitech g303, ss rival, razer deathadder, zowie ec1-a, and of course this gem, the mionix castor. First,  I'd like to say the build quality is stupendous. Even better than that of my ec1-a which was my daily driver for quite some time. However, with the ec1 I installed gun tape (that grainy grip that I put on my pistols) because I hated the slippery coating on the zowie mice (my hands don't really perspire). It worked fantastically but I decided to buy one of these to try out... being the mouse testing addict that I am. Of all the mice I've made my little tweaks to... From gun tape to using electrical tape for better grip, this mouse is the first I've used that I feel contours perfectly to my grip straight out of the box. I have fairly large hands.... 8 inches to be exact... yet this mouse absolutely molds to my claw grip/palm grip amazingly. I had to give my two cents in and review this piece of art myself since it's a fairly new release. I am expecting this mouse to make waves in the peripherals industry with 5 star reviews. The coating on the housing is wonderfully comfortable... Same as on my avior yet in a much more comfortable and ergonomic shape. It's the in-between [in a sense] compared to the avior ambi shape and the naos full palm shape. Again, outstanding quality and the tracking you'd expect from the flawless 3310 sensor. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for that daily driver of a mouse. If you're like me and you are on a quest to find that mouse that you feel you can use comfortably for the foreseeable future you're in luck. I finally can rest from spending so much of my disposable income looking for the mouse that's right for me.
