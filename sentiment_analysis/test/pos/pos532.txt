Best ear buds ever!  My first pair lasted 3 years which is longer than any pair ive owned.  I work out 3 times a week atleast and am not easy on the equipment.  I have the odd situation that my ears fill with sweat as i work out and most ear buds die off quickly.  I bought these because they seal the sweat from running into my ears.  The sound is terrific as long as you use the correct buds included in the package.  I was a little hesitant to take these out of the hot water and stick them in my ears but follow the directions and it all works out perfectly.  Eventually my first pair died and i bought a second.  The new pair showed up and one broke bevore i even got a chance to mold it.  Contacted customer service and they had a new pair out to me right away.  The sound is Great, the cord is nice and long for tall people. Im 6 2 and it stays nice in my pocket with no pulling.  If i could make a improvement it would be to have the jack come out at a 90 instead of straight.  It keeps getting caught on things and the connection cord goes bad.Still great product and a company that stands behind it.  Hard to find that anymore.
