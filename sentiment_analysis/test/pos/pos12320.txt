The companies customer service is amazing! I ordered mine from Amazon since I have prime...and I got a defective garment. It had a hole in it. I was worried since I had ordered from Amazon but they sent me a replacement immediately, in a bigger size too since I estimated my post delivery size wrongly. I didn't get to use it until about 7 days postpartum so I didn't get to get the ice benefit but the back support has been great. It's a little cumbersome to get on and off so on the days that I didn't wear it I DID noticed a difference in my pain level. I recommend ordering this product although I'm a little hesitant to recommend ordering from Amazon....the seams were not well finished in the product I got from then but there was a huge difference in the replacement sent to me by mama strut. Also your insurance may cover this product. I haven't submitted mine yet but for the price it's worth a shot!
