What a refreshing drink!  Definitely the best Calamansi juice on the market.  I've been searching for this for quite some time and happy to see it on amazon.  It's taste really has similarities of both a lime and a tangerine.  A must try for anyone who has never tasted calamansi juice before. I drink it throughout the day cold and in the morning hot as a substitute to my usual lemon water.  Extremely tasty with loads of vitamin c.  Try it even with some seltzer or mix it with some vodka, rum, or tequila.  Definitely a huge hit in my household.  Will purchase again.
