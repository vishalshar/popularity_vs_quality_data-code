I purchased MetaDerm Eczema Natural Moisturizing Cream [aka, ME in this review] because of the promising reviews it received on Amazon, and I read lots of thorough reviews on Amazon regarding various eczema products.  I will attempt to write a review based upon what I like to see in others' reviews of products like this, or what I would like to see in reviews other than one or two-liners, like, "it worked great."  or "Didnt work for me" or whatever.The ME, an organic moisturizing lotion, has active ingredients that consist primarily of homeopathic ingredients.  I have seen very few others that contain homeopathic ingredients in a cream dedicated to eczema and also consist of organic ingredients as well.  It has no fragrance, for those people that cannot tolerate scents.  It feels, and applies like a regular lotion, absorbs very nicely into the skin, not greasy at all.  As you will see below, I had to learn how to use the ME properly for it to work, after a couple of failures.  I hope that if you purchase this product, you will see how to use it simply, and properly as I enumerate all this below.  The ME doesnt seem to follow the typical eczema cream protocol but it really did work for me.Below, I will give a background of my experience with eczema and using ME, as I feel this is important to know when reading a review of a product that is designed to heal a condition you may have.  I.e., I like to know under what circumstance the person got the condition, and a little of their history, to see if it coincides with my own experience.  So here goes:For many years I have been getting eczema.  I discovered on my own that it came about due to eating wheat flour, (aka, flour - white or whole-wheat), or products with gluten.  I did not get stomach problems, or indigestion from eating gluten, however.  The eczema first came on in my adult years (while living in a northern, damp climate at the time, a high pollen-count area), even though I didn't eat a lot of bread or gluten products.  However, the first time it came on was after I had eaten, within two weeks, a loaf of sourdough bread.  I broke out with eczema on my calves, hands, primarily.  It also initially manifested during my worst year for hay fever in that area, and being at a stressful job.  Now it recurs primarily on either side of my hands and/or on fingers, and I am in a different climate.How and why eczema occurs for other people varies, such as stress factors, cold, dry air, climate, diet, etc.  I found that using detox tinctures (Nestmann Scolopendrium 28) did help to heal it at one point, under the guidance of a naturopath.  I didnt know about the ME.  Detox of any type should be done under the guidance of a good naturopath who knows your overall health condition/issues.  The Nestmann tincture helped to keep eczema from progressing if I took it at the earliest signs of an eczema breakout.  So here was an important clue:  eczema might possibly be cleared up for some, by trying detoxing  under the guidance of a naturopath, as I said above.How eczema manifests for me:  A red, very, very, itchy rash with tiny blisters that will weep if I scratch it.  And it seems almost impossible to heal, it cracks and bleeds, and persists for years, if you do not know what to do for it.  I learned over time that in many cases of skin anomalies, if the liver is unable to detox your body sufficiently, these toxins can get exported to the skin, as the skin is a (or one of) secondary detox organ for the body if other organs are overloaded.  ME definitely made the healing difference for me, as you will see below, while using the Nestmann tincure mentioned above.Past treatment methods, use of ME, and climate factors:  I began using the ME over a year ago, but it didnt work very well for me at the time.  I realize now that I was not applying it frequently enough.  Also, I did not use it continuously after the eczema breakout healed.  So, I tried everything from the usual eczema creams, typical over the counter cortisone creams, heavy moisturizing creams, to clay mixed with olive oil wrapped on my fingers with bandaids, etc., to keep it from itching at night.  Nothing was working, I mean, nothing.  I had been avoiding gluten all this time.  (We live in a very dry arid northern high desert climate where it gets very cold and very dry in the winter, and very hot and dry in the summer.)  It persisted.  When we went on vacation to a warm, humid climate in Mexico, the eczema began to clear up as soon as we arrived.  Continued to stay away from gluten.  The eczema stayed away for a several months.  I did not continue using the ME, but had wondered if I should have to possibly keep the eczema from recurring.  By going to Mexico and having the eczema heal, I realized another important clue, that eczema needs to be kept moist as much as possible.So, here is where the 5-stars come in:  As soon as this latest breakout occurred, I applied the ME continuously right at the start.  The eczema had just manifested again on my fingers, on the top, even after avoiding wheat and gluten, but seems to have been triggered by the cold, dry air that we started getting this winter.  Traces of gluten could be a factor, but am not sure.  I religiously applied the ME, several times a day, and even through the night, since, if I woke up during the night (not from itching eczema, though), I would keep the ME lotion by my bedside, apply, and go back to sleep.  I was truly impressed, as the ME stopped the itching and the eczema began to heal up fairly quickly.  It continues to heal, almost gone within about two weeks now of applying the ME.Using the ME for this latest iteration of eczema has been a total turnaround from my previous experience with eczema under any circumstance.  For it to stop itching so quickly, and begin to heal that quickly, is a great success story for me!  The ME bottle says to apply it liberally.  I personally translate that to mean, for my experience, apply often.  And I did.  Mysterious stuff, but this ME lotion really works.
