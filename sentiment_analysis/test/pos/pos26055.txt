I purchased this scooter for our RV so I can get around the campgrounds etc.. I have yet to go on a trip with it yet but I have been riding it around at home and it really is a neat zippy little thing. Really think it will do the job I purchased it for and is definitely fun for my whole family just sitting in our garage as well! Thanks ProGo.
