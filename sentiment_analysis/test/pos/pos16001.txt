Very impressed with thing.  I'm still learning some tricks, as I'm not really a pro-photographer but it's pretty dummy proof.  I use it for both over-head shots of my products and also angled shots with the backdrop and Sideshot.They've kind of thought of everything....it really is "all-inclusive".  I sell die cut, vinyl stencils, so I lay them flat and take an over head shot.  I not have very consistent photos, each one is the same and very clean and well lit.  Because of the material I use, glare is an issue with direct lighting.  The glare shields are genius. They attach via magnets to the screws that hold the lighting to the top of the box.  Snap right in place and pull right off when not needed - simple and perfect design and eliminates all the glare and reflection from the glossy finish of the vinyl and backing paper.The Sideshot is cool too.  I didn't realize it at first, but it has more LEDs built in it as well, so it adds more lighting to the box, even when not actually using it to take photos.  The little cord that attaches the box to the Sideshot (and provides power for the lighting) appears to be not easily replaceable (like a standard micro USB or something) so be careful not to lose it.  The built in USB to charge your phone is nice feature.The dimming feature doesn't have a huge range, it goes from bright to "off" pretty quick, but it's a LIGHT box, not a dark box...so doubt you'd need a variety of dim light settings.  Wish the power cord was just a little longer.  When on a table, this has to be pretty close to an outlet (or power strip, etc).My Note 5 takes awesome pictures, and I've had no issues with the LEDs effecting the lens or anything.  I'm using typical factory settings on my phone (like I said, I'm no pro).  Still need to be prepared to do some minor editing though, specifically cropping, etc...especially for larger items to crop out the sides of the box.The backdrops hook on the back very easily and seem to work well.  Would love to see more background options in the future, even as a paid add-on. Would be really cool if the backdrop spanned more than just 90 degrees and wrapped around, closer to 180.  That would help with the pictures of larger items catching the sides of the box.The break down and setup is very quick and easy.  It isn't "cheap" but it not super strong when assembled.  The box will shake a little when manipulating your phone, whether resting on top of on the Sideshot.  I'm also not sure you'd "mount" an SLR to use with the top picture holes.Overall, I'm very happy....it's going to take my products photos on my website to a new level and really takes the need to be a professional photographer out of the equation.  I could hand this to my son, tell him to set it up and take a picture with this phone and it would turn out great.As far as price:  $200 is pretty steep.  It was originally listed for $140 when first released I think, and I kicked myself for not jumping on it then.  I got lucky and waited to see if the price would go back down...eventually I found one sold directly by SHOTBOX (on Amazon, but not Prime or fulfilled by Amazon) for $145ish.  That price I was much more comfortable with and am happy with my purchase.  Was a necessary investment for my website.
