Good product, works as advertised, has replaceable batteries so I don't have to charge it weekly or daily and when they die after 9 months I just put new ones in rather than throwing it away like I had to do with two different Fitbits.  Plus it doesn't look weird wearing it with the watch my wife gave me for our anniversary several years ago.
