Alright I will be short and sweet. I was curious about the operation of this device and would it be consistent day in and day out. Bottom line it does everything as advertised. I work in a stressful environment and hopeful this device would prompt me to recognize when I was a bit stressed. When I get tense, Spire vibrates and confirms I need to address this. Is this perfect, no, but pretty consistent. I also wear a heart rate monitor so this is also a good reference point. If you are looking for a device to let you know you need to RELAX, you might want to take a flyer on Spire. You do need to commit to it and keep the app open to be most efficient. If you buy it you need to make Spire part of your daily routine. Only one issue is syncing can be long, but this is normal if you have not connected for a day or so. Occasionally it freezes, but all you need to do is shut down and restart. No big deal. I am not a believer in perfect 5 star ratings, so the 4 is all thumbs up.
