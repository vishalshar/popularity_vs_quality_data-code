Great set of gaming headphones.when I first opened the package. It was in a nice hard box. Not a case but a box. The sides of the headphones had clear protective coverings so it wouldn't get scratched. I still have those on it. The quality once I put them on was astounding and was a very comfortable fit. It came with everything needed in order to start playing immediately. Now one side of the headphones has your power button and a indention for a mic plug in which it comes with. Now what I have realized about these headphones are that you don't need the mic plugged in in order for the mic to work. Which is nice. The sides of the headphones turn clockwise and counter clockwise. One side for Game volume and one side for chat volume. The sides also can be pushed in to either mute your mic from others or to mute game volume. Which is also nice. The only gripe about that feature is that the push buttons are on opposite sides of the volume knobs. The plug in mic has a blue led light built into it which allows you to know when your mic is muted or not. One side of the headphones has an EQ button. Don't use it much but it allows you to change the setting whether you're watching a movie or playing a game. Another minor complaint about this product is that it loses the connectivity with the plug in USB. Sometimes my arm or knee gets in the way of the signal and temporarily loses the signal and disconnects. It reconnects shortly after but it gets kind of aggravating. The battery life on these is fairly good. I never had it die on me and I will play a game or watch a movie back to back. I also charge this headset while not using it though. This headset also comes with a 3.5mm wire for plugging into a phone. I've used it multiple times while cutting the grass. I don't have a big problem with the ear pieces getting to hot compared to other headsets, I can use them for long periods of time without getting annoyed at how much heat they're putting on my ears. The volumes for both game volume and chat are great. I never have an issue with either. Also another great feature about these is that you can hear yourself talk slightly in each side. This will allow you to know if youre breathing into the mic or not.Over all I highly advise anyone looking for a new gaming headset or just a nice wireless headset to watch movies to get these. They are great and aren't overpriced for the quality you are getting.
