I haven't used this very much so I'm giving it for stars. I've had no issues linking devices and playing music. It has a little punch to it so the music sounds good. I can hear it on the other side of my yard which is nice as well. Didn't use the phone charging feature or taking calls feature. It definitely suits my purposes.
