This mount is sturdy and securely holds an iPhone 6 in a CD slot typically mounted high and centered on the dash, with minimal vibration.  The articulation provided by the ball joint is a nice feature.  This mount design is preferable to AC vent mounts which are less rigidly mounted to a movable vent, and by design they close or block the vent.  This also works much better than any design which employs suction cups which regularly fail and drop the phone.The downward extending screw tightening mechanism on this can block audio or AC controls on some vehicles (Mazda 3), inserting the device in a CD slot upside down so the screw is on top can avoid this issue.  Also it works very well with the magnet mountable Logitech plus cases http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/protection-plus-for-iphone?crid=1537As a side note, removing the magnetic plate from the device exposes the ball joint which will fit the ball joint socket of some current Garmin GPS units.
