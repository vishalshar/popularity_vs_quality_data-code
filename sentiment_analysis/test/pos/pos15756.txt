This device does not know the difference between Solar Panels making your meter run backwards vs normal meter running forwards, so I use it to measure the amount of power that devices take during the evening hours when Solar does not effect the meter. OPTOCOM communications out of the IR port also confuses the readings, but they are short (<2 seconds) and (in my case) occur once every 15 minutes, and therefore can be predicted and ignored. Given these known limitations, I still LOVE this device. It has given me insight into my homes electrical demands. I used to leave my Kitchen light on but now I know my dining room light uses 1/3rd the amount of power and about the same amount of light, so I can reduce my energy needs with this simple change.
