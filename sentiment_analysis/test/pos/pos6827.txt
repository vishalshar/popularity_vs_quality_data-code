UPDATE 6/21/2014 - With updated watch firmware and the latest app, Everything is SO MUCH BETTER!  Watch and phone pairing very well now, alerts are all firing, and they even added support for K-9 EMail client.  Happy camper now!  Still some minor problems with Alarms and Social/TXT alerts, but overall, working well.UPDATE 5/30/2014 - Another software update and now CallerID is broken, doesn't show caller unless you press and hold a button, major fail, loose a star.  Also re-pairing is failing more again.  Up down up down, apparently no Software QA.UPDATE 5/26/2014 - So with an update from Google for Hangouts and an update from Cogito for there App, TXT/SMS/Social alerts on KitKat seem to be pretty reliable.  So far I have not noticed any failed message alerts.  Also, re-pairing/sync seems to be much improved.  Now if the watch and phone get separated and the watch shows the un-paired symbol, I can usually just hit the command button on the phone to force the watch and phone to sync back up.  This seems to work the majority of the time, much better.  The only problems now are that TXT/SMS/MMS messages in Hangouts still show as social not TXT alerts, and that Alarm alerts still fire off a beep two hours early no matter what is set (and are tied to event alarms for enable/disable).  Rating goes to 4/5 stars, though there is still no response from tech support or social media person.UPDATE 5/13/2014 - The alarm alert clearing problem seems to have been a one time thing, they have been clearing once alarm acknowledged on the phone as expected.  TXT alerts are still failing only 10% so far have alerted, tech support clueless so far, barely responding.  Review updated below.  Also confirmed that built in calendar/email programs do alert to phone, just not third party apps.  I'm upping it to 3/5 stars from 2/5 as I learn how everything works (still they should have this better documented!!!)-- The Review --So been looking for a good analog/digital watch plus 100M water rating for my daily watch.  Since I knew I was going to be spending upwards of $200 thought I'd look into the smart watch arena.  I thought this would be perfect but it really misses out on the smart watch part.  I love the look and the feel and all the watch parts, but the alerts are lacking.  Here are the details:The physical:So far I LOVE the looks of the watch. It's a little bigger than what I was hoping for but, overall, still well within reason. It's about double the mass of my old Timex Expedition watch (which was long overdue for replacement, about 15 years overdue), but the watch face is still smaller than the width of my wrist which is good. I have pretty narrow wrists for a 6'+ person (thin boned) so most modern design watches tend to look GIANT on my wrist. This looks big, but not to big. Mostly it's just thick, but again, not to bad, and I'll easily get used to it. So given all that, I love that the watch looks modern, classic, classy, not flashy, and solid. It's a watch that on first look you wouldn't guess it's got any electronic brains, nor connected to a smart-phone. It just looks classy. The wife approves the look.Big bonus (and a must requirement for me) is the 100M (10ATM) water rating. That means no fears about swimming pools and light water recreation. No diving, no water skiing, but swimming and shallow snorkeling no problem. Showers, baths, and doing dishes shouldn't even be a second thought.Finally, when alerts aren't displayed, the phone shows the digital time and date. This was another big plus, even ignoring the smart watch part, it's very hard to find a good looking analog watch that also shows a digital clock! This feature alone helps improve my overall rating for this watch. There is also a back-light for viewing at night, which is a little weak, but usable. finally the hands and markings of the analog watch glow in the dark, so that helps in low light as well.The Smarts (mostly)So I wanted a new classy watch, but figured if I was going to spend a fair amount on it I wanted it to work with my phone. Ideally all I really wanted was: Caller ID, SMS/MMS Alerts, Remote Music Control. So far I'll give the watch 3 out of 4 on this. Acceptable, see below for details:This is on a Nexus 5 phone with stock KitKat 4.4.3 (not rooted)  Caller ID = Works and seems to be reliable, contact details are shown, or phone number if not in contacts.  Clear alert with command button on caller ID detail page of watch.  Can also silence ringer/vibrating alert on watch and phone by pressing the command key while it is ringing, very nice touch.  You can still answer the call after silencing the ringer if you choose.  SMS/MMS Alerts = Works now with latest updates, kinda. Of multiple SMS messages all seem to alert, but because KitKat uses Hangouts for SMS/MMS you have to enable Social alerts not TXT alerts (ugh). Clear alert with command button on caller ID detail page of watch seems to have been disabled, they clear when you clear it on the phone.  Social Alerts = Only Hangouts or Google+ messages. I use plume for twitter/facebook and those alerts aren't triggering on the phone. The cogito app sees the hangout alerts but not the plume alerts.  To be fair plume is a third party app, so maybe the issue is there.  Mail Alerts = Default imap/pop mail client and gmail app both trigger alerts on the phone, so the basics work.  And with the latest update K-9 Mail triggers alerts as well, and that's a third party app.  Event Alerts = The built in google calendar app alerts as expected.  Unfortunately again, I use a third party calender and those alerts don't show up on the cogito phone app or on the watch.  Alarm Alerts = Works and seems to be reliable.  Major annoyance is that the phone alerts on androids pre-alarm an alert 2 hours early.  When an alarm is going to trigger the phone pops up a silent alert that you have an upcoming alarm in 2 hours.  Unfortunately the watch triggers and audio alert (even in silent mode) for the alarm.  Very annoying if your alarm isn't supposed to wake you up until 6 am and your watch is waking you up at 4 am.  Had to disable event alerts to avoid this.  Alarm/Event Alert tie-together = Since Alarm and Event alerts are controlled by the same toggle you can't have one with out the other.  Because of the 2 hour early alerts for my morning alarms, I can't leave Event alerts enabled.  Big bug here.  Battery Alerts = Not tested with watch battery, but if the phone get's low you see that alert on the watch.  Music Control = Kinda works, I have figured out how to pause and resume playback, but that's it for now (command button).  Lost Phone = Works, press command and left page at the same time and the phone cookoos!  Lost Watch = Works, tap the lost watch icon and the watch starts beeping.  Phone Watch Separation = Doesn't work, can't enable option, it's grayed out on the phone app.  Remote Camera operation = Works, quick press of he command button takes a picture using a basic camera app, must launch the camera app through the cogito app on the phone. Gives the option of using the front or back camera.Documentation of all this functionality is pretty sparse, some of it I've had to just figure out on my own. They do have an instruction booklet on their website which explains things a little better, but still lacks some of the functions I've mentioned above.  That booklet should have been included with the product.I really love the "watch" and the "smart" part has improved sine I first purchased it.  Overall, I'm very happy with the watch now.
