Love it. I have a D-Link IP camera and it took about 90 seconds to add the motion sensor to the "mydlink Home" app. Push notifications and Email works great on Samsung Note 3, schedules are easy to set up, and the motion sensor works surprisingly well. I now have 4 of these, one facing every door / large window. Says you can connect the motion sensor to the dlink outlet switch, haven't tested yet but just purchased a few to test.
