Bought this for my 8 year old and he loves it!  He was able to set it up and start building and inventing within minutes.  We did have one problem.  The cloudbit itself went bad and stopped working within a few days, BUT the customer service at littleBits was extremely prompt and courteous and replaced the piece quickly.
