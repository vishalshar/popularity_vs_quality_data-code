I have used the Bridge keyboard with my Mini4 only briefly so far.  I like typing on it.  The bluetooth connection seems to work without any problems.  I think it is handsome when used as a cover, although I was surprised at how much weight it added and I wish the external hinges hadn't interfered with the aesthetics.  All in all, though, I am pleased.
