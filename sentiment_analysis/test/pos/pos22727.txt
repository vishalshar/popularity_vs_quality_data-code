I eventually received my phone. Gosh! I waited, so long, was so upset, and guess what!  UPS left it in the Leasing office, without leaving a note on my door.  (Lazy to walk up to the 2nd Flr)  Anyway, after all the excitement, the phone is fabulous.  Lol!  I love this phone!  16GB, yes! I can DL all my important apps.  I  highly recommend the phone.  First I wanted to buy the Samsung 32 GB Note 4, but then decided to try this POSH phone as 16 GB would be fine for me, knowing that I am coming from a 4GB Lol!  Was I right! Hahahaa! I am so happy I did, and I saved a lot of money.  This phone is bad. (meaning (SUPERCALIFAGILISTIC)  DOCIOUS.Thank you Posh/Amazon, and pardon me from driving you all crazy, for not knowing who signed for my phone.  (I just wanted my phone. Lol!Happy customer  :)  :)  Hey guys, you have to buy the case: 360 degree POSH Rotating Case, yes, you will need that, no doubt.  I was about to return mine, when I did not see my Phone coming (thought it was stolen)  but my my! It's a steal and easy yo handle, great grip, and the rotation makes life Easy.  Perfect and affordable gift for the coming Holiday/Birthdays.  This is my own personal review.  I normally don't write long reviews, but this phones deserves truth.
