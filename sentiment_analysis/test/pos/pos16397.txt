I'm loving my MiniMD. I used to receive professional microdermabrasion treatments every three weeks and I loved my skin. People's jaw dropped every time I told them I was 38. Unfortunately I came across some tough times about a year and a half ago and couldn't afford to do the treatments any more. Despite home facials, I've been watching my skin progressively get more splotchy and scaly as time goes by. I was skeptical about this product...I mean, if it's as simple as a $99 device, why isn't everyone doing it?...but with the money back guarantee what did I have to lose? I love it. I cannot believe the dead skin in the filter each time I use it and after only a week (three uses) my skin already looks drastically different. It's soft and smooth and glowing!! I should have done this sooner!!!My only suggestion against this particular product is that I do a little bit wish I would have sprung for one of this brands more expensive devices. The attachment provided is a size that doesn't allow for proper suction in some bony areas such as the bridge of my nose. I will have to invest in more attachments I think. Or upgrade and save this one for travel!!Why are you still reading? Get a Trophy Skin microdermabrasion device ASAP!!! :-D
