Playing fetch with my puppy has been fun! This product comes with 3 small balls (not a standard tennis ball size) which is perfect for my mini schnauzer. It can be operated with electricity or batteries and have 3 setting to throw the balls to increase distance. I did notice that when operating it with batteries is doesn't throw as far but it also good since i use it mostly indoors. It makes a sound before throwing the ball and my puppy just loves it! He hears and waits for it and chases the ball once its released.
