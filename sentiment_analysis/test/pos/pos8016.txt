I work night shifts as a nurse and at times I have trouble falling asleep once home. After a dream water I am asleep in about 30 min. It has not let me down yet. When I wake up there is no hung over or groggy feeling. I recomed this to all of my fellow night shifters. I will even take this if I am only laying down for 3-4 hrs. Flavor is fine take it like a shot pore water in my mouth then followed by powder packet.
