The TrackR very easy to set up on both iPhone and Android, and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have attached  the device to my keys. The only thing that I do not like  is that, because it is constantly connected through Bluetooth, it appears to really kill the battery on my phone quickly. It would be great if they could turn this into more of a Wi-Fi app. Also, my phone is always able to ring the TrackR; however, if there are too many apps open on my phone,  the TrackR is unable to ring my phone (even if it's is nearby).  I emailed the company about this and they responded very quickly, and did indicate  that one would have to have minimal apps open (less than 8)  in order for the TrackR  to locate my phone .  Once I close apps and tried it, indeed, they were correct. Unfortunately, when your phone is lost,  there is no way to close apps  that would affect  the device's ability to find the phone. I hope they will do something about that. That said, I think it's a great product and does what it promises.
