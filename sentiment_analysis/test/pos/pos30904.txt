This is a very good device that beats the competition in many ways:  it is lightweight AND it knows where you are even outside of the home.  But, I have been wearing the device about a week now and think there is room for improvement.1. Unless the button is pressed, it is completely passive. This means that a caretaker or friend who you have authorized to access the Link monitoring on the internet does not really know your status. The Link report just says "At Home".  Even if  the device is sitting on the kitchen table, the caretaker who might Update Location multiple times will see different "nearby" addresses due to the inaccuracy of consumer GPS.  They might wrongly conclude that you are moving around the house when in fact you could be unconscious on the floor.  What the device needs is another button called (perhaps) "I'm OK" which the wearer presses (at least once per day) to show they are OK, and which the link service records in its history.  That way the wearer has told the caretaker they are conscious and all right.2. As far as the History presented on the Link page, it is limited to reporting "At Home" or "Out and About".  I guess Greatcall is attempting to respect the wearer's privacy.  There ought to be an option (set by the user) to provide a detailed history (which Greatcall undoubtedly has).  Also, as reported by other users, the History frequently misses times when you were "Out and About"...often for more than an hour.  It makes me doubt that they are "pinging" the device as frequently as advertised.3. If you do have an emergency outside the home, and are confused or unconscious, anyone who might come to your aid will not know what "that thing" is you are wearing around your neck.  The device should have 9-1-1 displayed obviously near or on the button.  I solved that one by affixing a label-maker tag above the button that says "9-1-1".4. I also ordered the accessory pack that contains two lanyards and a wrist band.  I thought I could wear the wristband instead of wearing the device around my neck.  It was NOT secure and the device fell off in less than a half hour.  I now wear the red lanyard but think that the "lobster claw" clip is difficult for anyone to attach and un-attach the device.  There are far better lanyards available on Amazon for under $5 that are easier to use.Also, be aware that in most cities, you can file a form with your local police that includes lock-box codes or where the key to your house is hidden, etc, that they can pull up if you dial 911 on your phone (and are at home).  That could meet many people's needs.I still am an "Out and About" person so the device/service is useful for me.The irony of this device is that it is something you may never use but must wear for the rest of your life.  It would be nice if it they also included a digital clock on it to provide an everyday use function.
