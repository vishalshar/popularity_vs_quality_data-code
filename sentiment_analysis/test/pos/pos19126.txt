I was looking for something to help me find my Apple TV remote specifically because the damn thing is always falling in between couch cushions or is left somewhere it shouldnt be. Looking for it endlessly got really old, really quick.I ordered a TrackR because it was super thin and came in black (I wanted it to match the remote). I was nervous about the ringer volume based on some of the reviews, but Ive been really happy so far. The volume is a little low when the remote/TrackR is buried underneath the couch, but honestly I can still hear it well enough to find it which is all I wanted!
