Had this for a few months and overall very satisfied, but honestly it is more gadget than needed. That doesnt mean it is not excellent. Most of us are conditioned to turn off lights manually, so using the remote app (on phone, tablet, etc.) takes extra thinking. I have not tried it with Echo or other voice devices.I bought other additions to this so I could wire (or wirelessly control) my main floor. Again, I find myself using the wall switches (including the pico remotes wall mounted), which is funny because one of the reason for installing this was me being tired of trying to access a switch on the kitchen counter that is blocked by cooking equipment.So why do I like it so much? Well it is a gadget in a sense. Other than that it has many uses. First it is nice to not have to get up to turn off lights your children leave on while they are transiting rooms.  But it is nice to dim some of the rooms at times. Also nice to control my lights when I am away, even if it is to give the dogs some light.They do make shades that work with this system, but I will wait to the price becomes reasonable.Final note: The system without the Hub is very useful in many cases. Wish I had this in the 80s went I wanted to control a hall light from upstairs and downstairs locations. In short, this is a great option (without the hub, unless you want to control with an app) if you want to install a two-way or more-way lighting control in a room that only has one switch. The Pico switch can be mounted on a wall with a wall plate to look like it was there all the time. This means even a novice can wire up a two, three, four-way lighting without having to run wires or cutting holes into the walls. This is great for older houses that may have one switch, but multiple entrances. Perhaps you have a house where the bathroom switch is outside the bathroom and you want one in the bathroom. This will assist.  Finally, you a seeking an option to add another switch because you created another entry way to a space, this makes that very simple. So the possibilities are endless, which as a gadget guy is why I really like this device.One issue to consider is loss of power due to a storm. We loss power and one of my paired (switch and pico) failed to work after power was restored. The fix was simple for me, perhaps even simpler now that I think about it. I had to remove all the wires to the switch, then reattached all the wires. This resolved the issue. So the simpler solution, turn off the breaker, wait 20 seconds, turn on the breaker and you may have to pair the pico again.
