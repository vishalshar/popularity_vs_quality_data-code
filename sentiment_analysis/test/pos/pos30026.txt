This is  great first 3D printer. Some of the modifications you'll want to make (literally print these parts out, available on thingiverse) are:- Top mounted spool holder (2 pieces slide together)- Deck hole cover to prevent parts from falling down inside the case- Platform lifters- Chain link (top and bottom pieces snap together) with mounts and attachment link to mount to side of the case where the chain link meets the spiral cabling- PLA filament oiler- E3D V6 quick release plate- E3D fan ducts for mounting front and rear 40mm fansTo do the E3D V6 1.75mm universal direct (google it - you will get better prints and the ability to print faster) installation:1) Remove the Robo 3D Plus's top case by unscrewing the 4 screws at the bottom of the legs, near the base, located on the left and right sides.2) Twist the Z-Axis poles clockwise until you have about 4 inches of clearance to the glass heatbed.3) Disconnect the heater core and thermister cables, using the quick connects.4) At the front of the hot end, right under where it says "DO NOT TOUCH", there is a single screw in the middle which needs to be removed to allow the quick release plate to move. Unscrew the screw and swivel out the quick release plate.5) Remove the parts fan by unscrewing the 2 screws holding it in place, and disconnect the quick connect. Place fan and the screws aside.6) There is another screw holding the quick release plate, which was hidden under the fan you just removed. Unscrew that screw until the quick release plate is removable. Set the plate aside.7) Remove the nozzle fan.8) Remove the nozzel by pulling down. If you have filament attached, cut it at the top and then press the filament release lever, then pull down on the nozzle.9) The stepper motor should be totally disconnect at this point, you're going to drill a 4.2mm hole through the bottom (widen the filament hole) and then counterbore the J-head seat 7mm about 3mm deep.10) Follow videos online to connect everything from that point on, installation is reverse but you want to make sure you install the V6 correctly and tighten it.Last thought - you will WANT to get the screw-in m3 stud thermistor. It is unacceptable that during long prints, near the end, the temperature gets reset and printing totally stops. No way to force it to continue, or pick up where you left off. When you install the E3D V6, make sure you put in the screw-in thermistor!
