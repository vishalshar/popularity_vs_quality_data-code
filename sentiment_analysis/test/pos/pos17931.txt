My puppy had "puppy papilloma" in her mouth. Basically where she got several warts in her gums and around her jowels. We were told by the vet they were basically harmless but to keep her away from other puppies or immunosuppressed dogs and they'd go away on their own in a few months. We knew they were harmless but honestly they just looked gross and they were getting bigger. So, we ordered this immunity boost (puppy papilloma affects puppies because they have weaker immune systems) and within a few days her warts were noticeably smaller and gone in about a week and a half. Our puppy is a St Bernard x English Mastiff so with her size we used the one whole pack in that time. Definitely worth the money.***I have to mention our puppy was also on antibiotics for a UTI so that may have helped... but I noticed a difference in her warts almost immediately when I started using this product.
