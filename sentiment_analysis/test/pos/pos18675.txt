Come with an extreme good quality case, and the whole thing is made in USA.Not very accurate (some Celsius difference) tested with human skin and measured water temperature, but see the differences very well.If you're curious about the real temperature of a thing you need to go close as possible because as far as you are the camera is more inaccurate.The box doesn't lie: you'll see what you never did before. You can pick out very interesting thing.Disadvantage which is not the products fault, that you can't see thru windowIt's not an everyday use device, but sometimes it can be helpful.2 things is what you be aware:1. Is your phone/tablet compatible with it? (see the list on their webpage)2. Is your USB port facing the right way. If not you need to buy a micro usb extension cable, but be careful i bought 5 pcs of cheap chinese ones (5 different make) but none of it worked. Referring to the reviews, this should work: http://www.amazon.com/YCS-Basics-Micro-female-extension/dp/B00HAOKCE8/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top?ie=UTF8
