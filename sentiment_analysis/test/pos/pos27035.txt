Got this a few days ago, but so far it has been exactly what I expected it to be. It controls all my devices, and gets me access to functionality that I couldn't get with the classic universal remote, or with any other similar product on Amazon. Best of all, it can also control two of my devices over WiFi instead of InfraRed, which nicely gets rid of the line-of-sight limitation.Edit: Looking at the other reviews, I realize that most people start with the wrong expectation. This is a universal remote, which means that there is a learning curve, and an initial setup process. If you just want your plastic remotes available in the app as virtual remotes, then it can be a 5 minute process. Integration with Alexa, gestures, home automation tasks, etc.. all those take time to configure, and you should be prepared for that.
