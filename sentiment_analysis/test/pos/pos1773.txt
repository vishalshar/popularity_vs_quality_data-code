Absolutely love this product! I was running low on the one I received over a year ago and am so glad Amazon has this in-stock now. I've noticed a difference! My eyelashes appear darker, thicker and longer. It's great that this doesn't flake or dry out in the tube. It looks natural, but still darkens your lashes, like mascara. This does not clump when applied. I've also used this on my eyebrows to slightly darken them and keep them in place. :)
