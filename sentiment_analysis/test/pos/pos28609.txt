I do dogsitting and was interested to try out Petcube Play to see if it woudl work for me. I loved it right away! But let's start from the beginning:The package deserves separate mention because it's very beautiful and informative. I was afraid to be a bit confused, but the main features of the product and vision of the company were described very clearly (I loved their dog adoption initiative) and I got overall feeling of the quality product and the serious approach of the company.The Petcube loos amazing, as a part of room decor. It is important, because it seems it's here to stay :) I managed to turn it on, connect to WiFi and to the app instantaneously. My doggies did not react on the laser (it seems it's huge plus for cats), so I turned it off. But I definitely loved that I can check on them any moment if I need to go out. If I see they feel lonely, I can turn on the microphone and talk to them a bit. First I tried to make screenshots, but then saw I can actually take photos and record videos (they are being saved to the camera roll automatically) - that definitely makes life much easier.And I haven't even mentioned the app! It's a real social network for pet owners. You can share your pics& videos and watch others. As long as you can decide if the videos are private or shared, I am in love with the possibilities.Overall, I recommend Petcube Play to both sitters and pet owners. It looks & works flawlessly and does give you more control during the moments you have to leave your pet at home alone.
