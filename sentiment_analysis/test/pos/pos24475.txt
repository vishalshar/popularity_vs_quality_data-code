day one with my better back and so i really like it! I have neck and upper back issues caused mainly by my poor posture, so i'm a prime candidate for this product!  easy to use- took me a minute to figure out that i shouldn't have it SOOO loose around the knees to start and to get it into position. now that i've got it right, i feel a big difference in my posture- it was clearly horrible. looking forward to continued use and feeling a difference long term!
