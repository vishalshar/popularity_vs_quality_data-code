Being a firefighter for a living I can't help but think of every possible worst case scenario and try to be prepared for it.This is a very important to keep in the car and the visor mount is the most accessible place to keep it.I am fortunate enough Y to have real cars to drill on and got to test the product on actual seat belts and Windows.The blade is very sharp and cuts through a car seatbelt with little effort.The window punch is not spring loaded but can easily shatter the driver or passenger Windows, but do not expect this to get you through a windshield.Windshields are made with safety glass that has a layer of plastic between two sheets of glass, so this tool will crack the windshield but not get you through it.The side windows on the other hand will shatter and allow for a quick escape.
