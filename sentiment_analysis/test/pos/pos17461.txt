I heard about this along time ago, and I've been waiting to get it for a while. At only $35, it's a fairly inexpensive gadget to try - especially since the battery is supposed to last for 5 years and can be replaced.  It even works with my ten year old smoke detector.It really only took me five minutes to link it to my network and insert the roost into my smoke detector. Part of that setup includes downloading the app and synchronizing it with your roost.Once I tested the smoke detector, the Roost app sprang to life with a warning alarm. I then installed the app on my wife's phone as well so now we'll both get notified if the smoke detector goes off, and either one of us can silence it. The kitchen smoke detector seems to go off the most because of cooking, so that's where I put the roost.There are other similar products like these below that cost about $100, but I just wanted something simple, inexpensive and effective to start with.Nest Protect 2nd Gen Smoke + Carbon Monoxide Alarm, BatteryLeeo Smart Alert for iOS and AndroidUPDATE:  Check out this great customer service.
