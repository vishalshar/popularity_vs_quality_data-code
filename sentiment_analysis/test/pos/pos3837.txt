Our family travels often within Europe and the US and it has been a huge hassle to find pre-paid cards for the countries that we visit. When I succeed in finding the pre-paid cards I have to keep track of which one is where and how much is on it. In addition I have a card provided by my employer for which I have in a different mobile wi-fi unit. In the end I have about three mobile hotspots units that I rotate to ensure corporate compliance and family connectivity.I bought this unit for myself in December 2015 to reduce of hardware and sim card chaos. I am very pleased. The unit is bulky so it wins no design prizes. but... you can fit two sim cards in it and have the extra bonus of the Virtual sim card. The unit has performed flawlessly in the US, Denmark and Sweden. I had a firmware update go very bad, but customer support responded quickly and the problem was sorted out swiftly. The unit is surprisingly fast in acquiring a signal, whether from the local sim cards or the virtual one.So far this appears to be the solution to my vacation connectivity problems as well as a back-up for when my corporate sim can't acquire a signal.Very satisfied so far. Only gave it four stars since I haven't been able to put it through its paces yet. I will update the review after a few months of usage.
