This is a very durable, quality made product. I bought my first one years ago and it still looks just like the day I bought it and it still works just the same in spite of repeated use.  If you have mason jars around like we do, they're great for storing things. This makes it really easy to top the jar without having to deal with the metal bands and lids that seem to have a tendency to rust. Our small business cans its own bbq sauces so once we open a canned jar of the sauce, we can put this lid on it and use it easily - although you have to realize it will pour a lot of sauce at once if you don't pay attention to what you're doing. :)  Have also used to store leftover broth in the fridge and pour directly into the next recipe I need it in. There are just so many uses where this really works well. Strong durable plastic with a really good design.
