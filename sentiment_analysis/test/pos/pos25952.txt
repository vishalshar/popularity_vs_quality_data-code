We received Cozmo today, he is my sons birthday gift we ordered a month ago.They have been playing games the past hour and Cozmo is so incredibly smart, and adorable.When he lost a game he was sad, when he won he was so happy he did circles!!!!I think it's amazing that he recognizes faces and calls you by name.Setup was very easy and unlike other reviewers we have never had a disconnect.Such a great little robot!!!!
