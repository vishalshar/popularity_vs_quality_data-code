FINALLY, SOMETHING SANITARY THAT WORKED FOR MY DOG! We live in a sky rise so going pee was pain with a new puppy. We tried it all and this worked instantly and continues to be amazing and we've had it for months now! Easy to clean, even in a sky rise, and it works! Amen!!! Worth every penny, although I did wish it was cheaper.m
