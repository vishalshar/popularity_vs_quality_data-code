I use this with my iPod Touch (6G) and my EWI USB. I was considering the EWI-5000 or 4000s but this basically let's me use the same or better quality sounds and I can keep my sound generator (iPod or iPad) far away from where I am standing. I use this in live performances and it is really pretty cool. I became the bass player for my group by accident :-) using iFretless and the PUC+. Pretty neat.I would have given a higher rating if the documentation about MIDI and power/battery life was more complete.
