I love this stuff! I work night shift, and on my nights off I really have a hard time sleeping. I have tried several other sleep aids including benadryl and Ambien, and this is my favorite. There is no dry mouth, or waking up groggy with this. It is all natural, just melatonin and tryptophan. I take bottle about 45 min before I go to sleep and it works great.
