Wow, it definately works! The only issue I have had so far is getting to come back off of glass. I attached it to the back of my iphone 6, and the first place I stuck it was on a window. I thought I was going to break my phone getting it back off the window! I'm sure it will probably loosen up a bit once it's not brand new. I also tried it on the fridge, and kitchen cabinets....works great and was a little easier to remove. I like the plastic protective card that it comes with, to keep it clean when not in use. I can definately see myself using this and showing it off to my friends at work. I'm already thinking of all the other uses I might have for these, and I'll probably buy more.
