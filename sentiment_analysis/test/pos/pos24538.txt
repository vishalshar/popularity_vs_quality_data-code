I have had my Awair for a few months now. I absolutely love how it looks in my main living space. (NOTE: I paid FULL price for the Awair. $199. No discount or incentive was given to me for this review.)I consider myself to be very concerned with indoor air quality. I have an Airmega 400S, Blueair 550E, Fellowes AeraMax 200, and a few lower end Holmes purifiers throughout my home. Healthy living starts with healthy air.Since I've had the Awair, I've noticed that when I close my house and turn on the air conditioning, the CO2 levels spike well beyond normal levels. They are between 2500-3500ppm with the house closed. My score would dip into the 50s.A bit of research proves that these levels are unhealthy and something inside the home is wrong.I contacted a local heating and cooling company to help diagnose the issue. The problem ended up being a clogged vent pipe on my natural gas hot water heater. The emissions were being vented back into my home instead of out the chimney. I cleared the vent and now maximum CO2 levels with the house closed are about 1000ppm. My overall score is always over 85.I owe a HUGE THANK YOU to Awair. Without your product, I would have never known about this problem. We have a baby on the way and this problem could have easily lead to significant health issues for our child.THANK YOU for making our home a healthier place to live!NOTE: I paid FULL price for the Awair. $199.
