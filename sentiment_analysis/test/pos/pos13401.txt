Problem:  How to store a large Yakima cargo box with mounting towers and bars inside.  I had been wrestling it up on large wall hooks above the vehicles but that was such a job I dreaded the two or three times a year it needed to be mounted on the car.  After reading about several hoist systems and all the problems - cheap hardware, difficult installation, cable systems that jerked - I had given up on the idea although the 11-foot clearance in my garage seemed to be space going to waste.Solution:  I stumbled across the myLifter on a YouTube video and looked for it on Amazon.  Although it was quite a bit more expensive than other systems the solid user reviews convinced me it could be the answer.  And they were right!Performance:  Easy installation; hello?, I said very easy!  The purchased strap kit was a good fit for lifting the box and the hardware, instructions and iPhone app worked exactly as described.  The app informed me that my load was about 65 pounds; well within the pulley set-up's 100 lb. capacity.  Up it went, saved set points and called it a day after maybe an hour and fifteen minutes. . . and some of that time was just trying to figure out where I wanted to mount it.Now I'm thinking about a second myLifter for the two bikes that are hanging from a couple of those cheesy ceiling lifters with the 50 yards of nylon rope running down to a cleat on the wall.  I see that myLifter makes a double rack for just that purpose.
