I am an espresso drinker, so the taste was very welcoming to me. If you do not like the taste of coffee these might not be very appealing. The texture is that of soft gummy bears and almost melts in your mount which is pleasant and easy to consume. I also drink green tea, so I am familiar with the difference between the caffeine effect of each. These cubes are more link green tea in that the caffeine boost is more level and gradual that that with coffee or a shot of espresso which can take the top of your head off if you have not had caffeine for a while. I limit my caffeine intake daily to about 100 mg of caffeine from coffee or tea in the morning and have used one cube in the afternoon a few times so far and the affect was what I was hoping for, a pleasant pick me up with added alertness like with green tea but not the jolt I would have gotten from coffee. I will be experimenting with these cubes in the future. As with any caffeine product, you can build up a tolerance so keep that in mind.
