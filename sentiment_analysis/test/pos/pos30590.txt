Decent TPU case.  The fit is just right, and it protects as well as any slim TPU case.The socket leaves the center raised off the table a bit, so you can't just set your phone down and type on it.  it would be nice if the corners had little bumps to keep it level.The QuadLock system is similar to Garmin Quick Connect, but the lock is better than Garmin's.  Also, it can be turned any of 90 degrees without moving the mount itself.
