I am a lover of photography so having 50 extra Prynt sticker papers is great! The Prynt device comes with 10 but since I am constantly taking photos (and now with my Prynt devices, printing photos!) having extra pages is a must!Each Prynt device carries up to 10 pages at a time so once I am running low, I just restock the paper cartridge. I really like the fact that inside the 50-pack box, there are 5 separate sealed packs with 10 pages in each pack. This is convenient because instead of having to separate the pages manually, they already come prepackaged with the Prynt's full capacity.**Tip**Make sure to place the little blue paper that comes in every 10 pack, inside Prynt, the way the instructions say to place it.For anyone that is going to get a lot of use out of their Prynt device, this is definitely a worthwhile investment.Hope this helps!
