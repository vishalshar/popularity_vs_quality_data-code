(I bought this at full price, not being paid or compensated to review.)Wow!  The gameplay really exceeded my expectations and my kids (9 and 12) actually had fun playing Prime Climb!  The color coding that helps weaker players check their math is genius.So, gameplay: if you land on a spot occupied by another pawn it gets bounced back to zero, which gives aggressive/competitive players motivation. Trying to land on a prime to draw an action card  gives those with better math skills more of a challenge. The possibility of a lucky roll, like a two when your pawn is on 50 keeps players from feeling like winning is impossible when their pawn is the farthest from the goal.  There are tons of possible strategies to use when playing, which keeps it from getting old. And all that is just with straightforward gameplay, there are several other play options!Overall, it's a math game that my whole family likes, I'm ecstatic!
