Great game!  We just started playing it a week ago.  My kids are 5 and 6 and they love it.  My wife is not into things like MtG or D&D but she found this to be really fun.  Think fun and simple like Uno, but fantasy gameplay.  It really does simulate some of the aspects of a dungeon crawl.  It can be cutthroat or cooperative.  You can have a tie and there can even be no winners.  Even losing is fun.  We got overwhelmed during the boss fight and we were trying to buy off the monsters, but one by one we ran out of coins and wiped.  Some games take 5 minutes and others you wind up reusing the discard pile and they go on for a while.  Lots of variety, lots of fun.
