Overall I like the tracker, and I even like the fact that there is no display.  It seems to be accurate and consistent with its output, so no complaints there.  The main issue I have (had) is with the band.  I had the silicone version, and while it is comfortable, just beware that it is not overwhelmingly secure.  I was able to wear mine for about a month, then poof, I look down and the device is gone.  I wore it around the clock, but on this day, something either snagged it or the little button worked its way free.  In any case, it's gone, and no way I'll be replacing it.  I don't want something I need to babysit all throughout the day.
