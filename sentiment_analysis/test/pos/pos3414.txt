We have about 6 growlers of various makes and models in our house, and not one of them beats the uKeg. We have thankfully experienced none of the QA issues listed in other reviews, and have had nothing but positive experiences with ours. The only (minor) problems we have encountered are slight tarnishing on the brass housing for the vision glass and the O-ring occasionally unseating when a bartender gets a little too handsy with the cap. The only impact we've had with the unseated O-ring was a drop in pressure over a day, which we fixed easily with the installation of another charge.The craftsmanship on our model is excellent. Everything aside from the tap handle and the cap is made from solid metal. The plastic components are hefty and don't feel "cheap". The longest we've ever kept beer in it was for 7 days, but at the end of those 7 days it was still tasting fresh, with only a very minor "funk", likely from a less-than-thorough cleaning after the last usage and some flavor bleeding.We have quickly learned to tell bartenders to NOT fill it to a full 64 oz. though. The displacement from the charge in the cap is surprisingly high, so even 62 oz. can sometimes result in a little overflow. However, given that we always fill it at the same pub and the staff now know us not just by name but by growler, they have quickly learned to adjust. We also recommend not having the bartender set the pressure valve on top either. One enterprising bartender twisted the valve to all the way full, and the pressure got so high that it essentially was just shooting foam.
