This is a very good all around activity monitor.  The app is pretty good, works well on my iPhone.  Plus they do a good job of keeping you updated on your progress.  I don't use the sleep monitor and the heart rate monitor is hard to get working at times.  In addition the battery life is pretty good, i think it last about a week but we recharge it about twice a week.
