Awesome product for a great price. Most home monitoring systems cost hundreds of dollars. This is a reasonable price as well as a great product. The negative reviews on this product come from people that have no idea how to use electronics. Person says the app has too much phone access. I bet this person also has Facebook which collects way more personal info. The other user says the cable pulls the device yeah plug it into something higher bud. Will only use this product for home security now. Tested the alarm it is loud enough to scare an intruder away. You also get an event viewer as well as an option to contact 911 if you deem a break in. Great job Korner!
