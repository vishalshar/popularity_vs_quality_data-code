I have mixed feelings about these glasses.Optically they are on par with my EyeBuyExpress glasses. And they weight nothing. And the carrying case and method of tucking them away works exactly as advertised. And they are so thin that it is very easy to clean them.My only problem is that I can't find a way to hold these properly if I am reading off my computer, that is, if I am looking straight. If I am reading downwards these work beautifully. If I am lying down reading a Kindle or watching movies on a tablet, these work magnificently.They are also great in the dark because it's very easy to orient the case by touch and tuck them away without touching the glasses. With regular glasses I always end up smudging them while trying to put them away in the dark.I can't blame the glasses because for all I know it could be the shape of my nose, but it just nags me that I can't use them in all three scenarios.As for the warranty, there was an insert warning me to go to their website to register them, that only took a few seconds.If these things fit your nose for your use scenarios, you will probably be happy with them. I obviously don't need to buy more since the warranty is for life, but if I were to buy these for somebody else I would rather go with a pair of EyeBuyExpress glasses.Update: out of curiosity I tried to wear these over a band aid. This solved the issue reading off my computer, and I don't have to re-position them at all while lying down. I am guessing my particular problem was either the shape of my nose, or the oiliness of my skin, or maybe a combination of of both.Update: I have been averaging 2-4 hours a day wearing these without any issues but I still prefer to wear them with the band aid. I am upgrading my review to 5 stars because I am actually very happy with them.Update (9/17/2016): One of the nose pads broke :-( I don't even know how it happened.  What I do know is that it took less than five minutes to order a free replacement, and I am now wearing them just 3-4 days since I made the warranty claim. So yes, they do send you a fresh pair if they break. And yes, I am still putting 2-4 hours a day of use with these, they are great (as long as they fit your nose).
