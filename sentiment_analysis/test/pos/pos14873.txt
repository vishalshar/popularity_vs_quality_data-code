My daughter was clicking the pieces together meaningfully and looking through the manual to get up to speed on what the components do within fifteen minutes of opening the package.  I was amazed at how quickly she took to it, despite never having played with an electronics kit before.  This kit should set the stage for turning her loose on my old Radio Shack spring-terminal-and-breadboard kit.  The modular design really works well; it's probably comparable to SnapCircuits, but slightly more refined and intended for a slightly older kid.  I am very impressed with the littleBits system based on this set.
