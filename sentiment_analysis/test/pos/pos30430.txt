Got this to take car of some large size lip warts on our Sheppard/Huskey lips/mouth. We got it May 9th and May 29th they are almost all gone. I followed the directions by doubling the dose for the first weeks. Worth the money since it saved us a $50 vet bill plus whatever treatment they would have recommended.
