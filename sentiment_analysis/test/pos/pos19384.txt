My whole family loves these chips--they make a great snack and are very portable.  I'm cancelling my Subscribe and Save on them though, because every time I get a shipment, the individual bags are smooshed and all the chips are crushed.  I can get nice, fluffy bag of unbroken chips at the store instead.  Good product, not-so-good shipping service.
