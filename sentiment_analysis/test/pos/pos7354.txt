Really good!! As a man, I've tried a ton of no shows and they never stay on my feet! These haven't fallen off once yet in 2 weeks of use. They have rubber grips inside on the heel. They fit well (mens 10.5) and don't show while wearing loafers. However, the front elastic is a bit tight, at the end of the day I'll have a line across the top of my foot, nothing unbearable though. I think this is a trade off for never having them fall off my foot.
