Okay, I received this two months ago but have just FINALLY started using it. I will keep updating this post periodically.It took me a good 5 minutes to figure this baby out. Even after watching the videos, the straps were all over the place but I think it is due to my excitement and inability to be organized. After I got the straps comfortably around my knees, clipped the loose straps to the side and the straps in the middle, we are good to go! (I am using this at work in my normal rolling/swivel desk chair).First 15 minutes... I can actually say I feel instant relief on my lower back. It just FEELS aligned. I feel like I am sitting up straighter and I even had to adjust my monitors to sit higher so I am not looking down on them. Nothing hurts and everything feels comfy.30 minutes in... still pretty comfortable. I am going to see how long I can wear it without going crazy/ be in pain. I know the recommended is 15-20 minutes a day to start with.I took it off to go to meetings and things like that and have had it back on for about 2 hours, I can say it is still pretty comfortable. Though it is as if my body wants to naturally go into a slouch position so I have had to readjust about 2 times to make sure my posture was optimal.Overall, I would recommend and I think it looks quite stylish. It is by no means flashy and will not draw much attention.
