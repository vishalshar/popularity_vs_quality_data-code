I ordered the Bluesmart after seeing it in the Houston airport. It definitely stands out and caught my eye, but not in a bad way (e.g. LV suitcase, super plasticly ballistic stuff, or full aluminum). It is on the smaller side, but I like that because I usually travel with a carry-on and a backpack (Timbuk2 Swig). With this setup I can travel on pretty much any long weekend trip  you just have to pack *smart* ;)Here's what I like: Professional look. Not too flashy, not too boring. I feel fine taking this to work, vacation, travel around the city  no problem. Tough build. This case can certainly take a beating. Outside zippers are nice and secure too. Inside section dividers and zippers. This is a really cool feature! I can make sure my stuff is packed nice and tight and won't bounce around too much. This also comes in handy when I need to separate dirty clothing/shoes from my clean stuff. Laptop sleeve and protector. Perfect fit for my Macbook Air. Cool blue wheels, nice visual pop. Charging. Really helpful on longer trips with stops that aren't just airport/hotel/airport. Good for charging at friend's house too. Cloth and materials. The outer fabric, inside pockets, and inside lining is better than expected. I'm used to my Tum's synthetic, nylon feel. Nice little added benefit.What I don't like: I would love a full-sized version for multi-week or month long trips. This definitely gets the job done for long weekends, but it's going to be a stretch after that. Fabric and wheels pick up general dust/dirt  or in my case, cat hair. I make sure to clean off the wheels every now and then, stupid cat ;) Haven't used the GPS yet or remote-locking. I just don't lock it or use the included keys to unlock. Also, I usually know where my carry-on is, so GPS hasn't been needed, but I like that the option is there in case it goes missing. Let's hope I don't have to.Overall, I like the suitcase and feel it's a nice upgrade from my Tumi Tech.
