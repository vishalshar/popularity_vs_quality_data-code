These are delicious!  I was buying them at Costco but they switched to the "natural" brand (which means pesticides are used and apples are on the dirty dozen list).  I meant to purchase the small bags of 12 but ordered these by mistake.  The only advantage to the smaller bags is that they will stay crisp longer.  It just depends on how fast you get through the larger bag.  These are extra delicious dipped in Almond Butter!
