This product works exactly like I need it to.  When I need to use my phone hands-free, I just stick it to the bracket.  Other brackets I have owned, it takes 2 hands to clip it in and out.  The bracket has a magnet that is strong enough to hold my Samsung Galaxy 4 protected by an Otter Box Defender case.  I put the metal plate that comes with the bracket (comes with 3 metal plates) inside the rubber case and it holds my phone just fine.  It probably won't hold an iPad and maybe not an iPad mini.I have not experienced any interference to my GPS with the magnetic bracket which I have seen comments about.I also bought one for my wife and my brother and they love it as much as I do.The only issue that could cause a concern is that it mounts to the CD player where you would insert a CD.  Do not tighten the bracket too tightly.  It could crack the plastic.  Also, don't leave it attached for extended periods of time or if your car is going to be outside in the heat.  It could cause the plastic on the CD player to warp or crack.  You can play a CD while the bracket is mounted but you can't eject or insert a CD without removing the bracket first.It may cost a little more than others but this thing is well constructed and looks like it will last a long time.  I highly recommend it.
