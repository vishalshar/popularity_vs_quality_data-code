My first touch to VR came through using these goggles to "visit" Rocky Mountain National Park through Google Street View's VR mode. Wow. Virtual reality is pretty hard to explain, but you really know it when you see it.Personally, I feel like the Merge headset was best suited to watching short pieces of content such as a movie clip or aforementioned sightseeing. The inherently slow framerate in the current smartphones easily causes headache, and thus full-length movies were out of the question. By limiting my VR "sessions" to about 10min at a time the headache stayed away.It's useless to compare this to Oculus - you might as well compare a solid Acura to Ferrari. Oculus requires a pretty heavy investment, not to mention there's no laptop powerful enough to run the headset. (You'll need a desktop PC with a heavy-duty graphics driver).All in all, if you're looking to get into VR and want bang for your buck in VR, buy this. If you're still on the fence, you might as well wait for the 2.0.
