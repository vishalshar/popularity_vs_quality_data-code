I ordered these to go along with my windshield cover, and they are the easiest thing ever! A lot of people at work have asked where I found them. You just slip the cover over your side mirror, and use the locking slide to snug it up. There is a plastic knob at the end of the string for you to shut in the door so no one walks away with it, but I haven't tried that yet. I find it tricky enough to secure the sides of my windshield cover in the door, without adding something else, too.The Mirror Mittz can be applied or removed while wearing gloves or mittens. The material is thin, sturdy, and slippery enough that snow and frozen rain slides right off. I fold the windshield cover up and store it inside the Mirror Mittz cover.
