First off, I do like the sleek design. It isn't an eyesore on my bathroom floor like most scales. The set up was relatively easy (it took about 10 mins). The interface for the app is pretty basicÂ—nothing too fancy or over the top. As far as accuracy of weight, it seems pretty spot on for me. I weigh myself with the traditional, mechanical scales at the gym and it isn't really different than the results from the Qardio scale. I'm still trying to figure out how I can set goals other than for weight  and still seeing if that is a possibility. So far, it's been a "no nonsense" experience with this product.
