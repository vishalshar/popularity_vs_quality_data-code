I knew I wanted a video doorbell as soon as I heard about them.  After some research the Skybell HD was my first choice given all of the features it included over the competitors.  I'll list the cons first as there are only a few.  A hardware kit is not include, it is sold separately on their website.  So while most people likely have screwdrivers, you may want to keep this in mind if you'll need more than the standard screws included.  After opening the box and reading the documentation I discovered I could not yet install it, because I had a digital chime and needed a separate adapter piece ($12.95 from the Skybell website and it took 3 days to receive) and to properly mount it on my sloped siding I had to purchase a wedge kit ($9.95 from their website, same 3 days to receive).  This was rather annoying as for the price I would expect everything, especially items that are so inexpensive) to be included and it forced me to wait a few more days to install the doorbell.  Once everything arrived I was easily able to follow the instructions and install the doorbell and the adapter to my digital chime.  Performance so far has been everything I was hoping for.  It takes a few seconds to connect the video in the app when the doorbell is rang, but the video and audio has been clear and the cloud recording has been excellent with no issues so far.  The motion detection even on low can be a little sensitive also as a bush by my front porch frequently set it off when there was any wind if it was on anything other than the lowest settings.  But the motion detection has otherwise been very consistent.I will be sure to update this review if performance changes and thus my rating, but so far it has been exactly what I had hoped for.  Not including everything I needed was annoying, but given the overall cost the minor additional cost was only a minor nuisance.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to install a video doorbell.  I started the installation process very intimidated but it was much easier than I had expected and I am very happy with my purchase.
