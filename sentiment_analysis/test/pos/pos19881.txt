After trying 3D scanners that costs three times as much, we have settled on this one. Its approach to scanning is the fastest and the most accurate of all the scanners we tried. Alas, the resolution of the models, especially human faces, is too low for professional results. Full-body capture is a breeze and the software is good, but we cannot print our models without using additional scanning hardware and software to improve the resolution of some areas.Overall, if you understand you're not going to get the results of a $15K scanner, you'll be pleased with the ease of use and the results. Everything else out there is a joke.
