The first time I ever found these, I wish I had the hindsight to buy more than one bag. I had no idea how amazing they were, and as of today, they seem to be a very hard item to find in Louisiana. The blend of sweet and savory is perfect, and the crunchiness is addictive. My only regret is that I can go through a bag all too quickly..
