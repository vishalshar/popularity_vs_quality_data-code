More expensive than others, but is packaging was superb so it didn't be destroyed during shipping, great tutorial pamphlet so I didn't have to rely on youtube, the tools were higher quality than other screen distributors, and the screen protector came installed perfectly. Lastly and mos important, I couldn't tell that it was a replacement after fixing my phone. It's the first 6 I've fixed, and I've replaced probably over 100 screens on earlier generations. This was by far the best replacement screen I've ever purchased.
