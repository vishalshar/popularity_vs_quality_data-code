I am 26, use a wheelchair, and live on my own. I enjoy my independence but I had one too many close calls so I looked into emergency response systems. I tried LifeAlert's mobile system because I thought it was the only mobile system on the market, and I immediately returned it when I found this product.I love that this thing is SMALL - the closest equivalent I found was from LifeAlert and it was a brick (see pictures). This thing fits in my pocket, even though I wear super skinny jeans. Plus, it doesn't look like a medical device. Yes, I want the best care in case of an emergency, but I don't want to feel like I'm carrying something from the hospital all the time.GreatCall seems like a smart, modern company. I got this device and my profile all set up without speaking to anyone, and they even have an emergency app for your phone so you can get the same service from any device. LifeAlert, on the other hand, makes you speak to a bunch of people and fill out paperwork like it's 1995. I also like that GreatCall offers simple pricing tiers, no contracts, and does not try to sell you hard on additional services. LifeAlert reps put on the pressure tactics when I said I was only interested in the mobile system. LifeAlert also makes it very difficult to cancel your service, transferring you among several representatives.I've tested the service a few times and used it for one non-urgent issue. You get connected to someone within about 10 seconds and they have always been professional and courteous in my experience.Overall, this product is fantastic. Smaller, more portable, and cheaper than all the competitors I could find. And best of all it is waterproof so you can keep it with you everywhere. It has definitely made me feel more confident in living and traveling alone.
