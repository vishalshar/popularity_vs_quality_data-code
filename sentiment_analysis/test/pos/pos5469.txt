Both our Labs love it! They play chase/keep away with it in their mouth, tug o war, chew on it, I toss it in pool floats, toss it in the yard, it bounces in a playful way. Seems durable, they took to it right away, obviously doesn't have a funny taste or smell a lot of these type of toys have. I'll definitely be buying another so both dogs have one.
