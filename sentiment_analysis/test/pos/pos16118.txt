This is a great game for practicing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.  I got it for my 2nd grader for Christmas and she enjoys playing.  The math is still a bit of "work" for her, it takes some time and effort to do the harder multiplication and division (we do it in our heads, it would probably be less work and more fun if I let her use a calculator....hmmm, maybe I will try that...), but is a lot more fun for practice than worksheets!  Overall a great game, though not as exciting to her as Sleeping Queens or Mariokart :)
