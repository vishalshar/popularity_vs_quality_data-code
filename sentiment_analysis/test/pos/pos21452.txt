This cup is strong, but it can't stand for a full force. attack with a +7 long sword.... Or if you try to consciously knock it over.But Seriously it does good, just as advertised, it's a really cool suction design. that lifts effortlessly and if it's tapped it stays in place and resists. It takes about 5-10 lbs of force, I didn't hook that up with my scale yet, but I'd Imagine it would be around there. It's a gift for my Dad, he's in construction, let's see how long it lasts.
