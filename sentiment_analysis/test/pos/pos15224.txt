I have been using my Canary Flex for Several days and absolutely love it !!!! Set up was a snap. I had it up and functioning within 20 minutes. I'm not very tech savvy so that was great. It is very feature rich. I love the night vision mode. I am currently using it inside my home and have had no problems. The fact that it is small and blends right in is awesome. My brother has been raving about his Canary fora year and I couldn't agree more.The phone app works great. Real easy to navigate and switch between modes. The video is clear as is the audio. The wireless feature is great. I have been moving it around to different locations and not having to worry about a cord is nice.It definitely gives me peace of mind knowing when I'm away in keep an eye on my home and be alerted if anything happens.
