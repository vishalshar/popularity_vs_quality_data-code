I have been using this product for about a week now and I intend to continue to use it based on favorable results and update as I go.Initial impressions-My pores seemed to become inflamed by my nose and forehead the first day. I was not impressed.I noticed my reflection in the car window on day three and found my face to actually look smoother and looking hydrated and balanced.On day 5 I feel that some sun spots I have below my eyes have lightened. I found this impressive.My pores are still somewhat puffy and I am hoping this is my skin producing more collagen.I feel that may be the case because my face has a more plump/bouncy/youthful look.I am initially happy and like this product. I took a picture at day five and intend to post this and results in weeks to follow. For now I have a favorable yet still somewhat Leary feeling toward it. (Pores)At day 25 I am happier. My pores are slowly becoming balanced. My face is looking refreshed. I feel that if you want a cream that will do something in a positive direction, this will work. It may not be perfect but that is really sought after and as we know quite difficult to find.
