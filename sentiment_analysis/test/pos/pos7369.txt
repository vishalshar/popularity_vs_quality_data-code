Have been using my Remix Mini for the past couple months and it works great as a second computer in my office that I use primarily for streaming, email and other light tasks. Was a bit surprised to see that the Google Play store was removed from the device with an update a couple weeks ago, but side loading Google Play services and the store takes all of a minute, so it's not a big deal.However, be forewarned that, without side loading Google Play, it ships with the Amazon App Store, which is good, but doesn't have everything. Plus, without Google Play services, you're stuck using a browser for email instead of an app.That aside, this is great value for the money. I mean, for $60 I have a standalone PC that does what I need it to do. While it's not quite as slick as the Chromeboxes I've played with, it's 1/4 the price, which is awesome.
