My wife is very active and given that we live right next to Silicon Valley, she loves testing out new gadgets while supporting local startups with great products and ideas. That being said, Bellabeat's LEAF was the perfect gift to my wife for our anniversary.So far she loves it and is still exploring more features and uses.What is great:- Beautiful design and top-notch craftship, very light too- Very easy set up- Multiple ways to wear it makes a perfect fashion accessory for many occasions and outfits- So far most features used and activities tracked: general activity, sleep, smart alarm- Long life battery, no need to worry about charging- She collects compliments and curiosity comments almost daily.- Very user friendly App interfaceFrequent app updates with new features are ongoingWhat not so great:- When she reads the book in bed, the LEAF is thinking she is sleeping already, so we are trying to figure out how to either edit sleep time manually or teach the device to know. I am sure there is a way.Bottom line: if you are into Wearables and smart/fun technology to keep in touch with such important matters asactivity, sleep, breathing, monthly cycle, LEAF is the perfect gift/tool you or your loved one. Great for women of any age or group of interests.
