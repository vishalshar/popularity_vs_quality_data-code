This year I decided to get serious about action photography. I bought a maxed out IMac and a bunch of the new GoPro hero session cams so that I could do multi camera/ multi view videos of cars and bikes in my private collection. Think "Top Gear". This Drone and a soloshot have rounded out my capabilities. I now have a one man action team.Autel Robotics X-Star Premium: I would like to point out that I am no beginner to R/C. I have been flying R/C aircraft since I was a child.  I do fly much better as an adult and then technologies have come so far since then.  This drone arrived with the latest firmware and I was airborne in a mater of minutes. Same control setup as an R/C helicopter and many of the cheap play drones we have had. The main differences being that these GPS-Linked drones hover in one place and at one altitude basically hands-free. This drone has a lot of extra features not found with DJI Phantom series. These include large and very bright LED lights on all corners which assist with lower light flying. Heck, you can even fly at night if you are experienced with the LED orientation. I also like the automatic take off and land functions which have there own button as well as the return-to-home feature/button. Range has been good. The app works flawlessly. Battery life excellent. Battery charging is a snap! Picture quality OUTSTANDING! What more could you want.....Lastly, and highlight how simple this drone is to fly, my 8 year-old pilots this drone (with supervision) on beginner mode flawlessly. No need for prop guards if you fly sensibly and  take off and land on a firm/flat surface with under 10 mph wind. Buy one  yourself and Enjoy!
