My wife says: I have tried MANY mascaras - everything from Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancome, MAC, Aveda, Cover Girl, and Neutrogena,  Everyone of them leaves a degree of clumps or flakes on my lashes and eventually irritates my eyes, plus "looks" like I've got something on my lashes.  The Lamas Lash Masque is almost like applying a liquid paint to your lashes, then it dries and you don't feel anything on your lashes.  They are still soft and feel natural.  There is nothing that "flakes" off to get in my eyes.  No need for makeup remover because it washes off easily with a gentle soap and water.  I highly recommend this AWESOME product!
