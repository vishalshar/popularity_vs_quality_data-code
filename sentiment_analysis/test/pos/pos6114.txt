I bought this laptop for school use about 2 weeks ago. School for me starts in about a month so I haven't tested it out too much for every day carrying around. However, I have used it to play a few games on steam, and it has absolutely no problems running games on High, and older games on the highest setting. I also use this laptop to code, and I haven't had any issues compiling anything even with my multiple projects in visual studio. As an added bonus, this laptop also comes with a back lit keyboard, so late night coding sessions happen regularly. I would recommend this laptop to anyone going for computer science or a computer intensive field. If you're looking for a laptop that is lightweight, has a decent battery life, and solid specs, this laptop would be in your best interest to purchase.
