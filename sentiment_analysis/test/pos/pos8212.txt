This works really well and much more accurate than the variety of in-line scales I've owned.  There are no chances of leaks and since it weighs the tank, it's pretty accurate.  It gives several display options which are a nice feature and is back-lit to see in lower light conditions.  The only challenge I had is the insert into my grill had the hole for the tank and this doesn't sit on top of that very well.  That's more of an issue with my grill and this unit but I was able to get it to sit on there after playing with it a bit and since haven't had any issues and it hasn't fallen over.
