We just got this yesterday and hooked it up.  Took some figuring out to add it to a second phone.  We had fun with it all day.  Although. We think we freaked out our dog yelling his name, poor guy.  It's a great product to check out our little dog,  he seems to be doing what we thought all along.........sleeping.  It also lets me check in on my husband.  I now know that he is actually on the couch when he says he is doing yard work . Loove this product!
