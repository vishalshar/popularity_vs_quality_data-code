Impressive! I was looking for a cheapish home device that didn't take a tech guru to set up. I asked around and found this. I read the comments and wasn't sure if I should buy it. But I am glad that I did! It is very easy to set up, looks good, and doesn't cost that much. The ping notices don't bother me that much. I am mostly checking in on my cats. I wish it did roam around the room but maybe that will be added later. It shows up on my phone (even with sound!). Highly recommended. (a funny story - so, my sister and I went on vacation in Hawaii and this was going to be the first test for my Canary. I left my cats in good hands so I was at peace. After a couple of days, my friend called me and said that she could not find Vinney, my newest cat. He is a bit shy around new people. So after checking all the closets and still not being able to find him, I said, "let's wait one more day and then we'll start to panick". So early next morning, my phone pings and I check it and there is Vinney sitting right in front of the Canary looking around! What a butthead! I called my friend and peace was restored. thank you, Canary!"
