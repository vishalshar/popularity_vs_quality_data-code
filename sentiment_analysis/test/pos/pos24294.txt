Ordering my iPhone 6 on Day 1 and wanting to have a case in-hand immediately, I ordered this blind.  It arrived in hand along with my iPhone by the good folks at UPS and was immediately put to use.I wanted to have a durable, yet compact case for my phone that provided a decent level of protection (no simple gummy back) and this meets that standard hands down.  I also use Strava and other cycling apps a fair amount, so having a case that can mount to the bike at some point down the road is also part of the goal.  I haven't tested that portion of it out yet, but the snap-in/snap-out back is VERY secure so I have no doubt that this will work.The magnet back is a nice touch - a friend of mine had a similar case and this feature will be useful in a number of ways.  Overall, highly impressed with this case at first glance.  Only downside is that I wish the fit were a bit tighter - no real complaint, it's not loose by any stretch of the imagination, but I'm slightly nervous about the phone staying put on my bike.  If it were a cheap phone, I wouldn't lose sleep over it, but if I'm putting a $750 piece of equipment on a bicycle, I want to make absolutely sure that it's not going to move.  I count this as my paranoia though, rather than a fault, so definitely no deduction here.
