I can't say enough good things about this product and their immune boost as wellMy service dog has severe allergies, is on shots and before this company and their great products she was a golden retriever without much hair. She has been on this two times a day for 6 months and she has a coat to die for and her skin is also clear. She is still on monthly allergy shots but so much healthier since she started this.I highly recommend it to all dog owners especially those with pets with allergies.
