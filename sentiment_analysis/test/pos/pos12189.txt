Bought this comb for my brother, who is actually a very hard person to buy gifts for, gifts he actually likes that is. When he opened it and seen that it was a comb, and bottle opener he got a huge grin on his face. The go part is equally amazing as it fits well in your pocket, or even wallet so it is always with you if you feel the need for a brushing. It being stainless steel is definitely a plus because if you've ever had a plastic comb you know how easy they are to break and at the price you can't beat it for the product. Overall a 5 star for us. Definitely going to recommend to all the beard growers I know!
