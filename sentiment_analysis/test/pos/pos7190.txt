Held off a while to actually get this case after looking at some of the negative reviews. Decided to finally just purchase it and give it a chance and count the money as a loss if it was a total piece of crap.  I'm glad to say it is far from it. I am used to wearing a G-Shock, so this case is very comparable in feel and  durability. I work out often, and this holds up well.Very easy to install .. seriously, a monkey could install this case... and I'm not even talking about the kind that go to space, I'm talking straight out the jungle monkeys...There is no screen protector, but I just simply bought some separately and tailored them to fit within the parameters of the case. It's not water proof, but I knew that getting into it and that is cool with me.Would recommend this case and buy again.
