This product is so charming: from the sweet words of Lara Spear Riley's book to the little Switch Witch herself (and her adorable cauldron), this is clearly a product that is made to last and will return to our home every Halloween from now on. My three year-old daughter loves to wake up and find where the Switch Witch has "moved" overnight, and constantly asks us to reread the book, whose illustrations are brightly colored and, importantly for us, not at all scary (many other Halloween books frighten her). I love that we now have a solution for the perennial issue of Halloween candy that is still lingering at Thanksgiving and that my daughter has an extra incentive to behave ("Switch Witch only comes to girls and boys who are helpful" is a frequent refrain in our house these days.). I also love that the product--from the book to the packaging to the witch herself--is completely USA made, and that the creators are parents themselves. This was such a great purchase--we're not even halfway through October, and my daughter is already enamored. Thanks, Switch Witch!
