Pen itself is very cool. My son received one for Christmas and it jammed/clogged the first day. Customer service by 3doodler was absolutely amazing - they replied back to my email asking for help within an hour. After multiple attempts to unjam the pen, and a handful of emails with customer service, the company happily sent me a brand new pen. Replacement is perfect and my son (11 years old) is creating some amazing creations. This is a great gift for anybody who is creative or thinks like an engineer and likes to create and design.  Can't rave enough about the customer service.
