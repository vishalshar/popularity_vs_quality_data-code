I purchased my canary after choosing agonizingly over the Nest Cam and Piper NV. The canary camera won me over, and the setup was straightfoward. The packaging is top-notch, up there with the big boys. The included cable and charger was slick as is the build quality of the canary itself. After using it for a few days i believed the hardware works wellHowever, the Android App that came with the Canary refused to playback from the Cloud, so for now i can only give it 4 stars.Also i wished you can download the video from the laptop or web interface instead of app only (storage issues), and for some strange reason, the canary doesn't do that.Apart from that i'm relatively satisfied with the purchase.
