I love my leaf! I do get lots of compliments on it when it's showing. If I want to be more discreet, I clip it to my bra or wear the necklace on the longest extendable size.It seems to track skeep fairly accurately, except for when I'm hitting the snooze button in the morning. I've noticed that if I "snooze" 8-8:30 (meaning I'm awake, but in bed, usually on my phone) the Leaf thinks I was asleep until 8:30. Seems like no big deal because you can adjust your sleep and wake up times. However, when you adjust your sleep and wake up times, it resets your sleep cycle data. Using that 8:30 wake up time, Leaf will tell me I had 30% deep sleep, but if I adjust it to 8:00, the light:deep sleep ratio changes completely and looks nothing like it did before the adjustment. It will often instantly switch to say I had 60% deep sleep. I also wish you could input periods of awareness. I do have anxiety and deal with racing thoughts so sometimes I will be awake from 3-5am. If I don't move much, the Leaf tracks that I am still asleep and if I attempt to adjust it I lose the sleep data for that night.I have contacted developers to leave feedback and they responded within a day and let me know they were working on my suggestions already.The activity tracker seems pretty accurate, too. No rea complaints there.Period tracker took two cycles to get the start and end day exact but now it's on point!  I also love the meditations they offer.I have read that people become obsessed with counting their steps on the Fitbit but I haven't experienced this with Leaf. If wears like pretty jewelry and I often wear it under my shirt so I can forget I'm wearing it, just like any other necklace. You have to sync the Leaf to the app to get your data which I do about twice a day. I think the Fitbit having the information on your wrist, more visible and constantly self-updating would be much more maddening.
