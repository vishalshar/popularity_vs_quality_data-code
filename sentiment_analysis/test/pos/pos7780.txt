Great product for those who can't afford the more expensive Pantone color pallets, but I do wish that it had more color. It would be great if they had  an alternate version that had the different tints and tones of the colors instead of just opacity levels but it is a great concept and for your basic color pallet this is a great starting point to ensure that the color you want is the color you get. I also like how compact it is. I like that I can toss it in my laptop bag to take with me on appointments or working out of the office and still have the reference guide at my side.
