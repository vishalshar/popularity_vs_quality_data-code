This is a well-built, sleek, high-quality portable projector.  Being so small and running on a battery, it should not be expected to perform as well as a larger full-featured plug-in projector.  It does not have zoom or keystone adjustment.  You basically have to point it perpendicular to the screen to get a rectangular picture, otherwise you would be watching a trapezoid.  Its resolution is less than 720p, and I have noticed artifacts in high-detail images.  Audio from the internal is almost nonexistent.  But it is big power in a tiny package.You get it in a cube-shaped sturdy box that you can tell has been designed with care.  Opening it up, each item is packed into perfectly shaped foam packaging.  It comes with a slim remote and a stand with legs designed to bend and grab onto objects if needed in atypical settings.  I used this to wrap the stand around my bed's headboard and project onto the wall.  It also comes with charging cable, HDMI cable, and cables for other devices.  To connect with an iPhone I neededÂ Apple Lightning Digital AV Adapter for Select iPhone,iPad and iPod Models (MD826ZM/A).I use it to watch movies in the bedroom on the wall, without any projector screen.  Probably not bright enough for presentations unless you turn off most lights.  I plan to take it with me on vacation trips where I may want to display photos from my iPhone.  Usually I play movies from my laptop with the HDMI cable, and the sound plays from the laptop.  However, if I use the iPhone to play videos I would need to bring a separate speaker since it automatically sends audio to the cube, and I can't hear anything from it unless I put my ear next to it.  But it would be great for displaying photos off of the iPhone.  For the price, I think it would be more appropriate if it came with 720p resolution.  But the portability, quality and execution of this device is done quite well.Pros:- Tiny, sturdy cube- 1.5 hour battery life- Bright enough in dark settings- Stand wraps around objectsLimitations:- Some artifacts in high-detail images, possibly due to sub-720p resolution- Fan noise somewhat loud in a very quiet setting- No keystone correction, zoom (but hard to find in any projector of this size)- Speaker volume useless, need separate speakers- Remote only works when pointed to the back of the cubeI received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
