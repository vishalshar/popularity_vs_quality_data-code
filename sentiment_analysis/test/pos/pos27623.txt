The package came with mug, strap, removable(small strap for affixing to bags, purses, etc), mug sleeve, cute coffee bag, 2 stickers, and a heartfelt thank you letter. Straps were stowed in cup for shipping. I like the faux leather, because as faux implies, no animals were murdered to make it... which is pretty cool. Besides my activist point of view, I really like this travel cup. I like to walk my dog in the morning and on weekends, and it's always a pain to handle my coffee and pick up her "business". Also, we walk around 6 miles on the weekend and I am left holding my empty coffee mug for the remainder of our walk. Not any more! I am a girl who loves my carabiners! I usually hook my keys to my belt loop for ease of comfort and ease of access and you can do the same with this mug! I would recommend this only after you've finished your beverage- unless you have some heavy duty pants/belt loops.I however use the full strap around my shoulder, both styles are very convenient. The sleeve appears to be a brown hard plastic(like the mug), however it's exterior is covered in the faux leather. It doesn't slip like another reviewer had mentioned. Also, it is EASY TO CLEAN if you have small hands or simply use a bottle brush(for baby bottles). I drink my coffee pretty fast, so I can not tell you whether this lets hot beverages get cold.  And quite frankly I don't care... I purchased it so that I no longer have to tote around my empty mug on walks. As far as I can tell, it does not leak. I've attached a small video showing that when I shake it or tip it upside down, it has no leaks (sorry for the shoddy footage).  The only thing I would suggest to the company is to also add two key rings with this item, however until that happens I recommend to any consumer to purchase 2 small key rings to place on each hole where the small hooks are suppose to clasp. Placement and removal of the strap hooks lightly scrapes the plastic in the area the clasp edges come in contact with and might cause damage/breakage over time. Also, these key rings would also help with ease of placement/removal of hooks, since they should be less wide than the plastic holes. When worn with the strap each end, the top end of the horn (naturally) points downward, since the lid is the heaviest part of the cup. However, if you claps both hooks to each other and then to the top hole (or top key ring as I suggested) it shouldn't be a problem. Overall, I am VERY satisfied with this product and would suggest for fellow dog walkers and traveling coffee drinkers alike.
