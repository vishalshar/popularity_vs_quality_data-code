I really, really like how the top band feels. It's super smooth and super satisfying to touch! The padding on the ears is nice and soft and comfy, and I can wear these with no trouble for hours! I don't notice myself sweating, either. The controls are super handy, although they're a bit high. I think this is because of the microphone, though, so I don't mind. The cord feels nice and smooth, although I worry about the end of it fraying eventually as it lacks a flexible covering at the end. I don't know technical terms for this stuff, sorry! It's just...cord, then bam, it's the end of the cord, and there's no bendy bit. But then, I've had cords in the past that DID have that bit fail anyway, so I'm probably just being paranoid.As for the sound, it's great! I'm noticing some instruments I haven't before. ...I'm also noticing that a few of my songs intentionally include crackling or static that I never noticed before (such as Feel Good, Inc.), which is a great way to spook someone who just bought the most expensive headphones they've ever owned, haha!Most important to me is the ability to block out external sound, as I easily get overloaded by noises in the environment. They held up well during a trip to WalMart, tested with relatively quiet music (Dean Martin), so that's excellent! Obviously they can't block out a busy street when you're right next to it, but they fare far better at muffling it than my Sony earbuds do. In this price range, I've noticed that headphones with active noise cancellation tend to sound....pretty horrible, and they don't really do the job well. The isolation of these is very good as it comes with excellent sound that's not compromised by noise cancellation or Bluetooth. Hooray!I haven't had a chance to test these on a crowded bus yet, but I'll update when I do.All in all, I really like them! I do have one question, though, and that's if there are replacement parts (cords, ear pad covers) available anywhere. Parts often wear down over time and I'd feel much better knowing I could fix it when that happens. Thank you!
