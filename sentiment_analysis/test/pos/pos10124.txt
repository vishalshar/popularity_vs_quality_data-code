I ordered Sphero 2.0 to use as a movie prop in a Sci-Fi short. I also ordered the orange nubby cover. I love this product. It is easy to learn to use and to control. It is tough; you can run it around on a hard floor and crash it into the furniture and the dog with no ill effects. With the features like dancing, it exhibits enough personality to be a convincing character in the movie. Although in the movie we'll be adding a voice and sound effects post-production, the sounds that the Sphero makes are fun - adorable really. When we're done making the movie I'm sure that this will remain a favorite toy for my kids. I may end up having to buy another one.
