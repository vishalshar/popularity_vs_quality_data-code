The Luma is a special product. I had it replace TP-LINK Archer C7 AC1750. I am truly pleased with my decision.A few notes:- the great design of the product makes it look like art in my office- my wife often complains about the internet from my iphone i can now see if its the computer or my router (often the website)- allows me to reset the guest network without reboot the router- any questions I had about the product were quickly resolvedI am using a super computer (iphone) and now I have a router to go with it. a great contemporary update to the world of routers.
