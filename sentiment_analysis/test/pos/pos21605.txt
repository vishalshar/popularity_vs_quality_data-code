Since my cat's bladder stone surgery in March 2013, we've been monitoring her urine on a regular basis, to make sure crystals are no longer forming, after switching her to a bladder health food.  For the last 2 years I was able to obtain samples by using a black, plastic pellet type litter, although some times it would take several days to over a week before she decided to use the special litter.  With this last attempt at collecting a sample we were not having success, and it was stretching into 2+ weeks.  I made the mistake of shutting her in a room with the special plastic litter, that also happened to have a pet bed and a plastic basket I use for recycling paper.  Yup, once she peed in the pet bed, and the other time in the plastic basket.  I then tried the Kit4Kat sand, and after her breakfast, I shut her in the bathroom with the sand.  Within 4-5 hours I had wonderfully huge puddles of pee in the sand for the sample.  It is labor intensive, though, to siphon up the pee with the pipette provided.  Instead of using the little tube also included for the sample, I transferred it to a specimen cup with a lid that I had gotten from my doctor's office.  (I don't know what quantity they need for the labwork, so I err on the side of too much, rather than not enough.)I agree, it is horribly expensive, but well worth it to me if she continues to find this sampling medium acceptable.  I am going out of my way, for as long as I can, to avoid having the vet withdraw the sample from her bladder with a needle.  Given her surgery, I figure her bladder has been through enough already.  As a suggestion, just use a smaller litter box to put the sand in--that way, the amount appears larger than it actually is, with fewer bare spots in the box.  My 'dedicated' sampling box is one made out of some kind of pressed paperboard, used with a plastic catbox liner.This product gets 4 stars instead of 5, only because of the expense.
