I just received it and I do like it so far. Disregard the 1 star review it does have the alarm function you have to set it in the phone application. The tracker is an awesome product with minimalistic style. The step tracking is accurate and it tracks my sleep well. The sleep tracking feature is automatic which is awesome because you can't forget to turn it on. The battery life is pretty amazing being that I've have this tracker on for three days straight and it's showing 96 percent battery. It's also really water resistant so you can shower with it on and not have to worry. The only thing I see that isn't perfect is that I have to sometimes switch the band to the inside of my wrist to get accurate readings on the heart monitor. But that may just be me though. Also the companion app is really easy to use and fully featured. BUY IT. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative to more expensive models that's fully featured and still looks premium you found it.
