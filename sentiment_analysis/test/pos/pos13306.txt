I used these for a lengthy drought we had in Puerto Rico this year. They do not replace a shower but it's definitely a good temporary solution. They are large enough and don't dry out quickly. They don't leave a sticky feeling on your skin once your skin dries out, this was actually surprising. And, they don't have a particular scent to them. The only negative thing I could point out is the price. If you plan on using them on a daily basis then maybe it's too much for 10 wipes and you should look elsewhere, otherwise I highly recommend them.
