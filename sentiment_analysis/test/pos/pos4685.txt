I love this cup.  We are trying to move away from plastic and glass is our preferred alternative.  This is the only glass sippy cup that I have found and my toddler loves it.  I will say that he bit a hole in the silicone lit by chewing on it but it still works we just have to be careful not to tip it over which is fine.  Before he bit the hole in the spout it didn't leak at all.  I love that I can just buy a new lid for it and don't have to buy a whole new cup, but at this point we don't need a new lid we just don't tip it over.
