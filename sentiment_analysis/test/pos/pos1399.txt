FINALLY!  Something technical that captured their attention!  They absolutely loved assembling this kit.  You were right, the act of building it, made it their own.  Something they built.  They're proud of it.  And playing it was very interesting.  Learning to assemble the buttons and switches needed to complete the puzzles/levels.  We eagerly await new levels and new technical challenges!!THANK YOU PIPER TEAM!!!Edit: How could I forget to mention their customer service?!  Their customer service is SUPERB.  I don't know how such a small team does it, but their attentiveness and quick replies are admirable!
