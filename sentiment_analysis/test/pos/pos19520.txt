I just unboxed my Cuff. The setup process was quick and easy, only about 7 minutes. I downloaded the app onto my iphone6s, then added my contacts and tested out the alert and buzz feature. Both worked flawlessly.I'll post an update if any issues arise as I continue to use my Cuff.I'm surprised to see that others have posted negative reviews. Hopefully more than 3 people will review this product.
