Way better than the R1 (the first model) which crapped out after a couple days on me. It is in my opinion the best 3D printer you'll get for your money and for the quality in this up and coming market. Also the fact it works pretty much OUT OF THE BOX (I downloaded Cura software instead of the poorly designed MatterControl stuff this comes with) is pretty freakin sweet.On a side note I ordered the 3-D Doodle (not to be confused with the Doodle 3-D) which is a much cheaper and versatile printer server (and 3-D designing tool). The kids love it for their projects and I can now print wirelessly from another computer on my network and not tie up the primary family PC. Check it out here for deets: http://www.doodle3d.com/First things first, 3D printing is not for the faint of heart nor those that do not want to be their own tech support. Personally I have had no major issues like resetting firmware or having to replace a part so I mean this in a general sense of maintenance you MAY have to do.This is not a HP or Epson Printer that has been field tested numerous times with engineers fine tuning it for years. This is a home grown Kick Stater based company that is trying to break into the industry over the last couple years and beat out the bigger names with something that:A) Works consistently (I'm looking at you DaVinci!).B) Has phone support with English speakers.C) Has a online support community with documentation (this is really important if you have to be your own tech support)D) Is open source so you can run your own software (RepRap, Cura, etc) AND use your own equipment (again looking at you DaVinci!).  *I'm gonna expand on the "use your own equipment" part. DaVinci currently forces you to buy their over priced filaments much like the way HP  and other ink companies force you to buy their over priced ink. They do this on Razor Margins (sell cheaper product but  over price the add-ons and refills) which I think is crappy.  *Also, you can modify this since it is a variant of the Arduino Boards which is great for future tinkering and firmware changes.E) Has a large HEATED Bed to allow for better and bigger prints. Most printers are too small to do anything decent.F) Can use multiple types of material from, ABS, PLA, and Exotic types to print from.G) Auto leveling! unless you enjoy tweaking this all the time...don't cause yourself the stress and let this printer do it for you.With all that said, I am really happy with this new version and the company behind it given where they came from.
