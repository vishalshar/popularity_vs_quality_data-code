I remember when this phone was a dream. Now a reality and it's an awesome device. Love the look and feel of it. The storage works awesome, it's a fast device. Has a led notification light on the bottom which I thought would be weird but actually works great. The speakers are front facing and JAM! GREAT 1080p panel that goes very bright and looks crisp. I don't think you can buy a better phone for the price. Also has type c. Please note, this does NOT come with a charging brick, does come with the type c cord and sim eject tool. Also comes packaged very nicely. A+ for presentation and AAAAAA+ for the phone! Awesome job from a small team. Nextbit Robin is a solid phone for Android lovers!
