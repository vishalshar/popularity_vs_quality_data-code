Love this watch. Wish that it measured continuous pulse ... but that feature wasn't a deal breaker. I have a very thick wrist and was concerned about it fitting. Couple that with the fact that I HATE rubber/plastic/silicone bands and I was destined for a replacement band from go. So I purchased one of the stainless steel mesh bands in black (see link) to go along with the watch. I took my watch from something I really liked, to something I absolutely ADORE!! The metal mesh bands are cool, comfortable and account for a much larger wrist if necessary. Looks fantastic. I also have a Withings scale at home. Between that and this watch, I've got all the info I need to continue getting healthier.18mm Magnetic Milanese Loop Stainless Steel Magnet Closure Lock Watch Band For Withings Activit√© Pop (YESOO Retail Packaging - 180 Days Warranty) (Black)
