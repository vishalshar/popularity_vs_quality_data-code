First, this is an excellent product and implementation of a WiFi controller for your garage door.  I had been looking awhile for a WiFi based garage controller and even purchased a competitors unit, but sent it back because it did not work.  This device exactly as advertised.  I have found it to be very reliable and stable.  It is an elegant design that just works.I had initially purchased a refurbished unit as a trial.  If that worked then I had plans to get two more units for a total of three.  At first the refurb worked great but it suddenly failed.  An email to the inventor Denis was answered immediately with a new unit on the way.  I had a number of email questions and they were all answered immediately and expertly by Denis.  The service and support has been outstanding.  I was so impressed with the service I went ahead and ordered two more.  They all have been functioning perfectly and reliable for about a month.I highly recommend this smart garage door controller.  I commend Denis for both the product and service.
