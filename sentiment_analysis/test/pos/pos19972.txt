I break these up into small pieces to put in a treat ball for my dog. Sometimes I'll get a good bag that breaks up easily and the next bag will be hard and I have to use a scissors. I suppose that is a sign of a truly organic natural product (at least it is to me). The majority break up nicely though. They are expensive but last quite a while and are high quality so I keep purchasing them. I guess my doggie is worth it! She loves them and goes crazy when she sees the bag come out!
