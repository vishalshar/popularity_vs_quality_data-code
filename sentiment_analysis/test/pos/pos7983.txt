I LOVE this strap!! I had the standard strap that came with my Canon Camera and of course it does what is meant to.. but that in no way means it was comfortable!! I have had this BOOMR-RED strap a few days and used it for new years eve photo shoots at my church and it WAS A DREAM COME TRUE the weight of my camera no longer is a pain in the neck (PUN INTENDED ;) ) I would tell all my friends to get one of these!!
