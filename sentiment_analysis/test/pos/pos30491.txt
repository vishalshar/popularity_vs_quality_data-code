My 6 year old step daughter is very happy with this gift. Some other reviews suggest that there are no actual flowers in the seed packet, but we are seeing flowers sprout already. The started growing after only two days inside the house which makes the experience even more fun for her. She likes to play with other small toys she owns with the fairy and garden house.
