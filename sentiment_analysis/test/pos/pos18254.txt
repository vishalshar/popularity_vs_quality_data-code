Replaced my 7 year old Razer Deathadder that finally died.  I've got to say I'm loving this mouse.  I'm a claw grip guy and this mouse feels great.  I love the design of it as well.  Doesn't have that extreme "gamer" aesthetics.  Very comfortable.  Side buttons are nicely out of the way.  Love the rubberized side grip on the left of it as well.As for configuration, one great thing about this mouse is that it is driver-less. It allows you to customize a lot of details about it, but the tool that does it is a simple executable and all configuration is saved and processed on the mouse itself.  Allows you to plug and play on any PC without worry about to reconfigure it.The sole reason it's not a 5 star is because the RGB lighting is really not that accurate.  This seems to be a common problem across Mionix's mice from my research.  All colors it can produce have some weird violet rainbow coloring bleeding through and just generally inaccurate.  It's especially bad on lighter colors.  It really cannot do white at all well. White was what I was hoping to set it at.  Given how expensive this mouse is I'd expect better here.  I set it on a blue and it looks pretty good.Mionix's motto of "It's all about the craftsmanship" definitely feels present here for the rest of the mouse.
