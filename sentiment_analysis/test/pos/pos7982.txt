I love this camera strap! I wanted a great strap at a great price and that is exactly what I got. I wear my camera all day working at one of the World Birding Centers in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Finding a strap that was both comfortable and also made me feel secure walking around with a 200-500 mm lens on my camera was a priority and that is what this camera strap did for me. It distributes the weight of my heavy lens so my neck isn't stiff and sore at the end of the day.I would recommend this camera to anyone.
