I used to own a Garmin GTU10, this has replaced it almost exact same functions.  The Garmin app was better and the unit had more option/functionality but from a tracking perspective this collar works great and the battery life is excellent.  Keep in mind that these collars check their location at a fixed time period of somewhere around 5-10 minutes so its possible your pet will be out of the geofence until it does its check and that is when you will be notified.  So they could be out of the "whistle zone" for a few minutes before you are alerted.  At that point it turns the cellular radio on and it will do a 2 way notification with your phone revealing its location. Overall I like this tracking device and highly recommend it.
