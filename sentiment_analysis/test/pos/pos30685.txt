No one likes the awkward holiday arguments over politics and "when are you getting married?" I avoided those conversations completely this Christmas by gifting Joking Hazard. My whole family (the grown ups, anyway) had a great time and laughed our asses off. Easy to learn and play, and no knowledge of the comic is required. If you like Cards Against Humanity, this is an excellent way to mix things up.
