Works great!  Has eliminated the mouse, chipmunk, red squirrel problem in my yard. Much more effective than a live trap, and much less dangerous than poison.  Safe around dogs, although they do like to check the Raticator for dead critters and pull them out.  It can be a little hard on the trap, even with the outdoor container.
