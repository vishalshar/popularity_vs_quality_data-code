I've been wearing my hearing amplifier a few days a week for almost a month now-- and I love it!  For about a year, I have felt like I can't hear as well as I feel like I should.  I went to a hearing clinician to get my hearing evaluated, but she says that I don't have enough hearing loss for a hearing aid.  With my amplifier, I can select how much "extra volume" I want. Using the Solo makes me feel like things are back to normal!  I can hear things more clearly, find myself saying "what?" significantly less, and feel like I can really follow conversations now without any confusion or asking people to repeat themselves.What's exciting about this amplifier is that it is small enough to fit in my ear without anyone noticing, so I can wear my hair either down OR up, without anyone noticing the hearing amplifier in my ear! Also, the volume controls are easy to use! It was easy to get started with the product because it seemed like any information I needed was simply explained in the manual. They even tell you how to clean it and troubleshoot for any problems (although I can't say I have had any issues).Most importantly, I can hear again!!!! This product was definitely worth the $399!!! I'm so happy I stumbled upon Audicus's Amazon page!
