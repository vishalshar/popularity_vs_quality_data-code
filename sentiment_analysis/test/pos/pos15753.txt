I've been using this for about 6 months now and although I've purchased 2 other products while using this, I keep coming back to Jonre soothing hydrant cream because it just works for me. I'm over 65 with dry skin and this quenches the dryness and improves the texture of my skin while making my surface wrinkles much less visible.  Truly moisturizes without feeling greasy. My skin looks dewy like it did 15 years ago. This company got it right and their prices are reasonable for the quality of the product!  This is a keeper in my daily regime!
