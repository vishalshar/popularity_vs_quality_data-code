These bars worked awesome for my wife. She has awful morning sickness, and as soon as she wakes up she slowly eats an Anchor bar, and is able to start functioning shortly thereafter. NOTHING ELSE BUT THIS WORKS FOR MORNING SICKNESSAnchor bar gives 20g of protein, ginger, and vitamin b6. Very few ingredients, which is always good. A very mild blueberry taste, which is perfect for someone with taste aversions.Think about all the times where you need quality nutrition but can't stomach a meal because of morning sickness? Anchor Bar completely solves that dilemma, and it makes you feel better.Backed by a Harvard doctor, so you know its safe.I can't recommend this product highly enough. Its made my wife's pregnancy bearable again. BUY IT!
