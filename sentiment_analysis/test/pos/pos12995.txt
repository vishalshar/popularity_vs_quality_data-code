This is my 5th smartwatch, and it is pretty easily my favorite.  While there are some limitations to the software, this is a watch that does all of the things that a smartwatch should do, and does it well!  It is not a perfect watch, and there are some things that Mobvoi needs to improve upon, but overall I really like this watch, and here is why:Hardware: 5/5 - The TicWatch is built beautifully.  I personally have the charcoal version, so I will speak to that one.  The charcoal version is a sporty version that is built with the active person in mind.  The silicone bands are very comfortable to wear, and are also easily replaceable.  The watch itself has a nice metal casing and scratch resitant glass (note: the Onyx and the Oak version use Corning Guerrilla Glass).  The watch itself really only has 2 "buttons."  There is the main button that can turn the watch on and off, and then there is the "tickle side" that can be used to navigate through the menus and through notifications.  Personally I like just using the touch screen on the watch because that is very responsive.  In terms of sensors, the watch has a gyroscope, heart rate sensor, GPS, and Bluetooth built in.  It does also have a microphone and speaker built in to answer phone calls and to interact with "Tico," the personal assistant built in.Software: 4/5 - There is a lot to love about the software of the TicWatch, but there is still a lot that leaves you wanting.  The watch itself is so simple and easy to interact with because the developers really put a lot of thought into making this a watch that does all of the necessary features well.  The three areas of the software that I personally feel could use some work are: 1) The indoor running accuracy.  All of the rest of the activity features seem very accurate, but the indoor running is not there yet.  They definitely need to work on the accuracy.  On a 5 mile treadmill run the TicWatch said that I ran under 4 miles... over 20% off is not acceptable.  The step count was good and accurate during that run, but the distance was well off.  Outdoors it uses GPS and is spot on though.  I emailed the company, and the indoor running accuracy is a known issue that they said they are working on fixing.  2) The "Tico" personal assistant works well at some things, but let's be honest... it's no Google, which I wish it was.  3) There isn't much app development, and there probably won't be.  You can look up how to sideload Android Wear apps onto the watch if you want, but personally it isn't a necessity for me.  To their credit, I have already had two software updates on the watch in the 2 weeks that I've owned it, which points to Mobvoi obviously trying to get this done well.Battery Life: 4.5/5 - I am generally getting through 24 hours of usage with about 50% battery remaining.  That percentage drops down to around 20% or 30% if I keep ambient mode on.  With that said, I could easily get through 2 days of battery life if I wanted, but generally I charge it just before going to bed.  The charging is very quick.  It takes less than an hour to get it fully charged from 20% to 100%, and it uses Qi wireless charging.  You can use the Qi disk that it comes with, but I actually use my Moto 360 Sport charging stand to charge mine.  If you really want to extend the battery it does have a power saving mode that shuts off all of the sensors and only shows the time.  If you use that at night when you are sleeping you could easily get two full days.Features its missing:- No sleep detection.  Personally I wouldn't use that, but for many people this is a feature they want, and I'm sure Mobvoi could easily add this in.- A more universal music option.  As it is now you can only download music to the watch if you have the music downloaded onto your phone.  The watch does allow you to control your music for Spotify, Google Play Music, etc.... but you cannot download music from those services onto the watch.- Accurate indoor run tracking.  I mentioned this above, but it's worth mentioning again.  This needs to be updated ASAP.Conclusion: Is this watch perfect?  No, but I really love what Mobvoi is doing with the TicWatch 2, and I wish that Andoid Wear would look and work a bit more like the software on the TicWatch 2.  Mobvoi still has some work to do, but this is a fantastic device so far.
