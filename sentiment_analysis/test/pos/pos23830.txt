Update to below.... the UBTech team responded through facebook and were absolutely amazing in helping and communicating. We now have replacement batteries being couriered over.  Great customer service. Thank youOriginal msg:We Ordered this twice for my son for his birthday. first time the battery wouldn't charge. While plugged in, we saw a red & green light flashing, however after hours of charging the app indicated that the battery was dead and not charged.I went through the return process with amazon, which didn't help as my courier service (outside US) refused to return an item containing a lithium battery. Amazon recommended I contact the supplier directly.So as not to disappoint my son, who was heart broken, we ordered another one thinking the battery was defective. Same problem. we called UBtech twice and both times the Support promised someone form the international office would call back and twice - NOTHING. Very disappointed with the support from both amazon and UBTECH. what a waste of money (literally down the drain)
