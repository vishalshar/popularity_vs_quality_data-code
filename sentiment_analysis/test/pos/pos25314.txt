I ordered two of these for my 3&4 year olds iPads and they have been put to the test! We have had them almost a year and I finally thought to write a review because yesterday one of the iPad's got left on the roof of the van (cut me some slack I have three kids under 5) and we were driving down the road and heard something bang the roof. We turned around and found the iPad perfectly fine on the side of the busy road. My kids have spilled milk on them, dropped them down the stairs, hit them with Legos, anything you can imagine, but these cases keep the iPads in perfect condition. Wonderful product!
