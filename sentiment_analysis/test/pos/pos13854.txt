The iBlazr 2 is a great product!! I have an Africa girlfriend (I'm white) and in low light settings she doesn't really show up well/at all. Usually we hunt down the brightest areas we can find when we take selfie, but even that only works half of the time. With the iBlazr unless you have a ton of back light (usually never good for pictures) we always get a very well lit picture! The Bluetooth works amazing with my iPhone 6s. Make sure you get the diffuser. My only complaint is how damn bright this product is when taking a selfi. It is seriously blinding on the high level and the diffuser makes it tolerable on the low setting. I wish it had more control over the brightness. That being said I would still buy this product regardless.
