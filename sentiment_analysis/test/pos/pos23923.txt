Bought this for my dog who loves tennis balls. It took about 3 days of working with him to get him to drop the ball into the hopper but he got it and it works fine for in the house. The problem is the balls provided. Within the first day one ball split in half just from the dog catching it and by the sixth day the second ball split. The balls are the size of a ping pong ball and have not found another ball that will fit the unit. To buy more balls from the supplier is costly so need to give some thought before buying the product.
