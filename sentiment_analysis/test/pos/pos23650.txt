(I didn't receive these for free or anything like that, I just picked them up and hoped!)I'm a person who doesn't mind spending the money for great gear and/or recordings, but I need to be able to hear that difference from the 'standard' equipment or recordings.  These ear-phones are fantastic for helping ANYONE hear and appreciate their music in a whole new light.  I had just about given up on 'ear-buds' as a whole, because I've never found a pair that could even step in the ring with my headphones.  That's changed now.The packaging and the marketing really play these up, but I'm here to say that they aren't over-stating the quality!  My previous foray into the 'higher end' (relative, since I'm in no position to spend 4 or 5 figures on my gear) ear-phones was with a pair of Westones triple drivers that left me seriously under-whelmed.  $300 bucks and they aren't THAT much better than my 20 buck buds that I used for riding.I've only put a few ranges of music through these right now.  Stuff that I felt would adequately run the range of highs, mids, and lows.  I am truly amazed and overjoyed!  I'm listening to my Fiio X5 (gen II) with their E12A 'Mont Blanc' IEM headphone amp.  I had to turn my 'bass boost' off!  That's never been an issue before, but these IEM's produce such a great low end, that the boost isn't necessary!  How about that?I'm an audiophile, but I really, REALLY dislike that term.  Mainly because it has a certain 'air' to it.  I'm sure you know what I mean.  My definition of an 'audiophile' is someone who, not only enjoys audio music, but someone who can discern subtleties of good and GREAT recordings.  An audiophile doesn't (or shouldn't) hold one genre over the other, in terms of music, but rather can discern the differences between a good musician (or musicians) and ones who truly stand out.  I've heard the range of them in my time, across all genres and a great musician can be crippled by a poor recording or rendering of their talent.  Similarly, a mediocre musician or singer can be improved with a great recording.High definition audio is a real thing, within the limits of the original source.  You can't take a 48/16 recording and give it a 192/24 wrapper and go "listen to how great this is!  It's so much better than the original..."At the moment, I'm listening to Beethoven's 5th and it's so clear that I can hear when they flip the pages of their music!  Outstanding!  Previously, I started out with the 'Heavy Metal Soundtrack' (Don Felder's 'Heavy Metal (Takin' A Ride)'), then went to Incognito's 100 degrees And Rising (Barumba), then Boston's 'More Than A Feeling'.  I'll run some acoustic jazz through them later.Overall, you simply can't go wrong with these ear-phones!  Less than a third the cost of Westones and Shures and they sound better to boot!  Fantastic!!
