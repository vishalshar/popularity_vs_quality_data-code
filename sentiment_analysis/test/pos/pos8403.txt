Good sound with ample bass (for its size).  My use case is not very demanding: I sit it next to my shower and listen to classical music on Spotify at fairly low volume.  I partially charged it when I received it, and after a week of 15 minutes per day, it's still at 2 out of 5 battery increments.  The controls are easy to understand and they interact just fine with Spotify (skip fore and aft, etc.).One concern is that the rubber piece that fits over the inputs and in theory renders it waterproof is not confidence-inspiring in its fit.  I would have no problem, say, getting water splashed on the unit, but I'm not so sure about submersing it, as various review videos have illustrated.  It also gives off a powerful off-gassing smell right out of the box, which, thankfully, dissipated with time.
