This is a great vitamin, especially for kids with MTHFR. I searched high and low for a multivitamin for my kids with active folate & b12 and there's very little out there. This product saved my sanity and provides my little ones with the vitamins they need. Thank you smarty pants for listening to your customers and providing a top notch product!
