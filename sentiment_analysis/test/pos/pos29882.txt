I love this thing! It is so tiny but creates so much noise, and has a variety of sounds to choose from. I am so happy I traded my fan in for this, and I can take it on trips also because it is so small.My only complaint is that the on/off switch button broke/got smashed in after a few days of use so I had to buy a new one... so be careful with the buttons.
