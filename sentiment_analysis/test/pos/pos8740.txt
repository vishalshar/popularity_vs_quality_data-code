Wonderful case! My 5 years old daughter absolutely loves it. Nice and soft, easy to clean/sterilize, and hold her iPad snugly. Really thick silicone so I don't worry as much if she drops it or bumps the corners. The handle is sturdy (it has some give, but isn't too bendy). Excellent value! I highly recommend this case for your little one.
