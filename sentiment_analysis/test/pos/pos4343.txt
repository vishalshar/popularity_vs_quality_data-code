I love the way this interacts with the hub we have, to a degree. When the front door opens it signals the light plugged into this to turn on so it seems like someone is home. I don't like that there's a 20 second delay, but I guess if someone were to have to get up to manually turn on the light it would take that long anyway. Other than the response delay I have absolutely no problem with this product and highly recommend it.
