At first my kids seems a bit confuse by this new 'toys', and randomly attach things. and I love that littleBits make 'engineering' fun by allowing an easy error-and-trial. After awhile my kids become expert and know which component to put in what's position to archive the desire output they want.Thank you for helping my kids to the future.
