This stuff is really delicious! cooks up just as quick and easy as pasta. Has a really nice nutty, earthy flavor. I'm so excited I found this... pasta without near as much guilt. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a healthier, protein packed alternative to pasta without sacrificing the comfort of noodles.I've seen a lot of questions about nutrition, so I uploaded a picture of the nutrition label for the Shells variety, but I assume other varieties are quite similar as well!
