Read instructions and followed the pretty detailed video for which a link was provided. It is pretty simple heat them and allow enough time to get warmed in a cup of water and then insert speaker bud and form. It is like anything that is custom if you follow instructions and do it correctly you get an awesome fit. Mine are perfect I have worn to work out, run and hit golf balls in and they have not fallen out yet even when I worked up a  sweat. Sound is good and even though they are not noise canceling the sound on an airplane versus conventional buds or even some noise canceling buds I have had the sound is better to comparable because your ears are plugged. Comes with a nice case and the sires are good quality ribbon like wires as well. I also like that you can buy additional ear molds if needed, not sure based on some reviews how they will react to southern summer heat but at best I have a good pair of buds to leave in the briefcase.
