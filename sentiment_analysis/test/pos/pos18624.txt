Love these sheet sets. Makes changing the bed so easy when the baby has a leaky diaper or the toddler has an accident. I have two problems though, sometimes the corners are hard to get the zipper to go around and you desperately need 2 zipper sheets to go with the base, one to use and one to change to when accidents happen.
