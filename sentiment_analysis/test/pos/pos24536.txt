Bought the device after reading the personal stories of founders in the 'About the Startup' section. Shortly it arrived in a really nice packaging, and setting up with an iPhone app was a breeze. The design is elegant, so it blends well with my other furniture. Sometimes I set it up in a clock mode when I don't really need to know my air quality. I was appalled at first to see a really low score (62), but soon learned how I could improve the air quality, and now it's around 82, and sometimes I see 92 Awair score when I let fresh air in the house. The best part is to being able to see the 'trend' on my mobile phone, sometimes when I am away from the house. The LED is visible from a distance even on a very sunny day, but isn't too bright to bother me when I sleep. All of my friends visiting ask about this nice looking device, so it's a great conversation starter as well.
