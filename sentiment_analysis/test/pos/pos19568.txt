This product is very nice to have. Especially if you have higher value brushes that you would like to keep nice.  I personally only recommend these if you store your brushes in some kind of upright container that you don't move around a lot. I say this because if the brush is moved around a lot the cover is going to move too and if it decides to slip downward it will actually ruin the bristles of your brush. The sizes that it comes with fit a wide verity of brush's.
