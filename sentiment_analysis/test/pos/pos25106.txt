We love this little guy. He is eager to connect with our phones (though one user does have to disconnect in order for another to connect; you can't boot them off). Sound is good for a small, over-running-water-speaker. Controls on the snail are easy to use once you locate and memorize them. It's great to be able to mute or skip the music without touching my phone with wet hands. I believe there is an option to take a call, but I haven't tried this. Do read the instructions: Your shower critter does not live vertically on the shower wall. He will fall if you leave him here for more than a few hours. I assume he could live in the shower on a shelf, but ours comes out to dry off on the window sill.
