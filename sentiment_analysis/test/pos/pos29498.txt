Works pretty well but wish it had some sort of grip as the laptop slides around on it when it's tipped on my lap.  Haven't used the mouse pad yet but it looks like it would work pretty feasibly.  Can't tell about the protection but my lap doesn't burn up even though the computer gets pretty hot.  Praying it works to protect! My macbook slides in and out easily. the flap magnetically closes up with a little extra but gentle push.
