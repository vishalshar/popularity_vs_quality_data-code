Beautiful lighting! My whole house uses LIFX lights and they are second to none - they are brighter and richer in colour than any competitors' product I have seen. I initially had connectivity issues with the LIFX Color 1000, but these have been fixed in recent firmware updates and LIFX Support staff were very friendly, thorough and honest with their help. From my tests so far it looks like the new LIFX + has a rock-solid connection out of the box - it's been connected for the last three weeks nonstop.They are easy to use and control with great themes and effects, and together with the Logitech Pop I have elegant and configurable wall switches that anyone of any age can use - my three-year-old daughter gets to have her colour theme and she can turn it on when she wants :) without necessarily using a phone or app to control them. Now with the IR in the LIFX + my security cameras see clearly at night into every corner without disturbing us at all. Well done LIFX on another beautiful part of my life! I can't wait to try out the new LIFX Z strip lights too :)
