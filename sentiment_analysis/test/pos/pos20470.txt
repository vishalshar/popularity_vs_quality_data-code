I love my JimmyCase case, but I do have one complaint (down below). But first, the positives. I love the look of the case and the convenience of the elastic band on the back to hold cards and cash when all I want to carry is my phone (right now I'm keeping business cards & emergency cash there, but it'll hold a credit card nicely too). The wood gives it a high-end look, and the stripes are super cool (I got orange & gray). It's very distinctive. It's also slim and lightweight, and it has good "grip." Also, the case I had before this made it almost impossible to click the power button on the side (I still maintain that's an Apple design flaw) but the JimmyCase makes it easy to press. The little "bump" where the button is located is hardly detectable, but once you learn where it is (feel just above the grippy part) the button presses very easily. Love that.The only negatives are this, and they are minor: 1/ The rubber bumper does protrude a little on the front, to keep the phone screen from lying flat against a table when you put it down, but I wish it came out just a little more. I would feel more confident about protection if I drop it. 2/ This could be a problem unique to me, but right after I got the case I discovered that I hold my iPhone with my left hand and sort of "cradle" it (or stabilize it) with my left pinkie resting under the phone. I realized this because the cutouts on the bottom (which are plenty roomy), are a little rough, and it hurts my finger. There has to be a way those cutouts could be smoothed or the edges more rounded? Anyway, I'm trying to train myself to hold the phone another way.Even with the two minor design imperfections, I'm very happy with the case.
