My kids are 18 and 15 so I was worried they might think this was juvenile.  I was wrong. They love it.  I affixed it to the wall by the back door (so they'd see it when they left or came home).  I used the "sticky" pads that come with it so i didn't have to go find a little nail or a hammer or a screw drive.  The pads are very secure, doesn't even wiggle.  Way to go!!
