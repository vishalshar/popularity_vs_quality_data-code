If your Hickies are too tight, try tying them with the loose method provided on the instructions. You can even mingle the regular and the loose method if one is too tight and the other too loose.Also, don't think about using these shoelaces for boots. They're much too small. I'm not saying I regret buying Hickies but I had originally made the purchase with the idea of using these on my ankle boots. They're not even compatible with my smallest pair of booties. Again, I don't regret this purchase because I'm using these elastic shoelaces on my running shoes and it's all great but I'm still disappointed.
