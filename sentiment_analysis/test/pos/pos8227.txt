Unfortunately, soon as I put the 3DR Solo in the 3DR Backpack, with the lights attached, the plastic bottom frame of the front light just came right off.Pro's * Lights work great and help a lot better than the 3DR Solo lights * Easy install and snug fit. They won't be falling off, which is a good thing.Con's * Frame around lights is kind of thin and so it can break easily * Wires are not really cut to length so you have to tape them down to keep them out of the wayAll-in-all, it was definitely worth it, I just hope the quality of the frame improves some in future versions.
