Most negative reviews are inaccurate!  I too have got poor images and wanted to return it too. I kept it and played with it and now thoroughly enjoy it. The XR is for longer range not for inside or short distance. You'll have to play with it and find the focus that works best for you. It's best use is to spot live creatures around your property. I've been able to see rabbits at 60 yards, wasn't sure until I spot lighted it or saw it jump. Don't expect to see a clear picture with contrast because you'll see a solid image and the outline at distances. When you scan go slow and if you see a spot hold it still as it will adjust and be clearer. I use mine to locate my horses at night.
