We really like the small size and big sound.  It's the size of a baseball but sounds like a fan.  For several years my husband has been running a fan in the bedroom for better sleep.  But the breeze could be a bit cold for him.  This will be great for sleeping at home as well as for being away.  We immediately packed it for our Christmas getaway and it has worked like a charm.  Can't wait to get it home.
