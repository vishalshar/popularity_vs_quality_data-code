I purchased the Rachio 8 Zone to replace my Rainbird esp-smt.  The setup was quick and easy, the configuration via the app was simple and user friendly.  I live in NE FL and my St. Augustine grass is very temperamental.  If its too dry it will die quickly, if it gets too wet and over watered I am plagued with sod webworms or leaf spot.  With the new Rachio I elected to go with the daily flex schedule initially.  I set it up, it watered the next day at 0500 and then over the next week kept adjusting its schedule due to rain forecast and actual rain we received.  Overall its a great product that I will expect to save me thousands of gallons of water over a year.Here is my only complaint area:  The device gives you the option of selecting a certified national Weather station like at your local airport or major municipal office.  These sites report wx to NOAA and official Weather.Gov sites.  Or you can use a personal weather station that can be less reliable , prone to power outages and less accurate.  In my location the nearest airport is approx 7 miles away, across a large river.  The weather patterns over at the airport and at my house vary significantly, especially in the summer.  So I opted to go with a PWS that was only a mile away.  I feel this gives me much more accurate WX information in terms of rainfall and temp/dew point.  Even still, it is very possible, like today as I write this review for it to rain at my house or at the PWS like 1.5" in less than an hour, and it not be registered with my Rachio.  So my only request is the team at rachio come up with their own or a COTS rain gauge product that will accurately measure rainfall amounts precisely at your home.Other than that I am very pleased with the Rachio 8 Zone controller and have been telling all of my friends about it!Can't wait to see new features in the future.
