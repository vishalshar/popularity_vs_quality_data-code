Love the pillow. Product itself is super comfort. Wanted to give it four stars because it didn't come with a bag but the product itself was great.  Note to company though - please make a cute canvas bag to protect the pillow. When you travel, it's easiest to keep travel pillows clipped to outside of your bag.. so it doesn't take up room. Used a shoe bag instead.
