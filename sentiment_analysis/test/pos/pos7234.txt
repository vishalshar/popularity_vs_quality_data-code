While I have yet to use this on myself, I have amazingly had to pull a weirdly amount of slivers from others. It is almost as if once I bought these magical tweezers people started getting slivers embedded in their fingers and toes. The other thing I have on hand is a magnifying glass. If you are like me and buy these you should expect people to show up at your door with painful splinters. Soothe them with some neosporin and send them down the road feeling happy.
