When I had my first bottle of this, I couldn't tell if I liked it or not, switching between mild disgust and "hmm", even after finishing the entire thing. The second morning, the same thing happened. HOWEVER, on the third morning, the flavor really grew on me. Not only that, but I noticed a persistent up-tick in my energy throughout the day.By Day 4, I began to question just what addictive substance was in Coffiest, because I couldn't get enough! I finished my morning bottle and was already thinking of drinking another the next morning. After a month of drinking this stuff, I'm hooked and have just bought a second batch. I'm going to hold off on subscribing to see if it remains as enjoyable this month, but it's looking good so far.About the flavor: It tastes like slightly sweet black coffee with some mild cocoa undertones. It has a consistency a lot like a protein shake using powder, and a chocolately brown color.
