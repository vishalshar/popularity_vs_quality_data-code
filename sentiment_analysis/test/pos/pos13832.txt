I rarely write reviews for anything, but i felt compelled to let people know how great this product is...  After years of drinking coffee and ruining my stomach, i started to drink tea about a decade ago.  After hearing from a friend about Pique's tea crystals, i decided to give it a shot.  First and foremost, the quality of the tea is top-notch.  The flavor profile, depth and taste of the tea is excellent and as good if not better than any premium tea ive had anywhere.  On top of that, the fact that the tea is so easy to prepare, makes this a no brainer.  Not having to deal with strainers and used tea leaves, makes this great for anyone on the go.
