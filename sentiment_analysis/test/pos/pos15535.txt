Detatchable mic doesn't work & customer service never followed up to ensure customer satisfaction. Love the headset. Just want a detachable mic that works.Love everything @ this headset though. I could see these LS30s lasting @ least a couple years or whenever the batteries give out. Quality construction. Very comfortable can use for 4hrs w/o getting smashed ears or sweaty ears like my Sony Golds did. Bass isn't as strong but got my $ worth. Sony Golds only last up to 6 mos. due to cheap construction.
