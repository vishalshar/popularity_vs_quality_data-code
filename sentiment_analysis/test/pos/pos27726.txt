Saw these mentioned on America's test Kitchen on PBS. I tend to buy a nice block of cheese or two a week from Whole Foods and they can be quite expensive. If you don't eat it quickly, it tends to mold before I finished them.Placing them in these bags has eliminated the problem. I don't know how, but, I can attest to their effectiveness!
