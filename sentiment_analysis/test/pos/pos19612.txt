Does exactly what it says and is easy to set up and schedule feedings. Bought as my cat eats wet prescribed food for life due to a urinary issue and my boyfriend and I were going away for a weekend with no one available to catsit at our apartment. Our cat does not do well in an unknown surrounding (has stress issues)so didn't want to have to take to someone else. I froze all the feedings and it worked very well for 1 1/2 days, even with wet food. The webcam is very nice as well (I used just to make sure the feeder was working as it should). Something to remember, if you will be feeding at night, you may want to keep a light on so you can see your pet with the cam when you are away.A little messy and a hastle to use at all times with wet food only, as my cat did scrape out with his paws, but if you are gone for a day or so it is very handy to have.
