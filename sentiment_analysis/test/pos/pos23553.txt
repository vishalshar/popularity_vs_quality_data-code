I really like Slice. They have a great mission, and I've purchased two of their box cutters. I really looked forward to their Craft Cutter, but I noticed a few things right off the bat.First of all, the positives:+ Good GripThe metal housing provides a great gripping surface+ WeightIt's lightweight compared to exacto-craft knives. This could be especially handy if you're working on a craft that will take a long time, helping prevent or delay hand fatigue.+ Non-roll DesignI like that it doesn't roll on the table when set down.Now on to the drawbacks.- Non-pointed TipI really wish the tip were much more of a fine point than it is. The sharp, pointed tip is what gives an exacto craft cutting knife an edge here (or er, point). Could a ceramic blade chip if it's too thin at it's point? Not sure, but it would be nice to have for very detailed work.- The capThe cap could be better designed. When placed, the blade end of the blade actually touched the inside top of the cap. The cap doesn't lock into place, so if you twist the cap around, you could potentially damage the blade.- CuttingIt cuts okay. I thought it'd be fantastic, but was a little disappointed. The plus side is that it will last a lot longer than a steel blade, though.-- Conclusion --It's a great craft cutter. If you can get past the few drawbacks.
