Xylitol is wonderful for people who are diabetic and cannot use a lot of the other sweeteners. It doesn't have the after taste of many artificial sweeteners.  Even the natural sweetener stevia is awful in the aftertaste department and really does not  taste as sweet as Xylitol. If you have a problem with gas, just use a little, and don't over do it.  If you are diabetic as I am you have to watch what you eat and how much you eat, anyway. With Xylitol I can still have something sweetened without the worry of carbs. and no nasty aftertaste.
