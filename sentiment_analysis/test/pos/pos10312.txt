I've had the Leaf for only a short time but I can already see a positive change in my behavior. The first thing I do when I wake up is sync my Leaf to my iphone to see how I slept. When I see in the evening that I haven't achieved my activity goal, I push myself to go out for a walk even if I don't feel like it. My favorite part about the device is that I can wear it a lot of ways. I wear it like a bracelet the most and this is where my biggest concern comes up. It's not water resistant and I always have to be careful not to get it wet when I am washing my hands. I hope the next generation will be waterproof and there will be  different kinds of bracelets to choose from.
