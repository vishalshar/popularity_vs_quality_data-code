We just got a Whistle GPS to help us keep an eye our 4 year old King Charles Spaniel - Sophie. I was a little apprehensive about buying one after reading some of the reviews, but so far we've had a great experience. Our 12 year old daughter is the resident dog walker in our house. Every time she takes Sophie our for a walk, we get a notification within minutes that she has left her "Whistle Zone". It's fun to use the tracking functionality to track the progress of their walk around the neighborhood. After you start a tracking session, the app notifies you of the exact location of your dog every three minutes. You can even see the path your dog took on the map. And if you need to locate quicker than every three minutes, you can simply refresh GPS within the app to get the current location.I'm grateful that Sophie has never gotten out of our yard before, but it's great knowing that if she ever did we could use the Whistle app to find her quickly. It's not something I ever worried about before, we have a fenced in back yard and it seems pretty secure, but a few months ago our neighbor's dog somehow got out of their backyard (they still aren't really sure how!) and it took hours or searching, putting up posters etc. to find him. Luckily they found him, but it was a stressful few hours as the whole neighborhood searched for him. After that experience I did some research and found Whistle. I hope to never need it, but if I do, I'll be glad I have it.Another thing I love about the Whistle app is the activity monitoring. Sophie spends a few days a week at a doggie day care. To be honest, I've always been a little worried that she just sits around while she's there. Now I can go into the app and see how many much activity she's actually getting while she's there. It's great to know that she is clearly having fun and running around while she is there!My only complaint about the product is that I wish it gave me the ability to customize the notifications I get from the app. The notifications for when Sophie leaves her Whistle zone are the ones I really want to get. But I don't care that much about some of the other ones, like whether or not she hits her activity goal three days in a row etc.I'm not a big review writer, but after reading some of the negative reviews, I really wanted to share my positive experience with the product. I think this is a really awesome product and I would recommend it to any dog owner who wants to have peace of mind that if their dog ever got out, they could find them quickly.
