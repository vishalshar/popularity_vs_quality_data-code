Love it! I use it mainly for shower and in the kitchen. I can use it in the backyard because it's loud enough over the kids and adults barbecuing, though the only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of 5 stars is because the range drops from only about 15 feet from Bluetooth signal from either using an iPad, iPhone, or a smartphone.
