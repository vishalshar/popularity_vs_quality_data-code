I've been a Piper Wai customer for sometime now after seeing it on Shark Tank & loved it. However I came across this product which is half the price, same packaging and look along with similar descriptions & thought why not give it a try.  I'll never go back to Piper Wai, Primal Pit Paste performed better than a product that costed 2x more & I go through every 1 to 2 months.  It actually goes on better than Piper Wai, has a better odor & consistency.  Primal Pit Paste is a must have for every woman.  I'm pretty sure guys could use it depending on the scent they would want. The other advantage of this product over Piper Wai is A variety of scents and it comes in a stick form. Piper Wai is one scent which is more manly and the color is a dark slate so unless you rub it in chunks of that color could be left underneath your armpit.  Primal Pit Paste goes on clear, smooth & doesn't have piece drop off your fingertips.
