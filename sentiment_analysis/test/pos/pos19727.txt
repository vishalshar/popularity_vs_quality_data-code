At first I had a difficult time putting the mount into the CD slot but after watching a you tube video, I got it!  Very easy to install (one you know what you are doing) and put together.  The mount is very sturdy and holds my iPhone 6+ easily and it does not slip.  Works out great!  I'm very happy with the CD slot mount as I did not want a vent mount as I did not want the air being blocked as I live in a hot area of California.  The CD mount works out perfectly!
