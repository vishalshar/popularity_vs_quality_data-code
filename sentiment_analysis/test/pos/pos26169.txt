I love these!!  I have been staying clear of sugar now for almost 2 years but I missed having my chocolate.  These gems give me just the right amount of sweetness with some chocolate but none of the refined sugars...I can eat a whole bag at one sitting if I allowed myself too.  If your trying to lower your sugar content but still gotta have your chocolate taste this is great alternative to a chocolate bar!! Get some there awesome!Â Bare Natural Banana Chips, Cocoa, Gluten Free + Baked, 2.7 Ounce (6 Count)
