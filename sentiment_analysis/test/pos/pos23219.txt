I have 10 cats, and I needed a way to feed 7 of them for a little over two 24 hours periods while we went out of state to take another one of our cats to a medical procedure. All 7 are under a year old, so they eat a LOT and often. We don't have any family and friends nearby and we didn't want to hire a pet sitter when we already have automatic litter boxes. I did a lot of research about auto feeders and decided this was the best one for the money. I feed mostly raw, but used this feeder for canned while we were gone. I originally only bought one feeder with plans to use a different feeder for kibble, but after setting up and testing the Feed and Go I bought a second one and returned the kibble feeder.Both Feed and Go's worked flawlessly for the short periods of time we were gone and since my kittens share well there was no issues with only having 2 feeders. I'm really glad I didn't need to stress about whether or not the cats at home were being fed while i was away dealing with a sick cat.My only suggestion would be for Feed and Go to offer a less expensive model without the cam. We already use dropcams to monitor our pets, so the cams on the Feed and Go don't serve any purpose for us. Like others, I also wish there was an option for freezer packs to keep the food compartment cool. I live in the desert and while it was fine for the cooler months I wouldn't feel comfortable leaving food in the feeder for 24 hours or longer without some way of keeping the food cool.Edit - I went out of town and used the feeder to give my older cat his "early morning snack" that way no one else in my household had to wake up at 5am and feed him. It worked perfectly, and i could watch the cam to check on him and make sure none of my other pets got to his snack first. Even though I don't use this feeder daily, it's wonderful to have around when I do travel or leave my house for an extended period of time.
