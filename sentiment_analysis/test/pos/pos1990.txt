So far this thing has work exactly as advertised.  I use it when I'm out hunting so it's a little tougher to say how many charges I can get out of it for my iPhone just because it's colder outside and cold isn't as good for the battery life but I think I got close to 1 1/2 out of it the time I used it.  I like how thin it is and it seems to charge up fairly quickly.  I also like the 4 little blue lights on it telling you how much of a charge is left in the Flux.
