Very tasty, organic and made with basic ingredients, and its just sweet enough. If you're into eating foods that are more natural with no additives and extra junk, you should give it a try. It's great as a peanut butter substitute...use it for sandwhiches, baking, smoothies or even straight off the spoon :D
