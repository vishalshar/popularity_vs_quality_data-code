This item is soooo amazing.  I just got a tiny little kitten three days ago and I was struggling while at work because I was so worried about her.  I didn't want to confine her to the bathroom so I decided to get this camera and use it to check in on her.  I am so happy with the quality and the rotation, the voice and sound and the night vision.  I would recommend this to any pet owner.  I am thrilled with it.
