This thing is awesome! I have been looking for a good sounding bluetooth speaker that I can take out by the pool, skiing, camping, tailgating, etc. and I am glad I found this new brand. Although I am not big fan of the name (Fuh-goo), the product is awesome. I bought the Style version as I do not really like the look of the Sport jacket and the Rugged jacket is a bit too much because the speaker spends most of its time on my shelf playing music and I want it to look good. I love having the option and versatility of being able to put a different 'look' on it in the future. As an FYI to anyone wondering, there is a video out there showing the speaker going through a durability test without any jacket on at all and it held up to everything.The bass is actually pretty dang good. Rich and true, not heavy and fake like the Bose Soundlink Mini can sound like sometimes. I'll be the first person to tell you I like a good bass rumbling in my ears (especially during workouts) and I have come to appreciate the great sound and balance this speaker brings. The bass will make my desk/shelf vibrate (albeit minor) when I turn the volume all the way up, but the highs and mids are really where this speaker shines. The music has absolutely no problem filling a large room.If you purchase this, you must download the new firmware update for the speaker off of the Fugoo website to get the experience this speaker was made for. The poor reviews on here are primarily because the person did not update the firmware!
