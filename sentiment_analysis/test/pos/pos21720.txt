I've been looking for something to help with focus and endurance, and this works wonders, I heard of this from Tim Ferris' podcast and immediately went to try some for myself.A bit about myself I'm anti coffee (never drank it, never will), so I didn't get the Lion's Mane and Chaga Coffee Mixture that many others have gotten, instead I purchased the Lion's Mane Mushroom ElixirI've tried dried lion's mane from my local grocery store and lion's mane pills before, but this is something different it blows the other products out the water.The dosage of lion's mane in each packet its well worth it, each packet contains 1.5g (1500mg) of lions mane, more than I would expect which is great, more bang for the buck.Some people are complaining about the taste, although it is not a pleasant taste, it doesn't take away from the effects that it produces, I think the taste (bland and earthy) adds to the wakefulness and alertness that the concoction produces.
