After reading a recent article in The Smithsonian magazine about this technology ("How to Plug in Your Brain", David Noonan, May 2016 - you can read this on the web, BTW), I decided to give this a try. I had initially passed over it because I didn't see Android support for the device. Support is now there, but in a limited fashion - I'll revisit that in a moment.The big question is, of course,  does it work? For me, the answer is a resounding yes. The energy vibes I've tried thus far are like a strong cup of tea and get me going for workouts quite well. The calming vibes do a good job of reversing the energy vibes so that I can sleep at night (unlike with caffeine).The process of running through a vibe feels a lot like using a TENS unit (if you've tried that) - a little tingly and slightly odd, but not unpleasant at all. Each vibe takes 10 to 20 minutes to run through, during which you are free to do whatever you'd like. Vibe times can be extended,  and you can pause, stop, or restart them at any time.The strips can be reused, but do eventually wear out. I find that they last longer if I clean the skin where I attach them before putting them on. An alcohol wipe is a convenient method for this. Given the price of the strips and my propensity to be a cheapskate,  this is important to me :)The only issue that I have with this unit is Android support - an issue that they are obviously actively working on. When I first saw the list of Android devices that they claim to support, I thought that this would be like many Android apps which claim support on a few devices but really work on most anyway. Not so here - the app didn't even appear in the Android Store on unsupported devices, so it was impossible to even try. If you have an Android device,  try downloading the app BEFORE you buy the device to save some frustration. Some other reviewers have complained about the device disconnecting during a vibe - this is what they are trying to avoid by blocking some devices. I presume iOS users don't see this.I'll continue to update this review as developments warrant. Once the Android issues get resolved, I think this thing deserves 5 stars.August update: I've been using the same strips repeatedly with no apparent degradation. So while they don't last forever, with a little care they do last a while (20-30 uses and going strong).I don't see any change in the status of Android support,  but I'm still watching for it...
