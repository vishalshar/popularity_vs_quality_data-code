I had been looking for a mobile projector that I could use when traveling for meetings and watching tv and movies on the go. The first priority was size - I wanted to make sure it would fit in my backpack and wouldn't be a pain to carry around. The RIF6 seemed like a pretty popular unit based on reviews so I decided to give it a shot. My unit came a few days ago and I've been playing with it ever since. I love it! It's sharper and brighter than I expected. For it's size, I didn't expect to to be able to produce such a clear image. I've watched a couple movies with it this weekend and it produces a very good picture at 120 inches! The brightness is better than other mini projectors I've used in the past. It definitely seems brighter than advertised 50 lumens. As you should expect, it won't work well in a well-lit room or outside - but neither will any projector anywhere near this price point. It's also very quite while it's turned on which is a huge plus. Most larger projectors need bigger fans to cool their bulbs - not so with the Cube :)I was also pleased that it came with a full set of accessories. The tripod is very versatile - makes it very easy to find a vantage point in most places you'd want to project. It also came with a variety of cables for plugging in your input device as well as charge the internal battery. The battery life has been pretty great so far - same as advertised! The next thing I'm going to buy for this is a cable to allow me to plug in my iPhone or iPad so I can watch things on a huge screen without having my laptop.
