After hearing the health benefits of avocado oil, I gave it a try. I've mostly used it for making eggs and frying food. This does not smoke or burn as quickly as olive oil. It is a on the pricey side, but worth it. I prefer to use it now over olive oil when cooking. Going to be ordering another bottle soon and will try to use topically or as a carrier oil with essential oils.
