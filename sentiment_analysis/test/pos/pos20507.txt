I bought this system to mount to my bike so I was able to see my mileage on my phone during my rides.The assembly was super simple and took less than 5 minutes. It is very easy to attach and detach your phone to this product.I love how the company offers an entire line of universal products as I am now able to keep the same case on my phone all the time and attach it to my bike, my running band and even my windshield gps mount.
