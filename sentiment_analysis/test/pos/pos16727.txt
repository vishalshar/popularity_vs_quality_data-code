I'm so glad I went with these.  They work great, stay on, clean easily and work well.  I'm happy I got them instead of the metal ones that may have rusted or not cleaned as well.  I was able to cute the straw and they work in the big mason jars.  I'm using for dish soap in my kitchen and hand soap in my bathroom.
