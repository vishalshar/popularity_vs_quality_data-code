It only took my son about 20 minutes to install it and less than 5 minutes to program it.  I am now able to lift a 40 pound bag of pellet salt, dangle it above my water softener and slit the bag to dispense the salt into the tank of the water softener.  In the past this was a heavy and cumbersome job for me, but with the help of My Lifter I am now able to accomplish it easily and independently.
