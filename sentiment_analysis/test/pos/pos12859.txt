Over the years I've tried upward of 20 different natural deodorants after trying to rid my life of toxic products. Deodorant was the hardest habit to kick because none of these so called natural brands could keep up. I needed a deodorant that could stand the test of high pressure sales job during the day and hot yoga at night (not to mention summer in the South!!) Needless to say, this is the ONLY product I've tried that can hold its own, and then some. I started with the PPP sampler pack which I would highly recommend to get a better idea of what scents you prefer. I've tried both the traditional "stick" version as well as the jars and ended up liking the jars better. I felt the deodorant is easier to apply with your fingers vs the applicator. I'm partial to the lavender scent but also really enjoyed their other scents. Whether you are an active person, or someone just looking for a natural way to stay odor-free, Primal pit paste is hands down the best product on the market.
