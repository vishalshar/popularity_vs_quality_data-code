Rokform makes great cases, and the magnet on this case is incredibly strong. There are two different inserts that can be used, the one in the picture that allows for the magnet and their hard locking mount, and another one that gets rid of the hole and centers the magnet with more grips around it.I love the look and feel of the case, but there are a few things I don't like. The buttons are harder to press, the case is very stiff and the buttons are flush with the rest of the case now. Also, if you like to swap cases and take your phone out of the case a lot you feel like you are going to shatter your phone when doing so. The lip on the case is so stiff that I feel like the buttons are going to be ripped out when shoving the phone into the case, and the switchable insert plate on the back pops out easily when trying to put the phone in.Overall though, once the phone is in the case its great and the other little things don't matter.I would definitely recommend this case to anyone who wanted to mount their phone anywhere.
