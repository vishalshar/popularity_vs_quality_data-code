Overall a great product with some nice features. Initially I had some concerns about the usable volume in the case and overall build quality, but was pleasantly surprised by both. For a 2-day trip the size was perfect, and build quality is comparable to other high end luggage brands.I had fears about the wheel bearings - since I thought they had more emphasis on being a design gimmick than a functional aspect of the luggage. However, although I haven't been using the bag for long they perform well and actually look great.Other things I like - easy access laptop / ipad  pocket for TSA.Things I don't - the mapping (i.e location of bag via map in app) seems like overkill for a carry-on luggage (I have no idea when I would use this).
