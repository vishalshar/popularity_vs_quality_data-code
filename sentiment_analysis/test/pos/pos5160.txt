I really love this product.  I was first introduced to it by a family member while we were out skiing in Utah.  I was feeling groggy but after taking a Voke tab, I quickly perked up and it didn't feel jittery like coffee or other caffeine products.  I liked the tab so much that I ended up ordering the product from Amazon so that I could have them while I was in school.  I really like the product, it's a great way to get a clean, boost of energy without crashing or fading out quickly.  It felt a lot better than coffee.  Would definitely order again!
