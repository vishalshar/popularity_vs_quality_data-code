I have been following this product since it made the rounds on various tech blogs and websites.Pros:-Taste is nice and neutral, so it is easy to flavor.  I just add a bit of chocolate syrup and shake it.-Reasonably priced.  You have to consider that this is essentially a meal in a bottle.  A beverage would be a bad deal at this price, but it's a good deal if you consider it a meal.-No weird bodily reactions.  Doesn't cause aches, pains, gas, cancer (so far).  None of the downsides of 1.0, at least for me.Cons:-The seal on the rim of the bottle doesn't peal off cleanly.  This leaves a bit of gunk, which is mildly annoying if you drink it directly from the bottle.  Truly not a huge deal, but if you drink one every day or so, it gets quite annoying.-Doesn't satiate very effectively.  This will be different from person to person.  For me, I feel hungry not 2 hours later, but it is important to note that I don't feel any side-effects of hunger.Use:I know some of you are thinking 'what the heck is this actually used for?' and 'I like real food, why would I want this abomination?'  Perhaps my use-case will make sense to you.  Before Soylent, if I woke up late and had to rush out the door, coffee could only sustain me for so long.  I'd normally go to the job/meeting, but end up stopping somewhere for food on my way back.  A fast food meal costs $5 to $7, more than double the price of a bottle of this stuff.  It also comes with a HUGE softdrink and a pound of fries, or other nutritionally void junk.  With Soylent, you pay a few bucks up front, and end up saving money down the line.  You also avoid eating that junk-food that you might have had otherwise.You see, we don't drink this stuff instead of a steak dinner, home-cooked meal or lunch with friends.  We drink it in place of meals that would otherwise be junk-food or nothing at all.
