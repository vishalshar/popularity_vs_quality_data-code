I purchased these plugs, because; the specifications indicated a high amperage, and because it was advertised as being "Amazon Echo compatible."  When I received them earlier in the year; I was pissed off, because the only way to interface them with Alexa was through IFTTT.Imagine, having to constantly "Trigger" things On and Off.  Not only is it "just ain't natural English," but in the back of my mind; I was just waiting for the first police related shooting to occur, when someone would shout "Trigger!"Today, I just noticed that these things have ***FINALLY*** been added to Alexa as a "real, Honest to goodness," Smart Home Skill.Hallelujah!
