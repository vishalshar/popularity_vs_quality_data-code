This product is good for eyelashes, but I use it for my eyebrows.  Because this is slightly opaque, I just swipe the brush along my eyebrow.  This adds a definition, defines my eyebrow, and helps hold some of the strays in place.  I've used Lash Masque for several years for this reason and have had several people ask what I do to my eyebrows.
