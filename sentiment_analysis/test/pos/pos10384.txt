My 5 year old granddaughter loved playing with these. I got the Day at the Beach, the House, and the Marine Rescue sets . She liked the scenes and the dolls and she played with them for a couple of hours. I liked that the scenes are not Barbie pink; the dolls are multi-racial; and that there was a boy doll included. There are some changes I'd like to see though: Not all the sides of all the pieces are magnetic (only the sides with stars) which was frustrating since she couldn't put the accessory pieces where she wanted. According to the information on this site, the tiles should connect with the Magna Tiles we already have, but they didn't stick together well. We tried to build a second story on the house, but it wouldn't stay put.
