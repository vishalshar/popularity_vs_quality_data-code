My kit did not come with the cover and sand so we had to order those separately. They came very quickly It's fun and easy to set up but takes time to get up and going. 3 weeks until you can add the fish. Our Basil has not sprouted yet, so we are still waiting. You need to fill it with high quality bottled water and NOT tap water. It does not come with many instructions, you must go online and read a lot. Check out the FAQ page, that helps a lot: https://getecoqube.com/pages/faqI'm still figuring out how the lights work. Going to need to read the FAQ again. I am impressed with how quiet it is. And it looks really good. The lights are bright, they light up the downstairs at night. So far we are happy with it. We will update our review once the fish is in.Notes:- Very fun concept Kids are very excited.- Very good looking- Easy to take care of.- Fun for the entire family.- Perfect size for a desk, like at work- Very quiet- Lights are bright
