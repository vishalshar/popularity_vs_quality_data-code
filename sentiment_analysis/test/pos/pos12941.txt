This review will be listed in each of the speakers I tested - The JBL Flip 2, the JBL Charge 2, the JBL micro wireless, Bose Soundlink Mini, Bose Soundlink Color, Fugoo Tough.  I tested all these speakers side by side with various types of music.  Decibel levels tested at full volume with decibel meter 6 ft. from speaker.  All speakers are portable, Bluetooth with a built in rechargeable batteryJBL Flip 2: Nice speaker, loudest of the group tested at 101 decibels.  Pros - Very clear vocals and treble. Very little,  if any distortion. Comes with a pretty nice carry case, has a battery level meter.  Speaker phone capable.  Cons: Battery life not that great when listening at high volumes - couple hours at best.  Bass is almost non-existent.  Sounds like a louder version of the JBL micro wireless.  Certain music actually sounded shrill due to the lack of bass.  Recommended if you are not a big fan of bass and want a really loud small speaker that is speaker phone capable.JBL Micro Wireless: Great speaker for it's size with decent battery life - typically around 5 hours.  Good balance of bass, mid range and treble - not overpowering in any area.  91 decibels.  Pros - very portable, 3.5 mm plug is part of speaker and is nicely tucked away when not being used.  Cons: not really any as this speaker does not really fit with this group, but I wanted to include it because I have one and think it is a great speaker for it's cost and size.  Recommended if you want a really small speaker that sounds great and has good battery life.JBL Charge 2: This is the only speaker in this group that has the ability to charge other devices via a USB port.  Pros - Best battery life in this group for a speaker that is loud - 99 decibels, ability to charge other devices, sounds decent at lower volume, has a battery level meter.  Speaker phone capable. Can connect with up to 3 devices.  Cons - I thought this speaker has too much bass and frequently, bass was distorted at high volume. Sounded slightly muffled compared to the other speakers.  Recommended if you typically listen at lower volumes, love bass, are looking for long battery life, the ability to charge other devices and want to use your speaker as a speaker phone.Fugoo Tough: Very nice speaker overall, just not loud compared to the others in this group. The only weatherproof speaker of the group.  Pros - Best battery life in the group - after the initial charge, I never charged this speaker again throughout the testing and ended with just under half the battery life left. Capable of up to 40 hours.  Verbal cues for various speaker functions.  Waterproof, mud proof, shock proof.  Very good bass, mid levels and treble and great separation.  Room filling sound - speakers in every direction. Speaker phone capable. Music can be controlled from the speaker.  Verbal battery gauge.  Cons - Volume level sucks at 91 decibels - same as the JBL Micro Wireless and this was after the firmware update. After firmware update, I noticed a slight increase in volume, but it also introduced distortion.  Recommended if you typically listen at lower volume levels, want great battery life with speaker phone capabilities and have use for a waterproof speaker.  Note* I spoke with a Fugoo employee and he told me they are coming out with a new speaker spring of 2015 that will address the volume issues.Bose Soundlink Color: Pros - Compact speaker with good battery life (longer than 8 hours at low to mid volume levels) and great sound - decent bass, mid levels and treble. Loud - 99 decibels with almost no distortion. Cons:  No speaker phone capability.  Even though this speaker has left and right channels, separation is not good because of how compact the unit is - almost sounds like a mono speaker.  No battery level meter.  Recommended if you are looking for a great sounding speaker with good battery life and don't mind that it does not have speaker phone capability. Bose Soundlink Mini - In my opinion, this is the best all around speaker in the group.  Pros - Room filling sound with great separation and great sounding, very crisp bass, mid levels and treble.  Loud - 99 decibels with almost no distortion.  Good battery life - over 10 hours at low and mid volume levels. Can be charged by plugging in or just setting it on the included charging base - a nice feature.  There was a definite, very noticeable difference in the sound of this speaker vs all others in this group.  Cons - no speaker phone and no battery gauge.  Recommended if you want a speaker that sounds like a much larger speaker and has good battery life.
