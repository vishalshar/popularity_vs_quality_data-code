OMG, this thing is awesome!!!  I set it up after dinner (and it was super easy to do), and thought, "we'll see if we get anything by tomorrow morning."  We didn't have to wait nearly that long for results.  Within an hour, we had our first mouse.  Within another hour, we had a second one.  This is so cool!!!
