I have to say it was a bit of a stretch to pay up for the device but I have no regret whatsoever. My goal was to connect with friends and loved ones around the world. Lets start with the fact that Im a bit of a FOMO person (Fear Of Missing Out), and I have a few friends like that. Me and my friends travel a lot for work and we have close friends actually living abroad. We hate to miss an event, a dinner, house party etc when travelling. Inspired by the likes of Boiler room or BA TV, I figured if I could stream a party at my place to the loved missing ones, we could create a link between us that wasnt possible before. It sounds a little weird right but hey this is 2016. Well I opened the box (I liked the attention to design here, its clean and simple) and 10 minutes later I was streaming live already. Its so simple it blew me away. The live edit features are easy to use and everything in the design/user experience is very natural. So heres 5 stars for you at Mevo, good job.
