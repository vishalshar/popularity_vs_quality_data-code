This is a heart healthy oil with a very high smoke point.  It has almost no taste, so your seasonings get the upper hand. It goes a long way, you don't have to put much in the pan as it spreads very well and does not burn off.  It makes a great base for salad dressings as again, no noticeable taste so your choice in flavorings and seasonings stand out.  It is also very stable, resists oxidation = long shelf and cook life. This is a great new product of algal fermentation.  Try it, you will like it.
