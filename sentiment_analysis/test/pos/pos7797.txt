This has been a game changer in our kitchen. Replaced our terrible Brita that was ugly, bulky and not very functional...the lid would fall off, water spill out, etc. The Soma is something I can leave out when entertaining without putting water in a different pitcher. It has great capacity. The lid does NOT fall off. And you can fill with water easily from top without holding the flap open. It's gorgeous to look at and the handle, balance is all excellent. I would buy this again and again. Couldn't recommend enough.
