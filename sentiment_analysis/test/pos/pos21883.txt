I very much liked the design of this pod, although it works pretty much the same as putting your phone into any cup. The advantage seems to be that it's flexible enough that it will accommodate any of the larger phones. Unfortunately, it just didn't amplify the sound enough to work for me, as I had purchased it in the hopes that it would help my mother who is hearing impaired to hear her speakerphone better. The seller was very nice and offered a refund.
