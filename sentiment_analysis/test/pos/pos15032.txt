My cat absolutely goes crazy for these. They really are amazing!  They are very very well freeze dried and packaged. You can tell exactly what you're getting and theres no dust at the bottom of the bags. My cat loves the variety and every bite is exciting to her and to me because I know what she's getting is safe and I can portion them if the chunks are too big. They are easy to give and a real (in more than one way) treat to give her.
