This.  Product.  Works.  I am buying it in bulk and sharing it with everyone I know.  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  I left for a 3-week work trip and put a piece in one side of my vegetable drawer and one side, nothing.  The side with had NO mold or rot and the other side was full of mold!  AMAZING!  I put a small piece in my blueberries or raspberries, which usually seem to begin to mold within 2 days, and have been able to eat the entire container before seeing any mold.  I have a large size from Costco and it has been over a week.  Pristine, bursting wth flavor.  Perfect!  Thank you for sharing the "old knowledge" with us.  We should all be seeking solutions such as this.  A true benefit to our community and environment!
