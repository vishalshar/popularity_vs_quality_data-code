This gizmo works great on Fender guitar that has it's tuners all in a line on the same side of the head. Where it DOES work great is on Gibson like guitars that have tuners 3 on each side of the guitar head. Pretty hard to hold the Roadie Tuner on each tuner, hold the guitar, hold the iPhone and strum each string individually. It does NOT work that great on 12 string guitars either. I have a Rickenbacker 370/12 and it is a real balancing act to tune it with the Roadie Tuner. I decided to use the Roadie Tuner only on the Fender Guitars. With all other guitars I use my PolyTune Mini, which works great on all my guitars.
