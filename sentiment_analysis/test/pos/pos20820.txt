I like them.  The elastic distributes fairly well throughout the calf so they are pretty comfortable.  Others have mentioned holes but I didn't have that problem.  I agree that the fancy boxes are overkill...  I'd rather the price be a little lower and there be no box since I just generally throw all packaging away.
