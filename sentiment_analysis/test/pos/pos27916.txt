Farberware to me is a name that I can really trust in regards to their high quality standards, and this microwave is exac.  This microwave has a beautiful design (love the stainless steel/black combination) and works and cooks all types of food perfectly.  This is a high quality, beautiful microwave and a great value for the price.
