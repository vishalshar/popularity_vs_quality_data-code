I've been slowly switching my every-day skin and bath products to more natural, less-chemically enhanced products. It's take a while to find a volumizing line that I like. Seaweed Bath Co. is making me happy. I've been using it for two weeks and haven't noticed any negative reactions. My fine, short hair (I wear a pixie cut) has the same amount of volume it did with my previous, not natural conditioner, maybe a bit more. My hair seems soft and hydrated too. This all may simply be a result of not stripping my hair of its natural oils and weighing it down with additives that build-up after a while. Either way, I'm satisfied and plan to purchase again. This conditioner is a little less "whipped creamy" than other conditioners I've tried - almost like a night cream consistency. It spreads nicely and a little goes a long way. It has a pleasant lavender scent that reminds me of outdoors. It isn't super perfumed or "girly" smelling though. I'd say anyone could use it and it would be a good scent. It is on the expensive side though, even compared to some other natural product lines, but I'd rather have something that's better for me than cheaper (and sometimes not so cheap_ products that have harsh chemicals.
