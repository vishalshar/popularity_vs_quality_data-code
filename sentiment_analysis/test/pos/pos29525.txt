Installed a dog door to the backyard that, of course, my cat figured out how to use immediately. She started jumping over our 6 ft privacy fence and wandering the neighbourhood. I purchased this product and draped the wire along the top of our fence. Works like a charm. Cat tries to jump to the top of the fence, gets a quick correction before she can make it, and then falls back down. She wore her collar for a couple months and now we don't even bother putting it on her because she never tries to escape anymore. Definitely worth every penny to train her to stay in the backyard.
