This is a good halfway point between mascara and bare lashes. I have sensitive eyes and regular mascara tends to cause issues. I've had zero problems with sensitivity, with this product. If you want full, fake looking lashes then look elsewhere. This gives them just a touch more definition then bare. Another reviewer called it "camping mascara" which I agree with wholeheartedly!
