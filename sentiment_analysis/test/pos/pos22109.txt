I love my MOOV. The strap is the only drawback. I've lost my pod three times but fortunately I've found it each time. The strap itself is very comfortable but doesn't secure the device very good. The MOOV now 2 is not for the faint of heart. I primarily do the 7+ minute workout and the walking workout. They will both push you and put a hurting on you. You'll sweat and you will be sore. If the company can remedy the strap issue it would easily be a five star review from me.
