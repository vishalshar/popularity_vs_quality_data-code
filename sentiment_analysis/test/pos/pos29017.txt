Initial review (5/24/16):I am upgrading from a basic Phantom 2 that I purchased at the end of December 2015 which I now want sell if possible, let me know if interested.This drone is a great FPV flyer. Easy to fly, lots of options on the remote, display is awesome. Customer service is great as I had to call them when I first received it as the firmware would not automatically load like it should have and still didn't at the end of the call.  Matt with Autel offered to replace it which luckily I didn't have to do as I learned on my own I had to do a full reformat of the SD card which resolved the problem.Here is a group on Facebook dedicated Autel X-Star drones which was very helpful for me to problem solve my firmware update issue and provides lots of other support;Autel Robotics X-Star Owners GroupUPDATED review (6/12/16):I was having issues with the video feed lagging really bad, 1/2 second delay and waiting for the video to catch up with the drone and choppy feed.  I spoke with Tom who replaced the drone.  I had the opportunity to test the old drone with the new one to test out the video feed issues which Tom gave me permission to do.  The difference was like night and day, 1/16 of a second delay (normal) instead of 1/2 delay and not knowing which way the drone was pointed.
