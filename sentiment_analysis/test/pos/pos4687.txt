Looked for a nice transition cup between the bottle and sippy that was glass so I could heat up the contents.  I couldn't have been happier with my selection of siliskin sippy cup.  A little expensive but have have had two glasses for over a year and not had a single break or chip with plenty of dishwashing and dropping.  I recommend this to all my friends as the best alternative to plastic.
