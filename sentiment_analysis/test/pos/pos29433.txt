I purchased these as an alternative to the fabric storage bags I had been using for my daughter's lunch. These keep the food a lot fresher (she says her sandwich bread doesn't get hard any more) and are fairly easy to clean. I can see how they may be challenging for younger kids to get open, but older kids shouldn't have a problem. The only issue I've had is drying them after cleaning--I haven't yet worked out a way to keep them open to dry out the inside after rinsing them out, so I end up hand drying them with a towel.
