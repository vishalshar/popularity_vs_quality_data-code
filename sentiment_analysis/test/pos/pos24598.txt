Wow! What a great item! I really love the convenience of the pouches and having no need for tons of newspaper and kindling for starting a campfire. I use this at my folks cabin in the fire pit and we start with full size pieces of wood and 1 packet of instafire. That gets you a roaring fire in about 10 minutes. Much better results than fat wood or fire starting pucks. Just light the pouch and your done! Very pleased with the product.
