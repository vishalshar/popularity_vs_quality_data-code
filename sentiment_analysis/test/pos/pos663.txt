I only use this and not mascara and it's the best way to have dark lashes without the gross mascara gunk. I'm fair-skinned, with brown hair and brown lashes and this makes my lashes dark brown/almost black. Regular mascara dries my lashes so much they fall out, but this stuff has actually helped my lashes grow. I also use it on my eyebrows and it's nice because unlike a pencil it doesn't get on your skin or look fake. I usually don't spend a ton on cosmetics, so $20 was a bit much for me, but I've had this one tube for a year and it's still wet and not at all clumpy, so it was well worth it (might not be the most hygienic thing to use the same brush for a year but I haven't had any problems!)Sometimes when I want a more dramatic night look I put regular mascara on top of it, but by morning I have raccoon eyes no matter how much I tried to get it off the night before. If you're on the fence, I suggest going for it. The worst that could happen is it doesn't make your lashes dark enough and then you still have a good conditioner/base to put reg. mascara on top of if that's your thing.
