Are you like me in that you hit the snooze button so often, that when you're halfway to work you realize you forgot to comb your hair? If so, this little comb will prove an invaluable tool. It fits very well in my wallet and has saved me from looking like a disheveled mess on more than one occasion.This thing is solid, yet lightweight, and worth the price even if you need to use it just once. Buy one -- you won't regret it!
