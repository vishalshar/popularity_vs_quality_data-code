The wink oil looks and smells a lot like Castor Oil and is one of the ingredients. I have been applying it to my eyebrows because they are a bit sparse in some areas. It took a bunch of clicks to get it primed but it easy to apply. I just swipe it onto my eyebrows and then rub it in with my finger. I have been using it for about a week and have noticed that my eyebrows are growing in a lot faster. I use it twice a day and am hoping it will continue to fill in my eyebrows.Overall, a good product!I received a discount in order to test the product.
