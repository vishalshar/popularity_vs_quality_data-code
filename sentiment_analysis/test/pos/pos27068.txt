I ordered this  'Peter Lamas Natural Lash Builder, Tint, Conditioner' after reading the reviews & knowing full well it probably was NOT a true 'lash tint' & rather more likely a mascara-like tinting conditioner. I was right. I tried it out as soon as it arrived & wore it over night. It did NOT last the night! But! I gave it 4 stars because; I can't wear mascara! I've tried every single type out there, gave it up! I use those 'Lash Builders' & then use 'clear mascara'. Colored mascara clumps on me, plain & simple. I always, every single time-end up taking it off. This stuff-not a clump to be found anywhere! AMAZING! While it is nowhere near a long-lasting 'tint', it is definitely a wonderful, non-clumping mascara! YAH! As far as the 'builder' & 'conditioner' part, that remains to be seen, but it has now become my one & only favorite mascara of all time! TYVM, Peter Lamas! :)
