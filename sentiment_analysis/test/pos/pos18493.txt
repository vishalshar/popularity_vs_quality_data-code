I got this as a Christmas gift (2015).  Like most of the buyers of this product, I was tired of fishing around for multiple remotes, hoping the one I needed hadn't walked off.  Control all of my home theater devices with my iPhone?  Hell, yes.  I always have my iPhone with me.Set up was easy enough.  You essentially get to "design your own remote", deciding which buttons you want from the different remotes placed in the position you want.  You can even set up macros if you want to program a series of steps for a button.  For example, when I press the power button for my TV, it powers on the TV, waits 15 seconds (because my TV is crappy and takes that long before it will respond to commands), then switches the TV to the correct HDMI input, powers up the cable box, then powers up the sound bar.  I have similar macros set up for my Blu-Ray and WD Play box.But what really pushes this product into the 5-star realm is support.  Like I said, I got this on Christmas day.  Got it all set up, but was having trouble getting the TV Guide working for my cable provider.  On New Years Day, I went to the website, found the support email address, and shot an email about the problem, expecting a response a few days out.  I got my response within a FEW HOURS.  On a HOLIDAY.  We exchanged a couple of emails until my problem was resolved.I've had occasional to email a couple more times with questions, and have always gotten a response within 24 hours... usually within 3 hours.  That kind of support is damned near impossible to find anymore.  These guys really want this product to succeed, and it shows in their dedication.Have been telling everyone I know about this product.  Check it out.
