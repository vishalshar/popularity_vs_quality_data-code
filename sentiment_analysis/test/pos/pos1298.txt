Seems like there are a lot of negative reviews of this product, so I wanted to throw in the positive experience I've had.I can't really comment on the DOAs that people seem to have experienced, except to say that the two I ordered worked right out of the box.They were easy to connect to my home wifi and have never shown up as offline.The only false alarms I get are from the one in my son's room (he's an infant) when his cries are particularly ear-piercing. I could move it to another room, but I can distinguish the false alarms because I have two Roost batteries and all my detectors are interconnected. So if only one of them is alarming it's a false positive.Reason some of you might get chirps with the Roost installed is because there are apparently a couple detector models that are incompatible with the Roost (more on their website). But if your smokes are interconnected, hopefully you have another that's compatible and you can just put it in that one.I've had one connected for ~6 months and the other ~2 months.Also, the one time I had to email support re the false alarms (before I knew the cause), they were very responsive.
