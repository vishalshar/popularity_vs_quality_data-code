I love how the box neatly fits the Rachio and it's power supply. Dropping one star because the door latch does not hold very securely. The latch plastic is so malleable that the door snaps open with a light pull on any edge. I feared it would even pop open on its own. I guess it's supposed to be locked with a small suit-case type of lock. I used a zip tie. I should not have to open the door very often, so occasionally replacing the zip tie is not a big deal. Prepare to have a lock or zip tie or something else to keep the door closed for extended periods of time (securing the door is a requirement in my area).Another tip: The face plate that comes with the Rachio is for indoor use. Remove it when using the outdoor enclosure. I was not clear about this initially, but figured it out with trial and error (turns out a brief instruction mentions it, sort of).
