So the big question I had when purchasing this system was whether or not I could lower my cost by refilling with crystals I buy at Wal-Mart.  As a graduate student, I really don't have the money to buy cartidges every couple of weeks (I've got two cats).  This review is basically here to tell you that I've done it, and it works for me. YMMV.As a first attempt, I simply threw away the old crystals and poo, and then filled it up with  ~4 lbs. of fresh step crystals purchased at Wal-Mart (~$[...] for an 8-lb bag or two refills).Problem #1: Wet Cardboard.  This is a documented problem with the system, as noted in reviews for the litter box, but I basically could only get two uses out of the cardboard box before the cat claws could pierce the bottom and cause soaking of the box in urine.Solution #1: There is no solution for the wet box problem, unless you can tolerate an impressively disgusting urine stench.  Luckily, Scoop Free improved their cartridge systems!  Note that new cartridges come with a slight change to the cartridge that has improved its sturdiness.  They have added a plastic sheet to the bottom of the cartridge to prevent cat claws from piercing the bottom and having the pee soak through to the bottom.Great!  Problem solved, right?  Well, I then started experiencing Problem #2: a screeching noise during the raking that really sounded quite awful.  At first I thought this was my fault, possibly overfilling the box and causing the machinery to operate with too much litter.  That wasn't the problem.  The problem was that as the cats continued to use this cartridge (with plastic sheet), their claws would occassionally get under the plastic sheet and lift it up, causing litter to get underneath the plastic sheet.  This plastic sheet would bulge up at the sides, and the raking mechanism would then start scraping the plastic surface as it raked, causing the screeching sound.Solution #2:  Now, for each new cartridge I use (I still use a new cartridge after about 2 or 3 refills), I use mailing tape (or duct tape) to tape down the edges of the plastic sheet. This takes some practice, but I have not experienced any screeching noises since.Anyways, I hope this review helps!  I also find this 3-pack to be great because it qualifies for amazon prime 2-day service.  Thanks, Amazon!
