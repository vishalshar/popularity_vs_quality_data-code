As an owner of 7 ilumi bulbs.  I'm somewhat satisfied with this product.  It was easy to setup but app still need some improvement.  Certain option doesn't work that well or didn't work at all for me without giving it some TLC.  It has mind of it's own.  Besides that, everything else works great.  The main option I use most is lights on/off/dim with Bluetooth.  So the other stuff is not a big deal for me but it would be nice if it work like it suppose to for other people.Ilumi team - please make smaller bulbs for ceiling fan or with motion sensor.  Also please update to where I can sync with Pandora or Spotify.
