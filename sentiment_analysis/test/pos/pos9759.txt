Exactly what I expected and needed! Friendly tip, for those who'd like to attach it to your keyring, you'll want to attach the green loop side to the keyring.  I started by attaching the black side and it accidentally went off during the first day I had it.  Since I switched to attaching the green side, it has not accidentally gone off at all.  This product is a MUST HAVE items for anyone who goes places alone at night.
