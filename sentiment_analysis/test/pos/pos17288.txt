Since I've been preggers, I've had problems sleeping at night and tracking my physical activity. Also, I hate wearing watches that double as fitness trackers. This Bellabeat Leaf is so pretty - it looks great clipped on my top, and love the necklace and bracelet options.Over the last few days, I've been using it to monitor my sleep, activities, and even my pregnancy stage. So useful! I've been wearing it to be bed, clipped on my top. Also, like the fact I don't need to charge this at night, since the battery is supposed to last 6 mos.
