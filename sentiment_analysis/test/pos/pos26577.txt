This is a great product that has some room for improvement. I mainly purchased this because of the treat dispensing feature. I have a dog who likes to wander into the kitchen and get into the trash when I'm gone, and I wanted to find a way I could train this behavior out by rewarding him for staying in the living room. It's been really helpful so far, but I've mostly used it as a way to check in on my dogs instead of a training aid.Pros:+ Treat dispensing feature is great. You are able to use any kinds of treats you want, although they have suggestions for what works best.+ Video is good quality. You are able to take snapshots.+ You can send audio.+ Overall a good design. I worried about my dogs trying to bust open the container to get the treats but it would be hard to do so. It's easy to mount it on the wall. It looks nice.+ The support team is very nice. They respond promptly and they are very helpful. They seem to genuinely care about keeping their customers, unlike some dog product companies. If you have a problem with your device, I'm sure they will fix it.+ The camera only turns on when you connect through the app.Cons:- Audio is only one-way. Originally, their Kickstarter said it would be two-way so I'm not sure what happened there. This feature would have been a major improvement.- You can only view the camera through their application. It would be great if there was a way to view it online too, so I can keep an eye on it throughout the day.- There are delays with everything. Your video is delay by a few seconds, and any interactive button you push has a delay as well. I expected a slight delay, but it's slower than I hoped. My internet connection is fast, so that isn't the issue here.- Treat dispensing mechanism can use some work. They suggest hard treats that are at least 1 inch long, but even the treats they supply you with that match this description aren't perfect. Sometimes one treat gets dispensed, sometimes 4+ do. I've also seen it get stuck once. I wish there was a better way to control how much got dispensed.- Minor con, but I feel their their social feature is a waste of time. They created a new social networking site that you can upload pictures of your pets to, much like instagram and the more dog-focused Pack. It has nothing to do with the camera. I rarely even see any photos posted that are actually taken from snapshots. I wish they would have put the effort into improving another part of the application instead.Some easier improvements: I'd like to see the addition of video recording in the future in addition to their snapshot feature. I'd also like to see a way to record video throughout the day. Currently, you're only able to view the camera when you connect with your phone. You can't see what happened in the past. It would also be great if you could set it up to alert you when there's movement.Overall, it's a good purchase if you want to be able to interact with your pet more, instead of just watching them.
