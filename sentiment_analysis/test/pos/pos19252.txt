I've had mine for a little over 3 weeks and so far I'm impressed with it. I've gotten alerts when my air quality is abnormal as well as alerts when there is activity in my home. I had a neighbor that has had her house broken into. I live in a normal area not out of the ordinary. After hearing of the break in, I felt it was time to get a security device that doesn't look like a security device. This thing does the job! As a test, I asked my mom to stop by and check to see if I left the tv on. She went and checked for me and my canary sent my phone an alert that my home had activity. I was able to view from when she opened the door and could actually hear the locks bot unlock and relock.As an added bonus, you can download footage of any activity within your time frame.I'm not crafty but I want to build a box around mine and leave enough room on it so it seems like a flower vase. I can't say enough to words about it. I truly love mine and plan to buy another for my grandmother.
