I purchased this "robot" for my 11 year old grandson who is usually immersed in video games. His father had been trying to teach him how to begin programming and fortunately, this Sphero is perfect for teaching and challenging preteens and teens in computer programming. The ball moves and reacts to how it is programmed. The description from the inventors is quite accurate. I highly recommend this "object" if you are looking for a gift which would intrigue the teen in your life. Excellent gift!!
