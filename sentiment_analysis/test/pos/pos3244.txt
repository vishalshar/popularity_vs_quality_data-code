I'm an interior design student and this stylus comes in handy for doodling ideas and concept images on my iPad.  I really like how well it works with the Paper app as well as the Autodesk Sketchbook app. It's very easy to connect and charges quickly. I saw that some people have an issue with the rubber tips with heavy use, but I use mine for about 2-5 hours a day and so far haven't had any extreme wear issues. It's pretty accurate and the bluetooth functions are cool and convenient. I've been watching this product for a while and I'm glad that I finally bought it.
