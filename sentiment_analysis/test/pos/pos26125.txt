The Illumibowl has a hypnotizing effect that's better than having a lava lamp in your toilet! Dogs and cats can't see color, so they ignore it. My wife, on the other hand, will stare at it for minutes at a time. HINT: for the suction cups to work, the toilet surface has to be clean, or, really, CLEAN. Use Windex. Then rub hard with a paper towel until dry. Moisten the cups with plain water. Then they work fine.
