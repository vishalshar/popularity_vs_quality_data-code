Excellent Phone for the price.  My husband and I both purchased one I did gold and he did black.  Excellent battery life, extremely lightweight, brilliant screen color.  Camera and video are superb.  All my friends and family are jealous, because they over paid for other phones that have same features.  Only posh Titan Max has more including FM radio.  I soooo LOVE this phone! Speaker and Bluetooth is awesome.  You also have access to all plays tore apps like on a regular android phone.  For my family members needing phones this year, Posh mobile will be my gift of choice!
