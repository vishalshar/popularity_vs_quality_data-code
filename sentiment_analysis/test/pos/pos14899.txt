My cats love this food. I always try to buy high quality and I rotate around flavours and brands frequently to avoid too much exposure to any specific food that might be "bad". Solid Gold makes a nice product and I've tried all the varieties they produce. I do have a cat with some pretty significant food allergies and Moonlight Prowl fits the bill nicely for him as duck is a less common protein source. Plus all 5 of my cats seem to love the taste and they can rarely agree about anything so that is huge plus.
