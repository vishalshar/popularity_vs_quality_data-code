I'm totally LOVING my ToneyBands!!!! I came across these little gems after looking to get a little more out of my workouts!!! When I learned you could burn an additional 15% more calories  just by strapping them on your arm, I was like "heck YES"! So now, not only do I love them, but all of my students noticed a difference in my arms and jumped on board and have bought them as well!!! I highly recommend these cardio wrist weights to add to your existing workouts, whether it be running, walking, yoga, Pilates, cleaning the house (we all know thats a workout in itself) or ZUMBAŽ...like myself! ?
