There was no sign of anything but white mold for 13 days. Then, all of a sudden and without ANY prior indication that anything was growing, on the 14th day there were spores the size of a quarter. By that evening the cluster was the size of a silver dollar and now, the next day, the cluster is a little bigger than a walnut. These suckers are growing fast! I don't know how big the mushrooms will get yet, but I was on this page a couple of days ago looking for reviews to advise me whether to keep going or just to chuck the whole thing in the compost. I'm certainly glad I waited!For those of you wondering if these mushrooms are ever coming, be patient! Unless you luck out, it will probably take a couple of weeks before you see signs of life.
