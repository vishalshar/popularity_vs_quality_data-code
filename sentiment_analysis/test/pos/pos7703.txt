With my first child, she had reflux and spit up ALL THE TIME, plus she blew out her diaper almost every morning (no tricks worked to stop the blow outs, a negative to her awesome sleep habits). I HATED changing the sheets on her crib with the standard sheets. I used the method of layers the sheets: mattress, mattress pad, sheet, waterproof liner, sheet, waterproof liner, sheet. It worked, but I was still washing everything twice a week and remaking the crib.For my second child I wanted something easier and found these. The price tag was hefty, but I used gift card received and my registry completion discount to purchase them to defray the cost, and they are AMAZING. Of course this baby hardly ever spits up and never blows out his diaper, so I didn't need them for the constant bedding changes, but I still LOVE these and HIGHLY recommend them to each family I hear is expecting. These are so easy to change!  I still put the waterproof pad underneath the top sheet so I don't have to mess with changing the mattress pad cover, but being able to zip off the old sheet and quickly zip on the new sheet is so incredibly easy and awesome, I actually LIKE changing his sheets!Now if only they could get a license with Disney and manufacture some princess sheets for a full bed that would just make me even happier (hint, hint!)
