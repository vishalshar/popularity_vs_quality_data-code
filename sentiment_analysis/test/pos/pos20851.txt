I got the PetCube primarily to check on my dog and be able to talk to him via cell phone without having to signup for any recording/streaming contracts other camera manufacturers require. I'll go through a brief review of the Petcube itself and my experience with the product.The Petcube itself:The Cube itself feels very substantial when compared to other pet cameras. The cube is wrapped in silver sand blasted aluminum which gives a premium feel and stability to avoid knockdowns. It has a rubber pad on the bottom to avoid slipping on slick surfaces and a tripod mount for placement closer to my dogs play area. I happened to have a cheap camera tripod which the cube screwed right into, but chose to place it on the counter to avoid running a cable across the room.The camera itself is slightly tilted down which allowed me to placement the cube on a table without having to tilt the entire camera down  nice! The laser pointer is remote controlled and has a wide range of motion.Setup and Use:The Cube is controlled via downloadable Petcube app  free in the Appstore. Im the type of person who throws the instruction manual into the garbage as these days everything is pretty self-explanatory. The setup ended-up being a little tricky, but I was able to figure it out within a couple of minutes. I had to pair the cube (via the App) with my account and home wifi -> this is done via the Me tab and clicking Add a Petcube Camera. Once the pairing process was complete I was up and running.Once I had the feed streaming, I moved the laser pointer around my dog who promptly tried to catch it! I also was able to get him to sit/lie down and get in his bed via the built in speaker. It was fairly entertaining to say the least, he looked pretty dumbfounded as I wasnt in the room, but hey, when owner says sit you sit.One of the AWESOME features the App has is the ability to broadcast your feed (and control of sound/laser!) to friends/family or publicly. You can let other people in the cloud control your petcube and play with your pet when you are away. Usually there is a bunch of other people broadcasting; I spent a good 30 minutes playing with cats from around the world!I definitely recommend this to any pet lover. It is a neat concept and the ability to remote control the laser pointer blows other pet cams out of the water.
