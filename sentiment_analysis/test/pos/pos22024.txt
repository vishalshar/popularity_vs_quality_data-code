This was my first VR headset purchase. I received them several days ago and have really enjoyed themso have my kids. They are incredibly comfortable because the foam material they are made out of. Maybe more importantly for us, theyre easy to adjust for multiple users (other family members in my case). We can adjust both the straps and the lens themselves in less than 5 seconds which makes passing them around really easy. I whipped them out at a birthday party the other day and they were a hit.I think one of the best things that Merge has done is make it easy to find good content that works with the headset. There actually is an amazing about of stuff out there - from 3D video, to games, to specialty app store apps. When you first put the headset on you can get started enjoying them right away, which for me was important to hook me.Finally, the headset itself feels incredibly durable. You can tell they took a lot of time to design this with comfort and quality in mind. They are soft and strong at the same time. I am really impressed with this headset and hope they release even more gear soon!
