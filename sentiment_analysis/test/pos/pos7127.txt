I absolutely love the Hatch Baby app. It is by far the easiest, most intuitive baby app out there. When I learned Hatch Baby made the Smart Changing Pad, I knew it was a must-have. The pad and the app sync beautifully together to track feelings, diapers, sleep, growth, etc. They are both so easy to use! Even with mom brain!
