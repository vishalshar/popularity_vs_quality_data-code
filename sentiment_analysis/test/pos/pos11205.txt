I was a little concerned about video connectivity and lack of motion sensing as some described.  I have the doorlock from August and though it works, I didn't think I'd need it after all, but figured I'd try it out with the doorbell.  The doorbell itself it very easy to install, assuming you have easy access to a currently wired doorbell and know not to touch the "hot" wire until the power is disconnected.  My wiring was a bit old, so I had to wrap it more than I wanted to be safe, but of course not August's fault.  The set up was a little frustrating as the initial connection on set up took much longer than I would have liked and it wasn't clear on the iPhone screen whether or not it timed out or was still connecting, so I stopped it and did it again, but waited longer on second try and it was fine. Like the instructions online (they should include these in the box) i moved my router right next to the doorbell during setup the second time, then moved it back when done.  I have an Apple Airport Extreme router.  It sits about 15 feet or so from where the doorbell is, which is mounted on a brick wall outside.  I have zero connectivity issues, none.  I can see video, connect to door lock, etc, just fine, video quality is good.  Alerts are sometimes delayed, but that could be the network and my wifi as well, so I don't freak out over that.  If the network and my internet provider was perfect all the time, I'd expect August products to be perfect as well.  But if you are thinking of getting one, be sure to watch the instructions online and move your router directly next to the installed doorbell if you can on install, it might help the initial setup.  I did contact August before purchasing and asked about motion sensing.  They said that was working a week or two before I purchased.  I can confirm that it does sense motion and you can set sensitivity.  I also do not have the August connect device but can connect to the door lock through the doorbell and unlock the door that way.
