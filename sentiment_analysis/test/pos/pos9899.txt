I bought the stuff and found it didn't work very well and the stick was gone after a couple minutes. Later i contacted grip boost and told them about my problem with their product; they stated that i received a bad bottle and sent me a new one free of charge. The new bottle works great and restores the grip on my gloves. Overall a good experience with grip boost.
