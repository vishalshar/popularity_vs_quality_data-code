I do not use crib bumpers as they are no longer recommended as being safe for a baby's crib by the AAP, but I still love these zipper sheets! Prior to using them it was such a hassle to get a sheet on without bunching up the mattress pad and pulling the crib skirt off. Now it is so much easier. You do need to use a flat mattress pad with this product, not a fitted one. As our mattress is wrapped with plastic, we often use a receiving blanket or flat towel instead of a waterproof pad. You just unzip your old sheet, lay a new pad down, zip on a new one and done! I cant do it one-handed, but almost! I took off one star because I feel that the product is over-priced by the company. The organic ones are outrageously priced.
