Very cool thermal imaging attachment to your smart phone.  Easy to use and is quite effective in finding drafts and will even pick up the heat transfer from a handprint on a desk or countertop.  It will also pick up the heat signature in a mirror.  I give it only 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the clarity/definition of objects was more crisp than what it is.  However do not let that stop you from purchasing this.  It really is a nice effective attachment for both work uses and for fun.  It also comes with a nice protective case to store it in.
