I'm backpacking and most hostels/guesthouses do not provide towels or towels for free. I researched ahead of time and found that this towel was the one I'd purchase. I've used its for 10 days straight (allowing it to dry after) and it only began to smell towards the end of the 10 days. I'm pretty impressed and I really like that it dries quickly.Pros:-Dries-Can fold up to the size of a pair of socks-Really does resist odors-Stays soft-Superlight-Soaks up a surprisingly large amount of water-I got the large size and I'm glad I did (its the size of a normal towel and you can wear it around your lower body to the showers etc.)Cons:-WAY TO MUCH DYE. I had to soak this in a sink and drain a bunch of times before I washed it. It really has a bunch of leftover dye-I wish it had loopholes or something if you want to hang it but you can't have everything in this world haha
