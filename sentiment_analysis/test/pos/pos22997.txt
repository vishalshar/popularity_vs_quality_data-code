My son loves this, but it takes some time learning how to use the pen and getting used to using it properly. The videos are a bit misleading because you can't just draw in the air freely; you have to start on a surface and can only draw vertically a short distance before making any other moves. The plastic just falls (I'm sure because of gravity) if you try to draw in the air.
