Good Switches - No Hub Required.  Check out IFTTT.Im editing my review because I now own both the outlet switch and light switch.I like the idea of having switches that dont require a hub like so many others do.  I own this light switch as well as the version that plugs into an outlet, see my review of that one as well.  I think that the WeMo platform is stable and well thought out although I do wish there was a laptop/desktop (non-mobile) interface.  If you only have a few switches it is fine, but if you had like 3 or more it would get cumbersome.Don't let the other reviews scare you if you are technology competent.  I hesitated to buy this because of the connectivity problem in other reviews.  I can only conclude that those people are more like my grandmother than myself.  I will say that installing the light switch requires a bit of electrical knowledge (or at least willingness to learn) and a bit of patience with the WiFi setup.  I also had to switch WiFi networks at one point and it was a bit of a hassle and required a decent amount of googling around forums.  There is a helpful video on this page.  No, it isn't absolutely an easy 1-2-3 set-up, but I don't really have any complaints either.  This thing does what it says it does, has a good app, and works well for me.In the app you can also set up more complicated rules for on-off, so it isn't like your light go on and off at the same time every day, making it obvious they are on a timer, you can use sunrise/set.  I also like that you can disable rules without deleting them.  So I can basically have a set for when I'm home, and a set when I'm out, and it is a simple transition from one to the other.What I like about the light switch as opposed to the outlet switch is that you can use it without the app.  You can just press the switch and never have to care that it is a WeMo switch if you want.  This is nice because with the outlet switch you have to leave the lamps on and control it only with the app (yes there is a button, but it is inconvenient).  This means that guests or anyone else has to learn about your nutty setup just to turn on a lamp.  This light switch fixes this problem and I really enjoy that.I travel a lot for work, and so I use these mostly as a light timers just so it isn't so obvious when I'm not home.  What I like is that when I am in a hurry out the door I don't have to bother setting anything, and I can just do it once I'm waiting at the airport.  You can do all kinds of nutty stuff like setting it up with a motion sensor, but for me it is just a controllable light timer.  It should be noted that this literally 16x the price of a normal light timer, so you pay a hefty premium for all of this.I have the light switch installed in my bedroom and I use it to help myself wake up.  Im a heavy sleeper and having the lights turn on is a huge help.By the time you are reading this I will assume that you know that the light switch will require a neutral wire and a deep electrical box.  This is almost guaranteed in newer construction, but you should check you switch box before purchasing.  Obviously this doesnt apply to the outlet switch.An often overlooked aspect of the WeMo platform is the IFTTT integration.  I think this provides two huge opportunities.  The first is that you can add Do buttons to your lock screen.  This means you can control the lights without unlocking your phone or opening an app.  Its just like swiping up and opening the camera.  Ive included a picture of what this looks like.  The second nice part of the IFTTT is that you can utilize the actual if functionalities.  For example: I have mine setup so that if I lose my phone I can press and hold the light switch and it will call me.HOWEVER, I bought the light switch when it was $42 and it has been going up in price.  I think that as it approaches $50 the competition really opens up and the alternatives are worth consideration.  This is a 20% price hike and I think that is substantial.Also, two minor complaints  First, the outlet switch itself if huge.  I feel like it should be 1/3 the size it is.  Also, the light switch has an indicator light on it which is a bit bright for my tastes.  You can see in one of the pictures that I have a bit of card stock taped over it to make it dimmer.
