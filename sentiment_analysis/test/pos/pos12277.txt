Some background: I really like a Gold Toe product called CusionTec. It fits well; lasts a long time; is reasonably priced; and has good cushioning. Unfortunately, I can no longer find the ankle sock in black. (Kohl's sometimes has the white-colored version.) So, I've been looking for a good replacement, and that led me to the Galiva Men's Cotton Extra Soft Ankle Cushion Sock.The good points:-The fit is just about right in Large for my shoe-size 13 skinny feet--not too tight, not too loose.-The construction seems to be good (see below). Probably not as good as the DarnTough brand, but those socks are really expensive.-The feel is soft.-The price is reasonable--decent value.The bad points:-The socks throw off thread and lint, and the black "droppings" really look bad on light carpet, and also look nasty on your feet. I thought maybe this problem would go away after I washed them, but, no, it has continued. (I turned the socks inside out when I washed them.) At the very least, the laundering instructions should recommend washing before wearing.-The cushioning isn't as good as the Gold Toe socks.-The packaging boxes are a nice touch if you're planning to give the socks as a gift. Otherwise, they're a wasteful use of packaging, and probably add to the ultimate cost.-I bought 2 sets of 3 pairs of socks, or a total of 6 pairs, or 12 socks. Eleven of the socks were the same size; one of the socks is longer by about an inch. That's worrisome in terms of quality control.Overall, these are good socks, but they could be better.
