I saw a review of these bags on a TV cooking show, so decided to try them.  We have wasted so much good and expensive cheeses due to spoilage over the years.  The bags work very well, keeping cheese fresh for about 2-3 weeks as opposed to 4 or 5 days when wrapped in cellophane.  While they are expensive, they more than pay for themselves.
