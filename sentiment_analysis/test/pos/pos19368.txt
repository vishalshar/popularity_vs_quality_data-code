Thync really works. As scientists, we were a bit skeptical but after using for a couple weeks, we are very happy with both the calm and energy strips. My skepticism evaporated when, while using the calm strip, I was relaxed enough to have a rather drawn out conversation about Roger the gnome who was going to give me a piggyback ride. Seriously, I was that relaxed!We definitely use the calm more often for anxiety relief and it really does work. Better than taking Xanax.
