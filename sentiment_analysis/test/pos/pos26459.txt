Love the idea and the product but it's not constructed very well. In less than a month the stitching has split where the tag is and has left a huge whole in the pillow. Unfortunate as I was going to order more as gifts but have since changed my mind.Edit - Top Shelf Fun reached out to me after reading my review and has offered to replace the defect. Great service is rare now a days and is very much appreciated. Buyers please don't let my initial issue affect your decisions.
