This looks like people food. Seriously - higher quality than what I eat most of the time. You do have to take a moment though to chop it up because it is not processed to the extent of most popular brands. I recommend adding some additional water and creating a 'soup'. It will be easy to prep and your cats will get all that water they need.When I go to pick up the food bowls after a meal they look as clean as if they came out of the dishwasher.
