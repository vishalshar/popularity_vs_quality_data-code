I'm reviewing this on behalf of my cat; I have not actually tried it. My not-very-picky Russian Blue needs to lose weight and this (Pollock Grain Free Weight Control) is a fairly low-cal dry food from a respected company. As with any new cat food, introduce this slowly by gradually increasing the ratio of this against the food your cat is familiar with, and watch for tummy troubles or litterbox issues. I am glad to have this option to help keep my guy healthy, and he seems to like it just fine. (He hated the Quail and Pumpkin, although it's higher cal and sounds much fancier!)Solid Gold Holistic Dry Cat Food, All Breeds, All Life StagesÂ Pollock Grain Free Weight Control blend
