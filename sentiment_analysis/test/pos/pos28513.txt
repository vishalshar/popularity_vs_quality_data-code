I like these and that the supplement is in the dog treats. I gave one to each of my dogs and they gobbled them down. That says a lot because my dogs are picky about their treats and food except for my little Chihuahua. She is my garbage disposal.But for bigger size dogs this could be quite expensive. It states it takes 3 sticks for a dog over 50 lbs. And 2 of my dogs are over 50 lbs easily. So that is practically 7 treats a day for my 3 dogs. This would be nice if there were enough treats for a month.  The packaging does not state how many treats are in the bag just the weight. I would want to know how many so I can plan accordingly. I know that these are supplements but you do want to give them everyday so it helps. This would be nice if there were enough treats for a month because we have been doing pills with pill treats which can be quite time consuming.I love the variety of treats. Love that they are sourced here and made in America also.They smell delicious too.The size is great but do they really need to be that big.  Could it not be a smaller treat so there could be more in the bag.I will count how many are in the bag and update my review.I was not financially compensated for this review. I have received a sample for review purposes. The opinions are completely my own based on my experience.
