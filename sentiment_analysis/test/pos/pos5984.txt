Never believed anything affordable could smooth out my wrinkles. I'm 34 and had a noticeable wrinkle between my brows. It made me appear angry when I was not :-( In less than 2 weeks I noticed an dramatic difference. Wow! I don't know what I am more excited about;  my wrinkle disappearing or that I am now a believer. I have faith that with continued use my skin will become more firm and healthy and that it will show.
