I discovered this in a local discount store and purchased it thinking that it would probably be another yet another failure to add to my hair product stockpile. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it works wonders on my fine hair and adds body that lasts.  I use it before blow drying and my hair simply does what I want it to!  Believe it or not, ladies.  Try it. I am now adding it to my Subscribe and Save orders because I don't want to be without it.
