The name says it all.  I backed the project on day one and received my reward in October of 2015.  Very pleased the creator of this stellar product took the time to get it right and keeps after it to ensure all backers see their reward.  When Amazon started selling them I bought another. I told a fried to get one as well, and his begrudging approval came along with high marks for the Bluetooth speaker.  Another friend bought one and gave it away because it was too big to fit in his R44 (and he got the repulsive green one). Anyway, the Coolest is easily the highest quality and best in class product.  If you want a cooler to take on safari or around the world on a sailboat, get one of the half dozen products that are just a cooler and pay more.  If you're going to the beach, tailgating or out on the pontoon, there is no better choice.  Nothing comes close. There are folks on here deriding the product.  They are the people you don't like to hang out with because nothing makes them happy.  This cooler is one of those items that will make you smile every time you use it.  It's awesome.  USB charger. Stainless hinges.  Plates, knife, cutting board.  LED light.  I got matching color utensils just to complete the outings.
