My husband loves taking these vitamins. Love that they contain methylated vitamins vs. synthetic as well as many other supplements not commonly found in a multi that are beneficial for your health.Our only complaint is that these contain folic acid vs folate/methyl folate. Not sure why that is, however, since the women's version does?
