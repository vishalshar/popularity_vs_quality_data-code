This is a great lead for the water.  Used it this week when I took my pup to the ocean. The color makes it easy to see.  It floats which keeps it easy to reach and limits the tangles. The length allowed my dog to have a great deal of fun, without my fear of her swimming too far out.  Loved it so much. My friend is now ordering one for her fur baby.
