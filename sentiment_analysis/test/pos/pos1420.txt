I want to love Spire.  I really do.  The team is seriously onto something with this whole "let your respiration rate (and consistency) be your guide" thing.The app is headed in the right direction: bugs are being squashed, features are being proposed and incorporated.The hardware of the device itself is rugged (I've dropped it several times, 1 of which was in a pool..) and unobtrusive (without fail I forget I'm wearing it).  For the fashion focussed there's the third design "plus" that this device is worn out-of-sight instead of having to make due with an unsightly wearable for all to see.  I couldn't care less about that last point, but can very well imagine that some wearers just might.So far so good.  Here's where the hiccups come in.  Spire tries really hard to relay actionable advice, and some of it is!  Other times, it's not.  When you haven't been active for an hour, the Spire stone will chastise you.  That's actionable.  When you're notified that you seem tense, that's actionable too.  When you're told that you just focussed for 20 minutes, that's just data.So what does this all mean?  To appreciate Spire you have to decide why you're wearing it.  In my opinion it all comes down to upping your awareness: what am I doing right now that's negatively affecting me?  After disabling notifications that are just telling me what I did in the past (I was calm, I was focussed, etc.) and enabling the notifications pertaining to what's happening right NOW (inactivity, tension, shallow breathing), Spire became 100% more useful.  If I were to dock a star it would be because I, as the end user, shouldn't have to make all of these correlations myself; the app should help do this for me.  But maybe my use case isn't yours, and maybe my settings don't suit you.  It's a hard problem to solve.  Spire's taking an admirable crack at it and I, for one, am pretty stoked to be along for this ride :)
