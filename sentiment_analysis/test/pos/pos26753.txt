This Polarpro tripled tripod stick is amazing! Not only does it hold the iPhone and GoPro hero5 it holds the Sony rx100.  Very well built!  I love the tripod feature and how easy it is to extent.  With the stick extended and the Sony rx100 on it there is no movement or wobble.  If you area vlogger this would be a great stick to have.
