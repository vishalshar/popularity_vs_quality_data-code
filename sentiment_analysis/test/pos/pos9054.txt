I really really like my leaf!! I would almost say love-but there are a few feature I think they will be able to improve on in future Leafs-a heart rate monitoring during activity and sleep(especially with sleep tracking) could make it more accurate-I feel like the sleep tracking is super sensitive-I know that my sleep is not the most regular, but I don't think it's that little-if there was a way to get this to be more accurate that would be awesome!!! I like that tries to track ovulation-but I understand that it is just an educated guess and should not be used as a definitive answer on that!!! Overall its a great product, very pretty and I love wearing it!!!
