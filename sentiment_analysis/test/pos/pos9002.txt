I bought this product to help monitor my mash temperatures for homebrewing. Overall, it works fairly well when testing it against my thermoworks (+/- 1 degree F). The graphs are easy to read, and alarms can be set with ease (be sure to read how to do this before you actually try). My issue with this product is that there seemed to be a delay in the output, meaning when I needed to raise my temps (applying heat), the temp read 149 for a couple minutes then shot up 8 degrees suddenly, down 4, up 2, then settled at 150. I understand thermodynamics and basic water workings to a degree (when heat is applied, the water / mash will not heat up uniformly), although this seems to be a bit .... eratic?All the same, it's good for giving you an idea as to where you're at when everything is stable although I don't think that's the point of getting this. I'll need to play with it more, hopefully it's not defective after being in the wort for 60 minutes (their website says the probe is water resistant for short periods of time). My probe was never fully submerged, I merely clipped it to the top of my mash tun so approximately 80% of the probe was in there.
