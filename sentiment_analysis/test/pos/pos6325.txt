It does what it says it will.I have no complaints. Since beginning to use these bags my cheese blocks no longer start growing the green mossy looking stuff that happened before I began using the bags.I used to wrap the remaining blocks of cheese in plastic wrap and then place in a zip lock bag. Would still get the fuzzy stuff and smelly agent with those.Now I just place in the bag, fold the end over and for extra measure I put a rubber bands around it. Works great.
