I can't tell you how much I love these. I work in an environment where plastic forks, spoons, and knives and thrown away every day. My inner tree hugger can't stand this so now I can eat my lunch guilt free. Great for travel, the TSA (hopefully) won't care, and the carrying case is really cool. Have yet to use the bottle opener built into the knife but you know that's only a matter of time.
