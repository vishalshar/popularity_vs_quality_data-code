I purchased this product around the 16th of August. Loved the fact that it was tasteless and could be mixed with anything except for soda. Starting using the day I got it because it came extremely fast and I am currently 4 weeks pregnant. It also help regulate my period and a great way to get your vitamins. The down side for me was that it made my urine smell wonky like not good. But I'm excited that we will be adding number 4 to the family. Good luck and baby dust to those who are trying!!
