The only problem i have is you cannot finish it all the way there is always a small amount of water left inside.Update On review after one week usage, The CLEAN BOTTLE image on the side is slowly coming off. I haven't even put it in the dishwasher yet. Its probably will come off pretty fast if i did put in dishwasher. I only used drinking water.
