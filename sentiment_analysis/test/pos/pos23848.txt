I am having fun with this bike. I am surprised how small it is yet it's powerful enough to take me uphills. I have another regular electric bike and it can't take me up the same grade hills because of its weight. I fold the bike, put it in my car and go to places and take videos on a mounted GoPro camera. Because of its very low center of gravity and height, it's almost impossible to fall from it.The bike is very high quality made in USA. Not a cheap made in china bike.I am very glad that it has a nice large comfortable seat. Larger than a seat of any bike. While the bike is small, the bike designers didn't make the seat a small uncomfortable one. No cutting corners there. Good job.Another impressive feature is the long range of the battery. I went for a long ride and came back to my car when the red led only (meaning low) was lit. Then I kept going for short rides back and forth for kicks on low battery to see how much more juice it had before the battery dies. l got bored before the battery would die! That's another impressive feature.
