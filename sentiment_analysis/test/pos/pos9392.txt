I bought this as an X-mas gift to myself and did A LOT of research before I purchased it. I don't want to say I am disappointed, but the online video reviews lead you to believe that the product is more epic/intense than it REALLY is.My experience with it thus far...I still have yet to figure out the Bluetooth but without the Bluetooth feature, you need 2 AUX cords to your headphones wired into the SubPack Bass Regulator and an Aux cord wired to your device/phone that has the music playing. Not convenient for public use with all the cords dangling and public opinion may think it looks suspicious, but its perfect for home use with gaming and chilling to music while seated.Overall, I am pleasantly surprised and am satisfied when I use it because it still "Brings The Bass" without deafening your ear drums with high volume, but I've felt more extreme bass that rattles my bones.
