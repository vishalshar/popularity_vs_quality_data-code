Super pissed about it breaking. It just came in the mail yesterday and I'm just really happy it didn't break inside of my phone. I wanted something that would last forever since regular iphone cords always break on me.Edit: I wanted this to work so badly so instead of a refund i opted to get another one. I think I made the right choice. First of all pretty great customer service. But more importantly it seems a lot more sturdy. I will try to update in a few months but I see this working for a while. Hopefully it'll work when I get the new iphone 6s because dealing with apple cords is always a disaster. Definitely try it out.
