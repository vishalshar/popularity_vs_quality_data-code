Love this product.  I have a small yard and this perfect for my Maltese.  It is easy to clean.  I just take the grass off and spray it down every other week.  I like the catch tray for the pee, very easy to clean.  As for the smell, I leave it outside and spray the grass frequently so it is not that bad.  I left this indoor then it may become a problem with odor.  Overall, I love this product.
