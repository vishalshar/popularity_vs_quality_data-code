I had very limited shelf space depth.  The reported depth of this player would have just worked.  The reported depth was less than the actual depth of the box and the plug-ins that go into the back of the box added about another inch.  It just did not work for me.  I wish the description would have been clearer.  The return process was perfect and I give lots of credit for that.
