Fits perfectly on the phone and clicks into the bike mount securely. It's a decent everyday case as well. My only criticism is that the plastic edges at the bottom of the case (at the opening for the charger) are a bit sharp, which makes the case a little uncomfortable to hold upright in your hand. It's a minor quibble however. For its intended use, it's really great.
