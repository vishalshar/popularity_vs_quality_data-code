Have a 30lb Shiba Inu mix and this fits her well. Only reason I docked a star is I find myself charging this way more often than the large dog version I have on my White German Shepherd. I get it, smaller size, probably smaller battery, but sometimes I feel like it looses charge in just a few hours. Maybe I got a defective one? If it keeps acting up, will contact seller to replace. Outside of that, it works as adversited.
