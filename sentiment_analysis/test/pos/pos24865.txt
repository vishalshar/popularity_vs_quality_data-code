Great band and case! Highly recommend for anyone who is rough on electronics. The band is a premium leather. Leather is a bit lighter in color than I'd like but is aging well. I wish the case was a bit easier to take apart due to me liking to change bands often. But it's great for bigger wrist and very comfortable.
