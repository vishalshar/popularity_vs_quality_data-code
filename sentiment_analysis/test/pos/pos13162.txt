I used this camera to monitor my cats while on vacation.  I enjoyed being able to talk with them but after dispensing treats I rarely found them in the room.  I had put it on a dresser which caused the treats to rain down making the cats fearful of returning to the room.  I admit that I did not give them much time to adjust to it before going on vacation so I am going to put it closer to the floor and try again.  It is a little pricy for its function and there needs to be control over the number of treats dispensed.  I have other cameras monitoring the house that are not as large and allow me to interact -- the obvious difference is that they don't dispense treats (and were less expensive).  It served my purpose and did an acceptable job.  I would purchase again.  Just a note on the phone app.  Be careful of who has control over taking pictures and posting them for all to see.
