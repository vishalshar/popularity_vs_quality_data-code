Absolutely worth the spend. Like many people I'm regularly sitting at a desk for work and consistently have issues with spilling water or knocking drinks over. The Mighty Mug has been awesome! I originally thought this was a gimmick and probably wouldn't work, but I saw a YouTube video of it being reviewed by Unbox Therapy and decided to try it for myself.
