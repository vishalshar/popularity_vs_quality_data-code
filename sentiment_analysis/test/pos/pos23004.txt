Works great but NOT for every shoe. I have a wide foot and these only work on some of my shoes. If you have more than an inch gap from left and right side eyelets when laced (some of my shoes have 2-2.5 inch gap) these may be a little too snug. I currently have them on my converse and they are working comfortably.
