Works great with our Blaze 5 burner natural gas grill. I take out the flame diffusing grates. Pizza turns out best with a temp of 650 - 700 fahrenheit. Use a thermometer to check.  Crust will burn any higher than that. Pizza takes 3 to 4 minutes and needs to be turned every minute. I've never made better pizza, been making dough for 15 years. The high temp is the difference. Indoors at 550 makes a decent pie but the cheese will be done before the crust. The high heat also helps to clean the grill of grease build up. I dust it out after the grill cools.
