Like Night and Day. Best shoe lacing system I have ever used. My shoes are more comfortable, stable, and easier to get on and off. I have size 12 6E feet with a very high instep. As a chef, I am on my feet most of the day. The ability to change the lace size depending on the place of the eyelets on my shoes to match the contours of my feet makes a huge difference between Hickies and fabric laces.  So far the Hickies system works on sneaker style shoes, heavy duty non-slip work shoes, and shoes that go slightly above the ankle.I have noticed that several folks have complained that the laces were too tight. In order to get the right fit, it is essential to go to the Hickies.com website where they have both videos and pictures of different lacing styles and loose/tight dynamics.  Actually I modified the extra loose instructions to get the laces to work.I have read some negative reviews about the laces snapping. I hope I do not have to revisit the site to downgrade this review. However, I imaging that getting the size right may help eliminate this potential issue.
