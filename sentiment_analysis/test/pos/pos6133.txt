Great phone at a great price. Super Snappy with no lag. Fingerprint scanner is instant. The sound quality speakers give a stereo sound of a phone 3 times its cost. Upgraded to Android 6.0.1. I'm very excited to have this phone and looking forward to trying different operating systems to run this unlocked bootloader. Fast charging 2.0 gives this phone a full battery in no time at all. What more could you need. Nice job Nextbit! The Robin is a quality product at an amazing price.
