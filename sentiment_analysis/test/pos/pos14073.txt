I have been pleased so far with my Blossom.  Few Observations.1. Set-up was quick and easy.  Manual was very good.  I had the whole thing done (removed old system, install/configure Blossom), start to finish, in under an hour.2. I didn't use the powerline network, and the setup was able to detect my WiFi network easily.3. The Android app was sluggish,and had trouble connecting to the Blossom website.  I got a number of connection errors during set up.4. I switched to the iPAD app and I have had much better luck.  I use that app to manage my system.5. I can only water on certain days, and it was easy to adjust the times and duration of watering.6. Very easy to walk around the yard, turn zones on,and adjust sprinklers.
