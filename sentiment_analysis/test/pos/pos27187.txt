I went with 4 stars as I had some issues setting it up. BUT the support I got was CERTAINLY 5 star quality. Very responsive when I pointed out an issue I had found and they updated the software overnight (literally). I have the device working with their current software AND with my Amazon Echo, so it was no easy task setting it all up and making them get along. I got a very helpful email from the company, did step by step and bingo! it all works now. I can now send commands from an Android device OR the Echo and the equipment responds. Seems to work as advertised now. I will admit that I was hesitant after some of the reviews, but the support I have gotten has been EXCELLENT.
