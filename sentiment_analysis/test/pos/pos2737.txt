I don't usually review products but I felt the need to for this wonderful device for a few reasons:To start, there are many complaints in the reviews regarding the metal grate on the bottom that constantly falls off and the difficulty snapping the back cover on after cleaning the inside coils. I bought my unit from the Kitchen Clique and I received what I've now learned is the ***updated version*** (confirmed by Sansaire). The changes include a fixed plastic covering on the bottom which replaces the grate entirely and the back panel is now similar to a battery compartment cover (very easy to take off and put back on).I do not know why they aren't advertising these changes or calling the unit "version 2" (or something like that). I had to contact Sansaire because I thought the grate was actually missing. That is how I found out about the new version.I also wanted to provide a review because I spent a lot of time researching and comparing sous vide equipment and perhaps I can help some people avoid that.My Experience with the ANOVA:-----Like most, I initially bought the Anova because it was cheaper ($129 on sale last month), the reviews are excellent and abundant, and so many online publications recommend and support it. My experiences were awful though.I received the Anova and tested it out many times. On about the fifth attempt, the thermostat would become stuck at a certain temperature while it was heating up but the water would continue to heat; and wouldn't stop until it began boiling. This ruined short ribs that I had going for over 18 hours at this point. I contacted customer service and they immediately sent me a FedEx label to return it for a replacement. About 3 weeks later, I received the replacement and tested it out. After a few cooks, the same exact issue happened. I sent it back for a full refund and decided to try Sansaire.Differences between SANSAIRE and ANOVA----They probably have a lot more in common than not, so I'll focus on the differences that I've noticed so far:Construction: The Sansaire is all plastic and feels a little delicate but it seems fine. You should be careful with any electronic device so I don't see this being an issue. The Anova is sleeker and the exterior is metal and a solid rubber-coated plastic at the top. I prefer the feel and look of the Anova but it's not that important to me.Heating time: I didn't do any timed tests, but the Sansaire seems to heat water almost twice as fast. It's actually shockingly quick compared to what I was used to with the Anova. Unfortunately, the Sansaire does not alert you when the water has reached the target temp (unlike the Anova), but if the water is heating up this quickly, you likely won't be far when it gets there.Noise: This **updated version** of the Sansaire is ridiculously quiet. If it weren't for the LED lights, you wouldn't know it was on unless you put your ear up to it closely. The Anova had a buzz you could hear across the room, though it wasn't annoying or a problem at all for me.Clamp/Clip: The Sansaire has a big hair-clip-esque attachment that can be hooked up in a second very easily. It holds pretty well but it's not even needed that much because the unit stands up on its own. The Anova's clamp can be shifted up or down on the unit to adjust the height and the back of the clamp screw tightly in to the container. I prefer Anova's even though it takes a minute to set up properly, but it doesn't really matter to me in the end. The only time I could see the Sansaire's clamp being an issue is if you're using a really tall container and the unit cannot rest standing up.Connectivity: Sansaire offers no connectivity whereas the Anova has bluetooth and sometimes WIFI support. I don't get why any one would really need this. If you're using bluetooth you're in the same room (or close) to the unit; just walk a few feet and change the temperature; but since you set the temperature when you turn the unit on, why would you need to change it later on? As for WIFI, I can't possibly see me leaving meat out, then remotely starting the unit when I leave the house. Maybe this is important to some.. to me, it's pointless.Conclusion:-----It will still take many more cooks and time to determine if the Sansaire will hold up better than the Anova (which lasted about 4-5 cooks; twice). But so far, I like it better than the Anova and it's working great. The water heats up quickly, stays where it needs to be, and is very accurate (confirmed with three different thermometers). Their customer service answers quickly and they cover the unit for a year so there isn't much worry. I will report back if the unit fails.For some extra help/info, I am using this unit with a 12-quart Rubbermaid food storage container and lid (you can find them on Amazon for about $20). I cut an opening for the Sansaire so the lid can remain on during cooking. I use foam insulation strips to fill the gaps between the lid and the unit (the same ones sold for window air conditions).One last word of advice: when the target temperature is reached with this device, it seems to bounce around 1-2 degrees for about a minute or so. After that it levels out and stays precise; so have a little patience.
