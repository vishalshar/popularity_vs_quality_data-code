Coming from Nexus 5, this phone OS was similar enough to the default android as to be entirely familiar. The phone works great, though there are some issues with audio stuttering while streaming over data using Spotify that I never had using the N5. Running on T-Mobile. Great deal imo. Definitely worth the cost, and I'm tempted to buy a backup just because its simple, works well, and doesn't cost an arm and a leg, or come loaded with bloatware.
