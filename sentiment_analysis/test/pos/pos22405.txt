For a 5 year iPhone user, this phone is a great introduction to Android. Works well, and for those who savor phone design and minimalism, this phone is definitely for you. Haven't had any issues using the device, yet, but I don't expect many. And developers seem motivated to see this project through and as such I am looking forward to the Robin 2, or the Batman.
