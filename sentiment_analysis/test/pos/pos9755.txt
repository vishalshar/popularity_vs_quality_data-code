I got it for a girl in my family to have as she goes to school. It is uber loud and very much attracts attention. I feel better that she has it. I moved the carabiner to the other side to keep it attached to her pack and i attached a littlw pull cord to the pull-tab. That way she just has to yank the cord to trigger it and the robocopp stays attached to her, not in her hand where she might drop it in a panic.  I wish the battery was replaceable, but on the whole i have no complaints. This is a must have for young girls at school.
