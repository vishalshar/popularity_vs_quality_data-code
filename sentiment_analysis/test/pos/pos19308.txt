After using the case for about 2 weeks I wanted to write a review. Im super happy with my pirchase of thin charg, I bought the case to use for pokemon go and it works wonders. Under heavy usage the case will slowly charge your phone but under normal or minimal use it charges very fast. When charging the case it  simultaneously charges the phone and they finish at the same time. It is also very thin and sleek people always comment on it.All I can say is I'd definitely recommend thin charge to my closest friends
