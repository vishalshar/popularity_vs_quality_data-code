LOVED this product. I was having a really hard time beating a nasty case of giardia and coccidia that our pup had come from the breeder with (we are talking months...) A naturopathic vet told me to boost her immune system and she would be able to fight it. I used this and honest kitchen probiotics and we beat it really quickly. The western vet tested her multiple times because she refused to believe we had beat it. She insisted she would have it for the rest of her life- I refused to accept this. I'm glad i did my research and kept at it... Time to switch vets!
