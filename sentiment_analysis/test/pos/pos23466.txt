While I was pregnant, I tried multiple prenatal vitamins.  Large pill type vitamins made me feel sick.  I also tried multiple gummy types including Vitafusion, Alive, and Target generic version.  These prenatal vitamins by SmartyPants were my favorite!  The gummies are soft, sweet, coated in sugar, and delicious! They taste like candy with a more natural fruit flavor than the others I had tried.  When I was pregnant these were the easiest for me to swallow and keep down.  It is true that one serving is six gummies, but that was not a problem for me since I found these tasted so good.Now that I am breastfeeding I still take these.  Even though these gummy vitamins are the most expensive gummy vitamins I have tried, I feel that they are worth it.  It is better to take these candy-like vitamins than to take other vitamins and feel sick.  I would recommend these vitamins to other pregnant or lactating women, especially those who have trouble swallowing traditional prenatal vitamins or don't like the artificial taste of other prenatal gummies on the market.
