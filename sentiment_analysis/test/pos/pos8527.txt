Got this for my 10 year old. Due to his experience in Lego building (real and virtual Lego building) I thought I might unlock his interests in assembling a computer and exploring sensors in the all so consuming popularity of a Minecraft environment. Admittedly I deplore Minecraft as  another time-wasting pursuit but as part of kit that includes assembling the handsome case, and plugging in sensors peeked my interest. He took a couple of days to complete the kit assembly. Believe me I wasn't looking over his shoulder but I did stress more than once to follow the blueprint they provide. He did all the work. What a pleasant surprise. I took the reins only to plug in the power supply which booted up the computer. On the third day he finished all the storyboard levels quickly and I had to plug in an ethernet connection to download the next levels (couldn't get the WIFI connectin to work for some reason). I give it 5 stars for what it set's out to do. Let's hope that the Minecraft angle with I/O capability expands to many exercises and even more sensors in an effort to develop an interest in electronics, manufacturing technology and robotics and also to the prospect of an introduction to programming code (SCRATCH scripting)  leading to an interest in Computer Science. The makings of a great learning platform are all here.
