Fast, powerful,  amazing and light!  Best laptop I've ever owned.  I've been fond of Asus computers since before they were popular.  In fact,  I try and buy an Asus before anything else.  Asus = Quality and affordability.I wanted to wait a few months before reviewing this laptop.  I have only good things to report.Lightweight.  My Asus I previously used was powerful but very heavy.  Not too mention it sounded like a jet engine at times as it kicked out the heat.  And let me tell you, it could get hot.  Not that I'm complaining,  as it was an amazing laptop.  I'm just comparing the incredible progress Asus has made.  This laptop is lighter,  cooler (by a landslide), much more quiet, all while packing more power than my previous laptop.Here are some Pro's....1) Lighter2) Quiet3) Stays very cool4) Very Powerful,  capable of gaming5) Battery Life seems very decent so far,  especially considering how powerful it is6) Backlit Keyboard7) Asus Quality8) The Price is affordable,  especially for what you are gettingI could list more but im in a hurry.  As far as negatives,  I honestly can't think of one.  That's not to say there aren't any things that could be improved but as far as my happiness,  I'm very pleased with this purchase.  I intend to add another internal Hard Drive when I need one but for now I'm fine.  I use several external USB hard drives for pictures, movies and music.My favorite thing : Because of the Solid State Drive, this laptop power on and boots up in a matter of a few seconds.  This isn't just an Asus quality but an SSD quality.  Yes,  I could have bought a laptop with much more Hard drive space but I'll take an SSD with less storage any day of the week.  I hope they are the future of computers (I'm pretty sure that it is) because I can't begin to explain how nice it is to sit down, hit the power button and immediately begin your laptop experience.  My main computer, which I built at home a few years back,  is hooked up to my television.  8 core processor,  16 gbs Memory,  2x's 2tb Hard drive (can expand with 2 more internal slots if I choose) and a very high quality NVIDIA Graphics card has been my pride and joy.  But,  if both my home computer and laptop are turned off,  this laptop is my go to computer because of its immediate boot up.  This powerhouse that I've got in my living room (and all previous computers and laptops I've ever owned)  takes so much longer to boot up.  In the past,  I'd power my computer up and go make a sandwich while it boots up.  Those days are gone!So if you are debating going with a 256gb SSD or a 2tb Hard drive,  I recommend the SSD.  It's a no brainer.  Need lots of space for pictures, movies and music?  Get an external hard drive and plug it into a USB port.Anyhow, good luck!  I spent weeks researching which laptop to buy.  After reading hundreds of reviews,  I pulled the trigger on this one.  I'm so glad I did!  You will be too!
