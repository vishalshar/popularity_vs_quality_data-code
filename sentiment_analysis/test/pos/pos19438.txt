I absolutely love this Massage Track!  I have lower back pain from sitting most of the day in front of my computer.  Nothing beats coming home and using the Massage Track!  However, Ill warn you, if you do not like firm pressure massages, I am guessing you probably wont like this.  When I first got this item I didnt watch the DVD that came with it.  I thought I didnt need to.  But after a day or 2, I decided to watch it and I am glad I did.  Has a lot of good tips on it!  I thought that this system would help with my lower back pain (and it did help loosen it up) but I didnt know that my favorite use would be on my neck.  I love just laying my neck down on the balls and just sitting there for 45-60 sec.  It is the best feeling!  After about a week and a half of using the softer balls daily, I started using a harder ball.  I am still getting used to it as it is a different experience, but my back and neck feel great after using them.  I would highly recommend this system if you love deep tissue massages!
