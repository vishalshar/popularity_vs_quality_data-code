My dog LOVES this kibble and it is good for him!It is highly rated online for containing a good ratio of high quality fats, proteins and carbs that are friendly to a dogs digestive system - it even contains some pro-biotics to help support good gut bacteria.What's best is that I can give it to him as a puppy, right through to adulthood. The price for the 40lb bag is very competitive - what more can I ask?
