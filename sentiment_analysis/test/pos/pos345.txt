For the price, an excellent product, and works with both iOS and Android. Much more thermal resolution than the FLIR One that came out first, which is iOS only and is actually a case you have to mount your iPhone in. This one works with my Android and Otterbox with a simple and cheap USB extension cable. I use it for all my renewable energy work -- Detecting air leaks, water levels, bad connections in electrical panels, bad pumps in solar hot water installations, bad solar panels, bad battery connections.......the list goes on. Also, it's very FUN to play with!
