The FocusShifter works exactly as its described. I can't say that it will replace the need for a traditional follow focus but for the price and with its functionality and easy set up, it does come in handy. It's a nice tool to work with especially with the marker board attached to rack between two or more focal points. Again wouldn't suggest it to replace or substitute for an actual follow focus with whip or an electronic one but if you don't have access to that, this is a simple focusing alternative until you can get your hands on one.
