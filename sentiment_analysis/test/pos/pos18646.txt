This was a gift for my 5-year old daughter.  It was very easy to unpack and assemble.  Although it says for 8-years old and up, my daughter plays with her older brother who is 10.  They both enjoy playing together with this robot.  It is nice that they can share a toy without fighting over it.  The battery stays charged for a long time and also does not take very long to recharge.
