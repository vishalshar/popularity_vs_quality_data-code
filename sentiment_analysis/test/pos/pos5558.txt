These are the best wrappers for cheese!!!  I saw these on America's Test Kitchen/Cook's Country and am so glad that I purchased them.  We love cheese -- all kinds but could never keep it for long without it turning to one lump of mold.  Now our cheeses last longer - especially the hard cheeses like parmesan and pecorino.  This is truly a great product!
