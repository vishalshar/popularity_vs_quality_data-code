I've taken this on a trip, through TSA on an airplane and used my Phantom 4 many times while bringing this back around.  It fits in the overhead just fine and also my Macbook Pro 15", which they claim only a 13" laptop will work, but the MacBooks are small enough that you can pack in a 15" pro.Figuring out how to pack the bag gets getting used to and I'm sure I can improve over time, but there is plenty of room for extra batteries and accessories.Great laptop, good value, big not not too big like many bags.  I recommend.
