We have two Airtame's in our office. They have worked well for our purposes of allowing Windows and OS laptops to connect. There is no substitute on the market right now for a direct HDMI connection. We had some issues with our wireless router in the beginning, as it only had a 2.4-Ghz channel. The quality and stability were greatly improved when we upgraded our wireless from 2.4 to 5-Ghz. Each software update has increased performance and stability. We are happy with the performance and NO cables running everywhere!
