These glasses are great. They are lightweight, but don't feel cheap / plasticky. The hinges are solid and I don't worry about them falling apart.  The lenses are large enough to provide good coverage against glare, but not so big as to look odd on my face.  I love that there is no logo on the sides, only the round dot design.
