I have searched for a quality turntable that comes in a retro case everywhere and wished that there was an audio review for it. I really wanted to hear how it sounded. I have meticulously researched 10 different brands currently being sold and discounted many. I decided to buy one, but after purchasing Crosley CR704C-PA Musician and testing it out, I was highly disappointed and send it back. I decided to purchase this one and found that it is the best on the market in it's price range. The problem with all of them is they have week amplifiers. Crossley sounded alright when I played radio or aux, but sounded pathetic when I played records. Now, I know what a genuine turntable record should sound like. I listen to mine on a Technics 1210 MK5 through powered Yamaha speakers and I did not expect that quality, but what I heard through Crosley sounded as if you're playing records through a "no brand" headphones from back in a day.This player works really well. Cassette and auxiliary work without issues. The sound is much, much better than all the other brands I've listened to (see video). Gets plenty loud enough to listen in other rooms. Now, this one is not without faults. The turntable mechanism is still of Chinese manufacturing and is rather flimsy, but just as flimsy as the rest of them. I had to glue mine to the wood frame it sits in, as it was loose. The needle headshell has a short handle that makes it inconvenient to lift and presents a risk of scratching a record, so I glued a longer one to it. Finally, the needle tends to skip a bit, so I plan to buy a headshell weight and add the weight on top.Currently, it's been in use for about 4 hours over past couple of weeks and has performed up to par.
