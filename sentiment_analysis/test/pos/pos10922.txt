We've been using the Feed and Go pet feeder for the past four months, and it's been great. Our cat was able to break into his old feeder but not this one! It's incredibly sturdy. We love scheduling feeding times from our phones and watching him eat on the webcam. The sound of the tray rotating is a bit louder than we expected, but it helps alert our cat when it's meal time. Our particular router took a little navigating to set up (though I don't think that's typical), however, the Feed and Go customer service is the best I've EVER encountered for any product. They walked us through setting it up and were very polite and patient; we had it going in no time!
