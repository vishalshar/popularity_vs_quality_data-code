Received this yesterday-put the batteries in-put it outside at 7 pm and by 9:30, we had a mouse.  It's fabulous!  Re-loaded it and had another mouse again this am.  I'm in New Mexico and had a mouse "matriarch" who decided my outside gas grill was a great place for a nest.  Took the grill apart-put moth balls in-she kept coming back night after night.  I could not get rid of her and hence her offspring.  Got her the first time with this.  I feel so relieved that I am now in control and getting rid of the mouse clan who obviously thinks my outdoor patios are home.  It seems that once the mice find a home, they just won't leave. Thank you for this great product.  I will keep using it until it's clear.  I'm so happy as I hate critters invading my space.The added bonus is, I'm providing food for the great horned owls and snakes without poisoning anything.  It's a win win.
