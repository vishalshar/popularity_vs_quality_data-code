Great idea, a computer in ball. Imported it from the US, we're in Europe; and relieved to find it comes with a world plug set with its induction charger, a US plug, an Asian plug, a UK plug and an European one. Gave to my 11yo daughter for her birthday, getting it setup reasonably easy; bluetooth pairing like you would a mouse or keyboard, but figuring out which app we would get the most out of more of challenge; right now she using the principle SPRK app to program it.  Fully charged the manual says it will last for an hour, thankfully seemed longer, so a far better buy than those remotely controlled flying toys that run out in 10 minutes; only manage to run out power once in the dozen or so sessions she has used it so far, re-charging a full three hours. Using it with an iPad Air running IOS 9.x; works well; Got to confess I am a IOS coder @ heart, perhaps not quite your average user, going to look into the development side too. Tried a few of the sample code apps, obviously not an area that has had at of attention for a while, some IOS 6.x in there [we're on IOS 9.x as I write this]; but it will be an interesting challenge for me too.
