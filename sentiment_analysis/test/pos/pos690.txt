Had the 4/4S model until I updated my phone to the 5S. This one is obviously much slimmer (mostly due to the phone being slimmer) but also does a better job of sealing the backside of the phone from any road grime you're likely to pick up while cycling. The two pieces now snap together and don't need to be held together with the lanyard, which is great if you only plan on using this case for when you ride like I do (it's a bit bulky for everyday carry). Comes with a rubber bumper that is removable, I've found that it's more difficult to operate the phones buttons with it on. Rokform makes nice product right here in the USA so it's a win/win.
