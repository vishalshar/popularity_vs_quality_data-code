The camera was super easy to install, and I like the way they've designed the back so its easy to hide the power cord. The mobile app was easy to get started, and I love being able to check in on my pup Cooper. Cons: Sometimes I get really bad video connection, and I'm not sure if it's a wifi issue or not. I also don't like that (the app) logs me out after a couple minutes. Sometimes I like to leave it on when I'm at work so I can keep an eye on my dog. Also, the treat dispensing mechanism is cool, and works with the cheap treats I like to buy for Coop, but it's really loud. The loud clicking sound of the mechanism and then the clank of the hard treats hitting the launching mechanism frightens my dog. Cons: you have to give people your password in order for them to check out your dog. (My mom loves my dog and she can't get her own app login. It also prevents more than 1 person checking on the pet.) Otherwise, I love it! Note: there's a few seconds of delay with the video.
