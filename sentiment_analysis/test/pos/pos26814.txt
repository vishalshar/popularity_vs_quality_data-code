I love this product! It allows me, 35 y/o female with bladder weakness to get up at night and use the restroom without turning the lights on. Before I purchased this product, everytime I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom, which is right off our bedroom, I would turn the light on and wake up my husband. Now I dont have to turn the light on and he gets to sleep through the night. The motion sensor on this product is great! As soon as I enter the bathroom door, the light in the bowl comes on!
