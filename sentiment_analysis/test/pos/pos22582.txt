I am finally reviewing the Fugoo after using it for months (since it was released). I was deciding between the Bose soundlink and the Fugoo. I ended up purchasing the Fugoo, because Fugoo uses the aptXŽ codec paired with Bluetooth 4.0 which provides better sound quality over Bluetooth. I own several Bose products, but have been dissatisfied in the past with the sound quality over Bluetooth. The aptXŽ codec really is a game changer for processing sound.I was unsatisfied with the max volume level and almost wanted to turn this in for another speaker, but today I checked the Fugoo website to see if there was a Firmware update, and there was! They specifically note this will increase the loudness. I ran a decibel check prior (using the same song) and before the upgrade, and the max decibel was 84. After the upgrade the max was 87, and it sounds great! There was no distortion! You can get the software and the upgrade package here: http://www.fugoo.com/downloads/I have put this speaker underwater, in the shower, spilled drinks on it, and in the cooler. It functions properly in all conditions. I'm super happy that they are providing support for this, unlike some competitors.Checkout tech spec's here: http://www.fugoo.com/technology/
