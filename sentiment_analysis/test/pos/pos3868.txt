I love helping startups with their projects on Kickstarter and Indiegogo, and I explore Amazons Launchpad for cool products all the time. Im no stranger to being the first to try new products on the market, and these days Smart connected products are starting to pop up everywhere.My first Smart product was the Quirky + GE Aros Smart Window Air Conditioner (which is brilliant in air-flow design and wireless capabilities); I bought a Nomiku Sous Vide Immersion Circulator (and now similar devices are popping up everywhere). Recently, I bought the Brita Infinity Smart Water Pitcher (dont judge, read my review first), so expect to see more and more products becoming Smart.This Bluesmart carry-on suitcase is the first Smart suitcase of its kind. It will be reviewed in two ways: as a piece of luggage (compared to my two other regular carry-ons), and on the Smart components. BEFORE USING You need to do two things before using this:1) Charge the suitcase battery with the provided blue micro-USB cable and adapter(If the LED charging light on top doesnt turn on, flip the ON switch in the suitcase. Unzip the innermost layer and the switch should be near the handle top). Charging takes 5-6 hours; top light turns blue at 100% charge.2) Download the Bluesmart app, and register your suitcase.While its charging you can read the provided instruction booklet, or go to Bluesmarts website to their support section to read up on how to use it. CARRY-ON Firstly, this is a carry-on bag, meant to go with you on the plane, to be stored above your seat. This is not a large bag for check-in. Second, carry-on bags are designed for 2-3 days worth of travel. However, on my trip to Hawaii I was able to pack the following: 6 t-shirts 6 pairs of underwear 4 shorts 3 pairs of socks 1 pair of shoes 1 pair of flip flops 1 MacBook Pro 13" 1 Kindle Paperwhite 1 iPad mini 1 Nintendo 3DS XL 2 paperback-sized booksTheoretically, you could pack up to a week of stuff, depending on what you have and where you go. Obviously, my trip to Hawaii consisted of shirts and shorts [see photos]. But to set your expectations, you can pack for 2-3 days comfortably. SIZE The physical dimensions are: 22 in/ 55.88 cm tall, 14 in/ 35.56 cm wide, 9 in/22.86 cm thick, and weighs 9.4 lbs/ 4.26 Kgs on its own. Compared to my two other carry-on bags, this bag is slightly bigger, and heavier. I haven't had carry-on size issues with these size specs. DESIGN I see this suitcase geared more towards business professionals and tech-savvy travelers. It comes in a cardboard package, in a large nylon bag. No money is wasted on unnecessary fancy packaging, and I appreciate that. I personally think this design is very masculine. The front lines on the fabric remind me of a mans torso, and the back design elements reminds me of... the top view of a plane.The main body is made of a three-layer polycarbonate providing a strong lightweight shell. The front opening is made of fabric that is held closed with a magnet, and a digital lock. The fabric inside needs to be strong and still lightweight, and that's what you get. The fabric pattern is blue and gray which fits with Bluesmarts color scheme [see photos].The blue wheels look cool and roll really smoothly. Ive been used to two wheels on my carry-ons so itll take some getting used to having four wheels. The extending handle was well thought out. It locks right before the charging ports; in case you should accidentally slam the handle down, it wont hit or break your connected cables. Very smart. STORAGE SPACE The front unlatches to three pockets, the biggest one towards the back holds up to a 15 MacBook Pro on its own (without a sleeve), or you can fit a 13 Macbook Pro (with a sleeve), There are two additional pockets in front of that for magazines or flat objects (which can help cushion your laptop further).The suitcase unzips and opens to a front and main section. The front is connected to the front I just described, and on the inside, there is a zippered mesh storage section. The main section has a zippered mesh on top, which opens up to the main compartment. There is enough room for a 2-3 day weekend trip. BLUESMART APP  In terms of UI/UX of the Bluesmart app, I do have some words for improvement here. You can search for your flights and input/search the information manually, great. There are four main circular buttons in the app: Locked/Unlocked, Battery, Weight, and Location. The Lock button has some odd circle on top of the main circle, I dont really know what thats supposed to mean. The Battery button inclusion is odd, it looks like a buttonbut you cant press it; its there only to tell you if its charging or 100% charged.Their main menu is on the top right when it really should be on the top leftlike everyone else, for a consistent app experience. They should change the Battery button to some status section, and the Settings should include options that their website support section talks about. It all feels very 1.0 (its 1.3). A UI/UX designer should be hired to update and redesign this app.*** UPDATE ***They have since updated the app, and it looks nicer and menus are much more intuitive [see photos]. BATTERY DOCK The built-in battery has 10,400 mAh of power. The battery is used to charge your devices *and* to power the Smart features. This is the reason why your battery drains faster than an independent batteryso that it can use some of that power to power other things. For reference, an iPhone 6S has 1715 mAh (can be recharged 6X), and the iPad mini 4 has 5,124 mAh (can be recharged 2X).There are two USB connectors: one below the extending handle, and one on the inside front pocket. You will need to have your own cables, of course. It can charge for a total of 5V/2.1A, so you can charge two devices slowly, or one device fast. According to their website, Bluesmart uses a 37 Watt-hour lithium ion battery (10,400 mAh and 3.7V), which is well within the FAA regulations on batteries, should you be asked by the TSA. GPS Location tracking uses 3G+GPS technology to locate the bag, and it spotted my bag within its blue circle in the app. The issue here is, should you be separated from your bag, like miles away, it only tells you the last known locationwhen you last checked. Their product description says you can track your suitcase's location at all times, what I presume is like Find My iPhone (as long as the battery isnt dead), but I havent been able to use or find the feature for this on the app, so Im confused by what it can actually do. Also, being a carry-on that stays near you, I dont see much need for a location finding feature, but its neat to have. Hopefully, the necessary hardware is already built in and the app just needs an update. WIRELESS LOCKING This bag has a digital lock. It provides options for automatically locking your suitcase if you step more than 10-ish feet away from it, and will unlock when youre right next to it. You have the option to turn automatic lock/unlocking off; these options are available in the Settings section of the app. If you do lock it remotely, you wont be able to just press the physical button on the suitcase to unlock it, it will have to be unlocked from the phone. This can be slightly inconvenient should your suitcase battery die; you would have to use a physical key to open it (the pain of manual labor I tell you. #generationYproblems), or charge your battery to unlock it again.Two sets of physical (TSA-approved) keys for the bag are provided, and are located in the exterior front opening in one of the pockets.A future feature I would like is to be able to lock/unlock it remotely, at any distance (like 10 miles away) if you happen to lose your bag. SELF-WEIGHING This feature is cool, but unnecessary. I weighed the bag on its own to see how much it weighed and it fluctuated between 2-3 lbs of what it's supposed to be. The weight of a carry-on isnt really an issue since most airlines dont have restrictions on carry-on weight. If you were to check this bag in, it would be a challenge to go over any weight limits since its a carry-on sized bag. This feature is more cool than functionally needed. THE TSA Because this is the first product of its kind, you should expect some possible altercations at the airport until the TSA is completely aware and informed of this type of product. *Please* carry around the instruction booklet and have your app ready to show, just in case. If they open the bag and see the battery wires (it does look scary), it will not look good for you, so its best you keep all this documentation ready for them to reference. And obviously, as with a cop, dont argue with them and let them do their job. If they ask to see inside, kindly let them know that there is a TSA-approved lock, and that they have the master key to open it, or lend them your copy.I personally suggest that Bluesmart create a global marketing campaign to inform airlines of this new type of product category, and to make sure consumers know what could potentially happen, but in the end, this suitcase has TSA-approved features. CONCLUSION As a suitcase, Bluesmart gets five stars; for the Smart features and price, I give it three stars, for an average of four stars.For my needs this carry-on suitcase fits the 2-3 days of clothes I pack  (and more) when going away; the addition of the battery is very helpful during this modern age when everyone wants an outlet at the airport; the Smart features are okay in this first iteration; and the design and functionality of the bag will make you stand out at the airport. I cant wait to see what new things Bluesmart will think of for their future models.
