Imagine placing your index finger on your lips and... mute! Wow, if only my kids were as disciplined as the devices controlled by SingleCue.For several minutes I kept muting and unmuting, then calling different family members and showing them the magic of muting by gesturing.All in all the concept of controlling my consumer electronics with hand gestures is appealing.For the most part I was able to get things done.The major point for improvement is doubling down on the magic of single gesture per action, like muting.browsing menus for controlling, like it is done today is only second best.On a different note, all in all the setup process was pretty straight forward. Minor improvements could have made it better, yet now when all is said and done... who cares.Good V1 with promising future.I know that the device's software can be updated, and I can't wait to get the next version of software.
