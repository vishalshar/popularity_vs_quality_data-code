I have used and used and used my Oru kayak to death.  Love it love it love it.  Caught more big fish off it and gone more places than just about anyone I know.  It takes a bit of use to break the plastic in so it folds easy.  Then it sets up in like 2 minutes.  So easy to use and so tough.  I've kayaked down the nantahala in NC on whitewater with it in march and flipped it going over Upper Wesser Falls.  I've scrapped it on shallow creeks and it is one tough boat.
