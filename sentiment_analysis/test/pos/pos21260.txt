I used it to start a campfire during a wet weekend.  The stuff does light right up.  It's amazing. Bit stays lit for just a few minutes.  I think I read 15 but I could be wrong. 3-4 minutes would be pushing it.  I think I also read that you get 3-4 uses per pack.  I needed a full pack to get it going.  May be different if everything was dry.  I would amd will buy more
