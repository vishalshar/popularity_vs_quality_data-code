I purchased this and a pink one for my daughter inlaw who just had a picc placed. We thought a medium would be the correct size but its quit big.  Hopefully the mistake can be corrected. The size chart needs a fixing. She measured her arm over the picc placement and her biecp is 12" the black one is bigger then the pink one. They were pre washed per trying on like recommend since she's prone to infections.
