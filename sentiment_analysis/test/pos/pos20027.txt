Purchased Immunity for my 5yr old GSP who after completing two courses of Prednisone and undergoing tumor excision surgery that left him with a foot long incision in his side developed a horrible case of canine oral papilloma virus (dog warts).  After the first week of (double dose) we noticed that his warts had stopped growing and new ones had not appeared.  After the second week the warts started shrinking!!!  I highly recommend this product for anyone whose dog has had a spontaneous case of warts after steroid treatment.  It really does work.  I definitely plan to reorder this product again.
