Great tool for learning how to hold the bottle and later a sippy cup.  I just bought this for my 5 month old daughter and used it today for the first time.  She took right to it and was able to hold her bottle, no problems.  We haven't used it as a teether yet, but the soft pliable leaves I'm sure will be great for that as well.  I have the Avent Natural bottles and the TipMeNot when on pretty easily and came off easily as well.
