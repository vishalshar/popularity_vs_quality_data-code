These are fantastic. I can't even begin to explain how amazing this headset is. I am very strict when it comes to sound. I personally hated the Astro A50s because to me they sounded horrible. The only thing it had going for it was that it was wireless and they were comfortable. These however are  $100 cheaper than astros. And personally they sound a lot better. The bass is rich and the 7.1 surround sound is surreal. I've used this on my PC and Ps4 and they work flawlessly. I own a ps4 pro and just so you know, you must use the back usb in the back of the console. The usb ports in the front do not register the LS40s. So if you use a LAN cable the optical chord will be in the way of it. Be sure to follow ALL of the directions provided in the small pamphlet provided in the box. It shows you exactly how you should set up the headphones to whatever device you are using for optimal sound. For those who complained about the bass, you must have not followed the directions. Let me not forget about the build quality...ive never felt such a premium headset. Its metal. Not plastic. These will not be breaking anytime soon like most plastic headsets. These were well worth the $200 and I will be using these for a long while.
