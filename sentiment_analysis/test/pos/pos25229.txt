This is a great fit for our Berner.  Fits great with his large chest, he is 100 lb and we have a size Large- and I think it will fit as he finishes filling out (13mo now).  It's easier on our body to maneuver him, but if he really wants to go somewhere it doesnt help as well in stopping him- need more of the choke collar for that.
