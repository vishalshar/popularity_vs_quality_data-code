As a longtime tea drinker, I have tried most store brands, but have always preferred the fresh blends from tea houses.  I purchased the Rosali Tea "Herbal Collection" sampler because I tend to get bored of flavors quickly and loved the idea of trying several different blends.  I was not disappointed.  Not only are the teas unique (flavors I had not tried before), but they tasted fresh and potent.  A little bit goes a long way.  The packaging is so beautiful that I almost felt funny 'self-gifting'.
