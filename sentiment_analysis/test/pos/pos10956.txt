I've had my Spire for a week and love it. It's almost eerie how well it is able to sense my mood. The reminders to let you know that you're tense are great, as it give you an opportunity to acknowledge the situation and try to relieve some of the tension. It's come in handy a couple of times at work already.The activity tracking/step counting feature is great as well. Seems to be more accurate than the built-in activity tracker from the iPhone.The design of both the device and charging station are really high end. They both feel more organic (remind me of stone/wood) than any other electronics I've seen. The device also clips discreetly onto your belt loop, so you don't have to be wearing some goofy bracelet around all day.Battery life is good. I've had mine on without charging for 5 days now and it still has a bit of juice.Overall, great product.
