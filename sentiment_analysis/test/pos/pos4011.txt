I misread the description when I purchased this set and I was thinking that the fork and spoon could be joined like the Gobites Duo.  This is not the case.  I still like the set and will use it when I'm on the road during my summer truck driving job.  I like to pack my own food and for this I don't really need the long reach of the Duo set.  I have since bought a Duo set for camping and backpacking , so I have the best of both worlds now.
