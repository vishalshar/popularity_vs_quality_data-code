To start out, I had a bit of trouble getting the filament to stick to the bed and it kept stringing quite a bit. With a bit of tweaking I've found that this PLA actually requires a higher extrusion temperature printer than the filament brand that I had  been using before trying this AIO Robotics filament. I'm still figuring out the sweet spot for it, but 220 degrees or so seems to be a good starting point for it. (200 and 210 were both too low to yield the kind of quality I was looking for in my prints.) I've continuously been getting very good first layers and nice, shiny finishes since making that adjustment.On receiving the filament, I would make sure to check that the bags holding the filament have not become damaged. I can't say if the bag was damaged in transit or not, but when I opened it to get the spool out, there was a hole in the clear side of the packaging about the size of my finger. As this was the first spool from AIO Robotics that I've used, I can't say if it has impacted the quality of the filament or not and if it might have contributed to the above difficulties.I've seen notes of certain spools not fitting the included spool holders for the Monoprice Maker Select (mostly the 1kg spools being the culprits) but AIO Robotics half kilogram spools fit perfectly well.
