My 11 year old son plays aau basketball. Some days he is in his basketball shoes almost all day playing anywhere between 3 and 6 tournaments..this results in very very very smelly feet and shoes. We tried sprays, creams, powders..you name it. Most things just mask the odor and not get rid of it completely. He has an expensive shoe habit and I cannot afford to keep buying new basketball shoes due to odor. These remodeez did the trick for us. We rotate between two pairs of sneakers while one pair are on his feet the other pair are sitting in a box with remodeez in them. By the time he's ready to put that pair back on the remodeez have done their job and they have no odor.
