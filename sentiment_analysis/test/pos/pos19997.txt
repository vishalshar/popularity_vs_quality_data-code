This camera is great for someone that wants a camera that is super easy to set up and very simple to use, but is not concerned about having a bunch of extra features.The set up process for the camera is very easy. See my video for step-by-step set up instructions. Basically, you just download the app and it walks you through the process.Once you have the camera online via the company's app, you are able to view and control the camera from the app only. The company does not offer any software for PC, nor does it offer a way to access the camera from the web. For that reason, I had to remove one star from my review. A lot of people would probably be satisfied with using this camera simply for monitoring via a smartphone or tablet. If that's what you are looking for, this camera does that perfectly. If you are looking for something that offers more functionality, such as a PC application, or the ability to support OnVIF or any other way to view the video stream from the camera, you might want to look elsewhere.Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
