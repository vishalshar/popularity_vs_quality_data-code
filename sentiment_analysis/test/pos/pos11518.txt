I really like these undershirts. They are a bit on the pricey side, but seem to be worth it. I have some chest tattoos that are are hard to hide unless I wear a t shirt under my dress shirts. Problem is that makes me very uncomfortable for the day, especially when it's warmer out. I've noticed when I wear these shirts you can't see my tattoos, they are invisible due to the skin tone matching and they keep you nice and coo. I will be ordering more in the future. Good job Sloane.
