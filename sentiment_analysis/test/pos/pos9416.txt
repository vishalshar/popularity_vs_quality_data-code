I'm new to sous vide cooking, but have a few comments.  So far I've tried a chuck roast, a white fish, and some eggs.  The best were the eggs - fudge-like yolks and barely set whites!  WOW!The chuck roast was done at 149F for 16 hours.  It was more tender than the normal chuck roast, but near the end of the cooking time, the juices all came out into the bag.  I used a Ziploc bag, and next time will try an actual vacuum bag to see if that works better.The fish was done at 122F for 40 minutes.  It made me a little nervous since I don't know if that's high enough to kill the germs, etc., so I don't know if this recipe is safe.  (I used recipes from their web site.)The thing I'm having some trouble getting used to is the Luke-warm temperature of the finished food.  Other cooking methods produce hot food; this method produces a very nice texture, but the food is barely warm.Anyway, the unit works exactly as advertised and keeps an amazingly accurate temperature.  I gave it a 4 rather than a 5 because of the packaging.  The unit sits on a base and the box fits over that base, making it really easy to pick up the box and have the whole thing fall out onto the floor if you forget it's on a base.  This is not good for electronics.  It should have been packaged in a box that safely contained the until and wouldn't accidentally come apart when you pick it up.  I'm now on the look-out for a different box to use to store it, which is an irritating thing to have to do.
