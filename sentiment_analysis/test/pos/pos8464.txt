Easily my most favorite phone case in the history of all my phone cases! Feels great and holds up well. I have dropped the phone a couple times while this case was on, and got not a single scratch.I DID experience the corner of the felt coming up after about 8-9 months of use, but a little super glue did the trick. Then a month or so later another corner started coming up so I just bought a new case. Totally worth it.
