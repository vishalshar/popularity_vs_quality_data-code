I've had this for almost 2 years now and it's been with me through two major moves. I've learned a lot about hydroponics so the education piece definitely worked :)My first betta died after two months, but I later realized that he was never healthy from the store to begin with. My second guy, Casper, has been a healthy and happy little guy in this tank since. He did have a bout of fin rot early but was treated early. He gets excited whenever people walk near his tank and it's fun to watch.The Pro:- No water changes! I haven't changed the water and the water stays relatively clear. I have a test kit for water quality and it always tested fine after the tank cycled. This has been awesome since I can set up an automatic feeder when I'm away and not worry about Casper.- Wheatgrass grows like crazy. Recently started growing green onions and they took off.- What's not to love about a happy betta?The Mehs:- Water pump cracked after a year or so and had to be replaced. Not sure if this is the typical lifespan of the pump.- The white plastic tray wraps a bit after awhile. Doesn't affect its function though.- Condensation eventually collects at the bottom of the tray and the water that comes back to the tank follows the condensation and drips down. The result is the tank sounding like a leaky faucet. Not sure if there's anything they can do to the design to prevent this. I definitely can't put the tank near where I work or it'd annoy the beep out of me.The Cons:- Didn't come with a heater - realized I needed one through my own research.- Growing wheatgrass started off cool but don't do it unless you are willing to keep up with the maintenance. The seeds mold easily and you're going to get lots of fruit flies. The wheatgrass seeds also fall through the cracks easily and into the tank. Cleaning the tank is a pain - the system really isn't designed for easy cleaning. I switched to green onions - low maintenance and grow pretty fast too!- I've had no luck growing anything else from seeds, even with a grow light. The basil sprouted a little and died after a couple weeks. Oh well.Overall, I'm really glad I got this. Learned a lot about hydroponics and have an awesome betta to boost.
