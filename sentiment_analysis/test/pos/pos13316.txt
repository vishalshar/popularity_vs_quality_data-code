This is my absolute favorite watch! Have gotten so many compliments on it, and have worn it for a week and a half straight. Worn it swimming - no problem, worn it hiking - no problem, worn it running - no problem. The band is like silk and will fit many, many wrist sizes. The all-white face is very slick and can be dressed up for work very easily.Worth every penny.
