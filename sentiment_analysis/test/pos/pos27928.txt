Very happy with this product. Performs as advertised. This adaptor solves the one Ubc only lnput on the MacBook. This adaptor doesn't have a Ubc input but they do make one at twice the price if you feel the need to charge while using the adaptor. I didn't feel that would be necessary of your MacBook is charged before using it.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I felt this adaptor shouldn't cost twice as much to get it with the Usbc port replacing 1 of the 3 USB ports. How often would one use 3 USB ports at a time?
