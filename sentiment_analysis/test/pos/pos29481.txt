I was skeptical when I 1st came across Grip Boost, but I figured it was worth trying out for $11 (as compared to buying a new pair of receiver gloves for $40-50). I was pleasantly surprised though. Grip Boost got me through another flag football season without having to run back out to the store for new gloves.
