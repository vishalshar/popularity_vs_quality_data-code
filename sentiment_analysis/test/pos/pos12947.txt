I originally bought the UE Boom for work. As much as I was impressed by its volume, I was doubly disappointed by its battery life. At full volume the UE Boom might play for 3 hours, and at half volume it was practically inaudible where I work.I just purchased the fugoo and although it's not quite as loud as the boom, the battery delivers! I worked a twelve hour shift and the fugoo lasted through all but one of those hours at full volume.  I am not only impressed but thoroughly pleased with the performance of this speaker!
