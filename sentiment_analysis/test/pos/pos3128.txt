These are fantastic. I use them on canning jars, however they fit many of those old store bought pasta sauce jars that I have saved for some unknown, future use. Now I will be saving all the jars that come across my path that these lids will fit on, and my husband is super excited about it. I have two of these caps but will be ordering the four-pack, two just doesn't seem like it's doing the trick and I find myself wanting more.
