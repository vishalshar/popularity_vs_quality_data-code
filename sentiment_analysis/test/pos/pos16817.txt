This mouse is great. With normal mice, my hand would become cold and sore over long periods of use. With this mouse your entire hand sits comfortably on it. This helps to radiate your own heat back to your fingers to keep them comfortable and not sore. (Your hand stays at a comfortable temp, not too cold not too hot)It will feel different at first due to how wide the mose is, but you quickly get used to it and won't want to use any other mouse. The ergonomics are perfect.
