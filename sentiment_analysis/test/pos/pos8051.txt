I have used this for flag football for a couple of months now. It does make gloves a lot stickier, though the effect wears off somewhat fast (over the course of a came it will go from being really sticky to above-average stickiness). That ends up not being a big problem because a single bottle lasts a surprising amount of time -- I usually apply some before each game (about 1x week) and I still have more than half the bottle left. Given the low price, and how stickier the gloves get, I'm happy with my purchase.
