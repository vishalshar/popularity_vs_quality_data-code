The 3Doodler has a nice, slim design and is easy to hold.The plastic has a hard time sticking to anything but matte paper.The pen needs time to cool down every now and again, and it will stop if it determines it is getting too hot.It is very easy to draw in air..I recommend using a lot of patience, otherwise your design won't come out the way you envision.Rounder shapes are more difficult than straight line shapes.There is a distinct plastic smell, but it isn't too strong, and  I forgot about it quickly.Below is an image of my first attempt!This is a fantastically fun Item, and I.m sure that my projects will improve with practice.One negative I have found, though, is that it is difficult to figure out which plastic to purchase when your initial inventory is used up.From looking through reviews of the various plastic filaments available, I notice that many of them are not suitable for the 3Doodler.I found out that the filament diameter for the 3Doodler should be 3mm, most of the offerings seem to be 1.75mm, which are not suitable.Some of those sites claim that they are compatible with this pen, but customers are finding that they are not.Many of the offerings do not give any specifications, including the diameter of their products.I ended up ordering the actual 3Doodler filaments, which I have not yet received, and I hope they will work, but it was a lot more difficult to figure out just what to buy.I love this pen, though, it is great,
