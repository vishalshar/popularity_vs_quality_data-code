Just received my Solo, right on time! Easy to set up and it sounds AMAZING. Hard to believe the quality and volume of the sound that comes from such a small box. I've tried listening to jazz, bluegrass, pop, classical, rock and country FM and web stations as well as Spotify, and sometimes it's hard to believe that the musicians aren't right there in the room.Like the look a lot too-- the walnut cabinet is simple and elegant, and the front panel shows either a simple "analog" clock (OK, it's a digital image of an analog clock) or logo, or the station and/or song you're listening to (very useful). Knobs and preset buttons have a quality, solid feel and are very simple to use.
