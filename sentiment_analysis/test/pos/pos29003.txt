Really-I didn't think it made a difference, but the reviews were so glowing  I had to try. OMG it's positively organic.It's Ergonomic! It's Efficient!  It's Gorgeous.  It fits in the hand as comfortably as an old baseball glove.Almost too beautiful to use, I wish everything was designed with such thoughtful attention to comfort, utility and design.  Glad I took the plunge.  The OXO is going back. It's prehistoric in comparison!
