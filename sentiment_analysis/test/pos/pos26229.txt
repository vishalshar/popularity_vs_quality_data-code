I used this product for a month prior to writing the review. I tracked my skin 'firmness' and cannot attest that it does much in the way of 'firming'-although I do think it may have a placebo effect...I do feel my neck skin looks tighter, but I didn't start out with much to begin with (Its all about starting young and being proactive!)The ingredients listed are well worth the purchase. I go do a skin care doctor, and she always tells me how important vitamin C is for the skin --to be applied topically because the face has small blood vessels that don't carry Vitamins to the face as well as the rest of the body.  She also recommends Hyaluronic Acid for moisturizing (dry skin ages you), Gylcolic acid exfoliates dead skin cells keeping your skin looking fresh and pores looking refined. JoJoba Oil is an essential oil that also moisturizes and softens and is said to fight wrinkles. I was purchasing Vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid separately--which was more expensive than this bottle that combines other natural ingredients that my skin care doc recommends. SO--if it doesn't perform the miracle of giving Father Time the finger, it still has a great combination of ingredients that are proven to improve skin. I highly recommend
