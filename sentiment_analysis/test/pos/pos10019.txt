I have always used the plastic collar stays that came with my shirts and was wondering if putting forth the money to get something that will last was worth it. The answer is yes, it's totally worth it. I always make sure to take them out as soon as I take off my shirt so I don't accidentally lose them in the laundry, and for the price I paid I don't plan on losing them, and now I can throw away all the plastic ones I have been collecting over the years.
