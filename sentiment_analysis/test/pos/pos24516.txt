Overall I am happy with this bag, however, disappointed that my runners do not fit in the shoe compartment (US size 10). Although this bag fits a large amount it can get heavy on your shoulder by the time you fill it. Not a fault of the bag but something to consider when making a decision to purchase e.g. If most of your commuting is by car and walking short distances perfect. I bought this bag for going to the gym not specifically yoga and it fits everything I need.
