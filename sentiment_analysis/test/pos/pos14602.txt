Great suitcase for a business traveler. The charging ports are great when in the airport or on the road and you need to charge your phone or laptop. The suitcase is surprisingly light and has a number of pockets / dividers to allow for efficient packing (great for suits or dress shirts). It also very easily fits into the overhead compartments of both larger and smaller aircrafts.The app is very slick too. I found the location tracking to be particularly helpful in the cases when I was forced to check baggage (rather than carry-on) and then was able to see where my bag was in baggage claim.Lots of bells and whistles for a modest price. Highly recommend for anyone who wants a smoother travel experience.
