What can I say?!  This mug truly boggled my mind.  I was skeptic at first, but witnessing first hand how it resisted my attempts to knock it down, even on purpose, it withheld its stance.  It even stood against my attempt to punch it down!  And yet, I was able to very easily pick it back up like it was a normal regular cup!  I am both amazed and impressed by the Mighty Mug.  It may be no punching bag, but it could definitely substitute for one on the go if you ever need to let out some steam, with its might to stand tall.
