My cat has been on Solid Gold (Katznflocken) her whole life and has always been a good weight with really soft, shiny fur. Then my grandma's cat moved in with us and they both actively tried to become fatties so I made the switch. My only complaint so far is that their breath leaves a lot to be desired and they are *both* super licky cats.Small price to pay for cats that aren't overweight though!
