Received it in the evening, in Toronto, Canada. Charged it and played a little in the evening.First impressions:- Very nice packing- Beautiful hardware, feels premium- Touch sensitivity is nice- Sound quality looks good- Ambient light mode does a great job. It shows important information all the time in black and white only.- You can also make the watch to only wake up when you raise your wrist instead of staying on all the time. Just disable ambient mode and turn on tilt to awake.- Set up was easy, no issues- Receiving notifications and replied messages too, both with quick reply and voice dictation.- Global mobvoi store is shallow at the moment, not more than basic apps and watch faces- Will download Chinese version. People seem to be happy about it.- The silicon strap that came additional with the watch is very comfortable. I am using that in place of leather in oak model.I will test battery, readability in sunlight, voice calls, navigation notifications, Google reminders, and voice assistant tomorrow.
