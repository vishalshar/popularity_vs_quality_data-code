The case fits my phone great.  Love the magnet for the car,  don't have to worry about your phone sliding all over the car.  Case sticks to the refrigerator which is awesome if your looking at a receipe or listening to music while cooking.  I have the clear case which got a scuff mark pretty quick, but no damage to the phone.
