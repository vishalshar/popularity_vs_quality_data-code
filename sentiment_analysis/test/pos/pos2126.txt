I just got my eTape16, so far so good. For what I can see, this tape measure  is not the type you will through in your toolbox without looking where the tape will go, and  I will not do that.  But how can you do  that? For sure the display will crack, scratch, break, who knows. It looks kind of fragile. I am not sure how long the electro-mechanical system will last, time will tell.  Of course, the tape is very easy to use, no question about that, very accurate. This is no the tape you will take to work in your roof nor in a dusty, oily, dirty environment.  In  my opinion this tape is for a delicate jobs where precision is required. It will not go to my garage toolbox, I will keep it in my computer desk. Will report more later...UPDATE:  An owner of the etape posted a picture saying his/her is not printed in inches and centimeters, mine is printed beautifully in both.
