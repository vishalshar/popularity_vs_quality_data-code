We switched from Tide pods to this and I was worried it wouldn't clean our clothes as well. I wanted something chemical free but that still does it's job. Both my husband and I work out often and our clothes get pretty smelly but this detergent does a great job of cleaning all of our clothes. It does leave a smell on your clothes afterwards but it's not too strong and it's pleasant. In regards to reviews about the pods not opening, I have never had a problem with this whether the wash is with cold or hot water. Also despite our clothes getting pretty dirty we have never had to use more then one pod in a wash to get them clean.
