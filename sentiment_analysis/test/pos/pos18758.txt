Ok - I 'get' the critics.  I have an older Tagg plus a new Whistle tracker.  The Tagg worked GREAT until the merger around October & November in 2015.  Then the alerts went from minutes to almost hours in some cases.  It was unreliable - and when it comes to our beloved pets this isn't acceptable.  But then in December things got better, back to normal.  Both the original Tagg and the new Whistle work great again.We originally bought the Tagg for our Border Collie because of her super-high energy, we were worried she would get over our fence and wanted to be alerted on our cell phones.  It works great for this - once our pup is about 300' away from the base station we get a push alert plus an SMS text message to our phones.  This takes a few minutes for the Tagg / Whistle to come out of sleep mode and realize it's not inside the geo-fence anymore.  So while it takes about 10 minutes usually, the benefit of this 'sleep' mode is that it saves the battery from having to be charged very often.  My guess is that if the GPS was always active I bet we'd have to charge the tracker about every couple of days.  But right now it seems like it gets low enough to pop on the charger (20%) about every 10 days.  (this is easy to monitor in the app - plus it sends you an alert when the battery is low.)  So overall the ~10 minute alert time is a good trade off in my opinion.  And once the tracker is away from the base station you can track movement in near-real-time with constant updates to a map on your phone or nearest street addresses sent to you via SMS (or both).  It's pretty remarkable this little, lightweight device does all this.One of the added benefits I didn't think I cared about was the activity monitoring.  We really only thought we cared about the GPS location + geo fencing.  But what we've found is that similar to a 'pet fit-bit', we set activity goals for our dogs and then check their progress toward the end of the day.  (you press a button on the base station to get a quick update - otherwise, while in sleep mode, you get an update about once or twice a day).  If the dog isn't near his/her goal yet then we go out for a walk or a game of fetch until the activity goal is hit.  You can also see if your dog has been feeling lethargic and not as active - the Tagg / Whistle will actually send you a push alert.  Really neat.Lastly - this thing has been really tough.  After a year of being on our Border Collie 24/7 the plastic case of the Tagg has some scratches on it, but is working 100%.  It's completely waterproof, gets caked in mud, goes in creeks and lakes, etc - no impact to the device.  You just have to make sure the contacts are clean before popping into the charger.The one complaint I have is that the Tagg unit was billed as having temperature alerts which would be cool.  The dogs go with us almost everywhere, and while we're super-sensitive to never leave them in a hot car and only leave them on cold days with the windows cracked, this feature would bring added security. We were told that the new temperature alerts would come as a software update to the Tagg after the merger with whistle.  Either I don't know how to activate this feature or its not yet there.Overall, really love this device.  Get one for your dog - you'll love it too.
