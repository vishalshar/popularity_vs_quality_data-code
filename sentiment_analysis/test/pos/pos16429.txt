Wow--I really cannot recommend this enough.  If you're a board game geek and happen to love purple (if not, check out the other colours) you NEED this in your life.  It's a grown up version of a snuffed animal for starters--everyone wants a stuffed animal, even if they won't admit it.  Second, it's soft and if you're going for a more grown up approach, then just consider if it a cushion.I like it for gaming sessions that when we spread the board out on the floor, but you could use it as a regular cushion or just put it on display.Also, I can't say enough for the customer service.  The company went above and beyond--and right at the Christmas holiday rush no less.I see a few more meepillows in my future in 2017.P.S.--watch the video Top Shelf Fun made if you haven't already.  It's a certain kind of special BGG-ness that pushed me from "I need this" to "OMG ordering NOW.
