I bought this toy for three reasons: it looked fun, it's made in the USA and I appreciate the gender neutral marketing. I'm sick and tired of only certain toys advertised for boys and others for girls, as well as being made in China. My niece loved playing with this toy. I plan to buy another and I'm excited to be able to pick it up at Target, since I have to buy most made in the USA toys online.
