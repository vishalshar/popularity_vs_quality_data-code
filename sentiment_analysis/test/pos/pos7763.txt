I'll go 100 on this. I don't test as much as I should and I know this, but going to the clinic sucks. It's a whole day thing, like the dmv. So I put it off. And I'm stupid like everyone else, I don't want to know the results. I'm sure I'm not alone on this...Anyway The kit was delivered within a few days, whole thing took like 20 minutes AT HOME with nobody watching or judging. Why was this not thought of before?  Very happy customer here. Definitely re-ordering every few months, I love this peace of mind.
