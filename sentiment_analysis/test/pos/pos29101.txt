I find these papers really handy for wrapping blocks of cheese.  In my household, that's usually cheddar and large wedges of Parmesan from Costco.  I wrap the block of cheese in a paper and secure it with a piece of painters tape, which can double as a label for the type of cheese.  The tape holds up for several occasions of opening and re-wrapping the cheese before needing to be replaced.  The paper is sturdy enough to hold up as long as the cheese does.  I can't say for sure that the paper extends the life of the cheese, but it seems to.
