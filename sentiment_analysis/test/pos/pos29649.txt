Ok so i did a review in this....and the cup overall is pretty good. It wont tip over very easy, so that will save amny laptops and keyboards...There isnt to much to say except:Good:- does as discribed- lid does seal so it will protect if spilt- plastice is strong, can withstand being dropped with liquid inside- hold plenty to drinkBad:- for me it was only effective occassionally. When my son kept messing eith it....it seemed to malfunction after awhile.- bottom suction cup occassionally sticks, rendering effect of cup pointless (henceforth -1 ?)I would definantly reccomdmd this to anyone that works near electronics...It will save you
