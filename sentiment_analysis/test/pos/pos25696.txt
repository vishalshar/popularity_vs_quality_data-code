This product works very well, with one big caveat.  Before ordering please note these bulbs are big and heavy. They did not fit in any lamp that had a harp to hold on shade. Basically the lamp and shade had to be very open. Watch video to see what I mean.However, once we found lamps that the two bulbs (one is the master, other is linked to master bulb and does not work alone) this system was very easy to set up. My daughter downloaded the Lumisound app on her ipod. The app has two functions, you can control both the speakers and dim the lights with it. She absolutely loved both features.She liked the sound of the speakers. I thought it was okay. but not superior. However, I love the idea of mixing technology and this works really well in a single room, like bedroom, living room or dorm room.
