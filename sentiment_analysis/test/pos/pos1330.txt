He came on 27oct so I have only had him one day and thought he is fab even my mum,who was not keen on him, was at the the end sat there in bewilderment as he rolled over and played great games even said my mums name. At the age of 13 I thought I was too old for the toy but no way. I'm taking to my dad who is a ICT manager and has a Xbox one, VR goggles and also a personal robot (that he spent loads on) to see what he thinks. I think it is a incredible product with lots of potential in the near future especially the update in December ??
