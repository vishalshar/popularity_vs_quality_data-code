This is such an amazing case for my HTC One M9!The case fits rather snug for my phone and works really well for grip and future drop protection. The case has a nice tint to it that blend in really well with any color of the phone. The buttons have a nice texture that feel really well and help identify the button rather than mixing it up.The screen protector that comes with it is a nice plus. I'm not the best applicant for these but they work really well and something to add if you have nothing on your phone.5/5 would recommend to someone again!
