Excellent way to mount your phone to the stem or handlebars. Rubber bands hold the mount in place surprisingly well, though I added the zip ties  for added security as I do not plan on moving it from bike to bike (and zip ties are cheap, lets be honest). Case is handsome and can be used for other Quad Lock products as well, but I'll stick to my usual iPhone case and use this just for rides. Obviously great product when paired with a cycling app. Really satisfied overall.
