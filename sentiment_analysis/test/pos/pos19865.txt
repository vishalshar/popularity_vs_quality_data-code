I use this at concerts and festivals as my fanny pack. It small and unobtrusive so I can dance, but big enough for money, my ID, gum, etc. I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's a bit tight on me.I am a size 10ish though. if you are any bigger it might not be able to buckle, but the tightness means it won't slip so I can't complain .
