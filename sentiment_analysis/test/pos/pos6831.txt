I just received my cogito today. So far it works flawlessly. I had to update the watch firmware right after opening the box, but it is working great. If connected device keeps updating this watch, it has a lot of room for growth.It does what it says and looks great. I have walked more than 25ft from my phone and the connection holds up. Almost no lag between when my phone gets a notification and when it is pushed to the watch- maybe 1-1.5 seconds. Working in a business setting, I can now keep my phone on silent and not miss out on notifications. There is room for improvement, but I am satisfied at the moment. Will update if anything changes.
