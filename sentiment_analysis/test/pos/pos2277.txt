I'm on my four box of these and it was about time I expressed my satisfaction with this product.  To preface, I've been experimenting with medicinal mushrooms for only about 6-9 months to optimize my body's performance, boost my immune system, and help chill my nerves when work gets crazy.I first read many synopsis of clinical studies about cordyceps and it's effect of human performance with regards to opening up of the blood vessels to allow more oxygen flow.  I was trying the whole "let's have a redbull or starbucks before the gym" but I knew I needed to change that and purchased this from a recommendation from The Model Health Show podcast (please listen to a few episodes if you haven't already!). I can confidently say that there is a definitely change when I drink a glass of hot water with these 3g of cordyceps prior to going to the gym.  I'm just a novice female weight lifter, no comps just want to be toned, but I broke through some heavy weights I was stagnant with.  I get a slight body buzz from drinking this but there is no crash, no shakes, and no withdraw as with coffee.Taste is great too!  I recommend to do a 8-10 ounce glass of water.  Don't dilute it with more water than that, you'll miss the flavor!  If you're looking to get a little boost, definitely give this a shot.
