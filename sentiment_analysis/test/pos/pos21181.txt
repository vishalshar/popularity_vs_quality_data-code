Performs well. Nice bright screen. Quick response to Apps given the Quad-core processor. Better than average battery life considering I get Push e-mails all day and night. Only using one SIM for now with simpleMobile. Pulls in signal well with few dropped calls.  For such a large phone, the speaker lacks luster! so almost useless hands free, BUT, works fine with bluetooth in car!  Still a good value, and I have purchased many, many off market phones. I'll keep this one!
