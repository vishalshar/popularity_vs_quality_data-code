I love this feeder. I did have initial Wi-Fi connection problems (problems with my router), but the company owner, Alex, spent at least an hour with me on the phone helping me get it set up. Since then, it has worked perfectly. I have a cat who would eat everything in 10 minutes if I let her free feed and who does not drink water (really!). I can leave four feedings of canned food with some water added and know that they will be fresh for 24 hours, and the water does not dry out at all. It didn't take long for Miss Iris to figure out that this is where her food comes from. It makes some noise when it turns, but that doesn't seem to scare her. I do like getting the notification when she is fed, and it was comforting when I was out of town last week to be able to turn on the webcam and see that she was eating. As others have mentioned, one of the few "cons" of this feeder is that it does not have a battery backup. I purchased the APC Back-UPS Connect BGE90M,120V, which should keep it running for hours in the case of a power outage, for peace of mind. But all-in-all this is a great product and there is no other automatic feeder that comes close.Track package APC Back-UPS Connect BGE90M,120V, Network Backup with USB Charging ports
