I have tried everything in the past to get my cat to give me a urine sample during her bladder problems and she's too smart and always knows when something is up. My last cat used to let me line the litter box (on top of her regular litter) with saran wrap and she'd step in, feeling the litter under the saran wrap and pee on the saran wrap and jump out fast so she didn't get wet. It allowed me to get my sample but this kitty won't have it.This product of the non absorbing sand actually worked--at first she jumped out once and finally went in when she had to really go and I got my sample and used PH strips--my big complaint with this product is that she has a jumbo cat box and a tiny 2lb bag they sell won't cover any of the box--luckily, I ordered 2 bags and it barely covered the bottom--enough to trick her but barely.I am ordering 4 more now and will have one bag always full of it and ready to swap out. I may even need 2 more in addition--it has to appear to the cat like the amount of regular litter--WHAT ARE THE MAKERS OF THIS THINKING WITH THE PACKAGING SIZE? Come on guys, make a regular size of litter bag or a box even better, since one tiny bag was leaking when it got here.Product works great--not enough of it, especially at the price.
