Having had this on our gaming radar for some time, we finally broke down and ordered it. Needless to say, it has lived up to the hype.Initial set-up for the first game took a few minutes, but once staged, the gameplay itself was intuitive and fast. While similar to Machi Koro with the "everyone benefits" mechanic, the execution of it is smooth and the growth in-game is well planned. By the end, we were cheering when certain numbers popped up and gathered a small crowd of curious on-lookers who wanted to join for the next round.As others have noted, the components (other than the cards as noted below) are top-notch. The punch-board multiplier tokens are some of the thickest I've ever used and the dice are impressively large. Rolling feels more like an event instead of a mechanic. Daily Magic Games also provides organization tab-cards that allow you to separate each card type individually for future games (much like how Dominion has labeled slots in their box). This significantly decreases the hassle of finding "Hills monsters" among your Citizens or confusing Start-Up Knights with Citizen Knights. It's a small touch, but dramatically impacts the set-up for every game beyond the first one. So much so that I am more inclined to reach for this now than I would a game where the first 5-10 minutes is spent separating everything. Additionally, the foam inserts provided ensure components remain secure during transport, but allow for future expansions or sleeving of cards to be added without worry that you'll run out of space.There is, however, one critical flaw to what should be a 5-Star game: our copy suffers from the infamous Card Curl. Cards began curving/warping the moment we removed them from the plastic packaging. During set-up of the initial game, we watched as the majority of the cards bent or warped. After the game, we placed them in the proper tab-organizers and packed the foam inserts in tight, but the cards still warped when we checked them the following morning. We'll be contacting Amazon/DMG regarding that matter.Despite the ding in card-quality, the game is impressive. It's fun, fast, and furious. The constant player involvement means little to no down-time. Beginners will pick it up quickly while veteran gamers will enjoy the strategy of figuring out which Citizen, Monster, or Domain to pick to maximize results. Between its speed of play, versatility of tactics, and wide appeal to a variety of gamer levels, Valeria Card Kingdoms now sits near the top of our go-to games.UPDATE #1 - I contacted Daily Magic Games via the form on their website and received an immediate response. They acknowledged that a small lot from the manufacturer was affected by the Card Curl, asked me to send photos, then put my info in the queue to have them replaced with the shipment going out a the end of the month. The speed of response and direct customer interaction places Daily Magic Games head and shoulders above the average gaming company, which makes me even more satisfied with VCK and gives me confidence in their future games. I'll update the rating once the new cards arrive.
