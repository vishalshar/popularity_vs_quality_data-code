I just love, love, love this cam!! No problems setting it up.  Great product!!  Clear picture. Would highly recommend. A great price!  I get to see both my Pomeranians puppies playing in there big play pen anytime. Sooo  entertaining to watch them playing together!!Update, I found a perfect treat for the cam, Vitakraft Dog Drops with Yogurt treats for dogs snacks 8.8 oz pouch for $3.46 on Amazon of course, the treats are small enough that they come out 2 or 3 at a time. An improvement would be to be able to hear them in their pen. I found that with the white cover is very hard for me at take off to refill the cam with treats, so I don't use the cover at all, hands aren't big enough to reach both sides to take off, arthritis. Taking a video of my pups would be neat update too!
