I find Dream Water useful when I can't sleep occasionally due to stress or sickness. I don't have insomnia so I like that it's not super powerful like sleep pills, which means less side effect.I drink it 30-40 minutes before bed, sometimes also spraying lavender mist to the pillow. They both sooth my nerves and put me into a good sleep.There are a few times that it didn't work as I was too anxious or too sick, but I can't blame it for that. It's a gentle sleep aid rather than a prescription sleeping pill.
