The unfortunate truth is the power supply for the Rachio is too large. This enclosure is well designed, and very sturdy. Their is a female plug inside this enclosure, but you will have to provide your own power cord to get power to it. Their is no tie-down to anchor the external power cord which makes it easy for the cord to be accidentally pulled out (scary).
