After unpacking immediately noticed sleek design as well as careful, proper packaging and detailed user manual (there are also video tutorials if you need them). In the silver box (shaped and designed to look like the projector itself) you'll find: projector cube, remote control, mini tripod with clip mount, wall charger and 4 different cables (HDMI, USB and MHL for Android and Samsung devises). If you are an apple user as I am, you'll need an HDMI adapter. Once I charged my new projector (red light turns blue when device is full of juice), it took me a minute to mount the cube to the tripod, power, connect and start watching videos. And I couldn't stop. It's a whole different amazing experience to watch something in the dark with a projector light beaming images to the wall. Imagine having your own portable movie theater you can take anywhere and watch movies, videos, look at photos or scroll through your Facebook or Instagram feed, or what have you. The cube is tiny: 2x2 inch and very lightweight, therefore very portable. You can watch movies in your bed beaming it to the ceilingthats pretty cool! For more of a surround sound experience theres a headphone outlet on the side of the projector and the bluetooth option. I tried my headphones and external speakers, it sounded great. Havent tried bluetooth yet. The Cube would make an awesome present and possibilities here are endless. For example, you can view a document and use a remote control to switch pages. I am planning to use The Cube in my office for client presentations and will take it to my friends rooftop for a movie watching night hangout. To add a few things: the software of the projector is upgradable; the cube can be connected to any device as long as theres an adapter (if needed); you can get an insurance for a peace of mind; adjustable focus (focus wheel on the side of a cube), theres also a Micro SD slot on a side of the projector (I was able to watch my GoPro videos that I made earlier that day right from SD card). The device is easy to navigate, practical and fun to use. Will be buying more for wedding and Christmas gifts.
