I love this product! I first ordered it of Yesstyle but they recently stopped carrying this mask. I was so bummed. I was really hesitant to purchase this off of Amazon because I was afraid it would be a fake. I am really glad I did! This is definitely one of my favorite mask! I was using the Royal Pearl one from the same brand but it broke me out so bad after the first use, then I applied this one and after 2 uses my break out has faded significantly! I will definitely continue to purchase this product!On whitening, I haven't noticed much but the redness on my cheeks have began to fade after using this product.
