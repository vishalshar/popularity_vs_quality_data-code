PROS:  Does add a nice flavor and mellows out cheaper stuff.I have deleted my old review as it is no longer applicable.  My first bottle split, and when I raised that issue with the company, I was sent a free replacement bottle.  The new bottle works exactly as advertised, mellowing out cheaper liquors and taking them up a notch.  Your VS can compete with a VSOP; your VSOP will be on par with a XO.I use mine exclusively for brandy and cognac, and it does wonders.  Buy without hesitation.Doing the math, if you can get a $45 bottle of Henny VSOP to compete with a $200 bottle of Henny XO, you are coming out ahead with this little wonder.
