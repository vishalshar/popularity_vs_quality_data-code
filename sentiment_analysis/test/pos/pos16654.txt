This Reprap based printer hits the perfect balance between an off the shelf plug-and-print and a DIY model. I dinged it one star due to a misaligned lead screw bracket on the Z axis out of the box. Luckily, there is a very active forum and lots of great YouTube videos for troubleshooting, calibrating, and modding this printer which had me back on track quickly. I was getting wonderful prints the first day which have continued to improve as I learn more and tweak settings. I sweated over this purchase very hard, looking at all those $300 printers. What I realized quickly is most of the reviews for those were either 5 stars or 1 star (lots of fake reviews and a few disappointed real customers), tech support was nearly nonexistent, and there was no online support community. For the price ($800) the print volume, features, upgrade potential, and active community around the Robo are well worth it.
