This little camera attachment is amazing for the price. I've looked for a decent thermal imaging device at a reasonable price for years and couldn't believe that this little widget could fit the bill. I'm really impressed with the image quality and relatively short capture delay.CONS: It could attach more firmly to the phone. The connector is the only thing that holds this to the phone, and it feels like it could wiggle free and fall off if you don't keep checking it.
