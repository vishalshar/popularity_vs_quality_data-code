This is a third update on a SeeK camera I purchased in Jan of 2015. After a thorough review of comments and reviews on retail sites, and on the SeeK mobile application, I think I understand the problem. I'm pretty sure the camera hardware was revised some time -- not too long ago. Early reviews tend to be terrible, with misplaced thermal pixels and false temperature gradients proliferate in the reviews. I purchased the camera in January (while the price was still $200) and most of the problems had been resolved, but the camera would malfunction occasionally and the temperature readings were off about 6-8 degrees Celsius. The camera ended up failing completely within a month and I was able to exchange it through Amazon.The replacement I got carried the $250 price tag and it works flawlessly so far. The temperature readings with the new camera are accurate within a degree and the images and videos are detailed and much smoother than the previous camera. If anyone has a camera that doesn't work as well as you think it should, then you should think about exchanging it ASAP. I'm not sure the company is exactly forthcoming with hardware revisions and malfunctioning camera issues.
