Order came very quickly.I refrigerated the package to prolong its life as suggested and only took out a packet whenever I needed one. The Sugru itself is very simple to work and form. Just open a packet, knead, shape, apply and you're done. It applies easily and "hardens" within a few hours. I say hardens, but if you form a thin structure as I did to make a carry loop attached to a travel mug, it holds its shape but still remains somewhat pliable.The various colors made it easy to select one to match your usage and all colors worked the same.Sugru has good holding power. I used three small beads to stick a flat disk to a rough surface in my truck that then allowed me to mount a suction cup holder for my rather heavy Galaxy S4 smartphone. It has not loosened since I did so and the phone on the long, flexible neck of the mount stays right where I need it.Sugru is one of those rare materials that allow you to dream up uses for it. I used some to prototype a small invention I've come up with (and my idea works!).One cautions: if you have small kids around, it would be smart to keep it away from them. It looks and feels like "Play Dough" when fresh out of the packet.Let me end by saying, if you are a tinkerer, you owe yourself some Sugru.
