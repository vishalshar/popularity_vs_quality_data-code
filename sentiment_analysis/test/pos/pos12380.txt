I, like a few other reviewers, saw this product first on a youtube video, and after buying a whole new set of make-up brushes, decided to seek out a product like the Brush Guard to protect my investment.I've read other people who think that you could buy a similar product at a home remodeling store, and I considered that too, but in the end, I decided it would probably be less work and less costly to just buy the Brush Guard sets.In terms of use - I honestly don't think there is anything easier available to protect your brushes.  I got 2 variety packs and one pack of the liner/shadow protectors and that has been sufficient for me.  I use them to protect my brushes from dust and dirt while storing them, and to help them retain their shape after cleaning.  So far, everything is great!Hats off to the inventor of the Brush Guard!  Simple idea, but a great investment!
