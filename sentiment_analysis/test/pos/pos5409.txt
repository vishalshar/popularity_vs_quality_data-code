My little Oksana loves these so much she was in the kitchen at 2am trying to dig her way through the bag. She's usually a very picky eater and since I'm not able to buy these locally we ran out quickly and I've ordered more for her. She has food allergies but these aren't bothering her a bit. Great product that my kitty loves. Cudo's to Whole Life!
