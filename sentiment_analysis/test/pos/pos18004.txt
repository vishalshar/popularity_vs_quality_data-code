The Creative Kit has been a huge hit with our 5 year old! We love that this system has provided a happy medium between technology/screen time and creative, hands-on learning. The white board is easily cleaned with the provided fuzzy erase pouch. The MONSTER app is perfect for her age right now. Mo, the monster, guides her along, encouraging her and her artwork. NEWTON is a great introduction to physics at a young age and encourages her to think outside the box by using the white board and objects around her. MASTERPIECE is next on the list to try!At first glance we thought this SET came with the Osmo base and reflector, but it does not. After a bit of searching, we discovered that only KITs come with a base and reflectors. Sets are basically expansion packs. You can purchase just the base and reflector at playosmo.com for $19 with a one week shipping time.
