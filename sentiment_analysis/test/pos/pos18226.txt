My only regret is that I did not buy these for my father sooner!  They are great. He is very happy with them and took to using them very easily. He especially loves the mug with the large handle. So far he isn't super thrilled with the spoons, but I like them for when I assist in feeding him. Would love to have a similar type fork as well and the option of buying additional mugs or all the pieces individually. They would be fabulous for kids too.
