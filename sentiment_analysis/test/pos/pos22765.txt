I have always wanted to purchase a light therapy skin machine and never have until I saw the Rejuvalite on sale on Amazon. It was such a good bargain I could not pass up.  I have been using since I received and am starting to notice my skin seems a lot smoother and brighter.  I drink from straws therefore I have small lines around my mouth as if I smoked.  Those lines are diminishing and do not appear as deep.  So far, so good!  As an FYI,  I had used a generic lotion on my legs one day and my knees broke out in a horrible rash.....the rash was not clearing up and I was getting ready to go to the Dr and decided, what the heck I will use the Rejuvalite on my knees.  Within a couple of days the inflammation was not as severe and within a week and a half the rash was gone.  Don't know if you are suppose to use for rashes but it did heal mine quickly.  That alone impressed me.  Haven't tried the Argan Oil Trophy Skin recommends but want to.........I am sure together my skin will look even better.  Thanks Trophy Skin.
