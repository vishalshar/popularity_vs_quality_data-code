UPDATE: I've had this watch for several weeks now, and I love it more and more. It has quickly become a part of me. I never take it off. It feels good and looks so classy. And it's so cool the way you can two-finger tap it and see the hands move to your alarm time, then move back to the time, which is always accurate. I love to see the sleep and activity data show up in my Withings Healthmate app alongside my weight and heart rate (the latter two readings from the scale, not the watch) as well as in My Fitness Pal without me having to do much of anything at all. I just want to thank whoever it was who returned this watch (and the reseller I bought it from, too) so I could buy it for what is now $250 off the new price. I love this watch. I mean, I really love this watch.I purchased the black Activite "Used - Like New" from a reseller here on Amazon, andknock on woodI am SO happy with it. I have tried so many different trackers, and none of them were working out very well for me. My first fitness tracker was the Fitbit Flex, which was a most-appreciated gift and got me hooked on fitness tracking, but the band just ate up the skin on my arm. I put it in a clip-on case that fell off during the night, and then my dog got to it and chewed it up.My next tracker was an original Pebble, which I liked better (especially being able to just shake it to show the face), but it, too, ate up my arm. I've tried three different smart watches that have been offered to me for review, and while I like them, they have to be charged every day. I finally ordered not one but two different Misfit Shine 2s, which got me sold on the idea of having a watch and tracker that runs off a button battery for months-long life, but the Shine 2 has to be tapped to see the time (which is cool looking but really hard to read) and both of my Shines either were not, or later ceased to be, responsive to tapping. Needless to say, I had to return them. (Thank you, Amazon!)Okay, so some history: When I started tracking food intake (with My Fitness Pal) and movement (with one of the aforementioned exercise trackers), I was able to lose 88 lbs. over 19 months. Without a tracker, though, I find I don't move as much and don't get inspired to get out walking. Pounds started creeping back on, so I HAD to do something. I knew I wasn't going to be able to take silicone or rubbery bands, and I knew I was not going to be happy with something I have to charge every day. I was not going to be able to wear a clip-on that might come unclipped at night because of our plastic-freak dog. And I knew I was going to go ballistic if I had to deal with yet another product that doesn't work properly.So, the one fitness product I have bought that has always worked for me and seems to be a well-made, well-supported, high-quality product is my Withings smart scale. So I looked at what Withings had to offer. I fell in love with the look of that white-faced, brown-leather-banded Activite, but there was no way in heck I was going to be able to spend $450 for it. The black one was cheaper ($399 the day I priced it), but still way out of my range. But then I looked at the used ones, and I took a chance on a black Activite for several hundred dollars off, only double what I'd had to pay for my Shine 2. It still blasted past my budget, but I sucked it up and did it.My Activite came quickly, despite the snow delays, and so far is working perfectly. It was easy to set up, and it is syncing with My Fitness Pal as well as my smart scale does and uses the same app. Assuming this watch doesn't just quit working on me, it's the best of all worlds for me. I have the gentle wakeup alarm in the morning I need, the time at a glance, the ability to see how I'm doing on movement during the day, and the all-important syncing of the data with My Fitness Pal. I don't have to think about tapping anything to see what I need to see or do what I need to do, and I know that the button battery will last for months. I've got an extra battery and a silicone strap for when I go swimming in the summer, and I'm comfortable wearing the leather band 24/7. It was a gigantic learning curve to go through, and for what I've spent I could have bought that gorgeous brown Activite, but I'm glad I finally settled on the Withings product.
