I've bought several guitar gadgets over the years but this is one that I really like.  I've had it a couple of weeks now and so far it's bulletproof.  The set up was as easy as described - literally plug and play.  The tone sounds as good as through a cable and I cannot detect any latency.  When I'm done playing i leave the transmitter in my guitar and it automatically shuts off.  When I pick up the guitar the next day it comes back alive within seconds after a couple of strums. I've installed the receiver on my pedal board and everything works seamlessly.  I don't play professionally and only use it at home but it's so nice not having to mess with a guitar cable.
