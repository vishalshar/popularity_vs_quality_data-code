I have fixed several iPhones over the years and have tried many different screens in that time. Now, I only buy iCracked products. They are a few $$$ more but it is worth it. They give you all the tools you need and the YouTube video walks you through every step. This screen even came with a glass screen protector already installed! Cover alone is worth $15-20.
