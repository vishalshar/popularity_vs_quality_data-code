My family got me this unit (they bought it at Bed, Bath & Beyond) for Christmas 2012.  I absolutely LOVE IT.  We have only used the cd burner once - recorded several records onto discs.  I found it easy to do and understand and the CD we burned worked fine in other players including in a vehicle. (that seems to have been an issue for other reviewers)  I think the sound is great, although I read a lot of complaints in other reviews.  It is beautiful to behold, very sturdy and I personally love the am/fm dial radio option.  I have thoroughly enjoyed playing records and have also dug up some old cassettes, which was fun!When you press the buttons to change the source, it takes a couple of seconds to engage - no big deal to me.  True that there is not a sound equalizer option, but that doesn't bother me at all - it sounds wonderful.A couple of months ago I decided to get one for my dad for his 77th birthday.  I consulted the many reviews of the many different choices and could see that getting a "dud" looked possible.  It seems that the quality of these machines is great when you get a good one, but can be a nightmare if you get a faulty one.  I was fairly nervous about that after all the review reading - but decided to get him the same one I have, since I have had no problems at all and the buttons are nice and large and light up, making it easier to see and operate.  I also liked the single cd simplicity.  I had it sent all the way to Alaska (another cause for worry, that's a long trekk!).  It arrived shortly after I ordered it and so far everything seems to be in great working order and my mom and dad both love it!  He is listening to records he has had for decades and hearing songs he literally hasn't heard for 30 - 40 years!  Very cool.I am 100% pleased with this item.  I thought the price was great for all the options you get and the sturdy, pretty wood build.
