This game is super cute and all the kids 9, 7, & 5 all have played. I like that they can use the tablet but it hasn't turned them into unmoving zombies and they must actually think a little not just mindlessly poke. The only thing that bothers me is the price I paid for a white board and markers, and a pen case. Seems a little excessive when I could have purchased these things from a dollar store and added to the osmo starter kit. None of them need expensive chalk markers at their age and they are super messy for kids their age.
