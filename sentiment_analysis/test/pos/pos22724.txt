This was exactly as described and functioned just as described. As long as you know the limitations that the size brings and can deal with them you may love this as much as I did, though ultimately I decided to give it up and switch to one of the giant phones that look so goofy in a holster case.I love this phone but because my fingers are normal male size input was very difficult.  I bought a fine point stylus but I wasn't adept enough to input accrately.  If your fingers are thin and your use of a stylus is better it might work well for you.  As an alternative the voice input worked well, though that meant I was subject to the random capitalization and off the wall interpretation of Google voice.The screen is fragile. One short drop wiped out a number of pixels.  Unfortunately there aren't any protective cases for it.  I loved having a phone I could fit in my jean's coin pocket.  Because I volunteer at a thrift store I was able to find a belt holster that was small enough to use when I wasn't wearing jeans.I'm guessing that the small size meant that the battery was smaller.  It made it though the day but I wasn't using cell data and only rarely used bluetooth or wi-fi.  The micro sd card worked well.I used this on Consumer Cellular.
