Organic deodorant: hard to find a good fit, and when you're in that trial period, these wipes work fantastic. These do a good job cleaning the 'pits of any stank, allowing you to re-apply deodorant to fresh 'pits. I've also used them as an after-shower, pre-deodorant extra measure.They come individually packaged, which is great for travel, keeping in your car/purse/gym bag etc.  and they're discreet.
