Hickies work well so far. Since I have a high arch, they are tight for a couple pair of eyelets which makes the shoes uncomfortable after a couple of hours. Otherwise they do the job - they are tight enough to keep my shoe fitting snug, and they make getting my tennis shoes on and off a breeze. I can't speak to how well they last over time, i.e. do they break.
