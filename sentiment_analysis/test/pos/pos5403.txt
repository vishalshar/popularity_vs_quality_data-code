I LOVE my Bluesmart bag.I amtraveling a great deal this year and use this suitcase on all my travels. It meets all my needs, size, weight,and security needs, It powers my iPad and iPhone, it rolls like a dream, and it looks good.  I read at least one review that was less than stunning and I decided to move ahead with my purchase any way. What I discovered was that their review was nonsense, it was as advertised.Now I am not some 40 year old technically adroit businessman. I am 75 years old and retired. Although this suitcase was not developed with the senior traveler in mind it is a perfect fit.
