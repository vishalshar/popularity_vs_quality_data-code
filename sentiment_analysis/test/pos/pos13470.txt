I am a musician and audio enthusiast. My normal listening gear includes Sennheiser Momentums, KRK Rokit 5 monitors, and ELAC B6 speakers. I had 3 pairs of Nox Audio Scouts dual driver earbuds before this, all of which unfortunately broke. As Nox is out of business (no surprise since their products clearly don't last even though they sound great), I had no choice but to look elsewhere to replace them. I listen to an extremely wide range of music, from Tchaikovsky to AC/DC to Zedd to Adele and generally enjoy speakers or headphones that are able to present a wide range of music well.After listening to them for over a month now:Pros:-Fantastic dynamic range, especially for a pair of earbuds-Bass extension is incredible and very detailed-They sound 'airy' and open compared to other earbuds-Treble sounds detailed, controlled, and sweet-Carrying case looks pretty cool-Build quality feels superbCons:-Vocals can sound recessed, especially on busy tracks such as on Mr. Brightside by the Killers. I usually prefer a more forward/prominent mid presentation-Mids could be sweeter sounding-Earbuds are large and may not be comfortable for everyone-Can expose weaknesses in your DAC, for example, these earbuds don't sound very good plugged into my Thinkpad, but sound great plugged into my Samsung Galaxy, iPhone, or my desktop headphone amplifier at homeI think these earbuds really shine with instrumentals or other types of music that are instrumentally driven. If you primarily listen to vocal work, I would imagine there are better earbuds out there. Either way, I doubt you'll be disappointed by these, especially for $100.
