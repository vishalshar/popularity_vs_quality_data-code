Absolutely fantastic case!The magnet is just an added bonus to a great all around case!The only issue I have with this case is that the rubber on the sides that touch the front of the case can come a little undone from the case. It can be snapped right back into place, so it's not that big of a deal at all.I first purchased a Rokform case for my iPhone 4 and was blown away by how protective they can be for cell phones. It's already saved my current iPhone many times. I would recommend this case to anyone looking for a cool designed case that's very protective!
