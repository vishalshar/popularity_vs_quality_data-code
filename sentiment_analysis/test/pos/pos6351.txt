I think I had more fun with this than my 11 year old daughter. Took it out of the box and let it charge for a while then downloaded app, turned it on, and was off. Easy to use. Great quality and we wore it out. I had the entire family over for Christmas and they all tried it. From a 7 year old little boy to an 11 year old girl to a 14 year old boy they all had a blast with it.
