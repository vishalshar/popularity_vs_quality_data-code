I was amazed how EASY to operate the Aviator was.  The Instruction booklet was written for "Non-Techies".  theprinting was perfect (not tiny), not too much reading, just to the point.  Transferring my cassettes to CDs was painless.  I LOVE my new toy. After the cassette, my 33s & 45s will be going to CDs  .The presentation of the unit is very well put together, makes a good addition to any room.  Enjoy,
