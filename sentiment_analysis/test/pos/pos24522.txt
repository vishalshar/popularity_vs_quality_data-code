First the overall description says Pearl, but in the details it says Blue, but I knew I wanted the bag regardless of color. If you stuff the bag really full, larger yoga mats won't fit through the strap. As everyone else stated, the strap is ridiculously cheaply made! and the strap cannot be easily replaced as it is permanently attached. However, I already placed an order for a shoulder pad that velcro's over it.Don't get me wrong, so many other aspects about the bag are AMAZING! It's perfect for carrying my two yoga blocks and mat. I also use it as a regular gym bag as well.
