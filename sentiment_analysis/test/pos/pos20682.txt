I've used other types of the selfie stick,the type that requires batteries on the stick itself,aside from having to replace batteries,it did make the products a bit heavier and bulkier! Whereas with this one you just plug into any standard USB charging outlet you're good to go.Quality/Use-----------------sturdy and tough material,I intentionally dropped it from shoulder level and it did survive the impact. It is mainly made out of tough plastic than can take a little roughing and tossing around.The part that holds the phone at the end of the stick is adjustable to fit most phone sizes,just pull it up insert your phone and the spring mechanism will snap back holding your devise in place. Small and very portable,its a couple of inches longer than an iPhone 6 Plus,it can fit even in your Jeans pocket,purse,handbag or the glove compartment in your car. The feature that I was mostly impressed with beside being designed in my hometown of NYC :) is the adjustable cradle,it gives you the better angle access to take your shot.Bluetooth 3.0, certified,once it is on,it will be recognized by your device.Final Thoughts:----------------------As you can see in my photos bellow,it can be mounted on a tripod,which will give an access to a less shaky or blurry shot! According to the product's listing,it can also be used with the GoPro,by attaching it to the GoPro connector. With all the mentioned above features and its decent quality,I do recommend it . And I do recommend it to my fellow Amazon shoppers based on my humble personal experience. As for durability and long lasting,only time and use can tell. Despite the fact that this product was a complementary test sample,I will make sure to come back and report any issues with quality in the future.Still, if you're a skeptical person and not sure whether to trust other people's reviews or not! With Amazon's 30 day return policy, you have four weeks to try it out yourself, before returning it for any reason, with no questions asked, and in most cases Amazon will pay for the return shipping, in other words, it is a win, win situation!! With that said, I hope you find my humble opinion helpful in making or breaking your buying decision.
