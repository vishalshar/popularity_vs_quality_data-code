This product is made well and is easy to set up. You do need a smart phone or tablet to used with this device. I pretty much followed the directions and I works without an issue. Now all of my devices, TV's, and devices or appliances that connect to the internet are protected. One last thing to note, mine was it was designed and manufactured in the USA. Customer support is in the US and is quick to respond.
