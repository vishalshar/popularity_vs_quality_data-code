I love banza pasta! I've tried several pasta substitutes, but many of the legume pastas have a funny taste or gummy texture. Banza has lots of protein, fiber and whole grains with real pasta texture and taste without the guilt. One odd thing is some of the pasta shapes are better than others (maybe due to cooking evenly), so I prefer the rotini, but am a repeat buyer and recommend you try it!
