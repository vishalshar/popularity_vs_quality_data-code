When our 8-year-old Golden mix was diagnosed with her second mast cell tumor, I went on the hunt for some kind of natural product to help prevent this from happening yet again. I found this wonderful immunity booster, all organic, and discovered that it is also helpful for senior dogs, just because their immunity is not what it was when they were younger. We have been giving it to both our dogs - our second dog is a 12-year-old Malamute - and they both seem to have more energy and be more alert and interested in what is going on around them. It will take some time, I'm sure, to know if it will help prevent more tumors, but I like the results I've seen so far.
