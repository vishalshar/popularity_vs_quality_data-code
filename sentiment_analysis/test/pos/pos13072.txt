This is a really fun addition to your anki overdrive track.  I'm not sure if since the other reviewers purchased and reviewed it if Anki has made an update, but I find that my Overdrive starter cars, as well as guardian, run on it just fine.  They scan it easily as well, as long as your not racing the AI in the first set of preliminary races.Some notes before you buy:1.  This is really fun and cool to play with, but you will have to adjust the braces under the ramps based on the type of surface you have the track on.  On carpet, the standard placements don't work well, and the cars tend to bounce a lot, sometimes leaving the track entirely (about 15% of the time).  Moving the landing brace towards the end of the landing piece seems to fix this.  Play with it a bit, some trial may be required.2.  Make sure you keep the cars wheels and the track pieces clean!  This is imperative, otherwise the cars have no stick when they land, and won't grab the next piece of track properly.  Simple cleaning before the race is perfect.I would have rated this a 5 if the pieces where a bit more sturdy, or the jump sections could be placed a bit farther apart, allowing a configuration that would have you jumping over another section of track, just incase of fall off's, which seem to happen mid-jump when they do happen.
