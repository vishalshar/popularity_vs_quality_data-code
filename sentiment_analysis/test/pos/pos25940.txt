good product! fitted nicely on my 3dr solo, protect my gimbal with enough clearance from the ground. some review said that won't fitted right on 3dr solo bag, i did some mod on my 3dr solo bag. i installed the leg extension other way around & make a nice hole on the extension leg part by heating up screw driver & make a nice hole on the styrofoam! and my drone seated nicely!
