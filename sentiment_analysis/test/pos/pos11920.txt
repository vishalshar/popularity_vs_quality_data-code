I had a similar case from this vendor for my 5 and got this for my 6. My boyfriend thinks it's way too bulky. But I love how it has a wrist strap so i can be hands free when i'm out. It can also comfortably carry 2 credit cards, license, and a small amount of cash. This is great for when i don't need/want to carry a purse. But if you insist on carrying a purse I would opt for a slimmer case.
