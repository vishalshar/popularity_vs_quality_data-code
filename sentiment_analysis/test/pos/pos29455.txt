I followed the directions for the loose fit, but it was still too tight. The hollowed out center digs into my skin a little,  making it slightly uncomfortable at times. I have a wide foot and a high instep,  and my feet tend to swell during the day.Otherwise,  they are made very well and have a fairly good stretch.  The product was as described and shipped on time.
