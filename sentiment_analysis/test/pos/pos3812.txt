So I purchased on of these for my wife because I know how nasty pepper spray can be (if you've ever spayed it everyone around gets it including you).  She was a bit apprehensive about it at first, until one day she accidentally detached the pin. She came back and said, "that thing is LOUD"  I just laughed and asked where did this happen and she said, "in the middle of a department store and everyone was freaked out".  I laughed ever harder.....now just imagine a perpetrator's first thought.. I think I might even get one for myself just because...
