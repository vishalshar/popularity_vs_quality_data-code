My first flush just came in: roughly 6oz of lovely oysters, brown-ringed caps, smell great. It's been great fun to grow these guys, very easy and excellent for impatient people-my mushrooms started appearing after the first week and grew extremely quickly, more than doubling in size daily; I would leave for work and come home to a much bigger cluster! I also love oyster mushrooms, and at the local market they fetch $4-5 for a sealed container of 4oz; even if i only get the minimum other side flush of roughly equivalent size, that means for $5 extra this is giving me the fun experience of growing mushrooms with little effort, as well as completely fresh grown mushrooms as opposed to the limp-looking things at the store, which is a worthwhile bargain for me. I plan to reorder in the future.
