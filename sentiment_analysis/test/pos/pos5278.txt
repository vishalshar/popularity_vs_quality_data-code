This review was written after several projects (48) done on the RoBo R1+ 3D printer purchased in September 2015.I am impressed by several factors on this printer; the construction quality is good, the print surface size is good and the product support is excellent!The only drawback was the noise from the fans since it is an open exposed printer.The RoBo R1+ 3D printer interior is well lit and there is ample room to work in. The print table is quite large, about 10 inches diagonally and can print that big.The filament spool is easy to install to the bracket and can be re-positioned to either side to give access and view what was being printed. Changing the filament is easy, but I found out that if the extruder is at working temperature, the filament can be removed and inserted quickly.The Matter Controller software is simple to use, but requires some understanding on how the files are loaded from the SD card so the printer can work without the use of a computer. The Matter Controller Software gives you options to change and find resources.  ItÂ’s great to be able to download something from Thingverse or Tinkercad and print it.  The manual lacks some information, but it is not a hindrance.  After contacting  the folks at RoBo, they pointed out what the steps were.Very impressed with their 24 hour customer service, they are quick, knowledgeable and will do follow ups.The printer is very easy to set up and unbox; which was a great experience.  The self leveling feature is great because I was up & printing in less than an hour (previous 3D printer took a few days).
