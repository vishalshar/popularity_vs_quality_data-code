While i love this cup and works pretty well there are a few things to keep in mind. Sometimes a surface you think it will stick to it won't really and you might tip it over. Also the bottom of the cup tends to collect dust or crumbs easy so you have to make sure where you set it down is relatively clean so you don't tip it over because the bottom is dirty. The straw it comes with is kind of crappy. I usually don't use it I just drink from it like a mug. Over all this is a good cup and I am glad I purchased it.
