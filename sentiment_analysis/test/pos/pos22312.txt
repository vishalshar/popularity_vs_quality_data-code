I never leave reviews. 1st my kids really like these vitamins, however with 6 kids giving 4, yes 4 gummies each the cost of these are really $$$. Just ordered Nature Made KIDS FIRST Multivitamin with Omega-3 Gummies Strawberry, Lemon and Orange 90 Count for my kids which are only $6.96 for 90 gummies and they can take 1 to 2 a day. Just a quick look 2 of the Nature Made gummies equal about the same DHA & EPA as 4 of the Smarypant gummies. So I thought I would pass this on to help you save some $$.
