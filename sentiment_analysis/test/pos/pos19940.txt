This is small enough and light enough to take almost anywhere, but powerful enough to enjoy listening to it.I've mostly used it in the backyard for BBQs and board games, and a few times in the shower. No problems getting it wet, but I can't speak to how well it survives a long drop because I haven't done it.My dog likes playing games with it.For the past week and a half, it replaced my car stereo and did pretty well. The bass was a bit weak compared to road noise, but now the new stereo is in so this can head back to the yard.Speakerphone calls have been fine. Nothing spectacular, but no complaints. Much better than the built-in on my android.Looking forward to the Big Turtle Shell coming from their kickstarter campaign -- it should be in the mail any day now.
