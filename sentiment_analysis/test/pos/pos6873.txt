I'm not sure if there is any security concern on letting 6-7 years old kids playing with littleBits, but my kids at such age simply love it! This is for sure one of the most intelligent toys you can give to a kid. It really stimulates thinking, almost like a physical reincarnation of the logic only found on software programming.
