I have a very oily face so for me picking the right facial cream has always been very challenging. IÂ’m always torn between the need for moisture and the need to avoid adding oil and shine to my face. Luckily this Eben Naturals facial cream seems to be formulated specifically for people like me. Indeed, it provides plenty of moisture and hydration while being non greasy and oily. The bottle features a treatment pump so the dosage is optimal and you can pin point the areas of the face you want to target. I can safely say I now found my cream of choice. Good job Eben!
