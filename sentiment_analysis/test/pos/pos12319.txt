I purchsed Mama Strut for a close friend after she told me about her post birth pain. I had it overnighted so she got it fast but wished I had known about it sooner. Here's what she said to me about the product."I felt immediate relief when I put on Mama Strut and so wished I had gotten it sooner. As a first time mom I had no idea what to expect post-birth despite having an amazing OB/GYN and hospital experience. The only thing they offered was disposable ice packs and underwear that did OK when I was laying down but were horrible when I stood up. I had so much pelvic floor pressure for weeks after delivery but as long as I had my Mama Strut on it disapeared and I was able to focus on feeding, bonding and caring for my precious little one. Mama Strut is an essential and every new mom should have one. Thank God my friend was caring enough to find it for me. Thank you Mama Strut!!!!!Thank you!!!!!
