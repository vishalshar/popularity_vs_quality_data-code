They grow so fast you think you might be able to see them change as you look at them.  Very fun.  Very productive.  I started it 6 days ago and I must have close to 100 (yes, I said 100) small mushrooms growing very quickly.  I will probably start to harvest in a couple of days.  Hope I like oyster mushrooms?!  Even if I find I don't, didn't cost much and fun to watch.  Makes you feel like you have a real green thumb.
