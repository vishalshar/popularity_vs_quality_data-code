Great idea. Interesting results if you get it right. Screen hopelessly too small, and impossible to see in bright sunlight we must endure here in Africa :) Certainly it changes the way you think about photography, which is why I bought it. I am developing a sort of intuitive approach rather than careful composition.Build quality is truly excellent, it is a beautiful thing. Ah and all sorts of people strike up a conversation as to what it actually is.
