I rarely write reviews - good or bad.  But this coupler is great.  They do not mention size in their ad, and when I got mine I freaked out because it said it was for "medium/large dogs".  My dogs are 4 lbs. and 7 lbs.  But I used it for the first time today and it was fantastic.  It is very sturdy and well built.  Larger dogs can use it too.  What I like about it is that there is a long lead for each dog.  The ones I tried using in the past were short and the dogs were knocking their heads together.  You can shorten it if you want to.Very pleased with this purchase & got it quickly.
