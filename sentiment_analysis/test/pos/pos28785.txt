Best travel pillow ever. It is also great for the recliner or couch surfing. I love that you can twist or wrap the pillow into some form that meets you needs at the time. Wrapping it around your face and back around your neck makes traveling a breeze as I simply sleep the entire flight. Nice and cozy but the thinsulate never gets hot. I an going to order a second one just for a back up or for company. Love it.
