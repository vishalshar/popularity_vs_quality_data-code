This is one of my favorite buys!  The older I get the lighter the sleep I get.  I have for over 15 years tired many products, and the more I took them the more I needed to take to get a good nights rest.  And then there was the waking up...groggier and groggier...snooze snooze snooze!  For over a year now I have been taking Xanax to help me sleep.  On a whim, back in November I ordered this item.  From the first use, I have been EXTREMELY SATISFIED with Dream Water. I will usually take it 30 mins before laying down, sometimes right before I lay down.  Within minutes I am yawning.  I actually get to sleep faster and sleep deeper than taking a xanax.  Really?  I dont take it every night and have re-ordered Dream Water twice since the first batch.  I feel like a new person.  So much thanks to the folks at Dream Water...you have brought sanity back to sleep:):):)
