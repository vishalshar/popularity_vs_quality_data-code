This is such a great device, so simple to connect and so functional in it's design and purpose.  As these have been hard to come by after their roll-out, I've purchased one of each color (black and white) and plan for them to be the first thing opened on Christmas morning.  I am TIRED of having, year after year, a phone full of pics of only my wife and two kids.  This gives me the chance to set the phone up using the stand and get myself in some pics for once!Gotta be the best gift idea out there for Christmas!
