When I received my Anymote, I went to work setting up a very basic remote to test things out.  I was disappointed.  The Anymote had no range and wouldn't work outside a few feet of my equipment.  At about 7 pm that night I sent an email to Anymote 's customer service explaining my woes.  I hoped for a reply within the next couple of days.  Imagine my shock when 15 minutes later, I received a reply from one of the developers, Sergiu.  I remind you that this was seven o'clock in the evening!  Sergiu and I exchanged emails over the next hour troubleshooting the device.  He came to the conclusion that I might have a bad unit (this stuff always happens to me, it's my curse) and promised to send me a new unit right away.Three days later, it arrived and I went back to work testing it out.  It worked just as advertised.  I LOVE THIS THING!  It currently controls my Panasonic plasma, Pioneer Elite receiver, TiVo,  Roku, Escient Fireball DVD Server and my old school Sony DVD Juke Box.  In addition, it controls my window AC unit and a floor fan.  It switches seamlessly between my WiFi devices (TiVo and Roku) and my IR devices (everything else).  All from my Samsung Tablet while I sit on the couch.  IR does have it's limitations so don't expect to just plop it down and have it work perfectly (or maybe it will for you, I have that curse thing working against me).  It does require reasonable "line of sight" so expect to do a little experimenting to find the optimal positioning.  As for the WiFi,  I can control my TiVo and Roku from outside.I've configured my remote to "watch" Tivo, Roku or a movie each with a single press of a button.  "Macros" are the key and if you have any experience designing macros for Pronto or Logitech remotes this will be a breeze.  If not, it's still a very intuitive process and after some trial and error you'll figure things out. This would be my only criticism of the Anymote, a pretty serious lack of instructions.  An instructional video or documentation on the designing of macros and customizing the remote would be very helpful.  Especially for customers new to this sort of thing.  That being said,  their customer service is second to none and I am certain they would work to help anyone having difficulty.So, to conclude, if you're looking for a solution to control your WiFi and IR devices from almost any phone or tablet and get rid of all your plastic remotes,  this is it.  I can't recommend Anymote or Color Tiger any higher.
