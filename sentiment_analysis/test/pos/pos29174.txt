I ordered the BTunes for use on my well-regarded Sennheiser's Momentum 2s. The VXB-25 was easily swappable with the Momentum 2s wired cable and offered good fit. The BTunes paired easily with my iPhone 6s and iPad Pro 9 and did not add any apparent additional weight. The sound remained subjectively true to that of using the Sennheiser's wired.  I wanted the option of Bluetooth for the occasional day that I could take my hour-and-twenty-minute commute on the New York City bus and subway without carrying my loaded backpack. Reviews of so-called Bluetooth sports-phones were underwhelming so the VXB-25 looked like a perfect option. Although the VXB-25s did not meet my quirky personal need (want), I still can easily recommend them to those who want a Bluetooth device for more "normal" usage.
