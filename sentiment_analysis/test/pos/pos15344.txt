REVIEW FROM AN AUDIOPHILE AND A TECH JUNKY:It does not get any better than this if you're in the market for wireless earbuds. I have been looking for completely wireless ones for a while now (10 years to be exact, based on when I came up with the idea) which solve all the multiple issues being wireless brings. I have looked at all the competition and read all the articles for anything else that exists out there. Bragi has solved earphone usability on so many fronts its hard to count but here are some:1. The "transparency" option means you don't need to pull them out when someones tries to talk to you or you're biking and don't feel like getting run over by a honking car. You turn it on and off as you please with a swipe.2. They're touch activated so volume, and pretty much every control can be activated by them including launching OK Google and Siri.3. They fit perfectly in any type of ear. I didn't know I have ear canals that differ in size from each other until I got these. I just use different sizes in both and it just works.4. THEY SOLVED BATTERY CHARGING. The buds come with a case you can carry them in. Not only does that case fit in your pocket easy, it charges the buds.5. They're WATERPROOF.5. They work better than any earplugs/phones ever to cancel noise from outside and are more comfortable than any earphones I have ever worn.6. They sound PHENOMENAL. I have tested the bass by using amps and equalizers and it handles everything surprisingly well.7. They look INCREDIBLE. They look better than in the pictures. The presentation and design is just beauty.8. WATERPROOF WATERPROOF WATERPROOF WATERPROOF WATERPROOF WATERHOLYSHTPROOF!This is now a 24/7 accessory I carry with me. I leave the house with my wallet, cell phone, keys, and my Dash. You never know when you're going to have to wait in that doctor's office or suddenly show up in a beautiful scenic place like I did with Mount Rainier yesterday and need an emergency set of earphones to make the experience surreal.Also, if you can't pair them and its not working, know that there is something wrong with YOU, not them. Anyone complaining about these without knowing how difficult of a feat they have achieved with these, needs to look at themselves. Also, the moronic reviewers here complaining about the sound quality just aren't wearing them right or are using the wrong size sleeve.UPDATE 1:My Dash cracked. Even though it looks and feels like it's pretty sturdy, seems like mine was a defected piece maybe. But in any case, it did. But who cares if it did because Bragi, being the ultimate German epicosity machine, switched it out instantly, no questions asked. They sent me a brand new set AND a UPS label to ship the old ones back. Also, even though my old right earpiece of the Dash cracked, it is noteworthy to say that it STILL worked PERFECTLY. At one point, I pulled it out of the charging case and it split apart completely, but the genius behind the way it is built, let me latch it back on and it worked flawlessly again. Something that still works so well and more importantly is designed so well that it works well EVEN WHEN IT'S BROKEN, I just have no words to express how impressed I am with everything Bragi.Not only is this product one of the best things I have ever added to my life, it is run by a company of people so customer centric, Amazon itself should give it a first bump. I have never had a more smoother and better customer experience. Thank you Bragi, for being the change this world needs. I hope and pray this company grows and is successful beyond all expectations because they deserve to. They have created their own innovative product which EVERYONE seems to now be ripping off.UPDATE 2:I am seriously contemplating taking a Saturday to create 200 Amazon accounts and leave positive reviews to counter all the re-tards who have given this product less than 5 stars.
