I've been waiting a long time for this to be released and couldn't wait to plug it in to my Zoom F8 (also purchased through Amazon) and just like the start up video said, it linked after just a few seconds and I was recording straight to the F8 with no glitches!  I bought two of them so over the weekend I'll be plugging in two guitars and linking them according to the instructions which should only take seconds, playing back through a sound system so I can get a better feel for how the sound reproduction really is but so far, it's GREAT!
