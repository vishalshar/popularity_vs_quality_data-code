We bought this as an alternative to our child drinking from plastic bottles and cups.  Our child has dropped this all over the place and the rubber outside has kept the glass from getting even a scratch!  Because it's a glass cup with a rubber top we can take the top off and add ice easily and quickly.  Our child loves this cup and always asks for, "my water."  We will definitely be buying this again for our other children.
