First, I have not received anything for this review. In fact, I purchased this unit about 8 months ago for $59 here on Amazon. Second, I rarely write reviews. I am extremely impressed with the this product ( I am using it as a range extender). Why the glowing review after 8 months? We recently replaced a router and the customer service has been top notch, which (in my experience) is extremely rare with anything tech related. Here is the story. When I initially received the Kisslink it worked great right out of the box. For the record, it took me a little longer than it should have to set it up, but I am NOT a techie at all and I still got it together super quick. Most impressive however is that after our new router was put in place, I just couldn't get the Kisslink to work properly.  Tried a few times and made sure I was entering information properly and it was a no go. I called Kisslink, expecting to wait forever and not be able to talk with anyone. But like I said, I knew I realy liked the product and wanted it to work again. Anyway, I took a leap of faith and called and -- get this -- they actually answered the phone and I spoke to someone who took me through the set up procedure. She tranferred me to someone else when it didn't work properly. The next person tried to help as well, very politely I might add. This is the person who told me that my call was being "elevated" and that someone with more experience would call me soon. I receive an email documenting the situation and the elevated status of my difficulty. And then, amazingly, I got a call within 24 hours. Tony walked me through a couple tests and we couldn't get it to work, but he didn't give up. He figured out a way and pushed an update while I was sleeping. Lo and behold, it's working like a charm AGAIN! After the update, he called a couple times and missed me and then emailed to arrange a time to talk ao he could check to make sure all was well. I know, unbelievable, right? I can only hope that these guys keep creating cool stuff to make my tech life work better. Best $59 I've spent in a long time.
