I used to go to a diner with the most amazing pancakes. It was the Star Diner in Sturdevent, WI. I met the owner several years later after it closed. I asked him what the secret was to his pancakes. IT WAS THIS BRAND!!!! These are TOTALLY off the chain old fashion pancakes. They have texture and wonderful flavor. They dont rise until they get almost done. They look nothing like a regular batter so be prepared. I used the recipe on the box. YUMMY! I also bought their vanilla cake mix...Great also! My only suggestion,  buy in bulk!
