The bridge is not wireless however I had plenty of space next to my wireless router which also had an open port so it was a hassle free setup.  Download the lutron app which does everything for you.  Installation of the in-wall dimmer is just like any other switch installation, same form factor, wiring, etc.  The stands are beautiful as well however I would have appreciated instructions on how to detach the remote.  The app is very intuitive, siri integration works great, setting up scenes for quick collective actions is very practical.
