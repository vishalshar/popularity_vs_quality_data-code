Simply the best race car set / track ever made. Great for adults and children alike.  It says it is for 8 and above, but we have had 5 yr olds play with it and I expect that 4 yr olds can do it as well. After opening the box our the kids and adults alike played with it for hours... until our cell phones died!Pros:1. Track is the easiest to assemble, it uses magnets, so nothing to snap off an break, and they almost connect on their own.2. Cars take approx 10 min to charge, but they give you at least 2 to 3 races per charge.. so almost 30 minutes of racing...or what feels like it.3. The number one reason I bought this, was for the ability for my oldest to play with it by himself and still have fun.  Anki has done a great job with this... this is where the AI stuff really comes into its own.  You can effectively race against the computer and it matches your skill set... really cool so it makes it fun without getting killed in 2 seconds. it has multiple computer players etc so it is fun for the children. So if you have an only child, get this because he can play without you, and then watch out he will certainly beat you when you play again!4. Can handle 4 racers at a time, you can switch lanes at will.... I would have killed for this when i was a kid.Cons:1. The track takes up more space that we expected (it is 9 inches wide) - we put a small oval track (4 corner pieces and 2 straightaways) and it hung about an inch off of a standard rectangular dinner table for 4.. - (We don't consider this much of a con, because we simply tell the kids to play with it on the floor in their rooms and take it apart and put it away in the box when they are done.  The track is that easy to take up and down... so we get a clean room after!)2. You do need an android or apple device assigned for every car your are concurrently running on the track. We were planning on using a couple of our old android phones for this, but only one of them would work due to the os requirement. So check the Anki site for what will work. This can be a drag, because most kids that want to play will this will not have cell phones..but tables work fine.. just a bit bulky to drive with since you steer by moving the phone right and left like a wheel.3. Oh yes the down load for the software on android is over 250MB..so make sure you have enough room...but otherwise very fun and intuitive interface.In the end the Pros far out way any of the cons, and after 3 weeks the kids still want to play with it every day... That is is a successful toy. I would say if you give it to you kids for Christmas or birthday, be prepared for it to be the only gift they will want to play with...no matter what else you got them.Thank you Anki, for making something so fun!
