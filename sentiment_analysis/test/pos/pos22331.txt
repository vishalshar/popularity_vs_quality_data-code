This product is potentially great. I love the analytics and the alerts it sends why dog leaves the "Whistle Zone". I did have some issues with it not working, but customer service was able to fix it remotely. The only reason why I'm not giving 5 stars is because the battery life is already pretty bad after 4 months of use. It originally lasted about 10 days (which was awesome!) and it now lasts 2-3 days. Not a big deal, but I forget to attach it back to my pups collar. This ultimately affects her analytics that she's not reaching her daily goals so it's not as helpful now. Would be great if the analytics could be adjusted for particular dates.
