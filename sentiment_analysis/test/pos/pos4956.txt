Finally a activity tracker that I can wear. I am allergic to nickel and every fitness tracker I've had in the past I had reactions with the back of the tracker that made contact with my skin. Fitbit, garmin, etc always had problems. Loved the trackers, but it wasn't worth the skin reaction. So to hear this was hypoallergenic I am beyond thrilled. The tracker to me is even better than the fitbit I don't care much for heads up display I can do with out i don't mind only seeing via phone. The only thing I recommend for future models is a get up and go feature that after so many minutes of being inactive it tells you to get up and move. It also looks amazing and is a great conversation piece since it really doesn't look like a activity tracker but more like a fancy piece of jewelry. Recommend highly!
