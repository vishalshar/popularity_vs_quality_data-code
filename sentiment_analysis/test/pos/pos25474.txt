These are the best wrist weights I have ever used, and I have tried many on the market!  They are waterproof so I wear them in the pool doing laps and they still look brand new. The top quality of the Tone-y-Bands cannot be compared to anything else on the market. They are the most functional without sacrificing fashion and comfort! I like to wear them daily because they look stylish and sporty on but are toning my arms all day long. Worth every penny!
