I have been using this product for about a month and my daughter has not had any signs of a bed sore. I use it on her bed and in her Geri chair. This is a wonderful product and I highly recommend it to anyone who has a bed ridden patient. I can't even begin to tell you how nice it is to have my daughter bed sore free. I hope more people find out about this wonderful product.
