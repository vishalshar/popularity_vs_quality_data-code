Purchased the item to help charge up a motorcycle battery that was dying that was not close to any wall outlets.This was the only portable battery that I could find with an outlet that had this density that was so compact. Worked exactly as expected and has a huge capacity for charging.Definitely recommend if you need a lot of power on the go
