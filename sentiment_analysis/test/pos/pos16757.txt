Yoga Towelnever heard of it until I ordered it, but let me tell you! Its AWESOME!! It reminds me of the nonslip socks that I used to wear all the time when I was younger. Its soft, lightweight, and long enough that I dont have to worry about touching the floor. I cant wait to try it out in yoga class! Then I can comment on the fast drying and super absorbent claims. The icing on the cake is, I can throw it in the ways. Always a plus in my book.
