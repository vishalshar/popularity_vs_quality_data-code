I really love these. They keep my collars crisp and they're adjustable to accommodate different collar sizes. Initially I had a little difficulty adjusting the collar stays, but after a little practice I got the hang of it. The good news is that the difficulty I had translates into pretty secure length--meaning they definitely won't slip or collapse while I'm using them. Also, they arrive in a nice attractive little plastic box that's slim and includes an insert to keep the stays in place while not in use. I keep them in the box in my drawer and love the balance they've achieved between functionality, adjustability, and simplicity.
