I've been looking for a sleep tracker for a couple of days and I decided to go for this one when I saw it could deal with the entire family sleep!The base station is a beautiful object, we had no problem placing it in our living room. The setup process is quite easy, I just had to follow the instructions from the app. And the whole thing does its job pretty well: thanks to the notifications, you surprise yourself respecting the bed time you set up, and the smart alarm became a must have for my wife and I. I feel like I wake up at the perfect time, every morning, you can really tell the difference! More importantly, it makes everyone's mornings way easier as we know what is the best time to wake up our child.Finally, living in a city, it feels good knowing that our home air quality is good, thanks to this product.
