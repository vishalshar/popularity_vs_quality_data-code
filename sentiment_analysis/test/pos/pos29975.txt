The was recommended by a coworker to control frizz in my thinner, naturally curly hair and I love it.  I spray it on my wet hair at night and wrap it up in a hair tie when it is almost dry.  In the morning, I take out the hair tie and my medium length hair looks perfect! It has taken about 5 minutes off my getting ready time in the morning which is incredibly helpful.
