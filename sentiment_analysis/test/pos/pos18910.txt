I am very happy with my purchases of Chaga Mushroom Elixer mix.  Since I started drinking it every day a few months ago, I haven't come down with any of the colds or other bugs that have been going around at work and at home.  Whilst I don't like the taste of it by itself, I find that putting it in a cup of strong tasting tea (Echinacea Plus or Detox, etc. with a spoonful of honey,) it's really pleasant and drinkable.  I'm loving the boost to my immune system, and if it only costs just over a dollar a day to fight of sniffles and colds, it's well worth it.
