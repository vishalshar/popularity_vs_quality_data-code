This device has completely solved my remote problem. It incorporates into and compliments my setup nicely. The device does work with Alexa. In order to pair the two you have to give Alexa the command phrase displayed on the screen. What I find, what the app instructs, works best is if you tell Alexa "ask anymote to"---"my"----. Make sure to say the device remote command correctly or you'll be better off sticking with a plastic remote. But fret not!!! This is where the app comes in as a key component to your setup. All but TWO of my component remotes failed to work. The corresponding remotes were found but didn't work. My RCA surround and Xbox One just wouldn't work.The custom remote maker is amazing. Any layout, any button, from any remote in your setup. I've set up a button to activate my Alexa app and Chrome. I even have a floating remote button to launch a remote in my setup from any app. Overall I love it. I bought this at full price.
