The remote for this is pretty awesome and way more convenient than trying to fondle around the actual speaker if you don't want to listen to the current song.  I've also tried the eHUB, which is similarly priced, and this is by far the better deal.  It's louder, more durable, and the holder for the speaker is more stable.  It is also a plus that you can use it to charge any USB device!  Definitely worth it for city commuters
