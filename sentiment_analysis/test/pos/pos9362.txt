The product has worked excellently for me, though I use it as an "off-label" treatment for chronic flaking and itching of my scalp.  I've been bothered with the condition off-and-on for about 20 years and nothing helped for very long.  My primary doctor gave me a prescription that never worked.  All of the OTC dandruff treatments are so harsh because of the zinc, sulfur, menthol, or salicylic acid they employ to slough off the flakes.  And those ingredients did partially work for a day or two, but then I'd be back at square one.  I'm a black woman with hair that needs continuous moisture, so washing my hair every day with dandruff shampoo would have been a  horribly harsh regimen.  Yet, waiting three or four days between shampoos (to spare my hair) meant that my scalp was in horrible condition by day four.  This had been my agonizing conundrum for years.Then I got the idea that maybe the harsh ingredients in these anti-dandruff products were actually making things worse.  So, I took the opposite approach and decided to look for a product that soothes and moisturizes--maybe something intended for eczema or psoriasis--and apply that between shampoos.  I browsed Amazon until I stumbled upon MetaDerm Organic Psoriasis Moisturizing cream.  I examined the list of ingredients,  read through all of the feedback, and decided to buy it.  I know that it's intended purpose is for psoriasis, but boy has it worked brilliantly for my scalp condition.The day after washing my hair, I part it into sections and apply MetaDerm to my scalp.  Because it's a thick moisturizing cream, I thin it out by squirting a small dollop of cream onto an old dish, add  water, and stir into a thin milky-lotion consistency.  I do have to mix it just right so that it absorbs into my scalp rather than coats it, so I don't get flaking from the product.  It's been trial and error for me, but 90% of the time I'm pretty accurate in mixing each little batch.Anyway, I noticed results the very first week.  I still had some flaking by day 4 (shampoo day), but it was about 50% of what I usually had to contend with.  Each week I saw greater improvement and by week five I was able to extend my time between shampoos to 5 days (which improved my hair's condition considerably).  It's been a few months now and I barely have a problem with itching and flaking anymore.  The only time I do is when I slack off of my regimen.In addition to the MetaDerm, I also usehttp://smile.amazon.com/Dead-Sea-Spa-Magik-Conditioning/dp/B000KUAJDS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1400013929&sr=8-1&keywords=conditioning+mud after washing my hair.  I apply it to my scalp and my regular conditioner to my hair.My story is fairly unique and probably won't work for everyone.  But I have to say this cream continues to work for me when nothing else has and I'm truly grateful to have found it.
