This little IR camera is great!  I am a level 1 thermographer and have used Agema and FLIR cameras in the past.  I have to say this camera does 90 percent of what those cameras do, and for far less money.  It is great for looking at HVAC and commercial steam systems.  Buy it, You won't be disappointed.
