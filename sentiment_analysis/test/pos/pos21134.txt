Very fun scooter that people ask about when they see the kids on it. Bought this for a 4 yr old and could be ridden by any child who has the balance to ride a bike. The handlebars adjust to multiple heights, to allow any height to ride it.We have both the Jr and the original, and my 48" six year old rides the original. If your buying for a child 46" or shorter, I would buy this Jr model. Otherwise you might want the original for them to grow in to.Parts are all built well and I don't see anything that is a potential issue. It was for the most part ready to go right out of the box. All I had to do was adjust the brake tension a little.
