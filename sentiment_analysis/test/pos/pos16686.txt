When purchasing this bottle, I was only searching for something somewhat unique to reduce the amount of plastic I consumed and to encourage me to drink more water. What I didn't expect was an easy to carry conversation starter that would be a gateway to establishing other habits. I've gotten so many compliments on this water bottle that it's gotten to the point where it's almost annoying. I've also gotten to the point where I rarely drink anything but water, juice, or coffee.Most water bottles I've had in the past would eventually wear out, were annoying to try and drink from, were hard to clean, or augmented the taste of the water with a metallic or plastic taste. This water bottle, however, is easy to drink from, resilient, and doesn't affect the taste of the water at all. The removable bottom makes it all the more easy to clean and the logo on the side looks as clear as the day I bought it. Would definitely recommend to anyone considering purchasing.
