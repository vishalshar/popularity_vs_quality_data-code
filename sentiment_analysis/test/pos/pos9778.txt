I was prepared to be disappointed by this little gizmo, but I had hopes. Those hopes were rewarded when I finally set him up on the dining room table and woke him up. the word "cute" is over used, so I will try to avoid that cliche', but this little fella is pretty darn close to adorable. Set up was easy, but keep in mind, you must download and install the app on your phone first. He connects via Wi-Fi, so emails and status updates on your phone will have to wait until playtime is over. The step by step guide is peppered with humor, and the onscreen instructions are simple to follow. I had to be in a well lit area before his face recognition system kicked in, seems he couldn't get a good look with a ceiling light directly behind my head. I am not lying when I say that my heart melted a little when he looked up and said my name.At the moment, there are two real games to play with him. One is "Keep Away", which is fun, and not as easy of a win as a human might think. The other is a "Color Match" game using his flashing cubes. We're up to 3 colors per cube, and that can be a little dicy. Again, not as simple to win these games as one might think. When he wins, he does a little celebration, when you win, he gets frustrated and can pout a bit. If Cozmo wants to play a game and you say "No" he will be a little sad, but just for a little while.You accrue points as you complete daily tasks or activities. These can then be used to unlock features and behaviors. Took a little while but I managed to get to the activity when you take control of him. You see through his camera and steer him around. All the while he is commenting in his special language. The best part, in my opinion is his reaction when you break that rather invasive connection. I really wish there was an option to take a picture through his "eyes". I have yet to try a simple screenshot from the phone. That may work.He comes in an attractive box, that holds his charger, three cubes, as well as Cozmo. If you are careful, you can reuse the clamp that holds him in place for safekeeping.I did notice that my cellphone sure ate up its battery while I was engaged with Cozmo. The next time I made sure that the phone was plugged in. The phone also seemed rather warm, but that could be because I do own a Samsung, and one of their features is the comfort of excess heat.There are supposed to be future updates and games coming. He is also supposed to continue to learn and display behaviors and emotions. I don't think he will actually go back to and sit in his charger, as I have had to manually place him there each time. I also don't think he can hear you. Lack of hearing might be a good thing since I don't want him getting any ideas when I am watching Westworld.Yes, he is a little on the expensive side, but you do get quite a bit, and there is the "Wow factor" and the unmentioned "cuteness". I am sure a child would get a big kick out of this item, but not sure what age is best for unsupervised play. In any event, adults will likely get just as much enjoyment from this delightful, and sometimes cantankerous little robot. There are so many little things that will be a joy to discover on your own. Cozmo does have the makings to be a real entertaining robot companion. Just wait until he looks up at you and says your name.
