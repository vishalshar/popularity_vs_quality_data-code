I had some trouble getting the battery to connect to my network (many, many, many tries), so I contacted tech support.  They not only responded, but they gave me the correct information to make it work.  (Wow - tech support responding with good info... that is a first for me!)Both batteries now work just fine... thanks.Updated - still happy with the product and support.  This is something new, give them a chance to make it!
