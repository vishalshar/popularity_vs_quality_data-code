Charges every device that I own without fail. Charges things like tablets, phones, ps4 controllers (main reason for buying), an atari gaming system, and probably more. This device is very modern looking. The octogon idea was smart and it's very appealing to the eye. I picked up a power practical device and every port charges at lvl 5 (maximum recommended lvl for phones). For best results, you may want to pick up some Power Only usb cords. These are cords that are made just for charging. These are different from usb data/chargeing cables like the one that came with your phone.
