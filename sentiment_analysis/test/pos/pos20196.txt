After frustration using various hand-held scrub brushes to clean the wheels on my cars, decided to give this product a try.  The device is sturdy and well-designed.  Surprised by the amount of power/torque sent to the brush head with a simple garden hose.  The hand grip is just right.This is much better than the pain of using a hand-held brush, a hose, and a bucket, where you have to work hard to get into the tight spaces in the wheels (or use a toothbrush or something like that for fine detailing), then rise off the wheel, and rinse off the brush in the bucket, etc.  This is so much easier since 1) the brush head naturally fits into tight spaces, 2) there is a constant stream of water to rinse away the grime while you brush, and 3) the brush head cleans more thoroughly and works much more quickly than a hand-held brush.  I'd say it cut the work time in half and eliminated the frustration of trying to get the wheels 100% clean.The brush head itself is a good compromise between stiffness that cleans well but won't scratch, and sufficient flexibility to get into the little nooks and crannies.  Worked great getting the grime and pollen off my outdoor furniture too.Very impressed by the functionality and design of this product.
