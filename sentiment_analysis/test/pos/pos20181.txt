This is the second phone that I have bought from this manufacturer and I have been very happy both times. I work as a photojournalist and have used this phone for many of my assignments in a pinch, and have been very happy with the results. Be prepared for some technologies like the Square reader and some backup apps to not work with this phone.  However, it is probably one of the best phones you can get for your money.The reason this phone lost a star is only for the lack of phone case options.
