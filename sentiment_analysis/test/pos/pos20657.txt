Quote from my kid "this is the best thing ever invented."It's definitely the cutest RC toy I've ever seen. Putting it together might be hard for some kids, but they were pretty blown away when it turned on for them the first time. I was pretty proud of them. My daughter has proclaimed it a member of the family. Feels like a toy for smart kids.
