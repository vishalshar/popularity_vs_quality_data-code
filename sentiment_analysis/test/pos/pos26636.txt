I've had this for 1 week and notice a considerable improvement in my senior citizen knees. It works beautifully and quietly as reported. I had one minor concern and contacted the seller who responded with a positive solution within about 20 minutes of my email. I have limited space in my condo so this unit is easy to store plus the carry handle allows me to use it in various locations. This makes it more conducive to use and no excuses! I couldn't be more pleased with the product or the customer service.
