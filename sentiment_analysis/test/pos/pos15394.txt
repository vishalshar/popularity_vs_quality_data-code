I purchased the Grab Green 3-in-1 Laundry Detergent, Lavender with Vanilla, 132 Loads, in 2012.I bought this item while being deployed overseas, so I could wash my clothes with laundry detergent that actually made my clothes look and smell clean. With just one use, My clothes noticeably looked cleaner and smelled better. The laundry detergent even cleaned out the washer I used, despite it being moldy, old, and smelly (these were the only kind of washers provided for use). It was definitely nice to take my clothes out of the washer, and not smell mold for a change. Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase, thanks to the quality, quantity, price, and overseas availability of the item. I highly recommend this product to anyone who likes all natural laundry detergent for a decent price.
