I hate styling my hair, but it's gotta be done. This product makes the task do-able and the results last longer.  I had to order additional curlers, no biggie.  The one suggestion I would recommend is for the round, detachable handle to be made more square.  This will prevent it rolling on counter or into sink after detaching from brush. Quite annoying, BUT don't let that stop you from purchasing.  Great Product.
