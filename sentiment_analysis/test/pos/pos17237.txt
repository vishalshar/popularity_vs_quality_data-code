They are listed as 100% Organic, non-gmo, no sugar added etc and I can definitely tell they are! The first bite tasted like I was taking a bite of a fresh apple. They are dried but you can still taste the fresh juiciness of the apple. I have gone through 2 bags of the apple chips but I haven't gotten to the apricot or mango chunks yet although I am sure they are just as amazing. Definitely a returning customer.
