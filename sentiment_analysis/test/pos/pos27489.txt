I got this as a gift for my grandfather, he loves building and working on projects but had difficulties remembering and seeing the measurements on a standard tape measure. This is a really accurate and easy to read tape measure, and it is really easy to use. I love that it saves the measurements so you can go back and look at them again. He loves this tape measure and I would recommend it to anyone who loves working and fixing things.
