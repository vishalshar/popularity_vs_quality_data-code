I've tested the Formaticum Cheese Paper with several different kinds of cheese (pepper jack, Beehive "Barely Buzzed," Neal's Yard Dairy Stilton, generic cheddar) and in every case, the cheese paper has worked better than any of my former methods (which have run the gamut from Baggies to wax paper and most everything in between).  Despite being kind of spendy, I suspect the paper will pay for itself in saved cheese.  The cheese is not only in better eating condition (sans unintended mold, slime, or  drying), it stays in that condition longer. If you like to try lots of different cheeses as frequently as I do, I think you might find it a good investment.
