My kids love this thing. Although I don't think they are playing it correctly, but it still works. You basic concept is that you need to move around this monster to the prize. The thing I like about it in away is that it does not start you over when you get it wrong instead you are just stuck where you ended. So in reality you could easily just click and use noe block at a time and continue to move it. I am not sure if there is an option to look for the shortest route or quick route but that would be a great addition.I actually ended up purchasing 6 of these because I intend to use them for the classroom. December there is a day of coding that I think students will absolutely love it.
