Works great dog loves it... Now if only he wouldn't require one of us to be standing there telling him to stop the ball in... Sigh...Go ahead and laugh now I'll wait...The machine itself works great balls shoot a good distance. The dog loves it isn't afraid of the noise and understands the concept... We're still working on getting him to understand the concept of playing alone.Good quality arrived in time estimate. No issues. Would recommend.
