These Rock. I have been wearing them for about a month now. I am converting my many pairs to Hickies!  You can check out YouTube videos for the various ways to "lace" them. You can do it tight or loose, whichever you prefer. A smal warning...  If you have extremely narrow tennies, they may not work.  I would have given 5 stars but I do think they are on the pricy side.
