I had been experimenting with pizza making on my grill using a stone for a while.  I got pretty good results except I couldn't get the crust to brown on the top even if the bottom was completely burned.  I was googling to see if anyone had ever lined the inside of their grill with fire bricks when I found the Bakerstone.  It seemed to fit the bill perfectly.As other reviewers mention, it is pretty easy to put together since you just need to install the firebox and two support bars.  It takes 5-10 minutes.  Quality of construction is OK with things fitting together, but maybe not perfectly aligned.I used it on a three burner "The Classic" grill and the unit just fit inside.  In fact, I actually removed a guard on a back (unused) infrared burner so that I could close the lid.  (more on this later)I heated it up for about 45 minutes.  I don't know the actual temperature that the unit achieved as my newly purchased IR thermometer seemed to be reading incorrectly.  It only showed 400 degrees, but given how quickly the pizza cooked, it had to be much higher.I made a couple 12" pizzas and used a square 14" piece of 1/8" luan plywood as a peel to build the pizza on and move into the oven and then used an aluminum peel to rotate the pizza and remove it from the oven.  I found it easier to rotate the pizza by sliding the peel underneath, pulling the pizza a quarter of the way out of the oven and then give it a quarter turn by grabbing the crust with my thumb and forefinger.Thin crust pizza cooked in about 3-4 minutes, coming out brown with some very small burned spots on the bottom and a nicely browned crust.  In other words, it worked perfectly.Regarding closing the top.  For one, you may want to be able to shut the grill down and close the top when you are done cooking.  Bakerstone does warns that you should never close the top when using the oven.  On their site they say that the reason for this is that it will heat up your grill (not the Bakerstone) too much and could cause things like the grill handle to heat up to the point it will burn you or that your grill could be discolored.  Call me crazy, but I did close the top with the grill on because it was cold and windy and didn't notice any major issues with heat.  But as the Mythbusters say "Don't try this at home" and you should follow manufacturer's recommendations!
