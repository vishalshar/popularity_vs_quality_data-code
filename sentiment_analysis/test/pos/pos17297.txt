I love my Alcohoot. I have always wanted a breathalyzer in my car to be absolutely sure I am safe to drive home after having a few drinks. My Alcohoot is perfect because of its convenient size and precision  accuracy. I leave mine in my car so anytime I go out for a drink, I am positive that I am both safe to drive and under the legal limit.The way I looked at it, I could either spend about a hundred dollars for this easy-to-use product, or I could continue to leave the bar ignorant to the fact that I may be pulled over and booked for a DUI at anytime. My choice was simple.There was this one time when I noticed my right headlight burned out as I was leaving the bar after a Thursday Night game. Knowing this would subject me to being pulled over, I generally would have freaked out and sat in my car for an hour or two. But with my alcohoot, I knew right away that I was below the legal limit with a .06 blood alcohol content (BAC). I was sure I was under the limit because I blew 5 separate times over a two minute period. It was a .06 every time. As long as you wait about 15 minutes after your last drink, this thing is right on the money every time.Since getting my alcohoot, I feel much better about driving home after a few beers with friends. And because you can keep it in your pocket, you will use this thing more than you think. For me, I have learned much more about my BAC which is something I didn't expect.My alcohoot has definitely made me a smarter and safer drinker. I seriously recommend getting one for yourself and/or a loved one (I'm getting two more as Christmas gifts for both my brothers). Enjoy.
