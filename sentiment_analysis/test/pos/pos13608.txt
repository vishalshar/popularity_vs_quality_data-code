Amazing! I had my initial doubts, but needed the extra zones and liked the idea of WiFi operation.  After connecting the unit and re-using the rain sensor (not needed, but required by City Ordinance) the system found a personal weather station 5 miles away that will help with more accurate weather forecasting.  The unit automatically adjusts watering times based on the lawn's slope and material (clay, loam, etc.), recent rainfall amounts and outdoor temperatures.Check out the manufacturer's website for details and ideas.  The unit will power external rain sensor remotes (no need for an external power supply).The estimated water savings seems to be a bit high, but all of this is adjustable--zone's coverage area, type of sprinkler heads and estimated watering rates (gallons per minute/hour).  For me, just knowing the unit is skipping watering times because of actual or forecasted rainfall will help pay for itself over time.The extra zones permits additional flexibility to target watering (tree bubblers, patio flower pots, patio mister, foundation dripper, etc.).
