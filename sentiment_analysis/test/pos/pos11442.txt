X-Star PremiumSamsung Galaxy Tab S2Update 5/17/16: Let me start by saying that the customer service was outstanding! I called (3) times and never had to wait more than 30 Sec. and the two men I spoke with, Tom and Allen, were very helpful and spoke perfect English. By far the best customer service I've had in as long as I can remember.So I went to update my Firmware and had the install of the Flight Controls fail. I tried several times, to the pint of draining a full battery and most of the control battery too. So to keep it short  If the update fails, you have to rename the Bin File by removing "-old" from the name and restart the process. The setup renames the file when it updates the firmware.  When we couldn't correct the problem over the phone, I was told that I would have to have the unit sent in for repair or I could return it to AMAZON. I asked what the turnaround would be and I was told it would be a little more than a week because I have (4) days in shipping to and from the repair center ( I live in the Southern CA. LA area). That was great news, less than (2) weeks for a repair, way better than the competition.  After my disappointment in having to send it back, it tried it again and had success.  In my case, I had to have the drone disconnected from the controller when the Flight Controls updated. I tried with the controller attached to the drone more than 15 times and it failed every time.So am I happy I choose Autel? Absolutely!!! Would I recommend based on customer service? 100% YES!First off, let me disclose that I have almost no previous flight time. In all I think I have less than an hour on a micro drone (I wanted some basic flying experience before I jumped into an expensive bird.). As others have indicated, this thing is easy to set up and really easy to fly. It comes set to beginner mode which only allows a range of less than 400ft. and an elevation max of 96ft. perfect for me since Im just learning. I havent changed the mode yet, honestly, Im too afraid and I need more flight time. There are very user friendly display instructions and information, this made it easy to get in the air. Im not a photography guy, but the images and video are more than satisfactory.When I was looking to buying a high end UAV I was seriously considering the Phantom 4 and the Typhoon H, both having very nice features and both priced about the same when you consider additional batteries etc. While waiting for reviews on the Typhoon H I came across the X-Star and it was immediately in the running as one of my choices. I ended up choosing the X-Star for three prime reasons, price, modular design, and customer service (thankfully I havent had to use it yet). Now there werent any reviews on Autels customer service, but they do advertise that as a selling point and reading some of the competitions horror stories, I decided to take a chance. So far Im very happy, and even happier that I havent had to use the customer service.So in summary here are my pros and cons.Pros:Price PointController is very nice, Telemetry info on built in screenModular DesignCan fly without cameraCan fly without additional deviceBattery cost ~$120Software is easy to useOrange body color easy to seeNice case, holds lots of batteries and my tabletCons:Doesnt have duel IMUsDoesnt have duel CompassDoesn't have front collision avoidance system
