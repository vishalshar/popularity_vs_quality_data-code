My 14 year old pit bull - boxer mix has a super sensitive stomach and is prone to allergies which usually manifest as skin rashes. He has had allergies and sensitivities since he was a puppy but now as a senior citizen we've had to search for food and treats that his digestive system AND his teeth can handle. He has all his teeth but he won't gnaw through a tree trunk like he did as a pup. These treats are crunchy, always smell fresh and make him super excited. We've been buying these on Amazon for 6 months now but overall about 2 years. Amazon has the best prices and the convenience of free shipping!
