We were so excited when we saw this mini projector with good reviews. The projector is great for our small family. We tried it out on several different "screens". We used a projection screen, a white sheet and the wall to test it out. The white sheet and wall showed a decent picture but not compared to the screen we used. The screen is adjustable so we tried at different sizes. The 100 inch screen is too big, the picture is a bit blurry. We tried it on the 50 inch screen which showed a nice picture. You need special cables to attach the device to Apple lightening or 30 pin devices so we purchased one. If you have an android with the standard plug or are using a computer (we used our Mac), the cables that came with the package work great. The device's speaker was not very good. We used a Bose speaker with the device which worked.While the device works for our small family, watching movies in the backyard with a few friends, we feel the real value of this device may be for small business owners or students giving presentations in a small room. The portability makes this an excellent option for taking your presentation on the road without having to drag along a large, more expensive (more breakable) device. The cube has a nice high-quality feeling to it. It has a nice weight so you know that its not cheaply made.Overall, if you're looking to show a movie/slide show to 50 of your closest friends of your trip to Tahiti, don't buy this. If you are looking to show a 50 inch movie in your backyard while making s'mores to your kids' friends on camping-in-the-backyard night, this is awesome. If you are looking for a portable device to take with you to present to your customers in a smaller room, this is a great option. Overall, we give it 4 stars.
