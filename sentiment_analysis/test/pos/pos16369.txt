The Gameband works very well and I get a lot of compliments on it when I am out and about. The game plays very well and boots up quickly. I've tested it on several desktop computers and laptops and it has yet to disappoint. While the materials for the band itself seem to be very durable, there is a small chip in the paint (which is surprising because I'm fairly careful with it). Luckily, the damage isn't very noticeable. I wish there were a medium option for size though. My wrist is just the tiniest bit too large for the small, but I'm positively swimming in the large.
