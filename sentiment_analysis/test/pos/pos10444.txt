This is a great little game that you can fit in your pocket in case of a gaming emergency.  The first play through we played the game completely wrong, but still had a lot of fun.  After reading the instructions a bit more carefully we realized that you were only allowed to cover one section of colors, and that made the game a lot more fair on future playthroughs.  For such a simple game it has great replay value and this will definitely remain in my arsenal for years to come.
