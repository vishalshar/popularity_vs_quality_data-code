I loved the sound, placed in my bedroom but found an issue with IR control from my Uverse receiver interferes with DB2, when using my cable remote control it turns on the DB2. There is no fix for it other than placing DB2 out of the way so that IR from my uverse control does not interfere with it. I am just somehow dissapointed by this issue.
