An update to my update and bumping my stars back up: Pebblebee made good and the replaced my unit and added some goodies in the package for my troubles.  They were very kind through the whole process.  I will leave the rest of my comments for reference.  I am happy this got resolved, because this little device really has saved my neck on more than one occasion.Update:  I am dropping my stars on this one, because mine died on Jan 29, 2016.  So...it lasted about 2 months.  I thought it was the battery, but I got a new battery and the light just comes on and stays on.  My phone cannot find it anymore.  Since so much time had elapsed, I cannot return it on Amazon.  I reached out to the company on February 3, 2016.  I received a reply, but they basically said I had to use a spoon or knife to discharge extra energy in the Honey.  As you can imagine, that did not work and my Honey still does not work.  They asked for the serial # which is supposed to be in grey or black on the back, which mine does not have?  But, I bought it from Pebblebee fulfilled by Amazon.  It was not a second party vendor.The original review, which still stands:My name is .... and I have adult ADD.  And life is crazy busy and scattered.  This item has already saved me 4 times.  Sometimes I have to play a little game of hot and cold and walk around the property (we have 24 acres) and watch the bluetooth signal get green or red.  The signal strength is very good and the sounds plays almost always.  There was one time it didn't and they were in my purse right next to me.  I bought these instead of the Tile because this product allows you to change the battery.  I want a lifelong product (thereabouts), not a product I have to send in every 8 months.  Works with my iPhone 6.
