This stylus is amazing!  I've used the Surface Pen and S-Pen with their respective devices in the past, and they are amazing, but they can only be used with their respective devices.  The FiftyThree Pencil can be used with any device on any platform!  And I love that.  Also, no one seems to comment on how slick the rubber tips feel against the glass of your devices!  It slides with great ease and makes drawing and writing very natural.  Having an eraser built into the pencil is awesome too, and many apps have the software integration to support it.  I use this Pencil with Micrososft OneNote on my iPad Air and it's nearly as good as using the Surface Pen with the Surface.  The carpenter style design of the pencil and the walnut finish are brilliant.  You will love this stylus!
