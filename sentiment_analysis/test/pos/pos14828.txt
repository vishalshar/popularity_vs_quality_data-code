PROS: Easy storage; Easy installation; Easy removal (snow?); Works. CONS: Wet/Damp storage; Size. I purchased this product in addition to a windshield cover for those frosty and snowy mornings (not yet snow tested). It fits my 2005 Dodge Dakota, but does not cover the mirrors "entirely" as I expected. The drawstrings are a tad short, but I was able to fit the ends inside the vehicle by rolling down the window and pulling through (otherwise the plastic end is between the body and door frame. I can say they work well for frost protection, but snow protection is to-be-determined (still waiting for snow). If it's a blowing storm, I can see some snow getting behind the cover. Keep a plastic bag for in-vehicle storage, especially if their is sleet/freezing rain in the forecast.
