I love these laces. I bought them because I was about to go into surgery, having bilateral total knee replacement.  I needed my shoes for physical therapy but it was hard to put them on and tie them.  My tennis shoes are now more of a slip on shoe. The stretch of the lace is just enough that I can slip my shoes on but tight enough that I can walk around safely.
