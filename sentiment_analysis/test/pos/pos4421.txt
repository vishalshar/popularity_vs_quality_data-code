This is a hard product to rate.  I've sat here clicking three stars, four stars, and five stars as I debated with myself on how to review my bulbs.  It's hard to rate a device that has resulted in so much swearing and fails on a daily basis, but really has no peer anywhere in the market and constantly impresses visitors.  I've decided to split the difference at four stars with a pro/con list; you'll have to decide yourself if they fit your needs.A little background: I'm using nine LIFX 1000 bulbs in a small one-bedroom apartment in a variety of fixtures ranging from simple table lamps to ceiling fixtures to a cheap Target three-spotlight floor lamp.  I have a cheap $20 Amazon fire tablet stuck on a wall and providing a central light control point.  I control the lights using SmartThings, Alexa, an iOS tablet, several Android tablets and phones, and a Harmony remote.Pros - The devices produce an impressive amount of light, holding their own against other LED and even incandescent equivalents. - The range of whites, going from slightly bluish, calming illumination to a warm glow that tops even traditional bulbs, is astonishing.  The ability to suit my mood to my lighting has proven even better than I'd hoped. - The color reproduction is absolutely unmatched in the industry.  No other competing product has the range of color capability of these things. - They are supported by a wide variety of IoT products, like SmartThings. - Being able to control them with an Echo is incredible.  Every morning I walk out the door with a simple "Alexa, Lights off" and feel like I'm living in the future.  Ditto on returning: "Alexa, lights on." - The app is pretty slick, with the ability to save and recall lighting schemes at a button press. - I've never had a bulb get bricked outright, as you can always factory reset them by clicking them on and off three times. - You can control them with light switches, as if they lose and regain power, they automatically go back to the last color setting.  Honestly, I don't use this, as rebooting the lights like this constantly makes me very nervous.  I put covers on my switches to stop people from doing that. - I've had no bulbs have lighting problems or fail outright, just connectivity issues (detailed below).Cons - They're heavy and on the large side.  That's not really a hard minus, but it's something to be aware of if you're trying to fit them in a fixture.  I had to take one attempt at a hanging lamp back to the store because with the added weight - these weigh several times more than simple on/off incandescent or LED bulbs - the lamp sagged and collapsed. - They crash ALL THE TIME.  Several times a week I have to go track down a bulb that's stopped responding and power cycle the attached light.  I've had to factory reset bulbs on my network five or six times in the past six months. - I'll frequently find that a bulb will respond to one control method but not others, and I don't know why.  Like, my phone will lose connection with one living room light, but Alexa can control it, and my iPad can control that one but thinks ANOTHER light in that room is inaccessible. - The app has a function to make the lights change in time to music, but it can only use the mic in the attached device.  So, for example, I will play music on my phone on my headphones, and I can't make the music move in time because there's no way to make it "listen" to its own audio output stream.  Maybe this is a limitation of the device rather than the LIFX app, but it makes this feature pretty useless. - There are functions like haunted house (make lights flicker) or random, customize-able color cycling in the app, which are fun, but they all require the app be left turned on to function.  These changes happen on your device, not on the bulbs themselves.  This would be annoying if, for example, you control the lights on your phone and want to leave them in "haunted house" mode all Halloween night: you'd have to sacrifice use of your phone for the evening to do nothing else. - I've never had all of my bulbs survive a firmware update gracefully.  There's always at least one where I have to manually restart the app, swap from my iPad to Android phone to push the update again, redownload the firmware update multiple times, or even factory reset the bulb and start over (several times, usually). - Pairing the bulbs with the app has a depressingly high failure rate. - LIFX doesn't support WPA2 Enterprise.  This isn't that unusual, sadly - neither does the Echo - but it bears mentioning. - This con really applies to all smart devices, but it was a surprise and frustration for someone new to the field like me: all integration between these lights and other products happens "in the cloud".  If your Internet connection drops, expect your smart home to get very stupid very fast.  "It's 2am, the Internet is out, and I can't turn off the #@$%@#$% lights." - Amazon Echo integration requires a "skill" to do anything fancy.  In other words, you can say "Alexa turn on the bedroom lights," but if you want to adjust color, you've got to use the long version: "Alexa, tell LIFX to change the bedroom lights to cyan."  That's not a huge issue; I change colors with the cheap Kindle Fire I stuck on the wall as a light switch.In summary: these are the best color-changing bulbs on the market in terms of the actual color changing, with a rich feature set that's constantly expanding with updates.  But in terms of reliability, expect problems.  I would say they're excellent - unmatched in the field, really - for the enthusiast experimenting with a smart home, but if you're a non-tech-savvy user who gets frustrated by things not just working every time and is unsettled by the idea of needing to juggle firmware versions and rebooting your lamps, STAY AWAY.On a side note, when purchasing, it's not uncommon for LIFX's own site to give bulk discounts.  Weigh your price options carefully, as these things are not cheap.
