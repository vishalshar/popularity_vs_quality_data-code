I had been thinking of Rokform cases for my phones for a few years. But they never had one for a device I had until I switched to the iPhone 6S. I heard Lex and Terry talk about the cases a lot as well which is where I learned about the cases.The magnetic mount alone has saved me a lot of time and makes for a hundred uses. when I have to make calls inside a server room, I just put the phone up on the rack post and use my bluetooth headset giving me the use of both hands to work.The case itself is well built and when combined with the glass screen protectors completes a total protection package
