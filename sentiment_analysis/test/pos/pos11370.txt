We have 3 papillons, and we bought the rubber/plastic collars last year to go with our fence. At the time, I complained that the collar part should be nylon and flexible because the little shocker box thing left a large gap with the neck and collar. It's a weird fit, it made the prongs really dig in, but the collar was very loose.We just added another papillon puppy, and she's about 4lbs, and we got this collar for her. MUCH better fit. We were worried because she could have easily slipped off the older style rubber collar. This one works great!As for the battery life, yes, it sucks! I have thought about taking them apart and putting in a new battery only, and now I will try after reading the reviews. BUT, if my dogs are wearing their collars, they know it, so they do NOT test the boundary lines for at least a month after the battery has died :)
