This game is great!  My 14 year old daughter hates math.  After playing it one time she started requesting to play!!! Half way through the second game she started doing the calculations in her head without even realizing it!  You can play a simple version with just adding and subtracting if you have younger kids that haven't learned multiplication and division.  The color coding on the board helps to figure out multiples!  All around great game!
