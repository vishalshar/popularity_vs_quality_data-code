I pre-ordered an Automatic when they first came out with the 1st gen adapter and have been using it until I heard about their 2nd gen adapter. I have a Jeep, so it's never really been about the fuel efficiency for me, but I've always found the analytics to be really cool. Automatic trip cost calculation is nice too when you're splitting gas with people.Now on to the 2nd gen adapter. The one feature I've long though to be missing from the Automatic was the ability to see real time stats. Other apps provide this, but have always required a separate sensor and the only way to use the other apps and the 1st gen Automatic was to use a splitter dongle, which is not reliable. Enter the 2nd gen automatic; capable of streaming real time information to the Automatic app and third party apps. Automatic reached out to the top car app makers and got several on board for the launch of the 2nd gen automatic.Personally, I wanted a performance stats app, so I went with DashCommand. The integration is relatively seamless. It can take a little extra time to connect, but it's not that big a deal. I was a bit upset that being able to do get this type of functionality meant a new adapter and a separate app, but I understand the reasons why and appreciate that Automatic went through the efforts to get us early adopters what we've been asking for.
