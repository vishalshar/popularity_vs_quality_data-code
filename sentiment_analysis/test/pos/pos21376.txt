I had this product on my wish list for several months trying to decide whether it was worth buying.  Mornings are fairly hectic in my household and at times I end up running out the house forgetting to comb my short hair.  I was thinking something simple like this to put in my wallet so when I finally notice my hair, I can comb it real quick.  I have to say this is a very value added product to my life.  The comb itself is very sturdy, so no concerns with bending or breaking that you may get from cheap combs.  I have nit pick complaint, and that is that the comb may be too thin - thinner than my cards.  The comb has a habit of slipping out of wallet from time to time.  It isn't a frequent occurrence, but it does happen.
