Let me just preface my review with my reason for purchase... My boyfriend is watching after someone's two elderly cat's indefinitely. They are about 15 years old and they are puking, pooping, meowing machines. I hate them (don't get me wrong, I am still very nice to them). He lives in a small, second floor apartment and in the summer heat, the entire place smells like hot cat piss 24/7. Yesterday after a particularly pooptastic and puke-filled afternoon, my Remodeez arrived! I put one directly on top of the cat box (ground zero) and one in the living room which is one of their favorite places to throw up ALL OVER THE FREAKING PLACE. This is where the miracle happened, where tiny activated charcoal angels came down from heaven and saved my nose's life. After just one night of the Remodeez being in the apartment the smell was almost completely gone, an 8,000,000% improvement. It is only detectable now if you are within a few feet of the litter box itself. I almost can't believe how well these worked. I just hope that they continue to work as effectively from now until the cats leave us...errr I mean get picked up by their owner.. I plan to purchase more of these for my car, my shoes, my beach bag, maybe even my smelly brother. THANKS REMODEEZ!
