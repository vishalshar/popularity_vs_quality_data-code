This product is exactly what it says it is. The light is a very small bulb that slowly changes colors over time, and it has a button that when you press it, it stops at the color until it's pressed again. It has a 2-minute timer on when it will turn off, and it is only reactivated when it detects motion in a dark room. It senses motion very well, so it turns on when it's supposed to turn on.The base uses four suction cups to hold onto the toilet, and the light is on the end of a wire with one suction cup.The light is pretty weak, but in the dark it still looks good.The best part of this product is definitely that it scares the daylights out of my fiance when she sits down the light comes on.I recommend this product if you just want a light in your toilet, and colors make you happy.
