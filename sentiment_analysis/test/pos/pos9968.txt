Being a meteorologist this weather station is hands down a excellent buy even with the add ons needed to get the whole package.Some people complain of high false readings with weather stations, almost ALL weather station have false readings  or some level of +/- degree of accuracy. So end that issue right there.If you want excellent reading place your instruments in key locations. Buy a radiation shield also.The free app and access to other stations information around the world is excellent. The indoor measurement also is excellent with my access to my heating and cooling system in my phone with another companies app I can easily turn on the heating : cooling : or fansIn my house to improve indoor conditions.A compact station with solid results.
