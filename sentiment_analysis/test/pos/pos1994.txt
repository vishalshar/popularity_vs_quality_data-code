Perfect.  It is small enough to carry in your pocket and the self-contained cables make it easy to use and even more convenient.  It is perfect to keep your cell phone working.  Obviously, from its size and power, it is not meant for many charges.  You can buy bigger chargers for that.I have bought three of them now and everyone who receives one, loves it.  This is the perfect Christmas gift.
