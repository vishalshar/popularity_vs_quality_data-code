Bought a black one awhile back and thought I'd try a white one.The only bad thing about this that I have found after using for about 7 months now (old one and new one combined) is that if you have a screen protector on it, you will be replacing it often. I have gone through three because when putting it on the machining is very precise and not much room is given for the protector thickness so it starts to pull up, and over times it bubbles up and needs redone.And DO NOT over torque the screws!!! I broke one because I wasn't paying attention and had to steal a screw off my old one.If you happen to be jumping into a ball/foam pit and lose the strap retainer piece (speaking from experience lol) you can purchase another one for five dollars, your choice of like 5 colors...white not being an option, just saying. You have to send them a PayPal payment and then an email requesting color.
