This thing is awesome. I'm a bit of a multi tasking gamer and most of the systems I've owned in the past would bog down and I ended up waiting on the system to keep up with me, but no problems with this system. Running EVE online and multiple Steam games on full settings without a hitch. It restarts lightning fast and the back lit keyboard is a real nice touch for dark rooms (my natural habitat) and same goes for the "normal" looks of a business laptop that hide the ninja hiding inside. The first thing I did before even firing it up was add a stick of Kingston Technology HyperX Impact 8GB 2133MHz DDR4 CL13 SODIMM ram with no compatibility issues. The trick is being really gentile with the shiny metal box (I used a suction cup that's normally used for removing cell phone screens) that protects the ram slots on the motherboard. Also, keep track of the back panel screw order if you decide to add ram, most are different lengths.
