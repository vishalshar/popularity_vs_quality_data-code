Great little gadget for my tech bag! I can now carry a big screen with me anywhere I go...literally anywhere.Carried it in to a movie theater in my jacket pocket and sat almost at the top row maybe 30 feet (conservative) or so away from the screen, and I was there early so I decided to see what it could do. I first turned it on and the image was blurry but to my astonishment it had the ability to focus and be perfectly legible even at that size and with the ambient theater lighting on, even at the lowest brightness. It convinced my friend to look up the projector on the spot and order one for himself. Don't know the dimensions of the screen we were projecting on but it was certainly far more than anyone would reasonably expect from such a small package.I am very slightly disappointed that there is no keystone adjustment, but considering the size and adaptability with the included flexible tripod it is not enough of an issue to take away a star.Build quality is superb and matches up like a mini-me of my inwin 901 aluminum mini itx computer case.Tip: save the foam inserts that come in the box and find a gopro case that they will fit in. I found one with customizable "magic foam" and halfway through customizing it for the projector and accessories remembered the quality and efficient packaging that was included with the cube. Works perfectly with a little extra space for the cables.
