Our dog Clio absolutely loves these treats---every time I pick up the bag she comes running over and instantly starts going through her routine.  Essentially she will spin indefinitely until I hand her a treat (almost feels bad).  They are easy for a small dog to eat, the treats themselves don't leave a residue or anything on your hands and smell pretty good.  I definitely recommend them wholeheartedly
