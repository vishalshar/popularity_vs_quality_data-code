My dog was a rescue, he was left on the street due to his mange which he was born with. I have taken him to the vet before and was given medication that took four months to even start to work. Well last week my dog started having the problem again, from my vet visit and research I found out he gets this due to a weak immune system. I purchased this product and within three days I can already tell there was a huge difference, I never have seen something work so fast. I will definitely keep buying this product. It is amazing and works great!! I give him two doses a day because he considered "sickly" but after the mange is completely gone I will put him on the regular dosage. I would recommend this product and for the price it is very much worth it!
