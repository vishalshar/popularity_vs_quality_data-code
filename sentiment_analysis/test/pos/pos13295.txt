I'm a commuter student and I use my phone as my gps. Holding my phone became annoying and placing it in the cup holder wasn't a great view. I wanted to avoid stands that needed to stick o my dash, suction cups on my window and air vent holders.I decided to get this because I rarely use my cd drive. After about 2 weeks of use it's perfect. It is locked in place very securely and tight. Just make sure you don't tighten the lock too much because you don't want to put too much stress on the entrance of the cd drive. It worked well in my civic in its upright and upside down positions. It did not cover my radio channels. Newer honda civic models may have a problem but my 8th generation 2010 civic was fine.The cushioning and clamp was secure and it held my phone very tightly. I did not fear it would slip or fall off. In horizontal position it worked well. Due to the weight balance it leaned more to the left but you can tighten the adjust to hold more.Overall great product and I recommend to anyone who needs a hand free device.
