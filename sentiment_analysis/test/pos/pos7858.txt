I like this little phone much more than anticipated,  here's a run down of why you might, too:Pros:No frillsA dial-tone, a real dial-tone!Large,  really large keysCool Jazz ringtone availableCompactInexpensive plans through GreatCall,  with paperless and paper billing out of Texas and a customer service center availableYou get that satisfying flip- close to end a callYes and No keys guide you through every functionCameraNo internetTextingCons:Occasionally miss having a "smart phone"  but the emotion passes instantlyNo internet but this is not really a con if you don't miss the distraction
