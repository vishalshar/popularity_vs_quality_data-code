Last year I had eczema on my leg. It was bad and the inflammation was getting worse every day. Ulgy, itchy, painful blotches. It hurt to put clothes on. Nothing prescribed by the doctors worked. I tried prescription steroids, topical and oral. Over a few months period, doctors tried combinations of medications including antibiotics and steroids, several different kinds of antibiotics. I tried other over the counter remedies. Still it kept spreading. Then I found Metaderm. I started using it twice a day. Within weeks I noticed a difference. First it cooled the inflammation and stopped the itching, then I started noticing it was shrinking! Now it is as if the eczema was never there! I never write reviews on products, but I decided this was something I wanted to share. It works!!!! I have since used it on my grandkids for a bee sting, and for hives, and again it relieved the problem.
