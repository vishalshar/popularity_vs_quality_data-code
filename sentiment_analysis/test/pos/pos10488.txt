Great pillow for travel and at home.  When left in it's travel bag it is a normal travel pillow.  Take it out and you can wrap it in a bunch of positions.  i've propped a book in the loop, made a sling from my head to my elbow, covered my eyes to block out light, etc...  worth the extra $10 over the standard travel pillow.
