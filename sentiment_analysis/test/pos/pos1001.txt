Excellent product for tracking golf.  I've used this about a 20 times now, I've had a few instances where the score stops reading on my phone while playing, however the distances keep updating.  After the round, I was able to get the whole round uploaded to my phone from the device as I kept tagging clubs as I used them.  The only time I had an issue was getting into my car with the device still on my belt, I caught the seat as I sat down and broke the belt clip.  I went online to their website, put in a problem ticket.  Less than an hour, I got an email response they were shipping me a replacement part to fix the belt clip.  This was all on a Sunday afternoon!!!!  Talking about Excellent customer service!  Less than a week, the part came in the mail, was easy to install considering they also sent the tool to remove the screws as well.  Good to know, not only does the device work really well, but there is great customer service to support it.
