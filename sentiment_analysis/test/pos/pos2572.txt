I love the speaker. Everyone was so impressed with this floating egg speaker and a lot have asked me where to get it. I can hear music loud and clear and I love how the speaker can be my night lamp as well. The only reason I give it 4 star is because when I charge the egg's battery, I have no way to tell if the egg's battery is full or not. The instruction paper only tells the charging time for the egg which is 3 hours. There is a red light showing when I connect the egg with a charger but it doesn't turn to different color when charging is done. I wish it would so I can tell immediately.
