Received my pillow yesterday!  Just in time for my 20 hour trip in a couple of days!  First thing:  the packaging is very impressive.  Well thought out and reusable. The bamboo fabric is "baby bottom soft".  I slept on it last night and had a great night's sleep.My husband is already eye-balling it.  He's going to have to get his own!!
