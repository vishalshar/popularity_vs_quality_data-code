I decided to give the Tile Slim a try recently and so far I love it. Not only is it slim and sleek and fit perfectly in my wallet, but it is easy to set up, works exactly as expected, and the app is nicely designed.My only problem with it is that the tile can help you find your phone by clicking the button on the tile. The idea is fantastic, but the execution not so much. The tile can easily set off the alarm on my phone with just an accidental squeeze. Just keep that in mind, especially if you are in a quiet environment, you may want to take your wallet (or other item) and keep it somewhere it won't be accidentally pressed.Overall, I really like it, and it is a significant improvement over other similar devices that I have tried.
