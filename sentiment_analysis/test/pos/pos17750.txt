They tout in their description that there are over 150 projects to make with this kit, which it true, but it is hard to find more than a couple on their site.  The site is hard to navigate.  The booklet that comes with the kit has less than a dozen ideas and really is average at best. I love the idea of these, and when I dig in and help my kids they are fun.  The pieces don't work all the time.  I think there may be a short.  I am also looking forward to the assembly board they have coming.  Hopefully that will help the pieces to stay together.  All in all I was thinking a 3 star, except I like that this is a toy kids will come back to, and create.  The price point is high, but I like them better than snap circuits because it is more creative.  If you have a child that is interested in this type of thing, but is not creative, the snap circuits would be better, as those come with better booklet instructions.
