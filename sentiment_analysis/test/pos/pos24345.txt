I started my lighting automation journey with Phillips Hue bulbs, but that was starting to get expensive.  Rather, installing Lutron Caseta light switches proved to be a much more economical approach, allowing me to control multiple lights with a single switch.  This starter kit is a great way to get into the Lutron world.  If you're at all a little bit handy, installing the switches is straightforward.  The hub is downright easy to get set up, using your mobile device with the Lutron app to set the whole thing up.  And the Pico switches are a nice touch.  Note that the switches are single throw switches, meaning they only control lights from one location.  If you want to control lights from multiple locations, you can use the Pico switch(es) to do so.  If you want to mount the Pico switches in a wall switch, you'll need to purchase the wall switch adapter (https://www.amazon.com/Lutron-PICO-WBX-ADAPT-Pico-Wallplate-Bracket/dp/B00JZRAFEA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1472305863&sr=8-1&keywords=pico+wall+mount).  Since purchasing this starter kit, I've purchased a ton more switches, pico switches and wall mount adapters and love the convenience of controlling lights manually or automatically (timers or geo-fenced), while in house or from anywhere in the world.  The only thing I wish Lutron would do is put little indentations or raised nibs on the ON and OFF parts of the switches so that you can more easily feel the switches in the dark.
