To say I'm obsessed with my TOO is probably an understatement. For it's size it has clear, far-reaching sound. I have cloudy grey and was a little worried I'd get it dirty quickly but I actually think it's a slight shade darker in person than in the photo and it's a very durable color - so glad I decided to get it in this color! It comes everywhere with me, just throw it in my bag and I'm off! Great travel speaker - highly recommend.
