Bought this little thing on Amazon Prime day for 33 bucks and for 33 dollaroos I was not disappointed.  It is novel as heck.  Tiny, compact, cute as a button, and functional.  I was in love with it right out of the package.  It is light and honestly feels like a toy.  Like candy should come out of it.  The display is bright and not too shabby.  The phone can get a little laggy at times but I had no problems hooking up to various WiFi connections.  Phone sound quality is pretty good.  4 out of the 5 people I call regularly said they could hear me perfectly.  Has fm radio which I like.  Works just like a big smart phone for the most part.  Some apps don't work like Pinterest.  I managed to get PokemonGo on there but, it wasn't very effective.  However, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, and Twitter worked very well.  Small, but well.  Netflix and Kindle worked....ok.  Netflix was jerky and you can tell the phone struggles.  It just barely misses the mark with processing power if you want to stream.Easy to root.  Enough said.Once the novelty of a tiny phone wore off, I was left with a tiny phone.  The only thing I couldn't stand was having to go back to T9.  Unless you have little elvish fingers, you're SOL with typing on the full keyboard.  You'll have to download a T9 keyboard to type and even then, it is annoying.  I don't even have man hands and I was all over the place.I will be using this phone as a back up and when I go somewhere that I don't want to be lugging my Note4.  You can put a lanyard on this little thing too!  SAMSUNG, TAKE NOTE.  For 33 bucks, this was a definite WIN.  Oh, I also just popped my SIM card out of my regular phone and put it in this one with zero issues.
