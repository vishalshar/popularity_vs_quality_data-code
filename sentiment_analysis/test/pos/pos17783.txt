A couple of months after switching our cat over to wet food (and dealing with the headache of the numerous inconveniences that comes with that task), we finally decided to buy this feeder.  And it's changed our lives forever.-We only need to load this thing up every 48 hours, and the automatic schedule we set takes care of the rest-When we're out of town (we both travel a lot for work), this is an absolute lifesaver.  Very easy to teach to our sitters or friends.-The webcam allows us to be reassured that she's always being fed whenever we're gone-We don't have to wake up at 6am every morning, 7 days a week.  On the other side, we don't have to be home at 6pm every night, 7 nights a week.To summarize, the time we've saved through this feeder is far more valuable than what we paid for it.Bonus for the company's customer service.  After a little fiasco involving the cat's water bowl, we thought the feeder was a goner.  Machine stopped working properly and we thought it was a goner.  Marissa talked us through some troubleshooting and now it works better than ever.
