I am an extensive traveler and have used Verizon's Mi-Fi device in many countries. The GlocalMe G2 is easier to use, monitors your usage a lot better, and seems to be doing much better finding 4G connections than the Mi-Fi. I find the device itself very intuitive, albeit slightly bulky. But that is insignificant in light of not having to deal with multiple SIMs when you travel throughout Europe, for example. As for the plans, they are better than buying into plans such as AT&T's Passport, but not as good as having local plans in the countries you visit. That is, price-wise. But, most of these "spot plans" have 30-day expiration terms and often times I found myself not using up what I bought. With GlocalMe plans, I have a year. All-in-all, I think it's a great tool for travelers.
