I go through and close all my apps frequently. However, I found out the hard way the keys leaving or pressing the button only alert your phone if the app is open.Also it would be nice if I could set it to ignore my silent mode (I have a lot of meetings and leave my phone on silent).So the pebblebee app has to be opened, and your phone cannot be on silent in order for it to do its job (Tile does this well).Both are software tweaks that could be changed to make a superior product.It works great other than that, and does as advertised.Another idea is making one specifically for the wallet, shaped like a credit card fitting snugly, and less like a flattened marble bulging awkwardly.All in all I would buy it again, I can work around the two complaints. I did research on lots of others and this one still won it for me.The ihere 3.0 was a very close second because it gives a direction arrow and feet away, where as the pebblebee only gives a more/less lit up bee hive the closer/farther you are. The pebblebee won it for me in the end because it has the leash functionality (makes noise on your phone if it is leaving the 30 ft range) which the ihere does not have. (Though my 3rd place "Tile" does have)
