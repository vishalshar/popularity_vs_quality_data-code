Who doesn't love to build towers? All of my kids enjoy playing with this building set. It even appealed to my oldest son, he is 10. The younger two, 4 and 7 years old, really enjoyed the wheels and spinners. It would have been nice if it came with a few more building plans, but they quickly learned how to use their imagination. I like the bright colors of the stackers. I also like the pieces that allow their creations to have movement. It would also be nice if it came in a more durable storage container. I like that it was very engaging for all my kids. I also like that it can be used as an educational tool with my youngest. He can learn simple math, shapes and patterns. Overall, this building set lets them use their imagination and has endless possibilities.I recieven this item in exchange for an honest review.
