I've only had this for a couple of days, so this is an initial review which I'll update in the future if need be. Make sure you know what you're getting when you purchase this device, as it is not designed to be a smartwatch substitute but a smart fitness tracker.PROS:- Legitimately looks nice; was a little worried that it'd look cheap or awkward but it does look like it could be a piece of jewelry/an accessory.- Quick and easy set up and use.- Comfortable (more so than any fitness tracker or smart device I've ever owned or tried on - including fitbits)- Battery life (I love that this thing runs for ~6 months on batteries - it was one of the driving factors in purchasing it)- More customization than you'd think - I won't get into specifics but know that this has more functionality than just tracking fitness, silent alarm, etc. Checkout the product's app or webpage for more details.- Vibrating Alarm (another major buying point for me) works well- Alerts work well; you choose which apps to get alerts from (calendar, email, text message, whatsapp, etc.) in addition to phone calls...it's nice that you can customize which apps to limit distractions- NOT distracting! Part of why I got this was because I'm already distracted enough by my smartphone, and having a smartwatch would just compound that...but I do like being able to get alerts on my wrist when I have an upcoming calendar event, whatsapp message, or phone call since I always keep my phone on vibrate or silence - this serves that functionality well.- Ideal vibration...I know it sounds weird, but my past smart accessries that had a vibrate option had obnoxiously powerful/loud vibrations...to the point where it'd be distracting to others if I was in a meeting which bothered me. This vibrates enough to get your attention (or to wake you up), but not so much that people other than you are likely to notice it as well.- User friendly app (its a nice little fitness app) that does a pretty solid job of tracking steps, activity, etc.CONS:- Serves more of an alert to check your phone than a wrist messaging screen of what is happening (which I'm fine with). You can set color coded lights for alerts (which is pretty cool) but each reminder notification is only 4 relatively quick vibrations and flashes (calls vibrate until the phone stops ringing); so if you don't spot the color of the led before the 4 vibrations are up you need to check your phone for what you missed...this isn't as big a deal as I thought it'd be, because when I think about it I'm more interested in being reminded that I have something to address, than being able to know what it is by looking at my wrist (taking my phone out is not that much more work)- App notifications decreases battery life - if you have a lot of apps set up with notifications...this makes sense but might also be a drawback for some. I only really want it to notify me of calls and calendar events, so I doubt it'll impact my batter tremendously.- Limited compared to android, pebble (RIP), and apple-watch; again, know what you're buying.
