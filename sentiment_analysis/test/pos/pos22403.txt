******After contacting Nextbit 1 more time we were able to come to an agreement.  I will update this review once I receive my new phone.I have also changed the rating to reflect there ability to communicate with me.*****  The first phone gets 1 star due to manufacturing defects. Unfortunately the paint is peeling off the phone within week 1 of having it. That's right I've only had it a week and it is delaminating. It also got the battery bulge on day 2.  I contacted Nextbit and they wanted me to send the phone to them for at least 2 weeks so that they can inspect then send me a replacement.  But after some collaboration we came to an agreement on them sending me a phone then I in turn will return the defective unit. If you run into these troubles and can come to an agreement with them as I did, don't be a thief and return the bad one.  Because of thieves we don't have nice things.Pros-Its a nice design, feels good in the hand not too small not too big (Don't take that in the wrong context lol)-For a 1080p display it is sharp and color saturation is fairly good (it would be unfair to compare it to high end amoled's at the price the phone is)-I really like the fingerprint scanner as its accurate within reason-The cloud storage integration is a really nice feature and works pretty well- For the most part this phone runs beautifullyCons-The UI that runs on top of the OS is buggy.-The speakers glitch between being overly loud and so soft you can barely here it even when maxed out.-Battery life after latest update is still mediocre.-Very few cases available to protect it as in less then 8 to choose from and only 1 that is semi rugged protection
