After my microwave of a decade unceremoniously died during a round of cooking some potatoes, I had realized microwaves had changed a little since I last bought one but not too much... Still, I had some research to do.I found one microwave that looked beautiful, right price and larger but the reviews were marred with exploding glass...not good! That led me to this one and I'll admit, the reviews helped; thank you!Here is what I think thus far:This is a lot more powerful than I anticipated and more so than my last one (a GE of the same size). It took 1.25 minutes to get a cup of water boiling whereas my last microwave took over 2 minutes. NICE! This Bella microwave (I got the white version) looks nice and even though it has a pull to open door, it doesn't move for me and stays put. If not, it'd be going back for sure.Pros (some subjective):Looks good (this is the subjective one)Heats quickly for me (your mileage may vary if you had an expensive one before)Has a turntableClock is niceHas adjustable cooking cycles (manual has good info)Auto defrost functionPrice is alright and fairSmall footprint on the counter (I've got a small kitchen so this is good for me)Cons:Door is a pull to openIf something occurs or goes badly, I'll update my review. If you've got any questions, I'll be happy to assist.
