We've had our Starry router for about six months now and have been really happy with its performance. Initially, we felt it was a little expensive, but we took a chance, based on the interesting design and the touchscreen.  No regrets!The game changer for our household was the ability to see what devices are connected and what was slowing our network connections down. We like having that insight and I find myself making a habit of counting the bubbles to see who's online.  A bonus was the surprising rollout of parental control features a few months ago, which we've started using with our kids. We like that we can control online access for our kids from the app or from the router - it makes managing those issues a lot easier.  We're excited to see what other features get pushed out in the future.Starry Station has far exceeded our expectations on performance and ease of use.  We have had no issues with coverage in our home (about 1,600sq ft - apartment, urban environment). We were a little bummed about paying the initial full price (since I see the priced dropped for CyberMonday) - but the tradeoff has been having easier to manage, better wifi in our home these last six months.  We had a Linksys router previously, which was OK, but completely opaque when it came to troubleshooting network problems. We are a "high-tech" family, but not a "technical" family, so Starry hits our sweet spot from and experience and performance perspective.
