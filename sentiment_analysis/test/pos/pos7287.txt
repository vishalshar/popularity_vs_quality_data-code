This is a great charger. Only two problems, it doesn't come with the wall charger (the connection is a bit loose to an iPhone compatible wall charger) and it's a bit heavy so your outlets cannot be loose otherwise it will keep falling out. I had this problem even while traveling on the Megabus unfortunately.
