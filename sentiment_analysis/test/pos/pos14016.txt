We were very impressed with this toy.  It doesn't just make sounds when you move your arm around, it senses the direction and speed of the motion to a certain extent.  So, on the drum set setting, with a little practice, you can consistently go from snare to tom to cymbal.  This was way more than we expected.  It's a ton of fun for my six-year-old and for me.
