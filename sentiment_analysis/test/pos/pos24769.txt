The Starling is perfect for what it is. For me, it is all about staying mindful and it has absolutely helped me improve my relationship with my youngest child. I bought it to make sure he gets enough attention.  With two demanding older siblings, he can often get ignored.We joke that he is a sack of potatoes that gets carried around to soccer practice, swim lessons, etc.  I know that it is really important to talk and read with children when they are really young and the Starling helps keep me focused on doing just that.  The Starling also helps keep me mindful of my tone of voice too.What I like:It is well built, cute, and as a Star its a neat little design.The daily activity tip from Alex is great!The charging station is nice as well and comes with a very long cable. I was also a big fan of the way that the USB plug attaches to the wall plug (a sideways orientation that makes it consume less space at the outlet).Both me and my husband are involvedWhat could be improved:The Starling does not track individual words.  That would be cool to see.I know that more is better when it comes to talking with kids but Id like to know what normal is too. The Starling allows me to set a daily goal but as it stands, it doesnt benchmark what is normal.Overall, if you are looking to improve your relationship with your child while accelerating your child's development then buy Starling :).
