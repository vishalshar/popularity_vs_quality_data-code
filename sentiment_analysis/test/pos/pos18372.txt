I've been searching and researching a replacement for a near 20-year-old Acoustic Wave System for about two years now.  I've been tempted many times, but there was always something that held me back.  Finally, I pulled the trigger on the deepblue2 a few weeks ago, and I couldn't be happier.  I'm no audiophile, but I do care about sound - the clearer and cleaner the better.  The clarity of the sound coming out of the deepblue2 is astounding.  There is plenty of bass, but it doesn't overwhelm and it doesn't color everything else.  The deepblue2 scales along with the quality of your source.  It sounds good with Apple compressed files or MP3's, but it sounds fantastic with lossless flac files.  Even I can tell the difference.  With the Acoustic Wave System, it all sounded the same, regardless of the quality of the source.  Feed the deepblue2 a loseless music source, and I think you will be amazed how dynamic, clear, and exciting it sounds.
