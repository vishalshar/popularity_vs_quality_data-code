These only came with the chips, not with the microphone cable or piece 3.5mm cable to connect a device to the ear chips. Kinda feeling ripped off as the cable is shown in the images for the product. Can't really try them without a cable. Attached photo of package contents. No mic/3.5mm cable connector.UPDATE: Spoke with amazon and got a new one sent out right away! One day turn around was awesome. The missing 3.5mm cable/mute button was in the packing this time. Seem like it's a litttttttle on the chinsier side of things when it comes to the mute/mic cable but the headphone chips seem super solid. Good sound and hope they last!
