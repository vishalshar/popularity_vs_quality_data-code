I have always had irregular cycles. On top of that I recently came off of the depo shot and birth control pills together. I was told that it would take a fee months for the my hormones to regulate due to the depo shot. I have been using this product for 2 months, and have had 2 "normal" cycles. I did get a positive OPK last month, but I can't say for sure if I ovulated. I use 1 packet in the morning and 1 at night
