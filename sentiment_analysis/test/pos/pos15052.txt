The Seek Thermal imaging camera is a well working accessory for my iPhone 6. I needed an extender for the connector because I use a protective case for the phone. I would have given it 5 stars but the support information is inadequate. There is no description of the operation, features, controls, etc. I found it necessary to keeping trying the different settings to find out what they do. The spot temperature readings seem approximately correct but as far as I was able to ascertain, there are no provisions for adjusting for differing surface emissivities. All in all I was satisfied with the Seek device and I recommend it.
