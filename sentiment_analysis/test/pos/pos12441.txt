I have several of the earlier generation bulbs and when this came out with the new infrared lighting I wanted to give it a try in an area we setup a security camera when we leave on trips. Setup was easy (had to reboot my router to complete it) and so far in my dry run it has worked great. Really enhances the nighttime visibility in the area. Great product!
