Okay, some of you may be familiar with the older Rat Zapper Ultra back when it was made by AgriZap.  That one was fantastic and did its job very well.  At some point, they sold out to Victor Pest company, and the new unit (it's currently silver in color) is absolute garbage.  I've been searching for a proper replacement, and this is it!The Raticator is every bit as good as the older Rat Zapper Ultra.  I have caught dozens of rats of various sizes, and there has never been even a single instance where the trap was triggered but the rat got away.  It has a 100% kill rate so far.Be very careful when you go through the reviews for this product - a lot of people don't seem to understand the difference between not placing/baiting it properly which means rodents never go into it, versus how well the trap works *once* a rodent goes into it.  The former is the fault of the owner, not the trap.  If you're using this for rats, they are very clever, and you have to outsmart them.This trap is the real thing.  It works extremely well, and is well worth the money.
