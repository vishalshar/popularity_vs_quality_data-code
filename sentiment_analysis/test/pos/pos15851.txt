Are looking to start automating your house? This  kit is a good start. The lutron bridge works flawlessly. I have the app and really like the ability to create scenes. That is handy when you have a lot of lights and need ways to control all of them at a push of a button. This product works well with Alexa and I would recommend it. If you plan on getting more than 50 devices then a second lutron bridge is needed. I read online that there are limitations to the bridge where the max amount it can handle is 50. I currently have 33 lights and plan on having 4 Lutron Serena shades added and I don't see myself going much further than that. If you're are like me and want something that works consistently then I recommend this.
