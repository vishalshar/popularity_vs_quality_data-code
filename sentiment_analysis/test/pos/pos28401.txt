This phone does everything the huge, brick phones do but is small enough to fit in any pocket!  Ideal for those who hate carrying around a big clunking phone.  It is literally a quarter of the size of most smartphones.  I have been searching for a device that has all of the capabilities without the bulk, and here it is!!  It is so tiny and lightweight yet fast and offers full smartphone features, apps, and storage (Micro SD card capable).  Can even type through the voice feature in all of the apps for text, navigation, web browser, etc.  So convenient.
