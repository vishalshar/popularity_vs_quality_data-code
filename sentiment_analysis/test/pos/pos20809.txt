Works great and looks sleek.  I am not a watch guy, so the fact that it feels comfortable and I barely notice I have it on is perfect. My only wish is that the straps were a little longer.  Maybe I'm "big boned" or whatever but I pretty much have to use the last or second to last hole in the band to buckle it, which doesn't leave much slack so it kinda sticks out.  It appears the bands are replaceable though so I'll be on the lookout for some longer bands.  I love that it's a fitness tracker without LOOKING like a fitness tracker.  I also like the sleep tracker feature.  It syncs with the weight watcher app too so you don't have to manually enter your steps for the day to get your activity points.
