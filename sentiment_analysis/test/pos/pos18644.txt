"Santa must have known I was learning to code!" Thats what my son thinks. This robot is a great idea. It comes assembled and can be controlled by an app on an electronic device. The one thing I dont like, however, is there are 2 apps available for controlling the robot. One requires some basic coding skills, the other app does the coding for you. Once your kid discovers the second app, all your hopes of them learning to code goes away! My son would say this toy is awesome, however, so I am happy.
