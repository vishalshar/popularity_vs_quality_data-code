I don't normally leave reviews but given the number of mixed reviews on here, I felt like I need to chime in. Bought the Dash two weeks ago and have been using them extensively (4-ish hours a day) for music and podcasts. I love them.Pros:- They make me feel like I'm living in the future. I couldn't decide on truly wireless buds so I bought a set of Erato Apollo 7's at the same time as the Bragi to compare. The Apollo 7s were great, worked well and were comfortable. But they had so much less functionality. The Apollo 7 felt like nice/cool headphones.The Dash feels like a computer in your ear and very futuristic.- Sound quality has been good. I've ordered Comply foam tips to see if they make the Dash sound and fit even better. They haven't arrived yet.- No dropouts. I'm on firmware v 2.2 and I have used the Dash both indoors and outdoors. Not experienced any dropouts. Caveat: I'm short: 5 foot 5 inches, I'm using an iPhone 7 and I keep the phone in my right jeans pocket.-  The audio transparency feature is fantastic. Love the fact that I don't have to take the buds out of my ear to hear people. I just hit pause and the microphone turns on automatically so I can hear people talking. This is also great for running outside.- I've done a few conference calls with the buds and the voice quality and microphone quality have both been very good. People were able to easily understand me.- Touch controls work well (they do take some practice)- Battery life is solid. Battery life is 3.5-4 hours and the case charges the buds up to 5 times. I have not run into a situation where I'm out of juice.- Bragi seems to be hearing their customers. I did a lot of research on wireless buds before pulling the trigger and the Dash had a number of complaints - no shuffle feature for the internal music player, no touch lock etc. All of those have been addressed via firmware updates. I love that my headphones are constantly evolving and will keep getting better.Cons:- Not really used the fitness features. Heart-rate tracking isn't super accurate. I use a Fitbit instead- My Tap (where you tap your cheek to launch Siri) does not work very well. It's still in Beta so hopefully it will get better over time.
