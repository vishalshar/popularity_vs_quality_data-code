Most popular toy I gave for X-mas.  Gave to one Grandchild who saw comercial and asked for one.  Other Grandkids received other types of robots! Now remaining Grandkids want a WowWee CHIP Toy Dog for their birthday, that did not receive one already. Everybody that sees it falls in love with it; Pet performs so many adorable tasks & even lets you rename your pet in your voice so he follows your commands exclusively.  The most amazing task is that the robot knows when it needs recharging, finds its charging bed, and actually recharges itself!One recommendation to the company....One of rear black wheels (paw) kept falling off.  Amazon Customer Service solution was to credit me back,and for me to order a new 2nd one. (Not bad, however)  We kept trying to figure out how to keep the wheel on.  By the time it was time to mail the item back with the return label, I think I had discovered how to fix the wheel . . . (Seems it fits and slides on by matching groves from the inside, but secures from the outside by turning/latching the wheel from the middle of the outside wheel.)  Well I am now ordering multiples (one as replacement, others for advanced birthday requests)because all the paperwork has been completed by Amazon & I have already been issued a credit for the 1st purchase
