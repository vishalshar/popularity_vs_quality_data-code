I waited a couple of months before writing this review, as I wanted to see how the Elite worked out over the long term. My wife is the primary remote-wielder in the family and the only Harmony remote she liked was the now-ancient 880. Her main issues were the comfort of the remote in her smaller hands and being able to reach the buttons she used the most. I always hated the 880 as I found the buttons too close together. I tried various newer Harmony remotes - the One and the 650, but none of them were acceptable. For a while, Logitech was designing remotes that seemed singularly unusable in their button layout. But then came the Elite.With the Elite, Logitech moved the transport buttons below the display, where they belonged. The most used FF and Play buttons were easy to reach and my wife found the size of the Elite comfortable enough. Many of the buttons we don't use (home control, etc.) but they're out of the way, and the buttons that we do use are large, distinct and nicely backlit.With the Elite and its Hub, I was able to eliminate all of the IR emitters I had wired into the A/V closet. I placed the hub on one shelf and it was enough to control all the devices on the rack. I did plug in one of the Harmony emitters and put it near the furthest device just in case. The TV I set to use the Elite's built-in emitter (which is otherwise disabled.) The RF control is completely reliable, saving occasional trips to the closet to "reset" something. The one physical improvement I would make is to add a small LED to the charging cradle so it could be identified in the dark.The Harmony software successfully imported the existing profile, but it took me some time to find where in the apps certain settings appeared. I found the Windows app easier to use but some settings are not available there. I did have difficulty doing the initial pairing of the remote and hub, but I managed to do it using the PC.My wife is very fond of the Elite and doesn't need to aim it precisely at a repeater anymore. I'm happy that the remote system is much less complicated than it was before.
