I have a cat with skin problems. He used to chew his stomach until he had no hair and raw, bleeding places on his underbelly.  I have been trying different foods over the past year to no avail.  When I began feeding the Solid Gold Winged Tiger food (Pheasant and sweet potato) his skin allergy improved to the point of almost being imperceptible within a few weeks of starting it.  Both of my cats relish the taste and the new protein type seems to be just what the cat needed. A vet said the problem is that the cat built an allergy to having one type of protein all the time.  It is best to vary it. Solid Gold has more than one protein source, so I will try switching types of proteins every few months.
