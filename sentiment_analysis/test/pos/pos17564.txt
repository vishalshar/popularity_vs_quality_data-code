I love my Leaf! I love that it reminds me when to get up from my desk and move around, and that there's lots of diverse activities to choose from.I've read a few reviews regarding bad tracking, and I have found it a bit inaccurate if I forget to change my settings that tell the Leaf where I'm wearing it. But otherwise, I don't need it to be super accurate since I'm not using it to count calories. I do mostly wear it as a bracelet and pretty quickly bought a different band on Etsy.I've gotten lots of compliments on my "cute bracelet" and most people are surprised when I tell them what it is.I find that the sleep tracker is fairly accurate. The only time I found a huge discrepancy was last night, when I took it off to wash my son's hair and forgot to put it back on for a couple of hours, then went to bed shortly thereafter. It thought I was asleep the whole time! But just to clarify, that was my fault! I like being able to see how much deep sleep I've recorded each night, and it's very interesting to see how my sleep changes right before the start of my period and if I had deeper sleep if I meditate before bed.I do agree with one reviewer's comment regarding showing the app to friends. I don't necessarily want to share my cycle info with them, but I'm also not really embarrassed by it so I don't think that is a huge negative.There is a nice variety of meditations included and I like being able to choose long or short ones, depending on my needs. I also like that you can pair with the Leaf so that it can sense how still you are during your meditation session.Overall, I am really happy with my purchase!
