I bought these for my girlfriend. I knew I could make this from wire wraps that I use from my computer, but I'd have to use a lighter to burn the tips to keep it from spreading. This was fairly cheap and was done very clean, so I'm actually satisfied with the purchase. Will purchase again from the vendor since I know the girlfriend will buy more brushes eventually.5 stars for shipping on time, good quality, and price.
