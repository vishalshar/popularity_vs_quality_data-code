I was a bit disappointed, but not unhappy enough to really knock the product.I heard great things about Further's soaps and their smells...The soap is great, cleans well without drying out, great texture, bottle looks good.The smell though.. lackluster. It's the right amount of "mild" and "short lived" that you want, but the actual smell isn't particularly unique. It's not unpleasant, it just smells like.... most liquid soap.
