We LOVE Cozmo!! My 11 year old son mowed lawns all summer long to save up and pre-buy Cozmo before he was released....I was SO proud of him!! Once Cozmo arrived, we were not disappointed! He is absolutely adorable! He can be programmed to memorize faces and the names of people, and when he looks at you and says your name, he squints up his little eyes and it's so cute! He is really smart and can stack his blocks, knock them over and play games with you and will even throw little fits when he loses. I highly recommend this little guy for kiddos 10 and up, maybe 8 and up if your child is very careful and mature. My 8 yo is not quite there, so that's why I say 10. He is well worth the money, hands down!! He does a lot of things and keeps my sons occupied for hours a day, truly!
