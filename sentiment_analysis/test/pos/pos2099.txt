How is it possible that something like this could be THAT EASY to install?!?!?!?!Like seriously, this was the EASIEST thing I've installed in my house so far!!!!I connected the bridge to my main wireless router, shut off the power, installed the 2 starter dimmer switches,fired up the power, launched the iOS app, and configured it all from the app!It's so seamless too! I can say "Siri, please turn on the Kitchen lights" and she'll do itand there's barely any lag. Even using the app itself, when I drag my finger on the dimmer slider in the app,there is only a small 400-500 millisecond lag in the response time from app to lights!That is INCREDIBLE!!!!!Thank you Lutron for making something that is convenient and EASY!I just bought a whole bunch more switches now!!!!
