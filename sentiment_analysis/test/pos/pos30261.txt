I went back and forth on ordering this phone but after it's recent price drop, I took the gambled and placed my order and after two months with the device, I'm very pleased with the purchase. Below is an in-depth review of the device but the TLTR review is simply that for this price point, there is simply no other phone readily available in the US that compares to the Nextbit (other than possibly the Leeco S3 if you can catch it on a flash sale and if you can tolerate it's heavily skinned variant of Android.)DesignAt first glance the hard squared edges may be a bit off putting and make the device seem a tad unwieldy but due to a mix of it's width and being relatively thin, it's actually very comfortable to hold.The muted pastel colors, slab like form factor and the large circular speaker grills has intrigued many other individuals whom have seen me using the device and while it may not be as sharp as something like a Galaxy S6 or an HTC M10, it has a very distinctive charm that I've grown to really appreciate. There isn't much more to the device aesthetically outside of two sets of LEDs, one being a set on the back that are used strictly when the Nextbit Cloud feature is enabled and when app data is being store or transferred to said service and then a small LED near the USB port that is used to indicate that the device is charging or will flash as a notification alert, which is one of my few gripes with it's design, the notification LED can be difficult to see and from what I can tell, will not provide notifications while the device is charged.SoftwareThe software on the Nextbit has one me over more so than anything else with the device; which is near stock Android with the exception of a few color pallets being swapped to match the mint green associated with the device and having certain OS elements such as the notification slider having a transparent hue to them. These minor changes are actually pretty attractive and I haven't missed the muted pastel colors of stock Android in the least. From the get go, the stock launcher that comes on the device is lacking an app drawer and is somewhat IOS inspired, however, this can be remedied with just downloading a new launcher; I'm running the Pixel launcher and other than the previously mentioned color swaps, the device feels completely stock. The other aspect of the OS, which is one of the "selling points" for the device is the cloud backup system which I honestly cannot comment too much on. While the concept of having a device that has near infinite storage is certainly an appealing idea, I haven't encountered much of a need to utilize it as the on board 32 gigs of storage has yet to be filled yet. The cloud storage feature will also back up photos and documents which is a nice bonus but I've been using service such as Dropbox and Google Photos/Drive to cover that feature.HardwareFor being a phone that's currently under $160, there simply no other phone that matches the value to performance that is found here. While the Snapdragon 808 may be a bit long in the tooth, at least in terms of the hardware cycles of cell processors, it performs admirably, especially when paired with the 3 gigs of RAM. In all my time spent using the phone so far in the 3 months I've owned it, I've only encountered a very small handful of times when the device started to stutter, which is just as much an issue with Android as a whole along with being what some would consider a "power user". Everything from high end games to loading 20+ tabs in Chrome have went through without any issues and I've very pleased with the overall performance. In terms of the screen, it's an overall quality LCD screen with vibrant yet accurate colors and great viewing angles and while it may not be on par with OLED panels found on devices like Galaxy S6, again, for the price, it can't be beat. I've also been very pleased with the camera performance, taking very high quality photos in normal lighting and handling low light photos admirably. Lastly is the fingerprint scanner which is reminiscent to the fingerprint scanners found on Xperia devices. While I would have preferred the scanner to be more in line with what's found on devices like the Nexus 6P/5X, it works better than expected, I will recommend though for the best performance, scanning your most dominant fingers that will be used for powering on the device multiple times to ensure that an accurate read takes place.
