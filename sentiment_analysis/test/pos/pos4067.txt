The only issue I have found with the Brydge Keyboard is when docked with the iPad Mini 4, is touch sensitivity icons at the bottom of a page are not easily executed. For instance, in the Mail app when viewing the inbox, if you select 'Edit' to remove unwanted or junk email the 'Trash' icon is not easily accessible to trigger the deletion of the selected email.This can be overcome with two options. One use a small stylus to touch/push/trigger the 'Trash' icon or move the iPad up slightly in the docking arm.Neither are extremely suitable for longterm use. Moving the iPad up from it's seated position causes the case to not fit flush when closed. Cumbersome to swap and change each time. Using a stylus defeats the purpose, for the most part, of having a keyboard.
