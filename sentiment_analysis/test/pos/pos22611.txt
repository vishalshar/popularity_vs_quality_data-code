Great! The plastic casing around the side buttons does look kind of cheap or like the letters would fade after moderate use though. I would not buy this if you are a pro or use the measure a lot. Other than that is very functional and works great in both ft and meters.  I love that the display can also tell you feet + inches in fractions or feet with decimals (in addition to centimeters). The screen turns off by itself, so no worrying about leaving it on and draining the battery. Overall its a great addition and I like it.
