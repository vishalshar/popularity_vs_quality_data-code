Great stuff.  Very high quality and consistent quality which is the most important part.  My cat loves this stuff any way he can get it.  We do dry as treats, mixed in with food when he is being picky and also sometimes re-hydrated. I'm pretty sure if it came down to it  I'd be willing to eat this stuff re-hydrated.  Maybe a good emergency kit supply...
