I hated how long my original shoe laces were, plus my cat decided that the ends were delicious, which you can kind of see in the before/after picture. I needed to replace my laces, so when I came across these, I figured I'd give it a shot. I like the idea of slip on shoes that aren't too loose. I just put these on, so I'll have to see how things go, but so far so good!A lot of reviewers say they are too tight, so maybe I just have small feet (size 7) and I do like a snug fit, but the "regular" lace-up method was fine. One thing that even the Hickies website mentions is if you want a looser opening, you can just skip the top row. However, I think that might make it a bit too loose at the top, and I don't want my shoes to slide around. So I looked at the suggestions on their site ([...]) and I came up with a minor alteration. I took one of their how-to screenshots and messed with it in paint to demonstrate what I did. Basically I did the standard lace up except for the top two, where I did a version of the loose lace. This resulted in a nice snug fit on most of the foot, but a very flexible opening so I can easily pop my foot in.
