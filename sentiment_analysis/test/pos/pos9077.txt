I purchased the "LifeProof" Fre case and the bike mount initially and not going to lie, I was pleased BUT...The mount is big, bulky and even though they provided 3 different sized gaskets to fix onto my bar, I still had to go out and get one that would work (one was too big and one was too small).  And even though the case is solid and water proof, the flimsy film over the screen was horrible (streaks, raised off glass near earpiece and rather bulky)... These issues made me look for an alternative...Which brought me to Quad Lock.  Initially I kept seeing it advertised all over facebook but once I decided LifeProof wasn't for me I gave Quad Lock a look... SO GLAD I DID.I odered Quad Lock and I popped my iPhone into the new case (simple and less than 10 seconds... LifeProof took 40 minutes)).  The case has no loose points and has a real tight fit.As for the bike mount, I was hoping it wouldn't be as time consuming as the LifeProof and apparently It wasn't... Again it took no time at all... super easy... just put the mount where wanted and connect with included o-rings.  Was it really that easy?  YESAnd using the mount is even easier.  With one hand you just put the phone onto mount angled and then turn into position... DONEAnd once mounted the phone is sturdy enough to use all the functions of the phone without the phone dipping or moving under the weight of your fingers.***  MY ONE COMPLAINT ***  This really bothered me but I did not lower my Quad Lock rating because it reflects more on Amazon (not Quad Lock)... I received the packed that was shipped via USPS and the mailing package was not opened (sealed as Amazon sent it) but once I opened the mailing envelope it was very evident that the Quad Lock box had been opened before... it had two rips and obvious that the unit had been used and returned... I shouldn't have to pay retail for something that was used and returned by someone elseHIGHLY RECOMMEND ! ! !
