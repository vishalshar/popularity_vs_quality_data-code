I love this thing, but the heart monitor is not that great. Considering that is one of the biggest reason I purchased this item that makes me very sad.But I do love the way if adds my weight to my other apps like Myfitnesspal and record. And I love the fact that it connects to my wireless network. That is so much better than bluetooth.If the cardio was more accurate I would give this 5 stars all the way.
