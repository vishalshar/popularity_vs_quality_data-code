I have had this water bottle for a week, and I love it so far. Before I had been using a camelbak water bottle, and it was disconcerting how quickly it would become dirty, especially around the nozzle. This one, on the other hand, is easily cleaned and just as effective at transporting water. The open mouth format fits my preference much more as well.There are no moving parts. The two bottoms securely lock in place, and I have not observed any hint of leakage.
