This is one of those few great consumer gadgets out there that actually make me feel like I'm living in the future. It's so cool. I kind of never get over having a pen that draws in mid air like freaking magic, or a 3D printer that you hold in your hand. I had the 2.0 and got pretty good with it, but I put it through it's paces and wanted to check out the create, so I gifted my old one to my roommate and got this. It's an improvement. It's smoother and a little more user friendly. The access panel on the bottom that you use to clear clogs or jams is easier to get on and off, and the plastic flow is like butter. They're pretty similar in size, I think this one a bit more compact but my roommate is asleep so I don't want to bug her to compare. I like the colors and design more on this one, it's more bladerunner.The access panel thing is a big deal. Clogs and jams can happen if you're lazy like me and leave plastic in the pen sometimes. Which no one should ever do. I've never had one I couldn't fix in under a minute or two. The instructions are more clear in this version, too, which is good. These things last a long time if you remember that its actually pretty sophisticated tech and take care of it. What else? Oh yea, I never just jam plastic in the back. I insert it and gently turn it clockwise while I wait for the motor to catch the plastic rod. My sister broke one at her school by jamming the plastic in the back like she was stuffing a turkey.Anyway this came yesterday, but I just unboxed it and tested it out and I was happy to see it still on point. I posted some pictures of just screwing around. I dig this device. I like any kickstarter success story, and I love that it's free hand, and that means it doesn't hook up to skynet and tell the robot overlords where I am.3Doodler Create 3D Pen - Latest Edition of the World's First 3D Printing Pen - Ultimate Art Tool & Crafts Pen Kit - With 50 Plastic Strands, No Mess, Non-Toxic (Smoky Blue)
