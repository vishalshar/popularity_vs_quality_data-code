Amazing wifi router worldwide  sim less connection.Easy to.set up. I used in Italy, UAE and USA....worked perfectly, just switch on and after seconds is working  at LTE /4G speed without any hassle of purchasing a local sim card.  GREAT  Connection , accurate indication of the data  used. The battery of the router lasts over 20 hours of continuous use..really amazing. With the package of 1GB worldwide (cost 29.90 Eur or pay as you go at 5 cents a MB or many other options...)  you have a hassle free package working almost everywhere. And you can connect.up to 5  devices at the same time. What to say more....I am  very happy !
