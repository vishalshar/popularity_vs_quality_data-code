A few times while waiting for the mushrooms to sprout I only misted them once a day. After ten days of waiting I saw little shoots forming. Then every day I would check and be amazed. They just kept getting bigger and bigger. Working on sprouting the other side now but so far I am really impressed and the kids love it!
