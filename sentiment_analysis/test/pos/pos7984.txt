I highly recommend this camera strap.  Made from quality material and adjustable length.  I was very skeptical that the bungee design would help with the weight issues of a large camera and long lens setup.  I'm  wrong.  It distributes the weight so that it actually appeared lighter.  Strap is long enough to be able to wear the camera as a side sling, in front or even in back when not in use.
