Great product be it for a fun one-off project, or as the beginning material for a mushroom farm of your own, My recommendation of this product extends beyond the quality of the product itself, but in just how much this company stands behind its products. I have been slowly building up my stock for growing mushrooms for local-area sales business. When I found a lot of these at a local discount grocery chain at an extremely good price I figured realistically that even if half of the boxes turned out to be duds, I was still ahead so I went ahead and purchased everything the store had left on the shelf, After taking home and preparing according to the directions on the box, I set them on the shelves of my grow-room, Wow, have I been amazed at how quickly these guys have produced, and nice large clusters ranging from .25-.5lb per box., I had pinning on over half of the kits within 4 days, and full pinning on the rest within the next week, The only failures I had out of the entire 30 boxes I purchased were 3 kits , which produced a different, fruiting body that I didn't recognize, not only was Back to the Roots extremely courteous and friendly, they were also happy to help and identify the contaminant, they were also kind enough to replace all three kits! This is the part that impresses me the most about this company, just how dedicated they are their product that they stand behind it 100% I would definitely recommend one of these kits as a fun entry into how mushrooms are grown. Once again, a big thank you to the staff and crew at Back to the Roots , for operating how I wish a great many other companies should be conducting their businesses
