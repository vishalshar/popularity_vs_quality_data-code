I have converted all my carcinogenic beauty products natural and healthy ones! Finding a deodorant that WORKED was difficult for me. I have tried Tom's of Maine, Nutri-Biotic, the crystal kind, and MORE with results that lasted just hours. My mom recently ordered Shmidt's and I tried it and was intrigued but not too impressed. I looked it up on Amazon and came across this. The difference is the ingredients are organic and it has coconut oil in it which helps it spread under your pits and is great for many other things too! I ordered it and I swear I will never order another brand again. I have found my perfect natural deodorant that ALSO works as an anti-perspirant which is what I needed most. LOVE!!!!! So grateful for this stuff!
