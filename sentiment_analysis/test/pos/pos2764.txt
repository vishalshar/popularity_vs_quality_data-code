Review is for using with PS4*8/13/2016 Update*Have been using everyday now, turns on and off now with no problems. Very Very happy with these!ok, had been very skeptical about buying these. I have gone thru multiple headset in the last month, hudu or something like that wireless, battery fired no charge, xberia just low sound and short cord, then went with ps4 wireless, battery was fried when I get it, then went with turtle beach stealth 500 p, fit too tight.Right out box I charged till the blue light stayed on. plugged in dongle and went to pair it up. Headset would not turn on. Held button for 1 sec, heard a loud pop, then now power, held the power button again,nada. no power. Me being stubborn I continued to try to figure out  what I was doing wrong. I even sent a email to the support email .Then for some reason I just kept pushing the power button for one second multiple time and it powered up. Re calibrated both by pushing that tiny button. Now its working like a champ.The sound is perfect, actually have to turn it down while playing division. They are a tad bit heavy but they a comfortable. I have asked multiple people that I play online with how the mic sounds, all have said great.I am still having the problem from time to time with the powering on button. Not sure what I'm doing wrong but each time if I mess with it powers up after a few seconds . I can deal what that. Pretty happy with them. Only thing that concerned me was I reached out to the support department the first night and still have not heard back from them. Hopefully this is not a defect that goes south for me
