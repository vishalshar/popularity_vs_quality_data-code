I absolutely adore this mirror! I wanted to buy one for about a year before finally taking the plunge, and I definitely consider it one of my most beneficial purchases! The lighting is amazing and allows you to match and blend your makeup better. The outlets really are so great for using hair tools or charging your phone while you sit at the vanity. The dimmer is a great feature! I was also pleasantly surprised that two extra bulbs came with the mirror. I think it is lightweight but still awesome quality. I'm only a 5'3 small girl but I was able to assemble it and carry it up to my bedroom by myself! Overall AWESOME product my only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner! A must have for any beauty junkie.
