This item arrived far ahead of schedule.  There was no packaging, and the small cushion sticker that sits inside the mount (behind the phone) was not previously applied.  I'm going to assume this is due to the factors of supply and demand.  I was refreshing this listing every 15 minutes in appliance to when the seller said they would have more available.  What can you do..?I've had every style of mount possible.  Cup holder mounts (way too low in eye's view,) dash mounts (I had 3, they either rattled, came undone, or "almost" damaged my dash,) windshield mounts (they ALL fall off eventually,) dash-groove mounts (rattled like a snake,) and varies makers of them.  I've at least spent $150 in car mounts that sit in a box in my closet.  I was over them and just went with resting the phone in my lap.  I can't believe I didn't find this item sooner.Mine is installed in a 2000 GP GT's stock radio.  It fits perfectly, does not rattle, does not block radio controls, and does not prevent the CD in the drive from spinning.  The best fitting car mount -- hands down.My only problem is the cushion sticky that came with mine.  (The thing seen in the picture with the yellow sticker on it.)  It was not perforated enough to remove from the sticker's backing, and I ended up damaging the corner of it when trying to remove it.  I ended up cutting the sticker off the backing.  No big deal, and could of just been my particular item.  Nothing worth not buying this product.I will never buy any other car mount ever again.  This takes the cake.  HIGHLY recommended.  Don't buy any other mount.
