I like this product so much this is actually my second Lumo Lift. I got the first one in December of 2014 and I accidentally washed about six months later! I went on Amazon and ordered a new one right away.I wear it everyday. It is so light I forget I am wearing it until I start slouching haha because it vibrates. Also, the vibration exercises are optional.I originally got it for posture monitoring but I am totally into counting my steps now too. I have an office job and it helped me realize I do not walk enough. I would absolutely say my posture has improved over the last year. Not because the product is magic but because it keeps you aware and helps you achieve your goals. The free app is great and easy to use.I would absolutely recommend. Just remember to take it off before you throw your clothing in the washing machine ;)
