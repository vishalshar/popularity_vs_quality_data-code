The cooler was everything it said it was going to be. The speaker is good quality. It gets loud and has good sound quality. The blender is strong and crushes ice. I bought and returned a used Coolest cooler when it arrived having been used at the beach and had a lot of sand in it. There was sand in the metal hinges that made a gnarling sound when opening the cooler. So I plan to try not to get sand in the hinges when I go to the beach. Maybe I'll put electrical tape over the hinges to keep the sand out. The handle has some wiggle to it but it's no big deal. Wheels are really nice made with real rubber and are quiet when rolling on pavement. The wheels were a major factor in my descision for the purchase. Over all very Cool. The coolest.
