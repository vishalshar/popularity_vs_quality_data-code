Extremely well-built mouse pad.. I've used it daily for gaming for over a year now and there isn't any sign of wear anywhere on it.  This mouse pad is very smooth, which I love. You can blow on my mouse and it'll slide across the mouse pad easily. My mouse also tracks perfectly across it, despite the little sparklies in it. This is a pretty large mouse pad.. it's 15" x 10".. I consider that a plus! Definitely a great product.
