My 8 yr old son was given the starter kit for the 2015 xmas and has spent all his money adding to it. He has about 700 bucks invested and loves his system. I allow him to set up in our living/dinning room to play with friends. Set up and break down is fast.I wish Anki would design special bags to store them in, we currently use the plastic bags they came in, however those are wearinh out.
