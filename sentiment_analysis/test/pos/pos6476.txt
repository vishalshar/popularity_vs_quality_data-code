The is a fantastic games for kids and very playable by adults.  My 6 and 9 year old have played this non-stop for about 3 days and played with many friends.  Rules are pretty straightforward and set up is simple. Shuffle cards, removed boss card Shadow Mage and keep him in criteria are met. Deal 7 cards to each player (2-4 players).  Any gems or coins go into your backpack in front of you ( visible to other players). All treasure chests are placed in the dungeon ( beside the draw pile)  All other initial cards to your hand ( weapons, monsters and thieves).  Drawing from the deck-- one card per turn-- add to your gems and coins or collect swords and shields in your hand.  If a monster is drawn it is played in the dungeon and each player in turn must act on the monster (s) till all are defeated.  This is where the fun bit comes in.... you can use a shield to deflect the monster, scare him away with a bigger monster, cancel him with the same monster from your hand, deal damage with a weapon or pay him off.  When the monster (s) are finally defeated ( same number of weapon points as hearts to the monster(s) )-- whichever player defeated the monster will collect any gems or coins that the monster had been payed by other players.  Treasure chest can be opened with a key only when there are no monsters in the dungeon... When one player has played the last card in his/her hand the Shadow Mage card is brought into the dungeon-- when the Shadow Mage is defeated the game is over and any other monster runs away dropping any loot they were carrying. My kids can't wait for an expansion.
