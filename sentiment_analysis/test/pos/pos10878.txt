It was not terrific trying to connect the first few times. If you have a memory cleaners, a VPN or virus type software, he just won't connect. Disable all of it. His voice has three volume settings, the SDK is in the app (in Python). He certainly is fun for everyone, but the novelty won't last long, the SDK however and the free software updates may make him more usable. I'd like to see a "Cozmo Pro" but only because I want to program him and get slightly better hardware.Frustration from connectivity on 4 different devices aside, Anki really hit a home run. This for every reason imaginable should be the must-have toy of the season.
