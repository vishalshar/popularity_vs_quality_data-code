?????A note from Mrs. L????? I think there is something noble about eating and enjoying something that has the audacity to look like this.Be forewarned gentle reader. The front of the package has an appealing picture of fresh bananas and coconuts.  The product is actually a very dark brown/black squarish/cube.  I am surprised no one posted a picture of the actual food item. I was quite taken aback by its appearance and was genuinely prepared not to like it.Oh. Dear. I loved this stuff. My husband loved it. It has a wonderful taste. An appealing texture. Delicious. Fresh, sweet banana coconut taste. Kind of like a dense sweet moist banana bread bar with a fresh almost tart banana taste.One might be inclined to ask the Almighty to forgive this brown plug for being so unbelievingly UGLY  because it tastes so good!
