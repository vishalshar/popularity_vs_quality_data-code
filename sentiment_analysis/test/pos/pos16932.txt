This seems to work very well and has a much more pleasing form factor than Apple's line of dongles.  I noticed from some other reviews that there were complaints about it getting very hot. How hot? Well no one seems to have shared that information beyond colorful metaphors so I decided to find out for myself. I plugged in the device, plugged in the power, added a microSD card and wrote a script to continuously read and write from the card.  I used an infrared  thermometer with a digital readout to keep an eye on it. It does seem to run a bit on the warm side. After about an hour of continuous use, the surface got to 104°F.  That is pretty warm to the touch though not blazingly hot.  I stopped the script and just let it sit there and the temperature seems to stay right around 104°F. I cannot speak for the experience of other people, but while yes, it does run a little on the warm side, I don't see it as a problem and it is cooler than my current CPU temperature which reads at 177°F. So with that out of the way, how well does it work? Just fine.  I have USB devices plugged into it as well as a microSD card and a full-size SD card. It works like it's supposed to.
