I have been looking for an almond butter to try for the first time and a friend recommended this one. When it first arrived it had some liquid on the top that I could not mix in. It had arrived a few days before I opened it so it was not due to being in the heat during delivery. Since it was the first almond butter I tried I decided to email the company and ask them if this is normal and if I should just pour the liquid off the top. I got a quick response from the company and they recommended I turn it upside down for a day and then it should mix in better. And that did work so I was very pleased with their help. Then I was able to taste it and what I love is the creamy almond taste. I love to eat raw almonds and this butter tasted like it. I have tried it on toast, bagels and as a sandwich on regular bread and it Love it. I also discovered that they sell it at my local grocery store so I am excited to be able to buy it there.
