I've used the GolfPad GPS app with and without the tags, as well as with a Pebble Classic watch. The tags and the app really shine when used with a watch as you really don't need to take your phone out of your pocket at all during the round. The watch provides yardage middle, front, back, hole number and par, and strokes recorded on that hole. Also ability to add strokes, putts or penalties. Just remember to tag before each shot (you'll get used to it), and you're on your way to good stats and course history information.Using the app with no tags is too disruptive as you're always fidgeting with the phone.I prefer aspects of the GolfPadGPS app over Arccos and Game Golf (though I haven't seen the latter with their newest app).One issue mentioned is the durability of the tags. The top cap fits over the stem/base which holds the NFC tag. Right out of the box, I could see that some of the stems weren't seated properly in the caps (they sat at an angle). I added a small dab of silicone on the underside of each tag to prevent separation. I also added a few small dabs of silicone around the head of the tab after screwing them onto the grips. I hope that helps them stay put, and I can slide a knife around them if I need to replace the grips.One star lost in this review because sometimes the phone doesn't register right away when tagged with the club. 2 or 3 times during a round it may not register without additional tries. It's a little finicky in that the club has to be held perpendicular to the phone for the tag to register. I guess that's why they're moving to a new device (instead of a phone) to clip on a belt to be introduced April 2016.*Edit Sept 13/2016 - no problems with the tags staying on the clubs after several months. Wish the technology was more accurate in terms of GPS around the greens as you have to take strokes gained with a grain of salt. Note the new LINK belt reader (that adds iPhone functionality for tags) delayed until early fall.
