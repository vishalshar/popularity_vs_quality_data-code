I purchased this as I have ZERO gardening abilities but really enjoy cooking with fresh herbs.  I also am tired of making trip after trip to the local market to purchase herbs only to have them go bad within a couple days, thus wasting my money and my time.This is SO easy a child could not only operate it but actually be SUCCESSFUL at growing pretty much anything from a seed.I currently have started and successfully transplanted to larger pots the basil that came with the initial system.  It is thriving and such a pleasure to have a renewable source for my love affair with basil.  And it's pretty.  I have this on my kitchen windowsill.  Great size and a great product.I was hesitant to order any other pods initially, I wanted to be sure this system was all it advertised and I'd actually be able to do it with success.  (again, I have no gardening skills)  After successfully growing basil, I branched out to purchase the experimental pods.  I have successfully grown cilantro and rosemary and currently have tomatoes and chilies sprouting.  I have also purchased two more 3-packs of the experimental pods and am really excited to grow even more lovely things.I cannot tell you how pleased I am with this purchase.  It's perfect for someone like me that frequently forgets to water or put in a sunny spot.  I am going to continue to use this system to start my herbs and plants then transplant them to pots I have outfitted with drip systems.  It has truly inspired me to try my hand at gardening, I have had such pleasure in making something grow but in harvesting it to use in my cooking.
