iCracked is definitely on the higher end, they're more expensive but worth the price. Incredibly detailed in their packaging, insuring nothing happens to anything inside. The tools too are of higher quality and that spdgr is a life saver. They even provide a ship label to send the box back. The only thing I was bummed about was putting on that screen protector, which was mentioned to be pre-applied. What did come per-installed was black rubber for the speaker, camera plastic, proximity sensor plastic and that mesh for speaker. It also includes a detailed instruction guide (with photos) and they also have a helpful YouTube video. All 7 features still work on my phone!  I got free same day shipping with prime and less than 24hrs later my screen is fixed.
