I absolutely loved this product .... FOR THE 3 WEEKS IT WORKED.  Thought the batteries had run down ... replaced them. NOTHING. Removed the screw holding the 2 halves together to see if I could see a problem. Too complicated if you don't know the circuitry. So ... as cool as it ... and as much as I liked it ... I would NEVER buy another one. An item this cool, costing about $20 should last more than 3 weeks.Update:Apparently the one I received was defective. The company sent me another one, and it is great. No problems. I really love it. I do recommend this product. It is so cool.
