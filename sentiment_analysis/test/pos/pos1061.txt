Wanted the skinny one to clean out jars, but based on other reviews, decided to pop for the set.  Glad I did.  The little one does fit into small areas to scrape out stuff, the medium one (I'm starting to feel like Goldilocks) works well on batters and mixing, and the spatula also works well.  The material is firm, yet there is flexiblity, and like others, I like that it's all one piece, easy to clean.  Recommend this product.
