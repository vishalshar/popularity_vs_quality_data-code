I thought long and hard about whether to get one of these or not- definitely never, ever imagined electrifying my fence to keep my guys in the yard (two large cats, about 13-14 pounds). One of them kept escaping and it got bad, we're surrounded by coyotes and he easily  would hop our chain link fence and roam around the neighborhood. After careful research of this product I decided to just go ahead and buy it- and I'm so glad I did. We have a 15000 square foot property surrounded by a chain link fence. I installed the product on the fence itself, about a foot high (neck height). It took about four hours with me and a guy that I hired to help me. Then I let him loose- chose not to do the training because of the time and effort required, and mainly because I really did not think my cat would take to being on a leash, I thought it'd do more harm than good. So, I let him out, followed him around the first few times. Kept the level on 2- so it's just a small zap, pretty slight (I tried it myself- didn't like it, but it didn't hurt). He got zapped a few times and ran back to the house, kind of crouched down and stayed there. But after a few days he seemed to be roaming free, very happy. I took the collar off each time he came back in because people had reported rashes, etc. That helped a lot. Also saved battery because I'd turn the collar off each time. After about 4 weeks I started letting him out without the collar, to see if he had been trained so much he didn't need it. Worked only for about 4 days then he escaped, so I'm keeping the collar on.This product has been totally foolproof. Thank you for designing this. I encourage everyone who's considering it to at least try it- it has worked wonders for us, made life so much easier and better for both us and our cat.
