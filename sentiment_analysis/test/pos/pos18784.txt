Awesome product! It fits great on my iPad mini, snug fit with no wiggle space. It's rubber all the way around which is great for my 3 year old who tends to drop it anywhere she lays her head at. I went with a blue and black since it is more gender neutral since I have 2 boys and 2 girls. Really worth it.
