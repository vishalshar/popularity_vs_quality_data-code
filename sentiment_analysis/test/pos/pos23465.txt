Finally! A vitamin I can take that I don't get sick or gag on! I've been trying so many vitamins since my morning sickness started, and literally dreaded taking them. I don't like that there's so much sugar, 11g to be exact, but if it can get me thru my first trimester vitamin wise, I'll take it. Oh I like that there's folate instead of folic acid (I've read we can't process folic acid in a pill but we can process folate, but be sure to do your own homework:)) I'll go back to my regular horse pill vitamins that have 0 sugar once I'm feeling more like myself!
