Pencil by FiftyThree is a fantastic tool to turn your iPad into a mobile digital sketchbook. As an Industrial Designer I use this all the time when I'm on the go and I love it. If you're looking to use your iPad for sketching look no further.I'll start with the great things about this stylus. It's super easy to use, charge, and bring with you. It's durable and it looks great. Over the last few months of fairly heavy use, it still looks great and everything including the tips has held up just fine! It really draws well and doesn't require too much force to activate. Sketching with Pencil on an iPad screen definitely takes some getting used to but that's where the Paper app's two finger rewind (GOD OF A FEATURE) comes in.Having a bluetooth enabled stylus is handy to allow you to use the back of the Pencil as an eraser. This feature alone is worth the price difference between Pencil and whatever other styluses you're considering but wait there's more! Buying Pencil unlocks all the additional tools and features in the Paper app which is really crucial. It's definitely not worth buying another stylus and paying separately to unlock these tools in Paper and I don't know of a better sketching and drawing app for the iPad so I feel like the Paper app and Pencil are a dream team, no brainer if you're looking into a portable and affordable way to sketch digitally!Also I have not seen any slight scratches or any damage to the iPad screen/glass AT ALL using this Pencil.Now here are a few areas for improvement and reasons I gave 4/5 stars, really if I could I would give 4.5/5 stars. The main area of improvement is in polishing up the transition between eraser and drawing. I would say 1 out of every 20 transitions between erasing and drawing malfunctions and I'm either erasing when I want to draw or the opposite. This isn't a critical issue because you can rewind and undo this easily.The only other issue I have is that when drawing for 1-2 hours, the Walnut finish Pencil gets slightly tacky. I'm guessing as it warms up from your hands, maybe some finishing treatment is getting transferred to your fingers. On the Pencil, this goes away as soon as you let it cool down and when you pick it up the next time, it's perfectly fine but the residue stays on your hand until you rub it off or wash them. Just something to mention, even though I love the look of the Walnut Pencil, maybe I'd lean more towards the aluminum version if I were considering the two. (But who knows, the aluminum could have a similar sort of minor issue I wouldn't have normally thought of.)Anyway these very minor future improvements aside, you won't go wrong with the Paper app and Pencil power couple! I really can't recommend it more highly!
