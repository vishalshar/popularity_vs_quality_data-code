Everything about the LucidSound LS30 has been great except for a few things I want to mention.The earpads are not easily replaceable with aftermarket ones. The pleather earpads are glued on to a plastic ring that clips on to the speakers.The only way to replace it is to rip out the earpads and super glue the replacements it to the plastic ring. This would be something I would consider if the pleather starts flaking off. I really hope that LucidSound makes velour earpad replacements similar to Brainwavz.There are 3 EQ settings and I find the default setting to be the best for gaming due being more balanced. The other two EQs (bass and treble) are better suited for music. Overall the sound quality is warm and a little bit more neutral than other headsets that have boomy bass or piercing highs.Mic quality isn't the greatest. I wouldn't recommend it for post commentary for Youtube videos but it is good enough for multiplayer gaming on consoles. I'm still having trouble finding the optimal positioning with the boom mic so that my voice can be heard without hearing my breath.The headset does feel heavier than a normal set of headphones but it is surprisingly comfortable and doesn't feel heavy while wearing it.*Update 9/1/16*Since the earpads are irreplaceable with aftermarket replacements, I used "KORE AVIATION Premium Deluxe Cloth Ear Cover for Pilot Aviation Headset" which wraps around the earpads providing better comfort with long gaming sessions. However, the cloth material is thicker and the fit is baggier which made my ears sit further away from the speakers. Overall the sound quality a bit deminished and muffled. I'm still  hoping a better replacement will come by. I will be back to update my review when that time comes.As for the microphone breath issue, I was able to remedy it with "Cat-Ears Mini Fur Microphone Windscreen (Medium)." The fit of the microphone covering is a little loose and I wish the fit was more snugged. The great thing I love about this cover is that I don't hear my breathy voice anymore. I'm quite amaze at how well this product worked.
