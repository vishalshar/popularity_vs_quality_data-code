Purchased the Bellabeat's Leaf about 3 weeks ago.  I love it! I get lots of compliments on the look. I feel it is accurate with tracking my activity and I like being able add activities the Leaf doesn't pick up on. Seems to be accurate with my sleep patterns.  I wasn't happy with the leather strap it was a bit uncomfortable for me (i have large wrists) so I created my own. I wish it was water resistant so it could stay on during a shower...sometimes I forget to put it back on right away.
