I love the product, and the immediate feedback I get. Sleep is one of those areas where I have tried for years to improve and get better quality rest, but no matter what I try I tend to go back to the same habits. With Eight, having the immediate feedback and data that actually seems consistent with how I "feel" I slept the night before has given me real insights to form better sleeping habits. I've used wrist bands and sleep apps on my phone, but the quality and variety of the data that Eight provides is on a totally different level, as is to be expected from sensors that are imbedded in your sheets. I strongly recommend the product for other people like me who are looking for ways to have healthier and more consistent sleep.
