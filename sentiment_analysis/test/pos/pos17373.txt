It's essential, no, a necessity because most portable batteries for the Surface line of laptops are cumbersome; needing a separate DC cable. This is simple: just pack your regular 65W charger and go because of the AC Outlet. In my testing it's close to 2 full charges before the battery dies, par for the course because the Surface Pro isn't the most efficient and neither is all the energy traveling from this battery but still a great companion for any laptop.
