It was pretty simple to install. Had some errors connecting with the bridge. Had to restart the router and the bridge a few times to connect but, after that it worked fine. We have a large home and we have guests so when I forget to turn the lights off downstairs its a very far walk down a lot of steps to turn them off. Being able to tell siri to turn them off is great. Also being able to turn them on, on your way home is great if its dark and you can't see if someone is dropping you off, etc. Also it has an option to send you a message when you left your lights on when your phone leaves the area of your house.
