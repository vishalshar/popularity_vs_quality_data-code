Awesome little device for swapping tuning on the fly, or quick adjustments before you play. On an electric it doesn't work as well without being plugged in, or running through an amp. This makes it a little tedious to use in noisy situations or if you were playing through headphones and the like. All in all a great little device for someone with multiple guitars and several different tuning requirements across them, but I'd still keep a BOSS TU2 or similar tuner pedal/rack around if you're a more serious player.Tips/Tricks: Doesn't seem to know how to react when your guitar is wildly out of tune. IE: if you're transitioning from E to Drop C you might have to get the 6th string dropped down near the note before the Roadie will engage and behave properly. I have had this issue more often on my 7 string but it's not that big of a deal once you get the hang of it.Possible Con: Now and then it seems to get stuck and not respond until I toggle WIFI off and back on again on my phone. Since it's not doing anything with WIFI this is amusing to me, but that's what seems to get it going when it gets stuck. Now, this could have something to do with my specific version of Android and the fact that it's rooted & rom'd the way that it is but... I figured others might like to know.
