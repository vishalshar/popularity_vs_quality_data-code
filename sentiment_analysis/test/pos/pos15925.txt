I originally wrote a decent review for this but my internet connection drop and I lost it so long story short, this product is awesome and I love the volume that it gave my hair. I have really thick straight hair and with enough hairspray and prep I'm certain that the curls/ waves will hold the whole day. The pics I post is right after I got done with washing my hair. I didn't put anything on my hair nor did I really take the time to put the curls in my hair properly. It was just a quick test run since I've had them about a week and just didn't get around to using them yet.  I bought the purple and blue rolls. Can't wait till my hair grows out again for a better look.
