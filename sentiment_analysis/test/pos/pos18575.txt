I have a dream of leaving the notebook behind and just using my tablet as a note-taking device.  This active stylus looked like the perfect fit, but ended up falling short for note-taking using my devices.  Paired with the right apps and devices this is an excellent active stylus.This active stylus came in an impressive box with a plastic window so you can see the product.  If you are considering this active stylus as a gift the packaging does its job to impress.  Inside the box is the active stylus, a short Micro USB to USB cable, and a user guide.  The user guide mentions a few apps that help use the stylus to its best potential, but I couldn't find most of them on the Google Play store.  I ended up getting Bamboo paper, which seems to be a pretty good app in this category, as many of the other recommended apps in this category didn't seem like very high quality when I tried them.The active stylus looks impressive and has a feeling of both lightness and sturdiness.  If you are looking for a heavier luxury pen weight this might not be the stylus for you.  The grip area feels good with a twisted aluminum body, which is really made by cutting out material.  The whole stylus feels solid and well balanced.  At the top of the stylus is the power button on the pen clip and the Micro USB port that is used for charging the Stylus.  The stylus tip is a hybrid design, it is pretty thin but is also a hard tip.  At first I was somewhat anxious using the stylus with a hard tip on the screens of my devices, but they all have tempered glass screen protectors so I was not worried about scratches but the touchscreen losing sensitivity over time with hard presses.I tested this active stylus with a few devices and apps.  I used this with an LG V10, Samsung Galaxy S5 Active,  Samsung Galaxy S4, and an Asus T-100 Windows 10.1Â” tablet.  I used Bamboo paper, emulated DS games, Chrome, and a handful of other note apps.  I found the stylus tip allowed for smooth motion but the results depend on your device and the apps you are using.  For standard data entry in Chrome, like fill-in bubbles, this stylus was incredibly accurate.  With stylus-dependent DS games on a phone the controls were flawless, with no noticeable skips, jumps, or gaps in inputs.  I had been using another stylus for a while with these games so I had a good feel for what was normal and the controls felt smoother with this stylus.  With note-taking it was another story.  Testing across all devices listed above gave me consistent results, skips and gaps in input transmission with note apps.  The best app during my testing was Bamboo paper, but there still were gaps.  I tested this at first by simply drawing straight lines and seeing not only inconsistent gaps, but equally spaced lines, which would indicate small input transmission gaps.  I tested passive styluses side-by-side and found more consistent, but not perfect, results.  This active stylus did allow me to take neater notes, due to the thin tip, but in taking notes it would miss parts of letters every eight word or so, making me go back and fix it.  The odd exception for this pattern was the Windows handwriting keyboard.  This allows you to write in the words you want and Windows transcribes it into text in a word document, browser, or any other app that accepts keyboard input.  While the Windows transcription is not perfect, and often frustrating, the handwriting using the handwriting keyboard was exceptional, almost perfect.  That shows with the right application the stylus can work very well, even on devices that don't have pricy touchscreen units, the only problem is I have not found a handwriting note-taking app that works as well as the Windows handwriting keyboard.This does not mean this active stylus is completely worthless for taking notes, it simply means it works better when paired with devices and apps that can take advantage of it.  Unfortunately, I could not find the apps on the Google play store that are recommended for this active stylus.  Devices that accept different pressure inputs and have settings for an active stylus will work much better than the average touchscreen device.I had high hopes for this active stylus with my devices for note-taking, but I will still be using this stylus for games and data input.  While it is slower than a keyboard I have found the Windows handwriting keyboard to be more interesting and engaging while entering data.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased opinion.
