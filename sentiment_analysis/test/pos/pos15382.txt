This thing is amazing!!!!  Buy it immediately.  It can fit in the palm of your hand and is as loud as a stereo - no idea how they pulled this off.  For the full on music snobs out there (I'm with you my friends), yes it is a slight bit muffled...but it is half the size of rubics cube!  Great for easy sound outdoors or wherever you need a boost. Love it!
