I got this just in time to put it on my car keys before moving into my new house. We all know how chaotic moving can get and I ended up losing my keys a solid 6 or 7 times over the weekend. Lucky for me I was able to ring the TrackR tag and find my keys pretty quickly each time! I had even knocked them into a sealedup box once and I could still hear it buried beneath all my stuff! Definitely would recommend this for anyone who is prone to setting their keys down all over the place like myself.
