We make air-popped popcorn, and have always added melted no-salt butter to it. When we recently went to see a show at the local theatre, I asked the counter clerk why the popcorn we purchased at the theatre was so light yet flavorful. She got out the product that is added to their popcorn, and it was called a "topping." This is a similar product to what we experience at our local movie theatre. It lightly coat the popped corn, and doesn't fall in a "gooey" mess to the bottom of the bowl. It's made from soybean, sunflower, and canola oil, with natural butter flavor...so we feel it's healthier for our arteries than butter.
