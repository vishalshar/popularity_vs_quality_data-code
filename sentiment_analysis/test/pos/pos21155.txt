I am a foodie. I have no interest in replacing a substantial amount of my meals with Soylent. But I also am absolutely sick and tired of "obligation/chore eating." I feel like every three seconds it's mealtime, and it just makes it impossible to get anything done. When I eat a meal, I want it to be a delicious and wonderful experience, and the reality is that just not every meal can be that way. When I'm just way too busy to properly enjoy a meal, these things work fantastically. Instantaneous, affordable, and suprisingly good tasting (I might liken the taste to vanilla soy milk, but happily without the nasty aftertaste, and a more frothy mouthfeel.) These Soylent drinks are the epitome of convenience, and leave me feeling pleasantly satiated while keeping me alive for a few more hours. What's not to like?
