We had this for about 6 months and are truly satisfied with the feeder. Not only it looks great, but also highly functional.The setup is quite simple and very easy to follow.We just moved and just had to reconnect the feeder to the wifi and all other settings functioned same as before.The tray is easy to clean by simple pull out.It is absolutely adorable to see our cats feeding and playing in front of the camera whenever we are away.We highly recommend the product and feel that it's worth the investment.
