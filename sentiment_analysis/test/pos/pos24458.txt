This mask is very moisturizing and has a light, relaxing scent that smells like aloe and clean linens. I have very dehydrated skin with large pores, so I have been on the hunt for a deeply moisturizing sheet mask (and this might be the one). I used it before bed, after washing my face and exfoliating using a salicylic acid pad, and let it really sink in for about 35 minutes. I did have some slight issues with burning as the serum penetrated my skin, but my face is very sensitive and this is normal for me. I removed the mask and massaged the rest of the serum into my neck and d√©colletage, and went to bed. When I woke up in the morning my face was radiant, and my pores looked smaller because my skin was so plumped and hydrated. I really like this mask and plan on buying more, it did wonders for my dehydrated skin.
