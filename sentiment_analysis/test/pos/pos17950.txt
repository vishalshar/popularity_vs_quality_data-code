I've had the Leaf for about 3 or 4 months, and it has made good choices a habit for me. I wake up to its alarms and sync every morning. It encourages me to push myself at the gym, as I always look forward to checking my progress on it. The weekly reports that get emailed to you are a real treat too! It is a beautiful piece of jewelry. I also love the new updates in the meditations. Now I can use the apps guided meditations or even manually put my own meditations in! Using the menstrual tracker really helps when planning trips/vacations, as I never really kept good track before hand. I couldn't give this product enough stars!
