I have seen a marked improvement in my two year old autistic boy. I have no scientific proof that the Omega 3's were the cause of this but I am hopeful that he continues to improve. There is a marked increase in eye contact, speech, and most enjoyable is the increased tolerance for cuddling. I will take it as a definite improvement.
