I am always hesitant about using extra virgin olive oil with heat. It is usually a waste because it ruins the expensive flavor, or worse, it burns and smokes with anything but a medium low heat.This PURE oil is luscious fatty, with a taste different from olive oil, less peppery but just as silky. But it does not go all Chicago Fire when I want to go from marinade straight to a hot skillet.Flexible, tasty and economical.
