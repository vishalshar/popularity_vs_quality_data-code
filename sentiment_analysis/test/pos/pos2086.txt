I used to drink several cups of coffee a day, a couple of years ago I lowered it to maybe a cup every few days. I used to use your regular coffee maker, but it takes quite a long time to wash all the parts and make the coffee in it, plus you cant really make just one or two cups.French Press in much easier, its perfect for a person like me who doesnt drink too much coffee but also for an avid drinker as you can easily make it over and over again, it literally takes like a minute.The box contains the French Press, two extra filters, manual and a spoon for the coffee. When it comes to these filters, they last for a long time, if you rinse them out after use. Ive had another press for over a year now and so far I never had to change the filter, it looks basically the same as when I first got it.INSTRUCTIONS:boil a desired amount of filtered water, let it sit for one minute. Meanwhile pull out the lid with the filter and use the coffee spoon to put coffee inside the French Press, directly on the bottom. I do one to one and a half spoons per cup (8 ounces, not 4) but thats really a personal preference type thing, some may like it stronger. This is also the only CON that I noticed: there is no markings on the side of the glass so you dont know how many cups you're getting. The listing says its 8 cups, thats 8 very small cups of 4 oz each. 34 ounces would be little over 4 cups for me, with one standard cup being 8 ounces (I have large mugs at home ;).After you let the water sit and cool off for a minute, pour it directly onto the coffee and stir. Then let sit for about 5 minutes, if you let it sit longer, the coffee will be stronger. This is another personal preference thing, you will figure out what you like best after trying it yourself a couple of times.Afterwards place the lid with the filter onto the press and push down slowly, so the filter ends up all the way on the bottom pushing all the grains down along with it. Then you can serve right away (keeping the lid on at all times).How much coffee you make is up to you, you can fill it all the way up or just make one or two cups. You can also make cold coffee with this, although in that case you would have to let it sit several hours.MEASUREMENTS:- 34 ounces of water at max, the press is about 9.5" tall, thats counting the lid- the glass is 3.75" in diameter without the metal basePROS:- decent price (around 26$ at the moment)- well wrapped, comes in a box, can be gifted right away- the glass and all metal parts are nice and shiny, it looks MUCH better than the one I have at home, its also from Amazon and was listed around the same price as this one when I first for it- comes with extra filters and spoon- VERY EASY TO CLEAN, i just rinse it out with warm water and set out to dryCONS:- no "cup" marking on the side- the taste is little different comparing to your regular coffee maker stuff, i got used to it really fast but again, it just depends on what you like
