We are a retired couple who have lived in our rural home for 35 years.  We have always had cats, and we have always let them go outdoors through a cat door.  There is so much to for cats to enjoy outdoors that we just couldn't keep them locked in.  Unfortunately over the years a fair number of our cats disappeared before they reached old age.  A couple were killed on a road a few hundred feet away but we don't know what happened to the others. After our last cat died (of old age) we got two new kittens we decided to shut the cat door and only allow them out during the day when we were home.  Unfortunately they almost immediately decided to wander into the woods.  We knew it was only a matter of time before we would likely loose one or both so we decided to try a PetSafe in  Ground Cat Fence.  We strung out 1000 of fence giving  them access to our lawn and garden areas but not to the woods.  We were somewhat skeptical that it would work but had read may positive reviews. When we tried to put the collar on one of the  six month old kittens it did not like it at all. The kitty jumped and tried to get the collar off and was quite freaked out.  So we bought some little cat collars and for a week we put them on at the door each time they wanted to go out.  We also bought a kitty leash .  That did not got well.  It was just too stressful for the kittens, We immediately decided to forget about trying to use the leash.After about a week of getting used to the regular collar we put the PetSafe collars on and they they didn't even seem to notice. They went running out the door and happily chased bugs. In fairly short order one kitty ventured into the "correction zone" and jumped a foot in the air and came running back toward the house.  This happened two or three time to each kitten.  The kittens did not seem to be particularly distressed after the initial "correction."  We had set the collars at the lowest setting of "2."  After a while we could see them hesitate near the wire where they would be hearing the beep, and then they would stop and head back to the house.  After the first two or three days they seemed to know where not to go and they tend to stick closer to the house.  They wait at the door and let us put their collars on each time they want to go out and we take them off each time they come to the door to ask to come in.  We only let them out when we are home during the day.As others have said, we don't think kittens need to be taught about where the boundary is; they figure it out very quickly,  They don't tend to overrun it as they move pretty slowly when they are exploring and they seem to head back to "home" after a correction.I don't think they need the shock part of the collar any more.  The beep would probably be just fine.  Petsafe should sell a lightweight beep only collar for use once cats are trained.We are very pleased that our cats can play outdoors without constant supervision  or worry that they will wander into the deep woods.
