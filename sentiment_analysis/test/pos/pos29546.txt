I thought this would be for the kids but after we loaded the app and I played my first guitar riff, I was hooked. I had to go plug the iPad in to the home stereo for the full effect. I did eventually let everyone else have turn and now need to order another. There is a wide variety of music styles, my girls gravitated to the pop songs and the movie like sounds. This will be great for a party night, it's almost more fun watching the rockstar moves when people play. I can't wait to show my buddies!
