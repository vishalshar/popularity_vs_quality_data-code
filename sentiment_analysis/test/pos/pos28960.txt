Edit:After a few Google searches, I was able to download an older version of the Amazon Music App.I wanted a small music player to carry around while running or while at the gym.  My solution was to find a small Android phone since it won't be restricted to Apple's itunes.  I previously used an apple 6th Gen iPod.  It was perfect except I couldn't download particular fitness apps.Via WiFi, I downloaded Amazon Music and my fitness apps.  Plugged in a 32G micro SD card, directed the phone to download directly to the card.  Connected my Bluetooth headset. I'm a happy camper.I'm not using this as a phone, so I can't say anything about its cellular capabilities.Yes, the screen is small. Yes, the keyboard is tiny even for my children-sized fingers.  Not trurning this as I originally stated.  I'm planning on keeping this. Oh, and the Pink is neon.It's only day 2 so we shall see where we're at in a month or two.
