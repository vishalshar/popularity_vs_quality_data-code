These are amazing! They smell super yummy and are perfect for packing in your purse or backpack for quick freshening up while camping, festivals, or even going out on a hot summer night.Pros: good, subtle smell, kills bacteria, cute packaging, really convenient, fits in purse or even wallet or pocketCons: Not a big drawback, but it tingles pretty strongly, especially if you've just shaved your armpits. It doesn't hurt though - I guess that's just how you know it's working, killing all the germs!Conclusion: I will be purchasing these again!
