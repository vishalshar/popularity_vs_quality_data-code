I already have a dressy band for my watch and was looking for something rugged and stylish for when I go biking and other activities that would pose danger to my watch.It's perfect, the watch sits in there very securely, the side button works fine, had a problem with the crown knob slipping a little, just had to make it a little tighter at the top.Highly recommended!
