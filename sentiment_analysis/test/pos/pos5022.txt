I...LOVE...this...thing. I got it to use with my Canon 50mm lens (after finding that the majority of similar products do not fit it), and after looking at the instructions (which are VERY clear, precise, probably the best instructions ive ever gotten with any product) I noticed it said "for fitting on the 50mm lens, go to the website". I did, and it showed me very clearly and easily how to attach it to any of my small lenses. the marker board is very useful if your trying to get an exact shot, and it even comes with a counter weight so it doesn't move your focus by itself! This is a genius product in it's simplicity and design, and I've found it to be a very useful addition to my equipment. I would recommend it to anybody who is looking for any sort of follow focus and don't have a shoulder rig or anything to attach an actual follow focus to. It WILL take a second to get the hang of it, but only a second. A+ for this one
