I absolutely love these snacks! I got the peanut butter ones on a whim and became addicted to them.  Can eat a whole bag in a day, if my husband doesn't snag them all first.  I have tried every flavor, the chocolate and peanut butter are my fave.  We also like the original and the coconut, but I like the coated ones more, just because I have a sweet tooth. I'm not a huge banana fan, so me liking these is pretty impressive.  I saw on Barnana's website they have this apple cinnamon flavor and a coffee flavor also.  I have never seen them in stores and really wanted to try them out. The coffee flavor seems impossible to get, but happy to see Amazon had this one.  Pretty sure they are a little over priced on Amazon, but to me it's worth it to try out a new flavor (yes, that's how into them I am).  They are very yummy, plus they are made with Celyon cinnamon, which is "real" cinnamon and it's rarely found.  I heard about that kind of cinnamon from a raw juice shop who swore by it.  Anyways, good stuff. They are a go to snack for me when I get blood sugar lows or hangry and need something ASAP. Om nom nom. P.S these are cube shaped, the coated ones are irregular ball shaped.
