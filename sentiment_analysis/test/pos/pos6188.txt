Purchased this phone for my husband who wanted something small, lightweight with all the features of a larger touch screen.  This little phone is super cool and easy to use. The phone is so light and small you may forget you actually have it in your pocket.  Everything about this phone is small, the text and apps are micro so reading glasses are a must if your sight challenged.  The keypad display is incredibly small so purchasing a micro stylus is helpful unless you have small little fingertips.  The phone is supercool.  All the service attendants at ATT gathered around us, examining it like it was a small foreign object from outer space.  I must give a shout out to Mike at Posh for his Tech support!  Mike, Thanks for helping me!
