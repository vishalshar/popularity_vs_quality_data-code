Well it certainly hasn't made me look younger but I expected that. I ordered a free trial of a cream that was suppose to make me look younger. Well this fee trial ended up costing me over $300.00. Needless to say it was a come on to get mycredit card number. Thanks to the bank my money was returned. Buyers beware of these come ons. I then ordered this Jonre and am very happy with it. It refreshes my face without a greasy feeling. I wear it twice a day to help the dryness of my skin and am pleased with the results. Will buy again when I run out.
