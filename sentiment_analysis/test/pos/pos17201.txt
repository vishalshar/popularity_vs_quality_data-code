Is a very simple to use product and I believe it has the most affordable international data rates available.  I have even researched local sims to use in the two sim slots provided, but the rates they provide are good enough.  The fact that it doubles as a cell phone charger while I do not need it as a hotspot makes it even better.  It is good.  It just works well!
