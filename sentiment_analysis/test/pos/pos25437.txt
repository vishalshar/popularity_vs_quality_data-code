I purchased this system because I didnt want to spend $1,700 for a Sonos set up that has less speakers. It took me as little as 20 minutes to get it set up, but the subwoofer wasn't connecting to the hub. After multiple attempts to fix the issue while on the phone with Rob at Enclave, he kindly shipped me a new system.The new set up has been working quite well for the past 2 weeks and I am using the ARC CEC set up. I have connected an Apple TV and a DVD player.The surround sound is great, also playing music from bluetooth with my phone is good quality and loud enough for a party.CONS:You need your TV on to see what selection you are making on the hub, and if you want to use bluetooth to play music its a bit bothersome.Bluetooth means you can't walk around the house with your phone in your pocket and leave the living room...I wish this was on Wifi like Sonos.The interface isn't fancy.Back speakers lack base and are very faint.Center speaker (hub) gets very loud during a movie when music plays and actors talk. It makes it hard to hear the dialog.All in all, its a good product but there is room for improvement. I would have bought a Sonos if at $1,700 it included two more speakers... However I also wanted to get something different, for the sake of having the next big thing! But the Enclave Cinema system isn't as good as promised.
