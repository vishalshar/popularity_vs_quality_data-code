I was skeptical when I first bought the ThinOPTICS, fearing they wouldn't stay on my face; but once I got used to how to put them on, they stayed admirably put.  I was even more skeptical about the "Lifetime Guarantee", but I shouldn't have been.  When one of the prongs which grip your nose broke off mysteriously, I remembered the Lifetime Guarantee, and made a call to the manufacturer.  Without any fuss, they noted my desire for a replacement pair, didn't ask me to send the original broken pair back, and within a few days: Presto! a brand new pair in the color and strength I had requested.  No fuss in getting the damaged ones replaced: the only requirement was that I'd signed up for the Lifetime Guarantee on the website.  They didn't even make me root around for my original receipt or other proof of purchase, but believed me. Will definitely keep buying their products, having had such good experience so far.
