To be fair, this is a decent case. However, for the money i expected it to be constructed a bit better, as in previous reviews I agree that the flashing is sharp and a bit annoying to hold. I will shave it down soon. I do like the material that it is constructed of. It gives the case a slightly added grip. Also, it fits excellent and seems to be fairly sturdy.I would have given it a 5 star review it it weren't for the flashing on the edges of the case being a bit sharp and not as smooth as one would expect for the money.
