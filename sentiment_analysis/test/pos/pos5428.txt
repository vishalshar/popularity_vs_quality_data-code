I have tried a lot of deodorants, and only two have really worked. Green Tidings and Primal Paste. I switched over from Green Tidings, because it was getting too expensive for the amount it would last. So far Primal pit paste works just as good or better.My arm pits smell nice after a long day. I am very happy I discovered Primal Pit's and love that it's got more varieties. The packaging may not be ideal but nothing goes to waste as opposed to stick deodorants.
