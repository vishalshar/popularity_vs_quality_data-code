Great tape measure, use it all the time!Update 07/11/2015Still a great tape measure but fist one broke. No, I didn't drop it! While I was using it, the end piece fell off and retrackted the tape inside the body rendering it useless! I even tried to fix it. But when I opened it up, all the parts exploded and I coudn't get it back together. I like it so much I bought another one. Hopefully this one will last alot longer than the first. It is a good product but, it is not made very well. If you do drop it even once, it's over!!! Taking one star off for durability.
