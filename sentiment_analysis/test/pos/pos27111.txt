My 14 month old Golden Retriever and 8 year old diabetic Border Collie are thriving on Victor Dog Food!  I found Victor brand while researching for a dog food that was highly rated, affordable, and most importantly good for puppies and diabetic dogs.  Victor's GMO-Free Professional and Hi-Pro Premium (the only two types we have used so far) are for "all life stages" and everyone is happy!
