The pico is the best in terms of holding a charge in comparison with my green eco sun kings, this little guy lasts forever on even an hour charge or in weak lighting, i even saw it charging to my lamps inside?! anyway it stays charged for a good long time and brightness is adjustable , good stuff id get another one of these in the future
