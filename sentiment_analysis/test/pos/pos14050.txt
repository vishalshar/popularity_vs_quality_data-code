Received my 360 system earlier this week and have logged two rounds with it. Overall takeaway - this is a huge step forward from the first generation Arccos, which I love using but definitely has some flaws.The 360 sensors are way smaller (about the diameter of a small ball marker and less than a half-inch high) and lighter (my guess is 6g), and screw in more securely to the top of my clubs. There's also a new process to pair the sensors with my iPhone that's simpler and faster. All together, set up took me about two minutes.Biggest in-play difference versus the original Arccos is the huge reduction in how much editing I have to do. My last round only needed two adjustments, both on short putts. That's compared to eight edits to my shot record during my previous round with the first gen Arccos system.Outside of that, much of the feature set is the same as before, just enhanced a bit. Of those, by far the most useful aspects are the rangefinder GPS which gives me all my distances, the data on how far I really hit my clubs, and the handicap breakdown for each game aspect.
