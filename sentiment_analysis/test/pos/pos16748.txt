Fun game, both kids played under 11yr and understood the concepts.I think there is a lot of scope to make this game more complex as the kids get older. Such as adding in a boom sector where that sector gets double pay and value and bust sector where the sector gets half pay and value.The winner of the game has to have a retirement card, 3M+ and sell all stocks however we had a situation where the winner had retirement card, 3M+ and also had several stocks on hand. This seems like a better option for true retirement where you hold onto the stocks with a 3M+ Cash.Kids loved the game, esp when they get to become a CEO of the company.Two improvements:I think the quality of the paper money could of been better quality.When buying a stock, we we should note down the buy value so we know the profit made when sold. Maybe add in some grid paper so you an track your stock portfolio.
