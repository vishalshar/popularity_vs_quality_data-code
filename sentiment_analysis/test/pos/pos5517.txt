Not all spoons are created equal! I did a lot of research about spoons to transition my breastfed baby to pur√©es and solids and this lived up to all its claims. This company modeled their design while studying a baby's latch while breastfeeding in order to make the transition as smooth as possible. I also love how wide the handle is which makes for an easy grip for feeding a squirming baby. So mama, daddy and baby are all loving this product as we move into this new developmental stage!
