I got this to help manage walking two of my doggie clients at once. One is a small dog and one is a medium sized dog. Both are very active and would get their separate leashes tangled up incessantly. After one use, the dogs were walking together like pros. It took them a few tries to realize they had to work together to go sniff things sometimes and there were a couple of "stand offs" when one wanted to go in the opposite direction of the other, but overall, it was great.One nice thing, as other reviewers mentioned, is that most pulling is redistributed between the dogs themselves, vs. the person holding the leash. That actually seemed to make them more willing to work together to get to where they wanted to go. They do need to learn to wait if the other dog has to stop to pee or something. A few potty stops were rudely interrupted! : ) But I think this will happen in time and I was able to give the "wait" command a few times when I saw this about to happen and that worked well.The product itself seems to be quality, very hardy, and was adjustable to accommodate each dog's height. It's also wide enough that I could grab it near the collar to keep one dog from initiating playtime when we needed to be walking. I was worried it might cut my hand or be hard to hold onto, but it was pretty comfortable. I'll update this review if it disappoints after several uses.Minus one star because it came with minimal instructions on how to adjust it and I had to fiddle with it quite a bit at first. It also has weird "claw clamp" type hooks to attach to the dog collars vs. the standard clips. They may prove to be sturdier than the standard clips, but it's harder to do a "quick release."
