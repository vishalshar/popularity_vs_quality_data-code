I've been using these for one year now and I have some advice on how to make these stay on the ear pods. Warning: I am about to acknowledge that ears produce an oily wax. If this offends &/or disgusts you, read no further. Ok people, ears produce earwax which will eventually cause the ear hoox to slide around and potentially fall off and get lost. I tried cleaning them regularly every couple days, not good enough. I tried applying a small amount of rubber cement to the contact points, no good. The oil dissolves the cement and well...yuck. Finally, it occurred to me I needed to make the surface of the EarPods rougher so the silicone tips would be less likely to slide around. Bingo! Using a bit of 220 grit sandpaper I lightly scuffed the contact areas on the EarPods. Lightly scuffed people! You just want to take the shine off the surface. This works so well that I think the ear hoox should come with a bit of sandpaper and instructions.
