This clip is so much better than I expected. It is enormous and solid and sturdy. I wanted it to  close smallish cat food bags. It is big enough to close much bigger bags. I'd thought that if it were decent, I would order some more to use for bags of lettuce. Much too big for that, need something much wimpier.
