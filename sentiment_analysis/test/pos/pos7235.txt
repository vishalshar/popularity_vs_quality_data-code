They perform as advertised. You've got to keep them clean though. Just grab your jeans with them and use that to rub off whatever's stuck to the tweezers. If they're taken care of, you won't need any other tweezers until you lose these. They'll grab the superfine hairs that others just slip off of, and are quite useful, all told. A bit pricey, but I've had my one set for 4 years now and never had buyer's remorse.
