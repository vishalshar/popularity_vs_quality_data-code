I am updating this review because the company contacted me and has replaced the thermometer. I am giving it 4 stars right now because I really like the product but want to see if the replacement lasts longer than one year.I loved this product but only got about 15 uses out of it before it stopped working. I emailed the company about their warrantee as the product was purchased less than a year ago. The company did not respond so my only recourse is to share this information. I would have given this product 5 stars when it worked but it is too expensive a gadget for less than a years use.
