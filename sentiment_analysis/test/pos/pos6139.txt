I original had a issue with Amazon shipping me the wrong color Fobo Tire Plus, problem came from the warehouse. Since then, I ordered straight from Fobo Tire website with an additional purchase of the Fobo Xtra Sensor for the spare tire. I never really measure the pressure in my tires for many years. Whenever I get my tire rotate at Costco, they add air to the tires. I wanted a TPMS, but most were out of my price range and many didn't have that instant option of letting you know when the pressure is low, until it's too late.Fobo Tire Plus in the other hand uses Bluetooth from your phone. With the Fobo App, you can see instant pressure from all of your tires. You can also set the MIN, RECOMMENDED & MAX tire pressure. I am surprise that the pressure on my spare tire in the trunk of my 2000 Honda Accord increases pretty rapidly. I guess heat builds up in the trunk faster. So far, I like being able to monitor all of my tires & spare tire with just a click on the Fobo App. If your tire pressure is below or above your MIN & MAX settings, it will give you an alert right away.For my 2000 Honda Accord, these are the factory recommend tire pressure settings.Front & Rear = 30 PSISpare = 60 PSIHere are the not so nice things about this. Bluetooth technology only allows the MAX Distance of 30 feet, so you can only monitor it while within that distance. After using it for 2 weeks, I did notice a Battery Low notice on the Front Right Tire Sensor, but it went away. I'm not sure what cause it, but I hope it doesn't come back. If it does I will just replace the battery, but the battery should last 2 yrs.See images attached.
