Bought these for my wife as a gift (not the only gift for the holidays!) We are both coffee lovers. Taste is great - perfect mix of coffee and sugar. You have to like the taste of actual coffee as it tastes like real coffee not a white mocha, two pump skinny vanilla, 2.25 second whip spray with a half-half soy blend iced frappe.Chewables are like a little bliss of coffee candy and happiness in a cube format.
