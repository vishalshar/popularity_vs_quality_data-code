This is a very cool projector which promises to be a great tool for office presentations, as well as for personal entertainment.  It has some limitations, but I think many of those are inherent is its small size.Let me begin by addressing the projectors good points: First, its diminutive size:  Both it and its remote are unbelievably small and light.  You would have no problem going on the road with this projector (and its accompanying remote) or simply carrying it from office to office or from office to home or back.  In fact, if your input will be a micro SD card, the only things youll need to take with you are the projector (with the SD card already inserted) and the remote.  If your input is a computer with an HDMI port, the only additional thing youd need to bring is the included HDMI cord thats included with the projector.  If your input is an iPad or iPhone, the only additional things youll need to bring is the appropriate Apple adaptor and the iPhone or iPad.  No matter how you cut it, this projector is the ultimate in portability! Second, its appearance:  If you like a minimalist design, this projector is beautiful.  It looks sleek, sturdy and professional.  The tripod and bracket that accompany it are also very functional and add to its professional look, as does the projectors remote.  This entire product definitely has a wow factor. Third, the brightness of its projection:  I used this in a completely dark environment (my basement), and then started turning lights on one-by-one.  Even after I turned all the lights on, there was no appreciable wash-out effect.  That is a very big deal if you intend to use this for any sort of business presentations. Fourth, its definition:  As the makers candidly state, this is not a high-definition projector.  But it is plenty sharp enough.  I tried out movies from Netflix streamed from my Roku, as well as PowerPoint presentations from my laptop.  Both appeared sharp, clear and easy on the eyes.  The brightness of the projection obviously helped. Fifth, ease of use:  The projector has a very good menu that appears when you first power it up, but I found you really dont need it for most purposes.  The projector seems to sense what kind of media youre going to project from the connector you use.  So, for example, when you use a micro SD card with movies on it, the screen automatically starts with the file system from the SD card showing the folders where the movies are located and allowing you to select one of them from the remote.  If youre using a Roku, it automatically goes straight to the Roku home screen and you use your Roku remote to pick what youd like to watch, just as if you were watching on your TV.  If youre using your laptop, it exactly mirrors the screen that appears on your laptop  you simply go to the appropriate file you want to see on your laptop and that file will be displayed through the projector. Sixth, input sources available:  This projector gives you the choice of three main input sources  micro SD cards, HDMI connections and HML connections.  With these three options, you can provide input from virtually anything youre likely to want to use  your laptop, your desktop, your Android smartphone or iPhone, your iPad or Android tablet, or your digital camera.  As discussed below, the only limitation to these choices is that, for some of them, youll need to buy additional connectors. Seventh, power source:  This projector can be charged to run off its internal battery or it can also be plugged into an outlet to run off of your homes or offices electrical system.  If you run it off the internal battery, it should last about ninety minutes (which is also the approximate time it takes to charge the battery).  The option of battery operation is a strong plus when you consider the portability of this projector. Now let me turn to some of the projectors limitations: First, input sources available:  I know that Ive already listed this as a good point, but its only fair to point out that there are other projectors out there, including ones much less expensive than this one, that offer addition input sources, including (a) wireless, (b) RCA and (c) VGA.  However, with a projector this small, there are invariably design tradeoffs and, since the sources offered by this projector allow you to access almost any inputs available to you, I dont view this as a drawback.  I just think its something you should be aware of when you make your decision. Second, the lack of a Keystone adjuster:  Some projectors have a separate knob available to make sure that the projected image is set up squarely on the screen.  This projector doesnt have that.  Instead, you just have to make sure that you move it to a position where it is squarely projecting the image on the screen.  Again, because of the projectors small size, I dont view this as a defect, its just something you should be aware of.  Besides, this thing is so small, it should be a snap to get it projecting squarely. Third, its speaker:  This does have to be labeled as an undeniable drawback, although probably a necessary one due to the projectors small size.  For something this size, its pretty amazing they were able to squeeze a speaker of any size into this thing.  They did, but the sound that comes out of it is small and thin.  Two possible fixes for this  (a) if your input source has Bluetooth, then use that input device to stream the audio to a Bluetooth speaker; or (b) hook up an external speaker through the projectors headphone plug. Fourth, lack of included connectors:  If your input device has a full-sized HDMI connector, then the included cable works fine.  But, if you want to connect this to an iPhone or iPad, youll need to buy a special proprietary adapter from Apple; if you want to connect this to an Apple computer using a Thunderbolt connector, youll need to buy a special adapter; if you want to use a Chromecast or Roku, youll need to buy a special adapter; apparently, if you want to connect to certain Samsung devices, you may also need to buy a special adapter.  These adapters work just fine with the included cable and this projector, but just be sure to factor in the price of the necessary adapters when you make your purchase decision. Finally, let me address a few operational considerations: First, if your input is a micro SD card, make sure that you insert the card before you power up the projector.  If you insert the card after the projector has been turned on, it wont read the card. Second, dont forget to hold down the Power button for a few seconds, rather than just pressing it and releasing it.  If you just press and release, the blue light will come on, leading you to believe that the projector has been turned on, but nothing else will happen.  You need to press and hold it for a few seconds for it to really turn on. Third, the remote does have to be aimed at the back of the projector to work properly.  If its off to the side or to the front, it wont work at all.  Speaking of the remote, dont lose it  the only thing you can do with the projector alone is to turn if on and off. Fourth, I would recommend buying a carrying case of some sort for this.  It doesnt come with its own case and there are a lot of fiddly little parts that come with it.  Having a small case to carry them in will help ensure you dont lose any of them. Wrapping up, this is truly a wonderful projector for both business and household use.  I would give it six stars if I could. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
