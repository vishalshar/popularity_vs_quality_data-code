This is my review of the HICKIES One Size Fits All Elastic No-Tie Shoelaces in Charcoal.These are my absolute favorite item for shoes ever. I don't remember how I came across them but I have not stopped wearing them in what feels like 10 years.Who on Earth wants to tie their shoes, and continue to do so every tie they come undone. Also, you have to keep adjusting the tightness which is a huge pain. If they're too long you need to double tie, which is impossible to get out, and if they're too short, it's too hard to tie.My old Nike's had a pink pair and they lasted for years. Each pack does come with a few replacements just in case. There are also explanations for the different ways that you can wear these, in case you want them tighter, looser, or just different. I wear them plain, so they slip on gloriously but I can absolutely run in them no problem. This is my second pair for my new shoes, and I will also be buying a teal pair.I'll never wear laces again.I strive to be as honest and thorough as possible when reviewing products online because I know when I shop online, I rely heavily on real-life reviews and real-life photos.
