Randomly found these St our grocery store and my toddler and I devoured them in a matter of minutes. Was excited to see that Amazon carried them. I have a box delivered every other mo. Organic, healthy, great cinnamon taste... What more can you ask for? And I love that they have a crunch! It's like eating a chip without all the guilt!
