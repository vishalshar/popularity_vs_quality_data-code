I wasn't sure what to expect based on some of the negative reviews here, but I wanted to give it a try anyway.  We followed the directions exactly (which are very easy) and within three days had tiny mushroom growth.  By day 5 they have almost overtaken the entire box and it will be time to harvest soon.  They are growing so fast, you can see differences within just hours.  It's crazy.  Perhaps it's the warmth here (summer in CA) or the particular spot by the window, who knows but I have to give this product five stars based on my experience.  Apparently, once you harvest this growth, you can turn it over and do it again on the back side.  This has been well worth the price, and even my non-mushroom loving kid has been interested in this.  Can't wait to add them to dinner. :)  I've been taking daily photos, and hoping to add them in...
