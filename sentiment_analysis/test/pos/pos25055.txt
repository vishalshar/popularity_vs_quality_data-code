My life will never be the same!  I think this is the best thing since.......the invention of indoor cats!  I got a kitten for the first time in about 10 years.  After about 3 weeks I realized, it is going to be a l-o-n-g 21 years?!  I am so not a litter box person any more!  Voila!  This extraordinary invention!  The ONLY reason it gets 4 stars, not 5 is the cost.  We are paying for convenience - and paying through the nose!
