I just got this today after a friend recommended it. It took 2 days to get to me, and in those two days, i washed my pits with baking soda to prep them for the ingredients in the deoderant. I also stopped using conventional deoderant, so yeah, i went 2 days with no deoderant. lol. As soon as it got here, I put it on and left the house. Tennessee is 2 degrees shy of Satans Sunroom right now, so I figured if I was going to try this, now is a good time. Its a really small little jar, only 2 oz, but you don't need much. It came with a cute little popsicle stick for application. I got the patchouli flavor (I love patchouli) and the scent is fresh and not overbearing. You really have to be careful with patchouli because it can be a bit much, but this has a good amount- not too much. I have been sweating all day, but there hasnt been any smell, just sweat. I can deal with sweat. I really like this stuff so far, and I'll update in a few weeks if I notice anything crazy. :)Update 7-4-2016:After a week or so, my underarms started to get a little irritated and red, so I discontinued use. I'm going to let my skin rest a few weeks and try again. I don't want to waste this stuff, or give up on it. I still love the product, so I'm not going to change my rating. Also, I'd like to note that I have really weird skin anyway, so I was almost expecting this to have a little bit of a bad reaction. And by weird skin, I mean I have red hair and stuff like band aid adhesive breaks me out. :D
