Purchased for my 10 year old daughter, she loves the idea of building her own minecraft style computer.  Although some of the parts required adult assistance (screw holes to small for the average pre-teen) she enjoys the ability to learn about the computer while building it.  The blueprints were an awesome idea but next time include a few more written instructions for the younger kids who can't follow the pictures as well as an older child.
