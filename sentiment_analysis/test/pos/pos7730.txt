Great gift!  A little smaller than I had expected--considering the cost.  However, my son plays with it constantly.  My only complaint is that the app that goes along with it is not available on some of the older Galaxy tablets--like his Galaxy 3.  I recommend parents check out this part before purchasing to make sure it is compatible with your device.
