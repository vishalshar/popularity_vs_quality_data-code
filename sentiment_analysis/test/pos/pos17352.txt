As a Frenchie who buys lots of cheeses, I can attest these bags are really worth getting.  If you keep your imported cheeses in the plastic wrapping they come in, or in a ziplock bag, they are likely to become moldy thus you wind up throwing them or cutting off the gross parts, a waste either way..  If you want to extend their life, just store them in these cheese bags once opened - you can reuse the same bag several times and it make a yuuge difference.  The material BTW is the same as what cheese mongers or butchers use in France to wrap charcuterie and cheese in - looks like paper with the inside waxed.  No closure, just roll the top, it's not meant to be a hermetic seal as they need to breathe.
