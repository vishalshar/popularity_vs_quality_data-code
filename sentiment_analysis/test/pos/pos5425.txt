We are currently testing the Cassia Hub for an industrial/enterprise solution for our product.  Initial tests have returned positive results.  While we did not get the range that we were hoping, as our use case was unique being that we had additional physical barriers to read our Bluetooth devices.  The SDK provided an easy way for us to communicate with our servers and the company support has been outstanding.The only issue out of the box was a challenge connecting the device to the Wifi network through the app on my phone.  I would like to see an improvement with the help section on the app and a more flushed out step by step guide on the app as well.
