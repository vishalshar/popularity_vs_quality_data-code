I am very happy with my purchase of the Asus. I think you will be hard-pressed to find a better-equipped computer for the money. True that there are small things you could pick pick on, the monitor resolution but I'm definitely not complaining for what I paid for it. The single biggest upgrade you can make to a computer is a solid state hard drive the speed is phenomenal. The computer boots from off to Totally Running programs in about 30 to 35 seconds... Boom! Love it
