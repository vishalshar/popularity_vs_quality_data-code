I purchased this for son's Christmas gift. I was hoping to try it out and if it worked well buy (through a grant) a set for use at the elementary school where I work as a librarian.The pieces will not stay on the mounting board. We are trying to create the draw bot. The arm piece will not mount at all. Also the other pieces of the circuit come off of the board all the time. Very frustrating. I will not be investing grant money in this project for our school.This is a follow up to this review:I cannot say enough great things about my experience with this company. After reporting the issues I had with the mounting board to the support site, I was contacted by a rep. They made it super easy to return the bad mounting boards (although it was clearly stated that it I only had to return them if I wanted to as a favor to the company so they could see for themselves what the issue was). Before I even returned the boards, I received a box with brand new, redesigned mounting boards! I am over-the-moon happy. We were so excited about this product because it looked like so much fun. Thank you littleBits for making it right!
