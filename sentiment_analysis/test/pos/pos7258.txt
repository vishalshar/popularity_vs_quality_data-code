I have a westie so she's not big enough to destroy it, but I wouldn't recommend it for bigger dogs who are rough with there toys. I can defectively see a large dog breaking this with just a few hard bites.  Controls took a couple of days getting use to but it's a lot of fun to play with even without the dog. I got the cover also since I don't want to scratch up my wood floors and my pricey ball. Although it might rip putting it on, but amazon is the best when it comes to replacements.UPDATE 12/8/15I've had this device for about 4 months now and it's still running. I'm really surprised it hasn't cracked by now after all the drops it's gone though. I've lost count. I do like the nubby cover but I feel like it causes the ball to lose some speed making it difficult to interact with my dog. But I'm sure it's helping sphero stay safe. I've uploaded a video of how rough my dog plays with sphero. Though I would never give this to a larger dog that would put some bite into this toy. It has only bugged out once, but I believe the bug was not due to the dog but while I was going though the tricks sphero could do it just stopped moving like the mechanics inside just froze up, though putting it back on the charging station fixed it up. I have not been able to re create this error.
