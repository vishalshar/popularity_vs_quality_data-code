Our son has been taking these vitamins now for over a year.  He still loves the taste of them and I love what isn't in them!It is difficult to find children's vitamins without artificial flavors, colors, and corn syrup that actually taste good.  I know they taste good because I just had to try them.  They are very soft, easy to chew, great flavor with just enough sweetness without being too overly sweet.  These vitamins also stay soft for a couple months if you don't use them up right away.Just a couple notes:*These vitamins do contain organic cane sugar*Daily serving is 4 vitamins so a bottle should last a monthI also love that they are on the subscribe and save program so I don't have to worry about running out!
