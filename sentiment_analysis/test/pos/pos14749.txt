I'm going to put where I get my FAA information to the bottom as I'm paranoid about getting in trouble. The plane is very stable. I have experience with RC airplanes and have only owned a little hubsan drone. This thing is rock steady compared to anything I've ever flown. Simply charge, download app, plug in android phone and off you go. I've used Autel's live chat on their website to ask questions and it has been quick and easy. The case is great. The big difference between the premium and regular x-star...Premium comes with case, connects to the airplane with Micro USB to USB rather than wifi, allowing the phone to access internet and live download maps, increased range.Now to the FAA hobby done rules - TL:DR, register yourself as a drone pilot, put your same number on all your hobby drones. Know the airports around you and use common sense near hospitals with helicopters. If you do something stupid and get in the way of an airplane/helicopter or cause significant property damage/bodily harm, expect to get in trouble.Two best websites 1) Airmaps.com 2) [skyvector dot com ] When you start flying, if you go to the FAA website, it will tell you to download the "KnowB4ufly" app. There are a few competing apps (hover and UAV forecast which I like). The app will check your GPS and tell you if its ok to fly. The confusion comes because the FAA app will list every single small private airport/runway as well as Helipads. When you review the website it doesn't mention much about recreational use and helipads/tiny airports. There are hospitals all around me and if you have to keep 5 miles then I'd have to drive 30 miles just to put the drone in the air. Reviewing the FAA news and updates from March 29th shows the actual rule but that is for 333 pilots and future 107 pilots. Airmaps thankfully has summarized in an infographic If you are within the specified distance from an airport, you are required to notify them of your intentions. Calling numbers from google searches didn't get me very far. Now in conjunction with the airmaps, you can use skyvector find every airport and registered helipad near you and find out if they have instrument procedures, a control tower, as well as who to contact with a better number than google search.  Airmaps.com also has numbers listed for each airport but there is a bug in the website as the number is for the regional control tower (e.g Most of North and East Texas routes you the Alliance airport which is incorrect. You need to contact the local person/tower.
