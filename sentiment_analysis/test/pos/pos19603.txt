I'm extremely impressed for the price. I'll describe what I like about this phone and then I'll describe where I'm coming from so that a reader may judge the relevancy of my review.The screen is crisp, the buttons easy and intuitive. It is responsive. It is loud and clear. I am happy with the camera. I've not yet played with the video recorder. They stock keypad is accurate both hen pecking and swyping. The reception - wow. None of my past or any of my families current phones have had reception like this. The styling is unique; I think a person will either love it or hate it. I like it. It fits well in my hand.Where am I coming from? For reception I'm comparing against a OnePlus One, Meizu M2 Note, Kindle Fire Phone, LG K10, Blu R1 HD.I myself most recently used an LG K10 short term after breaking my OnePlus One. The LG was lousy, but for an entry level phone I guess it was acceptable. The Robin is no OnePlus, however, the only things I really am missing from my OnePlus are multi color notification lights and double tap to open. Considering even a used OnePlus well exceeds the cost of the Robin I'm not complaining...and so far I have far fewer quirks.
