I have a lab mix that had a large wart show up on his mouth one day. Turns out he had CPV. The vet basically told us that we had limited options and that they could remove it at a large cost, but it could come back. They did mention that's it's and immune issue. So, we did some research and decided to go ahead and try this. We figured it couldn't hurt and loved the fact that it was organic. Well, the next day it had already started shrinking and a week later it was completely gone! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for an immune boost for their dogs. After the positive results we tried it on our beagle dachshund mix because she has a number of skin issues including hot spots. Once again it was like a miracle worker! She stopped itching as much and her main hot spot on her back cleared up! I swear my dogs seem like they have never been happier. I would absolutely recommend this!
