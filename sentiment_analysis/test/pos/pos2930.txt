Overall, I am extremely pleased with this purchase. One of my favorite things to do nowadays is go out to a bar with my husband and turn the Petzi cam on, enjoying my dog's company remotely with a margarita in hand. Our dog, Yukon, appreciates the treats this little contraption shoots out.For treats, we useÂ Milk-Bone Mini's Flavor Dog Treats, 15-Ounce. They function perfectly with the Petzi.The only thing is my dog finds me annoying when I am bothering him all the time while he sleeps. Sometimes he leaves the camera frame when I keep him awake. :) So sometimes I just turn it on because I miss him.Basically, if you're a semi-crazy pet parent like me, you will love this and wonder how you lived without it.
