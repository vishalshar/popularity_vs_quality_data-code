These cookies have plenty of chewy coconut. I was served them during a flight.I believe this box held 11 cookies, though I have finished the box already., and cannot confirm the count. These are not sold in stores in my area, and I found the Amazon price quite competitive with ordering directly from the company.  The cookies arrived fresh and were as good asthe smaller bite size ones I had been served on the plane.
