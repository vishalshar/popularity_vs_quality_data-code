I was looking for a good way to mount my iphone 6 on my Stumpjumper and this Quad Lock mount worked GREAT!  It is so simple and effective.  It keeps my phone locked in and secure on the mountain bike trails.  I also ordered Quad Lock case for my iphone for the extra shock protection.  It's a bit pricey but it's worth it knowing that my phone is secure and I am able to take advantage of apps like Strava to track my trail rides.
