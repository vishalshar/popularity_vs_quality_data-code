I love the PebbleBee Honey. I mostly use it as a tracker for my puppy who tends to be curious. With the Pebblebee I can keep track of where she is and it gives me piece of mind knowing that if she were to ever get lost I can find her easier. The sound and light alerts are super helpful too, especially when she is outside in the dark. Great product!
