This kit is excellent. The utensils are tough, easy to clean, and nicely sized. The case feels a bit big, but that's not a problem, really -- it means the utensils aren't compressed together. The case is quite sturdy and latches securely, and all of the utensils stay in place very well. The tip of the knife is perfectly sized for cleaning out the corners of tuna packets (important when you're out on the trail!), and the toothpick is a fantastic little luxury.
