I am loving my Misfit Ray.  I have had for a few months.  It is lightweight and looks like a bracelet.  Most of the time people don't even know I am wearing a fitness tracker.  It is also very durable.  I have dropped it several times and scraped it against various surfaces and it is still in perfect condition.
