GO! Outfitters Camping Hammock with Built-in Mosquito Net, GrayThis review is for the GO! Hammock with the integrated mosquito netting. This is an awesome product! This hammock has some features of some other much more expensive brands. I have tried other hammocks with the netting, my latest being the Hammock Bliss Skybed bug free, I can say with extreme enthusiasm that the GO Hammock is undoubtedly more comfortable! Lets expand on how comfortable this thing is. The material used in the GO Hammock is very soft parachute nylon, not ripstop, so it feels amazingly soft. I prefer the parachute nylon over the rip stop just for how it feels. The rip stop almost feels rough to me. This was an important factor for me when looking for a hammock. It's worth a little extra weight for me. Next, is the length. At 11 feet it is not a lightweight, but again, its all about comfort. The extra length and width gives you much more room to find just the right position for you. Then to finish off the system there is a fixed ridgeline included with the hammock. I prefer a ridgeline to get the perfect sag to flatten out the lie, and this does the job perfectly.Now on to the integrated bug net. The netting is a very tough no-see-um netting, very fine mesh. The netting is attached very well, triple stitched I believe. All the loops on the netting are made from the same mesh. This stuff is tough so don't worry about it ripping. Along the topthere are guide loops on the outside and inside of the netting for you to run the ridgeline on the outside or inside. There are tiny grommets on either end to allow the ridgeline to run inside the netting.Around the sides there are additional loops for the included shock cord pullouts and aluminum stakes to get the netting off your face and manage some of the extra hammock material. Again, increasing the comfort. *COOL FEATURE ALERT* Now, I don't know if they intended this to happen when the folks at GO! designed this hammock, but when I set my pullouts, a small shelf was created. This is cool because the Warbonnet Black Bird is the only hammock I have see that has a shelf. Now I have a shelf for $200 less than a WBB!! I'm very excited about this! So cool. Way to go guys!!Okay now that I have talked about how great this hammock is there are 2 things I wish they would tweek.1.) A better zipper. A larger toothed zipper that maybe went an extra 12 inches longer would be awesome. I feel the quality of the zipper is lacking, sorry.2.) I wish the grommet that allows the ridgeline to go inside the netting was a little larger. This is not a huge deal, but it is not easy to get the ridgeline inside.Thats it. Thats all I have to complain about. This hammock is almost perfect for me. I will include some pictures to show some of the stuff I was talking about. One thing you may notice is I swapped out the factory suspension for whoopie slings, I spliced them myself. Other than that everything you see is stock. I am so pleased with this hammock I can't wait to try out the Apex tarp. I'm excited about all the attachment points! Maybe the guys at GO! can send me one to test out and write a review. Who knows?? (Thats what I call a Garth Brooks hint, Shameless.)Anyway, if you have any doubts about getting this hammock, put it to bed and get this hammock! You won't regret it.
