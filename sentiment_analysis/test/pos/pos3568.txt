I'll begin by saying I work in IT but by no means a networking or hardware expert.  I have enough knowledge to get me in trouble but not always enough to fix the problems I create.  The Luma replaced my Linksys AC1900 which I've had for about a year.  My house is 2 stories with about 3000 sq feet and then another 1000 or so in the basement.  I placed a Pod on each floor as we have devices streaming on each floor.  We have pretty basic needs and mostly streaming and internet traffic.First visual impressions:When it arrived from amazon (thank you one day shipping) and unpacked it, I was impressed with the minimalistic packaging and materials.  Everything was securely packed and nothing was damaged.  The pods were a nice size and a welcome change to my bulkier existing router.  My cable modem is located in my family room and the pods are more aesthetically pleasing than something with a bunch of antennas on it.Setup:I'm not sure how setup could be easier.  I simply downloaded the app as instructed and it walked me through the setup of each pod.  It told me where to place each pod on each floor for optimal coverage.  Each pod took me maybe 5 minutes to set up which was mostly the pods registering with each other.  On the primary pod that is plugged into my cable modem, I plugged in a hub I use for a NAS, VOIP and some other hardwired devices I need in my office.  I had zero connectivity issues with any of the devices.  With my Linksys, I had periodic connectivity issues which I suspected was the router and this confirmed that.ConnectingNo issues connecting to the network.  Simple and easy.  Also the app connects directly to the pods and creates the mesh network.  Again, very, very easy setup.Performance:Performance is a big deal particularly because we stream everything in our house.  We don't have cable so we rely heavily on Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, etc.  After I first installed I went to each floor and ran a speed test.  We pay for a 30mb connection and as you can see in the pictures I was clocking in around 35-37mb on every floor.  Very impressive given I maxed out at 20mb 10 feet from the old router and around 10mb on the second floor.  I've tried extenders as well and still never came close to the coverage and speeds of the Luma.To further test the performance, I decided to do a test using multiple TV's.  I started a stream on each floor.  There were was only a slight delay when starting the seconds and third TVs but the stream were running fine with no buffering.  I then did a speed test again while all three were running and I was clocking in at 2.8mb download (see picture).  When I stopped one of the TVs it went up to 5.7mb and then up to 9.7mb after I stopped the 2 TV.  Not the most scientific test but you get the idea.  I did do one other test while streaming 2 TVs on the second floor and had similar results.Parental Controls:Parental controls and their claim ease of use was a big draw for me as we have two children ages 7 and 9 who are getting more and more active on the internet.  Setting up users and assign their related devices was very easy to do on the apps.  I like the concept of being able to set the rating by user but haven't fully tested this feature.  I will need to do over time.  I wish there was an option to put the parental controls at the device level.  Maybe I'm missing something but I don't see how I can do that.  It probably doesn't matter too much because you just set it at the user level and then applies to the device.  You would need some type of authentication mechanism at the device level to make this more robust but that would be more of a pain to manage.  Overall like other features it's easy to use for the networking novice.SecurityI haven't fully tested or experienced the integrated security features of the router and will need to be one of those things that I monitor over time.  It's nice to see which devices could be accessing suspicious websites and shows up on the app for you to monitor.  I'm thinking this will definitely come in handy as the kids get a little more curious.  The router also has a guest network feature which is nice and I will definitely use in the future.Overall:It's a nice router with some nice features.  If you're looking for something super simple to set up with great performance, I would highly recommend it.
