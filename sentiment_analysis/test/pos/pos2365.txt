This little guy paid for itself in less than 1 week! Purchased it after I saw a professional mold company use a thermal camera to find water leaks in the basement of my rental property. As I was playing with it after it arrived it found another leak from my dishwasher! Picture quality isn't nearly as good as what the pros use, but functionality is perfect. If you own rentals or do real estate flips... you need to own then camera!
