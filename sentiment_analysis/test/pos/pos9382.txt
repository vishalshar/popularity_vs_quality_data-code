I'm pretty happy with Petcube. It was great to be able to see my cat while I was on holidays. I had no problem connecting to wi-fi and set up. Customer service was helpful when trying to solve some "ghost" images, just a reflection of light from the windows. They do work on improvements...Things to improve: a longer cord would be great, including world-wide plugs. Also, I am getting feedback on my phone when I try to talk. So, can't really hear what's happening at home.
