An all-around great soap...even though I've only had the soap for a few weeks, it is substantial and will last quite a long time (if properly stored and not left sitting in water for too long!). Makes a nice lather, and feels like it is really cleansing your skin. My skin felt a little tight after using, but not in a bad or uncomfortable way. Also felt moisturizing and I am not put off by the smell of the very mild grapefruit odor the soap has. I don't feel it is unpleasant as other reviewers have posted, but that is an entirely personal viewpoint. Will continue using the soap and hope for the best. I love that it is made entirely of organic ingredients and is made in the USA. I don't mind spending the money on this soap, although if I had my way, it would be $1 or $2 cheaper, but that is just being picky.
