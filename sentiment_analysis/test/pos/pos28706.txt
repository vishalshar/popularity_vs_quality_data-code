Honestly great so far. If you follow the directions on the box charge them and update them they'll work great. The fit isn't awesome but I think that's because I have really small ears so they're just a tad bit big. I am really impressed with the sound quality so far and have had zero issues with their Bluetooth. I would like to see them include lifting as an option for activities but that's really my only complaint.
