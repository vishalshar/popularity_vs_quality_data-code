In the past, I always had a tendency to use way to much detergent. The GrabGreen Laundry packs has not only helped me portion out the correct amount but saves me money. I have been using this product for several months and can't be happier. I have a standard washer, not a HE machine. It suggests that you use two packs for a large load, and one for a small load. I have never found it necessary to use more than one, even with clothes that are soiled. I cannot speak to the effectiveness of this product for stains from children, we are two adults who aren't messy. There is no scent, and hasn't caused any issues with skin allergies. The product arrived with no damaged packs and was packaged well. It sits on the shelf in the laundry room perfectly. Make sure that you turn on the machine and then add the pod, allowing it to partially dissolve before adding your laundry, otherwise it doesn't seem as effective.
