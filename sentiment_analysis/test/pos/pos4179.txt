I was looking for a battery that would make my laptop last longer. The laptop battery only lasts like 2 or 3 hours. I took this to work to see how long the laptop would stay on without going into sleep/hibernation mode (except for turning off the LCD). I have managed to get through an 8 hour shift with the portable battery giving enough power to the laptop so that, when the portable battery shut itself off, the laptop was able to run an additional 3 hours off of it's own battery. I believe the laptop was at 50-60% battery power when I checked on it.This have been almost 3 weeks since I purchased the battery. Usually, using it like this, if there was an issue, it should fail about now. It hasn't.
