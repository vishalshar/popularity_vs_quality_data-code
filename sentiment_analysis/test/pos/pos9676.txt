I  have actually purchased two of these units and i am pretty happy with them. i am an original kickstarter supporter and i purchased a second unit based on my experience with the first unit. first of all i love the form factor of the charger as it nicely fits behind my ipad in my backpack. i am used to carrying around various bricks, tubes, and rectangular batteries all of which somehow do not nicely fit in a backpack or briefcase. this charger on the other hand is almost an extension of the ipad and does not take up a lot of space in my various bags. the solar panel itself is actually large enough to provide a reasonable charge and seems to do a good job in direct sunlight. while this is supposed to be a 13,000 ma battery my personal experience is that it does not have enough capacity to actually provide a full charge to my ipad which is supposed to be about 12000 ma. also the 5 watt panel if it was 100 % efficient would require 8 hours of solid sunlight to actually provide enough charge for the ipad. that said the panel is useful for maintaining a full charge on the battery so that it is ready to go when needed. the charger is beautifully designed and it is clear a lot of effort went into producing a nice product. if you are looking for something that will allow you use the sun to help provide a boost to your battery backup and a great form factor then this is a good product, just do not expect to go off the grid with it!
