With no display, it is the ultimate passive monitoring device for the minimalist human. And so, the battery depletes in 5-7 days depending on how many times you extract data from it via bluetooth. BETTER YET, it charges from 0-100% in a little over an hour.Amazfit tracker is VERY sleek, virtually scratch resistant, and waterproof up to 3 meters (Stanadard IP68). It goes were you go, and with any outfit.I have worn it both on my wrist and neck for comparison and it tracks very well in both settings,though I sleep with it on my wrist for more precision.The app is pretty good.. You can set alarms at which the device promptly vibrates, it can notify you when your phone rings, and to stop the vibrations, just tap the device. It gives you activity and sleep recommendations and gives you a daily percentile against other users.Simply put,I love this thing.
