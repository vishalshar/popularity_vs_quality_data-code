Gave this to our grandson for his 7th birthday. He loves it, as do two of his younger brothers. I was thrilled to find a toy that kids have to use their imagination instead of a toy that comes with instructions for what it builds. Also you don't have to buy any accessories;  all you have to do is save the tubes from toilet paper, paper towels and even wrapping paper. Ultimate recycling.
