This speaker is pretty damn cool. Sleek design, 360-degree sound, Bluetooth AND WiFi connectivity and great sound. I'd been considering another brand of wireless speaker until I heard this one. Easy to connect to either my laptop or my phone and so far no connectivity issues (scratchy sound, dead spots in my apartment, etc) that I've experienced with inexpensive wireless speakers. I like that it shuts itself off after a period of time (great for saving battery life when I forget). Still playing around with the radio stations (available through WiFi).
