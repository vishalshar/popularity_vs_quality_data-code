I'm a 13 year career techie who was millimeters from becoming a flip phone guy again.Unlocked hardware with respectable specs, stock Android with no carrier / manufacturer / "random brother-in-law of a major stockholder" bloatware to eat up processing power, crisp, clean design in both HW and SW, and finally, FINALLY a stake through the heart of the "Insufficient Space" glitch that Google should be ashamed still exists...  Wow.I was a bit skeptical, having been burned by other HW in this price range, but after a month behind the wheel, I'd buy it again at twice the price.
