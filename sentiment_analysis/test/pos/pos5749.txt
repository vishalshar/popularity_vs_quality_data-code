First of all, let me say that I love the design as far as rolling over small rocks,twigs, etc. makes it worth the price right there. However, there are some discrepancies between statements on the website and my experience.The wheels are pretty smooth, but not completely. When riding on some smooth polished concrete,there was a definite "hum" coming from them, which coincided with the vibration I was feeling through the deck. Not a huge deal, but it is a performance hit on a very smooth surface. One kick didn't roll me as far as one kick on orangutangs.Sliding vs grip:It has been raining or just rained each chance I got to ride over the past two weeks, and the first slide I attempted landed me flat on my ass on wet pavement.  I half expected that.On dry pavement, taking a curve at the end of a slope, I felt the wheels begin to break away at the apex of my turn, without me pushing the rear into a slide.  That surprised me. I adjusted just a bit and they grabbed again, so disaster averted.I'm not very confident yet at sliding, so I haven't tried to intentionally slide again.Wear:  about two weeks and they seem to be wearing evenly, but rapidly. I'll post a pic what they look like.
