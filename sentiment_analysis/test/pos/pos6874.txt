It seems completely unfair to rate a product based on its price tag.  Primarily because if you are rating a product you already own, you knew the cost before you purchased it!littleBits are truly worth every red cent.  In today's educational system kids are taught to learn what is on a test.  littleBits teach you to be innovative, creative, and allow you to think logically to make whatever you want.  This is a product that allows even the intellectually inferior to shine!  I have over 250 bits and use them in an after school program.  Not a single bit has ever become damaged  and no one has ever been bored!To compare littleBits to snap circuits is like comparing monkeys to carrots.  No comparison whatsoever.  Snap circuits are to prison as littleBits are to freedom!
