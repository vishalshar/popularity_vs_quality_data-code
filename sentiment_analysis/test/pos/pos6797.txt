We really love playing this game with our friends. The best fun is for 4 and up.There were two cards we chucked, I have a good sense of humor but they went too far for me with 2. The game itself is great, I wouldn't say don't buy it. If there is a card that you don't like.. throw it away.The ones I tossed: One showed a suicide (lost a parent and friend to suicide) and the other referred to children in a way that I could never find funny.Lots of blanks for you to come up with your own convoluted punch lines. Highly recommend.
