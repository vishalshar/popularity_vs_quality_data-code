I'm constantly looking for the "next best thing", so purchasing a product twice is so rare for me. This will be my second tube, and I don't think I'll ever give this up! I have oily skin, and very long eyelashes, so if I do wear mascara (even waterproof) by the end of the day it rubs off on my brow bone or flakes off onto the rest of my face. I also noticed that my contacts day out faster when I wear mascara. I was at the point where I just stopped wearing it, and I found this product. As I previously stated my eyelashes are pretty long but the main reason why I even wore mascara was to tint the ends and make them stand out a bit more. This product is amazing for that! It gives my lashes the voluminous look I love, and is virtually undetectable. It also conditions them, and I noticed over the past few months after swapping my mascara for this that they have grown as well. It lasts all day, and absolutely no flaking or smudging.
