One of my cats became an escape artist. I had tried other methods to keep her in the yard, to no avail. I put off this option due to price, but now that I have it, it was worth every penny. I didn't have to contend with any gates or other areas that I didn't want "electrified" so installation was a snap. A staple gun was all I needed.The batteries for the collar are a little pricey, but again, worth it to keep her in the yard. There are some Youtube videos showing how to alter the battery case so just the batteries can be replaced rather than the whole battery unit. I'll try this to save some money, but I'm not terribly worried about it. Each battery lasts about 2 months.
