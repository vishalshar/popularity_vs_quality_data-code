I was apprehensive at first to order a costly electronic from a new company that didn't have a reputation yet but I'm glad I did. This headset feels very high quality and I love the colors. The distance is not as far as a different Bluetooth headset I've had but it's further than necessary. The mic giving you feedback is something I've never had before but I really like it, it helps me control my own volume because these headphones are pretty noise canceling. I use them many hours every day playing games and I'm in love. The only problem I can think about with these is that if you have a big head or big ears they may be uncomfortable after a while, but that isn't the case for me so they're absolutely perfect.
