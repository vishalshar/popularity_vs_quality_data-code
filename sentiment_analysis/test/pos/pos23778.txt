This is my second purchase of a PetSafe dog collar and this little dog collar is nice because it has 5 levels of correction!  I purchased a PetSafe collar from the local hardware store and it was a disaster as it was only 1 level of correction!!  This doesn't fair well for a puppy and created a terrible learning environment for him.  I took it back and purchased this collar and the training has gone well.  I do like the new design where the collar itself is fabric now verses the older model I have on my adult dog...it is plastic.  Either way, these are excellent collars.
