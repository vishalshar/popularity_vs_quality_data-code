This device works as advertised. Never again do I have to miss a word of my podcasts or a note of my music just because I need to move around the house. Or move from house to car. Or move from car to office.I can even put it on the edge of the tub while I shower because it won't be damaged by a stray drop of water.If I had to name a feature it could use, it would be a battery indicator to let me know when it was low or when it was done charging. But this is a minor consideration for me.
