At less than $60 with a 20% off coupon (Amazon price and offer at the time of this review) this starter garden/indoor (herb) garden is pretty cool. Just about a 5-star product; the only things holding it back from 5 stars (hence, my 4-star review) are the high cost of replacement cartridges, the somewhat cheap feel of the product (a bit too "cheap plastic" for my tastes), and an app that doesn't quite measure up (yet).You've seen a few reviews that show you the plants growing so I'm going to focus this review on the grow garden device instead. So I've uploaded some photos to show you what comes in the box and what it looks like disassembled. Essentially, what you get is a water reservoir, a light, a cartridge holder, three cartridges, three "greenhouse domes," and directions. The oblong piece in the middle of the first photo is the the water level indicator (it slides in the channel at the end opposite of the light bar. It is not directly mentioned in the directions and it fell out when we were unpacking so we had to rely on the product photo to be sure we were not putting it in upside down). The light bar adjusts to three levels (to go up as your plants grow up). The light cycles at 16 hours on/8 hours off and this cycle is controlled by simply plugging in the AC adapter (unplugging and then replugging starts the 16/8 cycle over again (we have ours going from 6 in the morning to 10 at night; and when it's on it's very bright!)).You fill the reservoir by pouring in through the water indicator slot. When the indicator is flush with the "deck" there's enough water. The water wicks up into the open bottom of the cartridge. Refill as necessary (and indicated by the height of the indicator).Replacement cartridges aren't cheap; roughly $5.00-6.50 each ($14.95-$19.95 for a 3-pack). The selection is pretty extensive (most available on Amazon, but more in the shop at the clickandgrow (dot com) website).The app was a no-go for me. I noted user comments in the app store that stated some of the app's features were not working (the C&G tech support folks were kind enough to reply and ask for more details). I didn't get that far as the app requires you to sign up prior to gaining access. I make it as much of a habit as I can not to do business with folks who require my contact info before seeing what they have to offer. As such, it would be nice to see the app offer a "sign up; not now" option or a limited preview so users can get an idea of what it is they are giving their contact info away for (yes, I know, I could sign up with dummy info, but I shy away from that technique as well).Whatever you plan on growing you will probably want to transplant it out of the cartridge cup and into a pot. Otherwise, what a waste (unless what you want are tiny plants). So for me it's a starter device (i.e., not where the plant stays from germination to end-of-the-line). Speaking of the cartridge, there was one thing on the Amazon product page I thought somewhat misleading (but maybe I'm being too picky). A photo shows the growing medium with the statement that "Smart Herb Garden is reusable. The Smart herb garden is designed to last. Whenever your plants have been harvested you can get new plants and re-use the Smart herb garden as many times as you wish!" Makes it seem (to me) that you can reuse the cartridge. But I think what they really mean is that the growing deck can be used and reused by replacing cartridges.In the end, clever. This is "K Cups" coming to the apartment garden. Seems well-enough made and, as I noted at the beginning of the review, priced reasonably at about $55. Replacement cartridges are not cheap (whether one considers them expensive is a matter of perspective). Not thrilled with the app. Perhaps the company could link/provide more cartridge options on Amazon? As to potential buyers/users; probably of no great use where space is not a premium. As such, this concept works very well, I think, in an urban/apartment setting. It might also make a great gift for kids as they start off on their own gardening adventure.Summary: Nice, but not a grand slam. 4 stars, I think, is a fair rating.
