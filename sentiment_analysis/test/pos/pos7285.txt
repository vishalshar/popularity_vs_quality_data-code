First of all, the product seems very durable as advertised.  But, the tip of the lightning connector broke off. The reason this gets 5 stars is I sent a picture to Fuse Chicken and they sent me a new one at no cost within a few days.  This is customer service that I have come to not expect, but am very happy.
