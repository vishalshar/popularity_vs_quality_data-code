I loved the idea of this item but unfortunately, it was tighter than I had expected. It WILL fit 4 cards in the front pocket, but they will not be easy to remove quickly. I thought maybe if I moved one card to the cash compartment, that that would be a good workaround and I'd be able to keep it. But, no go. The cash compartment is too short to keep cards in. I really wanted to love this, but it's really too small to keep what I need on a day-to-day basis.
