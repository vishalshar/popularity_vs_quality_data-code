These banana chips have become my go-to snack when I am craving something sweet but want to be healthy!  there are no added sugars or sweeteners.  This is a great snack to take on a plane or in the car when you're on the go and need a sweet treat!  I bought the apple flavored ones too, but the banana are the best!
