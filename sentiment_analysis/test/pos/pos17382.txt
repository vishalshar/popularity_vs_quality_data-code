I really like this toothpaste.  It has whitening ingredients that you can tell are working. I certainly see a difference in the color of my teeth which is wonderful considering I am a coffee drinker. I also really like the pure mint.  I have never been a fan of the really strong, minty flavored toothpaste. They always leave an after taste.  This one does not but still gives you fresh breath.  *Received free for review. Opinions are 100% of my own.
