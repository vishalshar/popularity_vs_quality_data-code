I was skeptical, not thinking these bags could cut down on surface mold that can build up in plastic. They REALLY WORK! I put 2 or 3 cheeses in the same bag and don't have any issues for weeks - cheese can breathe, tastes great, and doesn't build up mold. I also like being able to sharpie the bags with what's inside. This will definitely be the only way I store cheese!
