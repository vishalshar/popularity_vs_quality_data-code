I was hesitant about these at first, the weight and the discretion mostly, maybe they weren't worth the $45 and I was wasting my money. I went for it anyway and I'm very glad I did. I've been wearing these all day every day for 5 weeks and I really have noticed a difference.Firstly, the weight. I bought the small size because I didn't want to look like a total weirdo, but I was worried because can a 1/2 lb really do anything for you?. I thought maybe everyone else was twig-armed soccer moms with desk jobs and that's why it worked for them. I'm a stronger woman, I work in a warehouse, I use a 14lb bowling ball regularly, so I thought maybe these wouldn't be for me. I will say they do work. I wear them everywhere and don't even notice them anymore, but I can feel it in my arms and I can see them toning up. It just adds to the simple things you already do that you don't even think about, like carrying your coffee mug or doing your makeup or driving your car..Secondly, the discretion. Obviously this is a MUCH better option than my mom's old jazzercise wrist weights, but what else could they be? They can't look like NORMAL jewelry surely.. You'd be surprised, I've had a lot of people ask questions about them, but it's always intrigued and curious, never "god what are those you weirdo?!". I get "That's an interesting watch, where does it say the time?" or "What's inside your bracelets?" or "Those are cool, what do they do?", I even had one gentleman I work with mistake them for "spy bracelets" from a J-Lo movie and seemed to think they were full of mace and piano wire, despite that that's probably not something I would wear to work. The point is, they're not going to make people stare at you, at worst you look like you might attend the occasional rock concert, and if you do so much the better, they'll fit right in.All in all they were absolutely worth it. Since I've grown accustomed to them I probably could move up to the large size, and I'd definitely consider it, I would absolutely buy a second set, they are worth the money. Very well constructed, you can tell just by touching them and I'm not exactly gentle on them. I love that they're waterproof, some people probably think "Who cares? I'm never going to play pool volleyball in them anyway (which they are absolutely great for btw)" but you would be amazed what a job it makes shampooing your hair. Highly recommended.
