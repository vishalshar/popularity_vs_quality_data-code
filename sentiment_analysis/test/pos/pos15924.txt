I had a chance to preview this game at Gencon 2016, and purchased it as soon as it was available on Amazon.  Overall a very good game geared mostly towards helping teach kids the story of the Exodus in a fun way.  Don't worry - you don't need to be an expert to enjoy it!  There are a few variations on how to play based on the knowledge/level of the players.  I'm looking forward to other stories being adapted in the same way.
