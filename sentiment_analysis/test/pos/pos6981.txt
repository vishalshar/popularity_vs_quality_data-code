I'm enjoying the product so far, the biggest issue that I'm having is it will not(or I can't get it to) connect to my Note 5) so I use it with my 2-1 Windows tablet.  Picture is clear, sound is great, I feel sure that I will enjoy them for a while.  The Price is a bit high, but you only live once and tomorrow is promised as we know it today.
