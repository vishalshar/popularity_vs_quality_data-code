I purchased Chirpie for my Niece's birthday and it is her new favorite toy!!!  It is able to entertain her on her own or with friends.  She just picks Chiripie up and starts planning the games.  Whether it's the Egg Toss or Sky Bird, our Niece has a blast with Chirpie.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing Chirpie !!!!!
