Love this pedal!  I can't even tell you how much fun it is.  If you get the chance to play with one, you certainly should.  I've had it for a few months now and haven't even played all of the pre-loaded songs.  I have loaded a couple of custom songs however (taken from MIDIs found online).  There's really nothing I can say about the pedal that hasn't already been made clear in the several videos made by Singular Sound other than to say I have no regrets whatsoever about buying this pedal.
