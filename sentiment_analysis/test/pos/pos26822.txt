Just got it yesterday. Placed batteries in and it started working. Placed it into the dark bathroom and waited for it to go out, I then had one of the kids go in to set it off. Came on and it stays on for about a minute or so after movement detected. Lights up beautifully! I have only had it for 1 day and I love it so far. Other reviews have touched on dependability and durability, so if any of that changes I will update my review.I will buy 3 more of these when they come down to a more reasonable price.
