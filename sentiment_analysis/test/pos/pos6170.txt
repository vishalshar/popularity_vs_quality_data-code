I love my Petzi. I am able to check on my dog as often as I want while I am away. When I activate the camera it makes a sound that alerts my dog that he may be getting a treat, he comes running. It's a pleasant sound so if he is asleep it does not wake him up. Programing the app was easy and the customer support is the best.
