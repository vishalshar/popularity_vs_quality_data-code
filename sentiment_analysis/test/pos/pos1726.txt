I've only used the cooler once so far, but it is great! The speaker is incredibly loud and clear for being so small.  The blender takes a little longer than my counter-top blender, but it's effective so I love it.  The bungee is genius for carrying things on top and the cooler seems to be very sturdy!  I don't know that I would pay $500 for this cooler, but under $200 I would say it is totally worth it!
