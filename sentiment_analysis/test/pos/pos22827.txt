I use this Xylitol instead of sugar because it is made from Birch and not corn. I have a very bad fungus that  feeds off regular sugar. So I cant have sugar, it does not have an after taste. The only drawback, if you eat to much your bm will be very loose. It is a very good sweeten for all things. Can use in recipes cup for cup same as sugar.
