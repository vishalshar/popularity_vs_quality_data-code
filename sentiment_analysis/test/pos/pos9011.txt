I absolutely love the design of this sleep sack and the softness of the materials. The personal touches (a handwritten note) with the packaging when I received the order was also a nice touch.  With that being said, there are just a few suggestions. The materials are nice, I just wish it was organic cotton and more breathable. The filling is still partially polyester I think, and our baby can get sweaty in it. We also live along the beach in Southern California so this sleep sack was a bit warm for our baby. We don't have central air conditioning and it's about 68-75 degrees Fahrenheit most of the year. It's too hot to use during the beginning of the evening but we put it on our baby at about 11pm and it's good for the rest of the late night to early morning hours when it's considerably cooler. I don't think we will be able to use it at all in the summer so I wish there was a lighter weight option. Otherwise great sleep sack and very comfy!
