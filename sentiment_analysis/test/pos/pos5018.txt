If you ever ended up with a bunch of Cholla cactus stuck in your leg, you would be glad you had this little device in your pack or pocket.  Just a simple tweezer that snaps into a metal holder with an eyelet.  Trust me, carry one of these or something like it to: remove cactus needles, bee stingers, porcupine quills from your dogs face or what ever surprises you get on the trail
