Yup...pretty awesome protection for your expensive watch investment.  If you follow instructions to the finest detail, it works just fine.  The only "unfortunate" issue is that when working and bending wrist back, the crown is easily pushed activating Siri constantly.  I am surprised Siri has not become angry over this being prompted all the time with nothing there...LOL.  For the money, it's worth it however, take a chance at an open box Amazon warehouse deal with prime for 1/4 the cost...the only issue is that it saved so much I ordered a clear one to have some options and received another black one but easily returned for a refund because it prime.
