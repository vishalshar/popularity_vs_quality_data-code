This is an awesome pet feeder!  Extremely easy to set up.  You set a schedule on a website; you can change the schedule remotely at any time.  Your recorded voice calls the pet to the feeder right before feeding.  Each feeder has a webcam so you can watch your pet eat or play or sleep or whatever (has a wide angle view).  You can even sync the feeders to feed all pets at exactly the same time (I have 3 feeders & 3 cats).  The feeder is extremely well made; it is wide and flat so the center of gravity is low; the pet can't knock it over or push it around. The pet cannot access the covered food before feeding time. I verified that If the power goes out, the feeder goes automatically back on line when power is back up.  Well worth the investment!July 24, 2016--I want to give an update on the 3 feeders that I purchased over 2 years ago and the incredible customer service.  The feeders work terrifically and I cannot say enough great things about the product and the company.  5 years ago, my employer moved me from east coast to midwest.  We kept a second home on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire and we get back there as much as possible (almost 6 weeks per year).  When we got 3 rescue kitties over 2 years ago, we realized we needed a reliable pet sitter (which we have) and very reliable automatic feeders (for feeding between afternoon of one day and morning of the next and for unanticipated times when the pet sitter cannot get to our house for a visit in the very busy summertime).  One kitty eats like he will never eat again. He will eat the food of the other 2 kitties as soon as he is done with his food.  For that reason, my most critical need for an automatic pet feeder was that all three feeders feed at the same time.  When I first got the feeders and set all 3 feeders up, I noticed that the feeders were off by a few seconds, enough to confuse the kitties a bit and give my ravenous Tesla a head start (thereby, giving him a chance to finish first and gobble up the rest of one of the other kitties' food).  I e-mailed Alex Stone late my time (and he is on the west coast) and he immediately answered, telling me that as long as the timers on the website for the feeders were within one minute of one another, the feeders would sync between midnight and 2AM,  The feeders did sync  and food filled dishes opened at exactly the same time the next day.  What peace of mind!  The 3 kitties are so trained that they lay around the feeders an hour before midnight snack (I can see that they do that through the built in cam when I am in NH and they are in MN).The amazing aspect of this company is the customer support.  I also had a little trouble with one feeder clock somehow changing time and after some e-mail exchanges, the company provided a replacement feeder.  I was amazed at that kind of service.  You cannot go wrong with this product or the company that stands behind it.  I am one of those pet owners who buys the best for my kitties and researches everything before buying!
