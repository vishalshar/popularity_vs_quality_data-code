I bought the jacket not so much for athletic reasons, but just to have a flashy jacket to wear during the chilly days. Trust me when I say that this jacket is NOT for Spring and early Fall! The minute you put this jacket on you will start sweating and that's mainly because of the mesh interior. You gotta understand that this jacket is not so much for style/casual wearing. It is meant to be worn as an athletic/cycling jacket. You have been warned. Good thing it has zip openings under the armpits to keep you cool and they do help! Now for the sizing, this jacket runs somewhat small. My guess is that under the armpits where it has zips tends to ride up and that might cause some mild discomfort for some. I returned the jacket for a bigger size. I usually wear a Medium in outerwear. Im 170lbs, 5'10-5'11 and the size Medium felt small under the armpits which caused mild discomfort and for the price I wanted to get a jacket that i felt comfortable with, so I returned it for a bigger size (Large) and it feels way more comfortable. Good jacket, but overpriced in my opinion. If you want it just for casual wearing then wear it during late Fall & Winter. For athletic reasons you really can't go wrong.
