This device is amazing!!! I was not sure with some of the reviews!! However, YOU HAVE TO GET THE FIRMWARE UPDATE!!I worked on it for hours... Almost gave up but after some research and placing a order ticket with the developer!! I'm now in business!!Mine shipped with firmware 1.2.26 and would not work.. but this morning, I awoke and it was updated and worked perfectly!!!Don't take the negative reviews as the final decision!But make sure to request the support ticket!!  Here is the link :)https://support.gramofon.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=29581I'm going to buy 3 more!!
