I love this thing!! I live in a condo and have two frenchies, I lined under the grass area with pee pads to help speed up cleaning time, it does the job and the dogs actually use it, I did have to coax them a bit with a training spray (they have a non smelly one at petco)  and kept and eye on them and praised them whenever they used it. It's been easy breezy since then.
