First off, let me be clear: I have never owned a different fitness tracker so I cannot directly compare this one to another. However, I can tell you my experience with this one. Like many other people, I was deciding between this tracker and the Fitbit Alta. I saw the Alta in stores and still found it to be too clunky and obvious, while this Ray is very subtle and I've received several compliments. The rose gold color is stunning (and not too pink) and the tracker itself has held up very well so far. I have had no issues with scratches or with the band coming off, which was a concern of mine when I was looking at other trackers. I also found the sport band to be a pleasant material, and I didn't think it felt cheap like some people said.I know that other fitness trackers have more features, but often they are so ugly that I know I would get sick of wearing them, thus defeating the purpose of the tracker. This one tracks my sleep extremely well, and the step count seems to be accurate, although I do get slightly different readings on distance compared to my GPS running app. However, the Ray is consistent, so it tracks my progress over time well, which is most important to me. This tracker detects periods of exercise like running well, but it did not work for me when I cycled when I wore it on my wrist, so I think the tracker would need to be moved elsewhere on my body. The app functions perfectly and I do like the point system, although I wish that manually logged activities would contribute points. Hopefully this can be added in the future. In addition, I have taken full advantage of the Link app and I love it because I can skip songs while at work in a very discreet manner. Also, I absolutely love that this tracker is waterproof. I was at a pool party and didn't have to worry about taking off this tracker, unlike my Fitbit friends.The biggest complaint I have with this tracker is the weak vibration of the motor for the alarm feature. The notifications work fine,  but I am a relatively deep sleeper and the alarm is nothing but a faint tickling of my wrist for me. The alarm isn't continuous as I thought, so it will turn off within 15 seconds automatically. Perhaps this could be solved with an update so that the alarm can be triggered while I'm in lighter sleep. Lastly, I have been unable to remove the bands so far because the band requires a tool that I did not find inside the box.Overall, I would recommend this tracker to someone who is new to fitness trackers or is looking for a tracker that doesn't need to be charged often and has an attractive design.
