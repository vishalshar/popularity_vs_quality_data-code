This is a pretty sweet device.  Pretty easy setup...not instant, but relatively easy.  The camera's viewfinder is a wide angle lens and its pretty detailed on what you're viewing.  Its also got a night mode so you can see things in the dark as well.  I did have to remove the reminders in the settings so that it wouldn't email me every time motion or sound was detected.  Now I turn on the camera at my convenience.  The audio is pretty decent as well, however you're given 15 seconds of talk time with a 3-5 second lag, so I'd tell the recipients to wait a couple seconds for a response.  Its totally free and only requires a plug and a wifi connection.  Works well with iPad, iPhone, Android phones too.Just an FYI, if you want everyone on their computers or iphones to talk over the Oco device, you have to put in the main account for the devices.
