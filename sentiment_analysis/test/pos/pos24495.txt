I originally bought this to water proof some of my canvas sneakers.  It works pretty well for repelling water with the only down side is that I used this on my white Chuck Taylor converse and it turned them a slight yellowish color.  It's not a huge deal and I half way expected that to happen.  I will be using more of this beeswax to water proof some leather shoes that I own.
