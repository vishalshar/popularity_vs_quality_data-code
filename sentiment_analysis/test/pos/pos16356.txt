I have to say, I'm very impressed. I've had some pretty poor ear-buds and was seriously considering the $300 Bose units. Well, I decided to try these because they had such a high rating. I have no regrets whatsoever. I mainly listen to classical piano music and these sound great. I can listen to music while the TV is on 5 feet away with no problem. The noise isolation is very good. I had no problem molding them to my ears. A great buy!
