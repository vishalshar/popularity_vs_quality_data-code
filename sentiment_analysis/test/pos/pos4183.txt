First you should know that I paid full price for these plates, so you don't have to worry about my review being genuine.  I bought them because we were going to have a some couples over for a Superbowl party at our house and I wanted something that we could all hold to eat all our finger foods with comfortably and not have to mess with coasters and flimsy paper plates.  I have to say these things are PERFECT for super bowl parties!  Based on my experience with them over the last few months I would also say they'd be PERFECT for pool parties, backyard BBQs, picnics, trips to the lake (I'd keep some in your boat!) and birthday parties.  I would put emphasis on any gathering outdoors that involves food!  Here's what I really like about these plates:- STURDY!  These things are VERY well made, solid plastic that don't flex or sag at all under the weight of food and drink.  They go through the wash like champs!  Isn't that the most important thing of all?-  FLOAT!  I was anxious to test out this float claim and see if they really did float with food and drink on them, so I filled up my sink and tested them out!  See my pics.  They really do float!  They can officially hold the weight of 3 cups of water before they submerge.  I measured with a measuring cup!  To give some perspective, that is a FULL movie theater cup!  The plate also floated with the cup full of salsa and the plate full of chips.  It floated with a full 12oz bottle of sparkling water and unopened can of soda.  These would be awesome for a leisurely float in the pool!-  DRINKS!  I was very pleased with the wide range of drinks that the middle compartment can hold!  The things that fit best were big movie theater and restaurant refill cups (see pics) and glass tumblers.  The 12oz bottle of sparkling water fit perfectly as well!  I didn't have a full size solo cup to test but I think those would be great also.  Soda cans fit well but with a little wiggle room (one finger worth).  I would be nervous about putting any tall/thin drink in this thing unless it's sitting on a table as it would slide around and probably tip over or slosh.  That means beer bottles are out.  Pour it in a big cup or tumbler and you're good to go!-  SERVING!  In addition to using these as individual plates for food and drink, I love these as serving plates!  At one time I once had one with salsa and chips, one with veggies and dip, one with wings and ranch, one with fruit and fruit dip and one with crackers and a cheese ball!  If you're using it as a serving tray it might be helpful to know that the center hole holds 3/4C liquid (again, I measured).  That's nearly half a jar of salsa (again, see pics).-  HOLDING!  One of the problems with plates like these is generally holding on to them without spilling if you get bumped.  These things were designed with that in mind and are SUPER easy to hold from the bottom as there is a groove meant just for your fingers.  Very comfortable and stable to hold for long periods of time without getting tired.While these plates excel at finger foods and side dishes, there are some things that I don't think these plates would work well for including but not limited to:HamburgersSteaksHard shell tacosNon-sub/hoagie sandwichesAnything wider than a hot dog or that requires cutting to eatI think it's also worth mentioning that these plates are great for my autistic 4 year old who has major sensory/food issues and needs food group segregation at meal time, haha!  All in all I'm very pleased to have these for occasions that warrant them, though they're a little pricey if you are hosting a big party and have to buy more than the 6 pack like I did.  I also think they would be better designed with a layer of silicone or some other type of coating on the bottom of the cup hold to keep thin glass bottles or other drinks from sliding around, but otherwise I highly recommend these plates!  Hope this helps somebody else who's looking!I did NOT receive this item free or at a discount
