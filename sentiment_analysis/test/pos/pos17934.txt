I bought this based on reviews and I am so glad I did.  My pup had CPV with 3 small warts in her mouth and eye and 2 that had become huge on her lips.  After 3 weeks of using this, the small ones are gone and the huge ones have been shrinking every day and are almost gone.  Very happy to have found this and not have to go the medical route which always wants to put her on antibiotics.  I will be keeping her on this for always so that her immune system stays strong.  Thank you!!!
