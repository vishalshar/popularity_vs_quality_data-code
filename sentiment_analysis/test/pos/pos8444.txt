I bought these because my shoe laces wouldn't stay tied at work. I'd have to stop and tie my laces all the time.I figured this would be a good solution and it is.After some trial and error on the best way to lace the hickies, I found just the regular across the top of the foot worked best.Now, I walk a lot. And these work great. A ten hour day on my feet, and I haven't had to mess with them once. I also love that I can slip your shoes on with them.My only complaint is if you have wide feet, (even if you do the wide foot lacing), they might be too tight.They are perfect if you have smaller feet, or really thin feet. A really brilliant idea!
