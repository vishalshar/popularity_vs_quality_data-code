I like it a lot. Not the highest quality offered by Line6, but then this is not a pro guitar amp to take on stage. This is perfect for practicing at home, and that's what it's intended for. The iPad/iPhone software is pretty cool, makes it easy to tweak sounds and download new sounds from the community (tons available!). They just released an android version as well.Would love to see Line 6 updating the firmware to make use of the USB port for a PC interface and or recording - that would put the icing on the cake!Also, a digital interface for the Variax guitars would have been nice, but again, this is not a pro amp.If you consider buying this, go to the Line 6 forums and read what the users discuss.
