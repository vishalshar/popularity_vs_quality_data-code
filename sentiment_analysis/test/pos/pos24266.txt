There is no way this should work as well as it does.  My son found this and I bought it for him for Christmas on a whim and hoped it worked as well as it said it would because it was on the expensive side for what it was.  It works great. We were totally surprised at the performance.  We even took it out on a windy day and were able to fly and control the plane from his iPhone.  We got a ton of enjoyment out of this as well as many laughs in amazement of the technology and surprise on the performance.  Use the templates provided to build your first plane and you will have a blast.
