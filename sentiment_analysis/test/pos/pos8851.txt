As a chiropractor, I am always interested in natural health care products. Recently, I was introduced to the Anchor Nutriton. I was excited of the prospect of a company developing nutrition based rather pharmaceutical products to help with common ailments which are often associated with secondary detrimental effects. Last week I asked two of my patients if they would like to try the product. They each noticed a definite improvement. For one patient the nausea had completely resolved within 30 minutes. For the other it was "at least 80%better. They each wanted more Anchor bars.I will continue to provide the Anchor bar to my patients in need and will keep you posted.Thanks to all involved in developing this noteworthy product!
