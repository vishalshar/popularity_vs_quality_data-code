was skeptical. have trouble tying shoes with fingers giving me problems. A medical foundation suggested these and am glad I found them. Installing looked complicated, but once I tried it, it was actually pretty easy. Have only used them a couple of days so don't know how long they last (hopefully awhile considering the cost), but so far I really like them. Would have gotten 5 -stars, but at this point, not sure they are worth the price since there seems to be many options. Hopefully, I will remember to revisit this to upgrade (or downgrade) over time.
