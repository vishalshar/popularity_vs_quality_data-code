This filament is incredible. The colors are deep and rich, and it prints like butter. I really appreciate the print settings being on the spool itself and not on some box that you'll throw away the instant you open it up. The high quality resealable bag is really what sets AIO apart from lower-quality filament manufacturers, something that $50 filament spools don't even include.This review is overwhelmingly positive because I really love this filament. I bought this spool with my own money and AIO Robotics probably doesn't even know I exist.
