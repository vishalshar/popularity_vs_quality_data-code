Currently in contact with IllumiBowl since my unit keeps draining the batteries.  I am on my third set of batteries at this time and they are supposed to be sending out another unit to replace the one I have currently.  This item is cool but not worth the hassle.  I was going to buy one for my father in law but don't feel like taking the change on him having the same issue.  Already wasted over $10.00 in batteries.  The unit just won't shut off.  Do your research and see if there is a better unit than this one.  I will be returning if the new one they send me drains the first set of batteries I put in it.Update:IllumiBowl has sent me a replacement unit that is now working just fine.  They stated they had a bad shipment come in and it has been corrected.
