Since I am constantly making my own salad dressings, I thought this would be great for sealing the leftovers in a pint canning jar.  It works exactly as it was intended and the seal is a strong one, yet not so much so that it is impossible to open.  I have a slight issue with arthritis and was a little concerned that I wouldn't be able to get the cap off once it was snapped shut, but it works just famously.  A great solution.
