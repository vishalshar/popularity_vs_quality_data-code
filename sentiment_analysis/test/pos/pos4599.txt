I do a lot of playing around with gadgets and toys, and this is one of the smaller and lighter drones I've seen. I like that it's also a teaching tool! The teachers in the lessons online are pretty helpful, but when you have questions, you can just head to their Facebook group to ask questions.  They get back to you pretty quickly, and there's a few hundred members in the group to help out.  If you're a kid at heart that loves playing around with toy gadgets, you should try it out!
