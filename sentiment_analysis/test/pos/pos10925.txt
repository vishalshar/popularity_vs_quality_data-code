My wife and i can get away for a day without worrying about our canine friends missing a meal, and seeing their eyes bulging out of their sockets as they wolf down their food live on the webcam really puts our minds at ease while we are out. :) I mistakenly left a peice of foam under one of the feeding trays, and it jammed the motor causing it to break. I sent an email, and spoke with the inventor Alex directly. He refused to let me pay for any of the damage despite it being a blatant case of user error on my part. I still feel guilty accepting the replacement part for free, but he really stands behind his product. The only way you could make this thing jam is if you forget the packing foam like i did, or overfill to the point that the unit cant function. I have two of these and cant be happier.
