This item does support my back very well.  I sit in front of my computer several hours a day without back support so this gives me the back support I need and my back feels pretty good using this item.  Once you figure out how to use it, I now slip into it pretty fast. I find I don't like to use it for more than a few hours at a time because my knees get a little tired from the straps pressure on my knees.
