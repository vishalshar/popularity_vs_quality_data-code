I love this case, having had one for an earlier model phone.  I bought this specifically for travel, because you can keep a card or cash while having the camera readily accessible--my other case is a wallet and it hampers photography.  Some people complained the case made the phone bulky, but I think it is worth it.  The phone is also easy to hold in this because it's not slippery, and the wrist strap is good insurance near the water, etc.
