Ok, read many of the 200+ reviews and there are some things this speaker is and some things it ain't. It will not replace a home stereo system, it's not better than sliced bread, and it won't cure cancer. It will however play music wirelessly. I have a beatspill and needed something more weatherproof to use around our backyard pool and the pill is not versatile to place anywhere due to the round design it rolls easily if not on a very flat surface. This guy is very flat and sits easily on any surface. The feet on the bottom are not suction cups like another reviewer stated as I tried this and it fell, but it would be cool if they were. The volume is fine for my backyard space, but does not get as loud as my beats pill. I put a 3M hook on the siding on the back of my house and hang it so the sound is projected out across the pool and works good. And for some reason I cannot get it to connect to my S4 no matter what which finds every other Bluetooth speaker I've ever tried. Super inconvenient since now I am forced to use my iPad for music and nothing else if I want music. Plus I won't bring my iPad outside so I have to go inside to skip songs. Overall I am pleased and would buy again. Worth noting this is more rugged and half the cost of a beats pill. And small enough to fit in your palm.
