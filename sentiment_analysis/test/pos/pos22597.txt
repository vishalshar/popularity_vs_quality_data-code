One of the limitations of Amazon Vine reviews is the time restriction before a review must be submitted. Certain products just require time to watch and evaluate. This Raticator S-Plus is such a beast.Two time-related factors in this review:1. Battery longevity2. An actual fried rodent as proof of conceptGuess what? I didn't have enough time to see if claimed battery life matches actual use, and despite the fact that mice do infest our basement, it's not the time of year where they go exploring for food reserves (think February or March instead).Still, reviews wait for no man...or mouse.Ah, building the better mousetrap. Raticator thinks they've done it. If the disposal issue is your biggest ick, then this is your device. Rodents get zapped on the metal plate inside, and a red light flashes, notifying you of the kill. Dump the remains and put the trap back. That's it. You never have to touch a dead mouse or rat. Easy peasy.SPECS:* Dimensions: Roughly 12" x 4" x 4"* Consumables: 4 AA high-capacity alkaline or lithium (nonrechargeable) batteries* Made in: The good ol' USA, baby* Warranty: 6 monthsWhat kind of charge does it pack? I have no exact figure, but it's supposedly not enough to hurt a person too badly, though you would not want babies or pets near it, both something to consider.It's great to see a product not made in China. At least the U.S. still dominates the mousetrap market. This is a solidly built item, with plastic walls much thicker than other similar household appliances of this size. It feels robust and well made. Hey, even includes a tech support number and a customer service email address. Nice. (See images below.)Powering this beast is an Achilles heel. The manufacturer recommends costly nonrechargeable lithium batteries, but promises about a year of use out of them, with up to 100 kills. High-capacity alkalines get about six months or 60 kills. Rechargeables are NOT recommended, and indeed I tried the unit with some 2700 mAh Sanyo NiMH that have never let me down, and they did, lasting only a few days before draining.Sorry, but I can't do anything about the lack of rodents in my house right now. Can't tell you how dead the Raticator S-Plus makes 'em, but some realities are out of one's control. I trust that if the unit can kill a full-grown rat it will crisp-ify a house mouse. Of course, your mileage may vary.Batteries fit tightly in the unit, as in "needing something to pry them out" tightly. Would have been nice to have a fabric strip one can position underneath them to help in removal.Clean up is not obvious. I would think electrocuted rodents might lose bowel or bladder contents inside the device, and that's got to be cleaned. The instructions note the device is susceptible to water damage and provides detailed instructions on how it must be cleaned. Something of a hassle.Here's the thing: If you have a lot of mice or rats and are constantly dealing with them, then this may be your trap. It's not cheap, takes expensive batteries, and may not be the easiest thing to clean. But still. If you have dead rodents filling your standard traps, and you hate the thought of having annoying spring traps everywhere, this is your solution.
