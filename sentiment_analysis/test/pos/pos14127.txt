I loved this product, it arrived on time, and as promised. It makes me wish I had kept all of my old cassettes, but I'm sure I will find some somewhere. There were two versions of this, one with the record function, and one without. I opted for the version with the recording feature and I am glad I did. Whatever media I am listening to, I am able to hit record and transfer it to the usb flash drive (which was included in the purchase!). So easy to take old vinyls, and bring them with me in my vehicle.Money very well spent!
