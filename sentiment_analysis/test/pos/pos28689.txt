This is a great device for runners who don't want to think about having to start and stop a smartwatch. It gives you various charts and feedback on heel strike, cadence, leg swing, ground contact. etc... A great value for the price. It is worth it just to keep track of your shoe's mileage. You do have to give it 4 or 5 runs to make it more accurate.
