We weren't sure what to expect when Santa brought this for my 11 and 7 year old girls. A few days later, my 11-year old and I decided to give it a shot. We were a bit confused at first, mainly because the info about the cards is presented later in the manual, and we were just following the first few pages.Anyway, after the initial confusion/boredom, it became fun quickly. We have played several games with 2-4 players. The 7 year old caught on surprisingly well, and was able to win her first game after a couple of tries.Anyway, the whole family loves it - after the first 1-2 learning games, it becomes fun.Now, they are periods of drought when people are just drawing cards that do not help them at all, so you do have to have some patience - it's not a 'non-stop' action video game, after all.
