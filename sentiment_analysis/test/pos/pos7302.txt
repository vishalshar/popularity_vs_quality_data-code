I'm a self taught piano player, mainly play guitar. I usually use piano to compose but never took time to learn how to sight read and the app is helping me do that right now. Going great so far. Nice that it doubles as a midi keyboard so it works with my other software as well. Wish it came with a pedal but those are pretty cheap to find on Amazon so you can get it yourself.
