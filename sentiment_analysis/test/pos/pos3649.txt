I love code&quill's notebook concept, and in my opinion it's incredibly well executed. The paper quality is top notch, and I also really like the indentation rule on one side, dot grid on the other. It's perfect both for sketching detailed diagrams, and for jotting down a few notes during meetings/classes/seminars. One thing that really surprised me (in a good way!) was the cover. I went with the Traveler's soft, flexible cover expecting it to be worn out within days. I'm a field biologist, and notebooks usually just don't withstand the level of hell that I put them through...but this one has! It's wonderful!
