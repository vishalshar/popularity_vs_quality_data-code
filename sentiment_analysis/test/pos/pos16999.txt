Well I have never used it and hope to never have to (and hope none of you will ever have to)so its pretty hard to judge how well it works. Will have to find a junk yard to test it out. But it does seem sharp and sturdy. The center punch feels sturdy as well. If nothing else, its a good weapon to have in the car as it is pretty compact. The case however isn't great. The velcro strap is a bit small so if you have a wide visor it might not stretch all the way. I don't actually keep it on the visor because it sticks out too much and its in my field of vision and annoys me. I leave it in my center console.
