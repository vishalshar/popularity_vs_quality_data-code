These are significantly smaller than any that I have seen in the stores, but it came with lots of flavors and a few additional sample packs so it was great for what I wanted. After using it a few times I'm guessing a single container would work on at least 4 batches of popcorn.The best part is that if there is a flavor you don't like, it's nice to have only purchased a small container so you don't feel like you are wasting a lot if you just want to throw it away and with the large variety you are almost certain to find one you really like.
