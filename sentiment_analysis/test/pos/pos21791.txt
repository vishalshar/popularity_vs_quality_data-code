These are great for sandwiches and snacks. Sandwiches have slightly more protection than a ziplock baggie, due to the thicker silicone material, but it is soft and flexible. They are easy to use and fit in the top rack of my dishwasher. I had stopped buying ziplock baggies a while ago, and these are a great alternative.
