Mealtimes are the highlight of my daughters dayyet they are the most dangerous times for her due to her severe peanut allergy. The foodie side of her wants hot, interesting, and well-seasoned food. Even if the school lunch could satisfy that need, its unsafe for her. OmieBox is the perfect solution!First, the hot-portion works! Extra seconds to line-up the notches on the lip of the thermos and the screw top + the boiling water/piping hot food trick = very warm food at lunch.Second, the not-hot portions work! Fill the compartments around the thermos with nut-free goodies, fruit, veggies, cheese, a cold applesauce squeezie and close the Omnibox. We place it in a Disney Lilo and Stitch standard rectangle lunchbox/bag, add a thin coolant-bar on the non-hot side of the Omiebox, and a frozen yogurt squeezie on top. Throw in a juice box or water squeezie and spoon. Voilŕ! Everything fits, little hands can open, hot food is sufficiently warm, cold food is cold, and the smile that lights-up my daughters face when she talks about her lunch is priceless!Having life-threatening food allergies puts a foodie in a tough spotespecially at age 5 when the draw of yummy-but-unsafe food may be too much temptation for her to resist. The OmieBox is a solution that makes my little foodie happy, but also allows her to leave her peanut-free bubble and learn to adapt to an environment where her allergen exists.
