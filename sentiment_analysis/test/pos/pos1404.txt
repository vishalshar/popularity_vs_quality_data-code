Awesome kit! My 7 year old son already loved Minecraft, he seemed a little skeptical at first as he did need some help building the actual computer case. Once he got in the program he fell in love. He's built a few switches and is now pretty much addicted again, but at least he's learning! Excited to see what else the program has in store for him!
