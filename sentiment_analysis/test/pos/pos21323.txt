This thing is the real deal.  I live in a community with water restrictions and it has made managing yard irrigation so much easier.  The biggest benefit to me is when I'm doing sprinkler maintenance because I don't have to keep running back and forth between the control panel and the sprinkler head to do testing and I can kill the water almost instantly if there's a major breakage instead of creating a huge muddy puddle.  The app is frequently updated and has a very good UI.  There are a lot of features packed into it that might overwhelm some, most of the core features are placed right up front.  I love being able make snap decisions whether to skip watering based on circumstances, or disable a zone temporarily due to breakage without sacrificing watering the rest of the zones until it's fixed.  There's a lot of customization for grass and plant varieties as well as sprinkler head types, so if you're knowledgeable and a tweaker, you will be in love.One thing that could have been better the size of the opening for wiring was a bit small and awkward for the number wires that have to be fed into it for 16 zones (and I only have 12).  Otherwise, setup and installation was straightforward and a breeze.
