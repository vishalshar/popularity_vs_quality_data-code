Really like the brush hero  Not only the cars but it was great for the golf cart and even cleaning our daughters scooter that she rides around in the neighborhood.  It certainly has gotten its uses.  Another creative use is for scrubbing areas around the pool.  May even try it on our filters next time we clean them.  Great multi use product.
