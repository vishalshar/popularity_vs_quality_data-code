Construction seems good, and works decent when tried on my dog, used on a Note 3.The background color is orange at first, which is confusing, you'd expect blue, though on a warm enough subject (lights), the background fades to blue.There is also an image/thermo slider so you can line up the sensor better, overall the Quality is fair, so the rating is Fair + 1, as it has a zoom and its under $300
