I've received a lot of compliments on this case for my Apple Watch. I love how tough it is. Very easy to put on the watch. I use to change color bands a lot, now they just sit in a drawer because my Lunatik case stays on 24/7. The bezel works just as you would think it would as does the button on the side. All in all if you are looking for a tough Apple Watch case that is simple to install, look no further. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
