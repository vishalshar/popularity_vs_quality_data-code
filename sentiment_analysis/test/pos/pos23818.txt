If you're in the field of barbering you most likely know what Andis Masters are. They're generally accepted as the best fading clippers because of their high speed, long tapering blade, and the iconic sound they make when cutting hair. The Andis Master is an undeniably high quality, professional tool. The Black Label edition of the Andis Master are largely unchanged from the regular edition. They have the same motor, same body, and same blades.The two major differences are the black powder coating, and the grounded plug. The powder coating is largely a cosmetic difference. It does give the clipper a finish that is a little more soft in the hand, and in my experience of cutting with them, it does dissipate the heat a little better to make them feel cooler during a normal cut. The grounded plug is another nice touch that hopefully won't have an impact on your cutting. A grounded plug is always better than ungrounded, but from a safety point of view it is really a last ditch effort if you're worried about a short.The Andis Master is definitely a 5 star clipper, but I'm rating the Black Label as 4 because of the price. It is largely the same clipper, with only minor differences. The higher price is definitely paid for the premium look and limited nature of the paint job. If you want a conversation piece in the shop then, by all means, get it. If you're a student or a barber just looking for something to make hair fly, save the money and buy the normal edition.
