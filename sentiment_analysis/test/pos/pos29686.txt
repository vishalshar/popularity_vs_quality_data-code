This was a little pricey for what you are getting but I loved the design and it an immediate talking point with anyone around you, the leather feels great, it's easy to clean, drink stays as warm as any other travel mug, and I even dropped it once but it didn't spill because the lid closure fits pretty snugly. As long as you don't mind the price I would recommend this.
