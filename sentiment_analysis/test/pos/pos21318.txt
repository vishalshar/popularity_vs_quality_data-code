Very convenient and easy to set up.  Basically programs itself.  It's only slightly more expensive than the tedious to program garden variety ones in store.  I always hated standing in the garage or basement for half an hour or more trying to figure out which zones are where and program on/off times.  With the app you can walk around the yard with your phone and activate zones for identification.  The water usage reporting is not accurate but you can't expect it to be as that would require modification to water lines and more hardware.
