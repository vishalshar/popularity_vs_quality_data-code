When I tried the Ultraloq UL3 from U-tec I'll admit I was a little apprehensive. I didn't really like the idea of my door being at the mercy of battery life or a computer. It wasn't long after I opened the box and did a little research that my concerns were laid to rest. When I took the lock out of the box I was surprised by the weight and the quality of its construction. This thing is heavy and well built. Obviously I didn't try to smash it or anything but I can tell it is very well made and won't come apart if it's tampered with. Security being my main concern, I was eager to give it a try at this point.In the box there were a couple of installation templates and instructional booklets along with all the tools and hardware required for installation. The manufacturer boasts that the lock can be installed in ten minutes and they're not far off. It took less than fifteen for me but I have a pretty heavy steel door. That made the drilling a little more difficult. That said, 15 minutes is still very quick to be installing a lock of this nature. It was very easy. Once the lock was mounted on the door, I had it set up for use in a couple more minutes. Again, very easy to set up. Once the lock was mounted and programmed it was time to download the Ultraloq app to my smartphone. Total setup time including the app was 17 -20 minutes tops. I was very impressed.The Ultraloq UL3 is impressive in construction, appearance, and ease of use. However it has many features that make it a very good choice as well. It can store 95 individual fingerprints and 95 individual codes making it great for both home and business environments. The touchpad has no buttons to wear out over time. It is an OLED touchscreen that conveniently senses the users hand to ready itself for code entry. The fingerprint scanner is accurate and easy to use. There is an emergency mechanical key that allows entry even in the event of a power failure or malfunction. Besides normal operation the user can set the lock to either "lockout" or "passage" mode. This allows the lock to be disabled to any entry method other than a key or to be left unlocked until the user is ready. All of this can be managed from your smartphone via Bluetooth 4.0.With the Ultraloq app users can unlock, lock, toggle mode, manage users, and view a entry log. User information can be backed up on the "U-cloud" and imported again so you never lose your setup. Plus there is a "knock" feature that allows you to unlock the door by knocking on your phone even if it's in your pocket. Take everything I've said into consideration and add that the battery life is 8,000 cycles or roughly a year and you have a quality product. Ultraloq offers a 30 day money back guarantee and an 18 month electronic warranty. More information can be found with the manufacturer.When compared to other keyless locks there are areas that the UL3 are stronger and a few that are weaker. That said, you won't find a model with all these features and solid construction for the price. All in all, the Ultraloq UL3 is a quality product that is incredibly easy to use. I highly recommend it.
