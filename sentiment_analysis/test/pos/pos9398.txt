The easiest way to describe this is that it adds to a 3 dimensional experience to music. I've produced music professionally for around 8 years now and can honestly say it has GREATLY improved my mix on the sub side of the low end. It's such a simple thing that I'm shocked it's not been done before but I can see why. At first I tried it on and was thinking "this is just a $300+ vibrating backpack", but within the first two minutes after calibrating then intensity and thumbing through some songs I was thrilled with the results.To mix any type of music with this thing you need to first play a reference track (a song you think is just absolutely mixed perfectly in the sub end), adjust it to fit the desired intensity you think it right for the reference track, then finally play your track and mix your sub end from there. Pop your song in the car, in a venue, or in a club and you will be BLOWN AWAY with how accurate your sub end is of your mix. No more punching the steering wheel of your car or face-palming when your low end overwhelms your mix or is non-existent but it "sounded just fire" in the studio.
