After sleeping on this mattress for a few nights, it is safe to say that it is the best mattress I have ever slept on.  It was easy to get it out of the packaging, and it took less than a few hours for it to expand to its intended size.  The memory foam and latex are such an improvement over my old box spring mattress.
