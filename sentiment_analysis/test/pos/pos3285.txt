it does get pretty warm as previously described and you have to be careful when disconnecting from the macbook but the adapter is very good as you can charge all components including smartphones as well as the computer, do find the SD card slot a bit unnecessary, otherwise I'm very pleased with the purchase and has become a vital component to use peripherals
