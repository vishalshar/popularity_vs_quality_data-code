I'm really growing to love my blue smart suitcase. I take a lot of long weekend trips and this is the perfect suitcase for the job. Perfect size and very durable construction; this suitcase be with me for a while. I like the front pocket to store my laptop in, which frees up space in my backpack. Got to the terminal a little late and all the charge stations are taken? No problem because you just plug into your blue smart and you're good. I don't use it every time but the app gets the job done (lock/unlocking, weighing of your suit case). Overall i've been very pleased with my Blue Smart and I expect that this is the suit case that is laying the ground work for future improvements.
