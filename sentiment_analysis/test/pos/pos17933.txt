Worked great at boosting my dogs immune system to get rid of dog warts (CPV).  My 1 year old lab came down with a case of dog warts.  It wasn't too bad, just two warts on the corner of her mouth that no one could really see.  But being an active puppy it was really hard to keep her away from other dogs and still burn the energy she needed. I did a double dose the first week (4 scoops for my 60 lb lab) and was a little disappointed that the warts didn't seem to change in that first week.  But by the end of week two they were just little white nubs and the end of week 3 they were gone!  I was so worried it would take months and our poor pup would without friends (she love other dogs) but BIXBI immunity worked great!!
