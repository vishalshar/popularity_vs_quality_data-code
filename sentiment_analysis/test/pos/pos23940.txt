I bought this speaker to mount to my bike when adventure biking. After testing this speaker mounts nice and tight to every single angle of the bike. The sound is extremely loud and clear. I have purchased speakers at 25w and this one seems way louder and absolutely full of clear bass. I have tested the waterproof function and it defintely is splash proof and waterproof. I must say for this price range I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and speaker.In addition This speaker comes with tons of accessories including a WATERPROOF travel case which i find so be super durable. It also includes a remote control to use when biking to avoid using your device. After testing the playtime at mid level volume I would say it pushes between 20 and 30 hours of playtime which is more than enough for my long trips.
