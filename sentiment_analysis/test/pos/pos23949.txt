Update:  I got to say that as soon as i contacted the seller they were amazing about helping me solve the problem and replace the unit.They recommended that I completely discharged the unit and charge it back so it will reset.I did and it started working fine.I have used a couple more times with no further problems.The only reason I don't give this products the fifth star is because it didn't work fine from the beginning.Hopefully the problem is permanently fixed, althoug I got to say I am a little nervous about handling the speaker with sweaty hands and gloves during a ride, i change the position from the front water bottle cage to the back cage in order to avoid sweat from dripping in the speaker buttons area.  I also covered that area with plastic wrap paper so there is no way of any water leaking through the buttons while pressing them nor through the mic hole.Keep you posted on any changes----------------------------------------------------------------------------I give this product a one star because it's the minimum, otherwise I will rate it even lower because it is advertised as waterproof but after only one cycling ride and a little sweat it broke down.  None of the button work anymore or they do something different than what they are supposed to do.I rode once and it worked fine, but today on its second ride it failed misserably. It wasn't raining or anything it just got some sweat on it as it was set on one of my water bottle cages (as advertised).I wrote an email to the seller this morning and I haven't received any answer.  I will keep you posted on any development.  Hopefully their Customer Service is better.
