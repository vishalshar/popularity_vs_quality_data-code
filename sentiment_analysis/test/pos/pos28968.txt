Solution to huge pores!! For years expensive facial cleaners, only to look at my 10xmagnified face mirror with disappointment! I could see black dots in every single pore- gross but true. I was curious reading that this soap was organic, handmade, natural ingredients and bamboo charcoal soap is an ancient soap. I noticed a huge difference instantly! The first time I used it I was so excited to see a change in my skin, finally! I dry brush my face before hand and then wash my face and I am so happy to watch all the deep blackheads disappear! This is the first time I have ever written a review and this product is amazing in many ways. You feel your skin is clean and a tightens your face in a good way. I realized it lathers quite a bit so I broke my soap in half so it would last longer. My back has cleared up too! Had a few pimples on it and they are gone. I am hooked on this soap- for life. Really. The smell is refreshing & light- grapefruit scented but it does not make your skin smell after. It is charcoal so it is black but washes off and I don't notice any residue after my baths. I want to give a bar to all my friends. It is that awesome. Don't hesitate - your skin will love you!
