Is it magic?! I don't really know (or care) how and why these bags work, but they do, and they work great!For years I've tried various combinations of plastic wrap, aluminum foil, waxed paper, etc., but nothing has worked until I discovered Formaticum! No more moldy cheese! - What I Use This For: Primarily I keep an 8 oz. brick of cheddar in a Formaticum bag, although I occasionally buy slices and store them in a bag.  - How I Use This:  I place the cheese toward the bottom of the bag, and then simply fold it closed, wrapping the excess bag around the cheese. I place it back in the fridge so that it stays folded.  I always use a new bag for each new cheese I bring home. I make sure that my hands are clean and dry and that any surface I lay the cheese on is also clean and dry. These bags work best when the cheese never has a chance to become contaminated with other food, or moisture.
