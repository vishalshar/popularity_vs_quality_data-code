A fantastic cord that holds up well. Gladly am using it as a replacement to the cheaply built, easily destroyed Apple lightning cable. Haven't really run into any issues with this, however on a few occasions, I've noticed it not charging my phone, and I would have to straighten the cord out in order to continue using it. I have had this for a few months now. Another note; after a while of playing with it (because it's too tempting not to) I noticed little squeaks as the cord moves. Not sure if this is a bad thing, it still works, I use it as my main cord for charging my iPhone 6.
