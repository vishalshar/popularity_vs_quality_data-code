These are great tweezers and fit securely in their attachment holder which can fit on a key ring if desired without fear of them falling off.  I have these in my first aid kit and they can grab the smallest of foreign objects from fingers and other places.  I really can't imagine these ever wearing out but if they do I'll quickly buy another pair.I've given these as gifts and love the fact that they're made in the USA.
