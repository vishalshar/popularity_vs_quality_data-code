Great product that every traveler or avid phone user should have. I travel a lot and this makes transferring images/data extremely convenient. Not to mention charging on the go with any USB port available. Build quality is superb, material is flexible and durable and I have no worries that this product will remain intact through the tough wear and tear many keychain items endure.
