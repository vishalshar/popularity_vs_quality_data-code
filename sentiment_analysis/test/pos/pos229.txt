I read about this product and was contemplating on purchasing it, however I have had under arm laser hair removal so I wasn't too worried about the irritation that some people get.  THIS STUFF WORKS LIKE MAGIC. I truly don't understand how they were able to figure out such a perfect combination, I keep trying to test it in different ways and somehow it works better than my aluminum in deodorants ( like degree). I keep waiting for that one day where it will wear out in a few hours, and it never happened! I smell amazing alllll day in disbelief. I did another test thinking maybe I'm just not a smelly person anymore, so I wore the Healthy Deoderant (Lavanilla) to see if it works the same for me and absolutely not, I smelled horrible with zero activity within  a few hours.  So do yourself the favor and avoid those horrible aluminum deoderatnts that cause breast cancer and TRY this one ( I got lavender smell, it's not strong and doesn't interfere with perfume) and it really works wonders. I'm still just shocked. THANK YOU who ever came up with this product! Where have you been my whole life
