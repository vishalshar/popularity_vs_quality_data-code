Super cool robot. Our 8 year old grandson loved it, we bought this one and the version for younger kids for our other grandson. They were both great hits. I did a lot of research because I was looking at dome other techie things for the older one but the reviews were all great with this guy. Seems the reviews were correct and the price was really not that bad for a toy like this,
