This case is a beast and by a beast, I mean in a good way!  I love the fact that my watch is waterproof.  I love the fact that my watch is protected and the color scheme is awesome!  The band is a nice soft silicone.  The only thing that doesn't seem to gel is the plastic piece that's used on the clasp.  It doesn't move very fluently on the silicone band.  The crown is responsive and the button is responsive also.  The crown needs a little bit of pressure when using it to zoom in and out.  Other than that, this is a great case and I love it!  I would definitely purchase this case again.
