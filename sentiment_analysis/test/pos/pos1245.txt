I like this product a lot. Some people say it's a mascara; I disagree with that. It is not waxy at all and doesn't build up volume or length. It seems to stay on most of the day, and I haven't noticed any flaking or making dark circles under my eyes (and haven't noticed anyone laughing and pointing, either). It does color your lashes with just one coat so they will appear longer since the tips are now darker. I haven't seen any advantage to using more than one coat. This is nice to wear on days when you're not glamming it up and just want your lashes to be visible. I like the conditioning aspect but haven't noticed a significant difference from using it in that regard. I'll buy this again.
