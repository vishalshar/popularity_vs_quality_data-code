After nearly losing my dog due not eating on his own for 17 days it was recommended that I feed Seamus and my other puppy, Paddy grain free, wet food that's low in fat. Solid Gold has been their food ever since and they LOVE it. Paddy used to eat his dry food once every 1 to 3 days. Now? He's waiting twice per day to gobble it up!
