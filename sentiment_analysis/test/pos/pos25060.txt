I like these much better than the premium blue ones.  First, love the fact that each tray comes with a disposable bag.  With the blue ones I have to use my own trash bag.  Because, let's face it, if you put the lid on the blue tray and turn it on it's side to place it in your trash can like it's shown in the ad, all the litter slides to the bottom, the lid comes off and out goes the litter.  I keep the cover (not actually a lid) and put it underneath the tray, then when I'm done with the tray, I put the cover on top and slide it in the bag.  You have to be a little careful, though, to make sure the edges of the tray don't tear the bag.  Once the tray is in the bag, I've had no problem with the bag tearing when carrying it to the trash.  Also, better packaging all around.  The bag of white litter is the full size of the tray, so there's no extra (wasted) cardboard to hold the half sized bag of blue litter in place.  I've had no problem with the Velcro tabs either; smart idea!  And, I've found no difference in "smell retention" with blue vs. white litter, so I'm not exactly sure what makes blue "premium" other than maybe the blue hides the yellow, therefore, it's not as unsightly.  And last, depending on what day it is, these are typically less expensive than the premium blue.
