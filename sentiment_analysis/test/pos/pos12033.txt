Yesterday I dropped my new phone from a height of about 3.5 feet, onto a concrete floor.  It landed squarely face down with a thud. The phone sustained no damage whatever, thanks to the UAG case. I previously owned an M8 and had purchased a UAG case to protect it, and had the same good experience with it, too. Urban Armor Gear is top quality.
