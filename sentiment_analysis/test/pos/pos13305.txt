Love this product! It's basically a giant wet-wipe, but it's so nice and thick and doesn't leave a sticky residue. I used during Ragnar Relay Chicago - after all 3 of my legs (9.9mi, 3.1mi, &5.2mi in the 90 degree heat!) instead of a regular shower and I didn't feel too bad! These were MADE for Ragnar. I shared with my vanmates and I was basically a hero.
