This is a very useful item. Riding on a keychain, it has spared me the misery of a dead phone many times. Much less bulky than a normal cord. But, sadly, no more durable. After a few months of riding with me, the plastic began to crack. I managed to repair it, with some difficulty. Hesitantly recommended.
