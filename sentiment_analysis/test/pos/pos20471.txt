I completed the transition eliminating my wallet about a year ago and have been using a "wallet case" ever since.  I have tried a few different brands/types and had been using a Sena leather case for the past 6 months.  The biggest issue with it was that over time the leather stretched and the cards I keep in it (my debit card, credit card, work credit card, license and metrocard) got loose and if I took one out, it risked having all of the others fall out.  With this Jimmy case, since the card holder is elastic, the stretching out thing is not an issue.  The wood backing is a nice touch too.  I guess one improvement I would make would be to rather than have cover the volume and on/off button, to just have them exposed the way the vibrate switch is exposed.  HOWEVER, I gave Jimmy case a 5 star rating because when I reached out to them to complain about the charger port space not being big enough to seat the standard Apple charging cable, they sent me a FREE case that had been updated to expand the size of the charger port, and they didn't even ask for me to send the old one back.  In the age of crappy customer service, these guys demonstrated they stand behind their products and will do what it takes to satisfy their customers.
