Fyi, I have only had and tested this thing for less than a week. If and/or when my satisfaction with it changes, I will update this review.Setup: it took a few tries to get my phone to connect to it via Bluetooth.Operation: I placed it in a centrally located room on my first floor and it was able to hear every smoke alarm in my 1400sf home including one in an upstairs bedroom with its door closed and one in the basement also with its door closed. It sent me a notification to its app on my phone and also called me when I wouldn't acknowledge the message on the app. I tried it multiple times on multiple days and it worked every time. It also works with IFTTT so I have it turn on my kitchen lights when it detects a smoke alarm (they are connected to a WEMO light switch) Nest owners you can have it turn off your boiler if it detects CO gas. In my opinion this is an awesome little device that everyone who has Wi-Fi should own.
