First off, I am a claw/hybrid gripper with 19 cm hands. I have tried out the Logitech G303 (poor shape for my hands), Logitech G502 (way too heavy), Corsair M65 Pro (unfortunately hurt my wrist and a tad too heavy), Mionnic Avior 7000 (not quite the right shape), Razer DA Chroma (far too light and felt cheap), and the Zowie ZK2 (a tad too small).Frankly, all of these mice would be go-to favorites are any number of people.  However, the Mionix Castor has them all beat (for me), and it's because of the total package:1. 10/10 build quality.2. 10/10 weight and balance3. 11/10 right-handed ergonomic shape (cannot comment on the EC1/2-A)4. 9/10 Sensor (PMW3310, same as Zowie)5. 9/10 medium force, uncheap clicks6. 10/10 big-ass teflon feet, feels like it's gliding on air on my cloth pad.7. 8/10 Mouse wheel in roll and button7. 7/10 software that is fully adequate but certainly not the best8. ?/10 LEDs who caresAll-in-all, a truly quality product that my hand instantly took a liking to, and one that my aim is quickly adjusting (very well) to as well.I would recommend this mouse to any right-handed person that would listen.
