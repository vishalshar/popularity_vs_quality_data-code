It's as cool as a jackhammer!  If that jackhammer were made of frozen moonshine filled with angry killer bees!The steel rim make for a good feel when drinking from it and the strap makes sure you won't lose it after drinking the massive amount of liquid it holds.  You will forget what happened, but the horn will be right where you left it.  Plus, it will be ready to fill up again for that important morning hair of the dog.The stand is a nice touch and it looks pretty good as man-cave decoration.  A row of them along a bench in front of a barrel full of mead would look even better!The rather pain nature is actually a plus.  It looks good as is but if you're a ren geek or whatever it should be seen as a blank slate to do with as you will.  It's even thick enough to (carefully) carve into it with a dremel if you have all that time on your hands.Overall, it's a big win.  Save the real horns for hanging on the wall.
