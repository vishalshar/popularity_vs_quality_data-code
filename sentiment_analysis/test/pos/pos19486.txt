I bought this for my wife as a Christmas present and she LOVES IT!When my wife upgraded her phone she bought a generic case at the cell phone store but it was sorta plain and boring. She wanted something more stylish but also functional so I bought her a JimmyCASE. We went out for New Years and it was great. She put our credit cards and driver's license in the pocket and then used Uber to get around town. No bulky purse to carry  (an leave in the Uber Car) and everything was in one pocket. This made us both very happy!She gets comments all the time about how stylish it is and how clever the pocket is. I was worried that maybe things would fall out of the pocket but everything stays in rock solid. I'm really impressed by how nice it looks (the wood grain is really classy) and the bumper around the edges looks like it will protect the phone from a fall without adding additional bulk to the size.My boss has a birthday coming up and I think I'm going to get him a JimmyCASE. He's really difficult to shop for (but a good guy). However I think I'll get him the one with the Black Pocket. It'll go with his black AMEX card better.  Ha!We've had no problems with the charger fitting at all. I'm not sure why other people are commenting on this. Our car charger and phone charger fits just fine.I was impressed by the packaging as well as the overall look of it. I hate when companies over package products, (so much waste) but I'd loved seeing that the JimmyCASE is made in the USA and that the packacking was cool looking. It makes me happy that I'm supporting American jobs!
