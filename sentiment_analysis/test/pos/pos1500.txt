My favorite styles of board/card games are "hidden role/deduction" and "cooperative/team-based" games.  I have many:  Spyfall, Whoowasit, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Werewolf, Mafia, etc., and Salem is one of my favorites.This game does a fantastic job of combining:* The Werewolf/Mafia element of the day and night phases (during the night phase, people close their eyes and certain roles "wake up" before the day phase),* A cooperative/team element where the Puritans are all on the good team, and the witches are on the evil team, and* The "evil spreading" element from the movie, The Thing, and the board game, Panic Room, which is based on the movie "The Thing."Additionally, this game is balanced superbly...not something all team-based games can boast.  My family recently played a game and the game came down to one (1) witch against (1) puritan, and the witch BARELY won!Gameplay is excellent.  Our family was accusing everyone of being a witch...one was bluffing!  Everyone was suspicious, and no one knew for sure who was who.  Suspicion like this through the whole game is a true testament to the excellence of a game.The art on the cards is great and my family truly enjoyed reading about the history of the characters in this game (the characters are based on the real life trials of witches in Salem).  Each character has a "special ability," which I also really like in hidden role/deduction games and cooperative games.One thing I want to point out:  I consider Werewolf and Mafia to be a "light game," meaning that there isn't much strategy in those games as compared to others.  This game has much more depth than Werewolf and Mafia.I will definitely be bringing this game to my game nights.  Whether you are playing this with family or other gamers, I'm sure all will enjoy.  And, if you are a hidden role/deduction game enthusiast, this game is a must.
