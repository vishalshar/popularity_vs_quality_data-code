These are very high quality, but as previous reviewers indicated, there are not many different emotion options. Some of them are unclear what the correct answers should be, but I think that also makes for an interesting lesson about how it's not always that easy to tell on a person either. I might make my own supplement cards of other emotions, but otherwise very pleased.
