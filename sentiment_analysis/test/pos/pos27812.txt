This is the first filament I have bought for my new printer but it seems to print very well.  Thus far I have not had any tangles (i've read some horror stories about those) and it seems to be of very good quality for the money.  I will definitely be buying more and i'd recommend you try some as well.  It is also VERY bright green!  I've read some reviews of other green PLA that wasn't as bright as they expected.
