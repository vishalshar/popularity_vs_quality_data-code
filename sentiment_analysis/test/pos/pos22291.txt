I love veggie pastas, even if I can't digest them as easily as traditional pasta. (Meaning that without probiotics, I get gassy. So I just take probiotics before and after eating veggie pastas and I am just fine.) I don't have any pasta related allergies, so I don't *need* to seek alternatives, I just enjoy having options.The box is surprisingly empty, the pasta is filled to barely reach the top of the window on the front of the box. The height of the cardboard could be cut in half...it's kind of a waste of box, but it's not a big deal in the end. I boiled salted water, and added the chickpea penne like ordinary pasta. I cooked it until it was my preferred texture, and strained away the cooking water. I dressed it with a chunky sauce and a drizzle of green chili infused oil. It was delicious! The penne was a little chewier than traditional pasta, but I like that. Also, my leftovers the next day weren't soggy, this pasta doesn't absorb liquids over night.I am very pleased with this pasta, and will happily buy it again! ?
