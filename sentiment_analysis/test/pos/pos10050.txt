Our 5 yr old Airedale was diagnosed with hip dysplasia about 6 mo. ago when she was limping really badly. I didn't want to just medicate her on Rimadyl, and did a bunch of research. This product came highly recommended by our dog trainer and it's been fabulous. It's a totally affordable way to manage her hip dysplasia without having her be drugged with an doggy insead. It really made a big difference in about 3 weeks and she hasn't had to take any drugs since.
