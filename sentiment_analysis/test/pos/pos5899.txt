When it turned out that the URL to the owner's manual was useless and I couldn't set the power levels without the manual, the online support person was outstanding in getting it for me.  She really made the difference in my experience.  The five levels of correction on the collar are really useful.  The very pricey little battery is my only complaint, but since I remove the collar and shut it off every night, it's lasted over the three months it was expected to.  I haven't changed it yet.
