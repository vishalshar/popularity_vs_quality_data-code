There are several different items in this product listing. This  review is specifically on the Skylink SK-200 kit.The Skylink SK-200 kit is a good starting point for an economy home security system. There are no monthly fees and sensors in the kit are all wirelessly connected to the keypad/hub. It is not monitored by a service and will not call the police or fire department in event of an emergency. It's more of a notification system than security systemThis is a proprietary system. It does not interact with open or other proprietary connected home systems. With a wired only network connection on the hub and the general feeling of system seems a bit old-school. On the other hand this is a proven system with a history and that's a plus in my mind.WHAT'S IN THE BOXThe kit is very well packaged and contains everything needed to get going except AA/AAA batteries and tools like a screwdriver for mounting the sensors on a door/window or the motion sensor on a wall.  In the box:- 1 motion sensor (needs AA battery)- 2 window/door sensors (needs one AAA battery)- 1 key chain remote (includes coin battery)- 1 Keypad/hub (4AAA batteries for power backup)- 1 power adapter for keypad/hub- 1 LAN cable- Mounting accessories for the sensors/keypad- instructions in English and Spanish- 2 SkyLinkNet window stickersThere are a number of additional sensors and devices available for the SkyLinkNet including video cameras. additional key chain controllers, garage door sensor, keypads, video cameras, etc.SETUPThe installation is well documented in the instructions and starts with the hub. It requires a WIRED network connection with internet access. Most home routers will work just fine. The keypad/hub has an AC power adapter and 4 AAA batteries in case the power goes out.  If your internet connection does not have battery backup the AAA batteries can at least sound the rather loud and annoying alarm. Don't expect much more in a power outage!Next put batteries in your sensors. They are all battery power only. The included instructions walk you through this step-by-step. When mounting the sensors in their locations pay attention to the instructions. All the mounting screws and plates are included in the kit.THE SKYLINKNET APPTo put the pieces together  as an alarm system install the skylinknet app. I have an iPhone 6 so I went to the app store for the free download. NOTE: there are two skylink apps and you want the blue one. The red one will NOT work with this kit.The SkylinkNet app will walk you through the sign-up process which requires an email confirmation. Next it will help you connect your hub and your account. Enter your hub ID and pass code (arm/disarm digits).  Once the keypad/hub is setup you can add sensors and devices.  The app provides step-by-step instructions. Getting the app, account hub and sensors setup was very easy with good guidance.One aspect I was not very happy about was the amount of battery drain the app brought to my phone. With alerts enabled my battery life dropped by about 1/3. Given how the app constantly monitors the hub status I don't find this surprising and probably a very reasonable price to use the SkyLinkNet system.CONTROL:From the SkyLinkNet app you have control and monitoring can arm/disarm the system in the home/away modes or set off the panic alarm (like if you think someone might have entered your downstairs unauthorized). On top of this you can see the status of all your sensors and devices. Pretty much total system control from anywhere with internet access.OPERATION:The door/window sensors operate exactly as I expect they should. There isn't a lot to say about them.The motion sensor seems to have better range than I expected when mounted correctly. I initially mounted it in a corner and it seemed to have very poor range. When I moved it to the center of a wall range improved dramatically. The instructions show it mounted in the middle of a ceiling.The key chain remote is kind of large in my pocket but convenient. So far operates to arm/disarm home/away mode and set off the panic alarm as expected.CONCLUSIONS:I like the SkyLinkNet SK-200 starter kit. It provides me a good monitoring/alarm system at a modest price with simple wireless installation (except the hub). The iPhone app worked fine and provided timely updates about the status of all the sensors, but reduced my iPhone 6 battery life by about a third.As a proprietary entry-level/starter home alarm/monitoring system at a modest price the SkyLinkNet SK-200 starter kit is a good beginning on a budget. I think it's worth 5 stars at that level of expectation.I received a free sample in exchange for an honest review.
