We bought two of these phones.  LOVE the phones, BUT...would like to see1.  SD capability required.  We use SanDisk Ultra 128GB Dual USB Drive 3.0 (SDDD2-128G-G46) to expand our storage.  It works, but is a pain  to mount and unmount the USB.2.  Need HDMI out.3.  Would like to be able to alphabetize apps on screen, not just in apps from settings. I'm sure this is an Android issue.4.  Must have holder/carriers that fit the phone.  Most pockets will not hold this phone.Overall this is a wonderful phone.  With the addition of an SD slot for additional storage and the HDMI output it would be the most awesome phone I have ever owned.  I also added an INSLIP [...] to the back of the case and it takes any strain off of my hand in using this large (easily viewed) phone.
