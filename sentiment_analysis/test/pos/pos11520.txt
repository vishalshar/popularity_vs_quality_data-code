If you have dark skin, do yourself a favor, and buy this undershirt. My skin isn't quite this tone; I'm more of a yellow brown, but the shirt is still invisible under my dress shirts that I wear to work every day. I look much better in this undershirt than I do when I wear theÂ nude-colored undershirts offered by Tommy John, which are really only meant for pale-skinned men, and leave visible lines on me . This undershirt is also soft, comfortable, and smooth. After I wore one for a day, I bought four more so I could wear one every day of the week.
