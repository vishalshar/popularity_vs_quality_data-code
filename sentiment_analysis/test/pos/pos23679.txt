I bought the Santa Barbara Ranch and Tomato Garlic. I thought maybe if the garlic was overpowering I could at least put them as a garnish into some tomato soup. It wasn't at all too strong and they will be a great side item to a lite lunch. Both are awesome at 105 calories a serving and a quick way to curb a craving for a bigger meal, with 4.2grams of protein. Yum yum yum.
