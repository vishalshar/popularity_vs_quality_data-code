Look - it's $250.  Even "semi-professional" IR cameras that cost 4x the price only have 70 x 90 pixels - this has 156 x 206 pixels.  So OK, it's still not like watching heat in HD, BUT IT'S $250!!!  And You can take it wherever because it weighs ounces.  They used to have to fill thermal imagers w/liquid helium to make them work!  Now U can casually walk down the street and see exactly HOW MUCH energy is being dispelled by everything around U - and it's A LOT!  Pot growhouse?  Oh, over there.  Where's the plumbing in this wall?  Oh!  There it is.  Waitress brings Ur cold eggs and everyone else's are hot?  Show her!  "Nope, haven't driven it all day" - then why's it hot?  AND U CAN RECORD IT ALL TO MEMORY, STILL OR MOVIE!!!  C'mon - what's not to like?  Pls support these guys - I bet they'll have it in HD in a few years!  Very satisfied.
