Its very mild.  Let me start there.  For past year I have been cold brewing with the toddy and OXO systems.  I love cold brew.  But I am kinda to the point of being tired of the mess of brewing it - like getting rid of a pound of grounds every week, brewing unit drips, etc.  So I thought about outsourcing it ;)The two main easy to find are Trader Joe's and Bizzy.  I tried Bizzy first.First - understand my tastes.  I have cold brewed basically all Starbucks bean varieties - ones they recommend and most all the rest.  I typically brew a pound with as much water will fit in the OXO or Toddy and let it sit for 24 hours.  Then my ratio is as strong as 1:1 with milk or 1:2 with water.I mixed the Bizzy 1:1 with 2% milk over ice which is my normal - and it was very light in color and taste.  I would have to mix this 2:1 with milk to taste like some of the stronger starbucks beans.Ultimately I will pass on this as it is too weak.  It gets costly when a bottle lasts 1-2 days.A few side notes:Everyone is different - maybe this lighter option is perfect for you.Bizzy reached out to me to ask how I liked it - they seem to be interested in customer care.Their logo, name and stickers you get are cool!No matter where your tastes are, I think many would like a different size option.  Like 32oz bottles - just less waste.  Since I would go through a 16oz bottle every other day at worst, it just feels like a lot of waste.
