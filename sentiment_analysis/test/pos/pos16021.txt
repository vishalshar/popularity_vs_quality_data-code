I've got two boys that are avid football players. They swear by this stuff! An exact quote from one of my sons is "it's like the gloves are brand new".  They each have their own favorite set of gloves that they wear when they play. They put some of the Grip Boost on their gloves, and it makes them tacky as if the gloves were new. I used to have to buy them new gloves every season, but this is going to save me a ton of money :)  Definitely recommended.
