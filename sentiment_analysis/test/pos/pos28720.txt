I'll be the first to admit that I'm not very informed on what makes a speaker great. I'm basically the person who says "does sound come out of it? Okay so it's good then, right?" But this speaker is so clearly incredible, that even I could tell. I took it out to the beach with me, and despite all the noise it was clear, loud, and beautiful.And, it still looks and acts brand new despite a rather unfortunate mishap where I dropped it on the sand, and then accidentally spilled water on it. I was so happy to see that it held up so well despite me being a clutz.It also has really nice battery life, and I love taking it places. It fits easily into all bags I have, and it's incredibly easy to use. I also love the color (I got the teal), and it was just cool.
