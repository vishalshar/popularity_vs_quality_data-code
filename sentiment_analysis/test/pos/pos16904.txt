I was wary when I ordered the Leaf after reading the reviews posted here. I have to say, I have been pleasantly surprised so far. It is really unusual and attractive. Activity tracker matched up with time and info on my treadmill. Sleep tracker accurately recorded my sleep, including about an hour when my sleep was disturbed. I have tried using to on the chain, clipped to my shirt and as a bracelet. Only minor issue so far is that the bracelet is almost too small for a bigger girl. It is leather, so I suppose it will stretch out a bit. So far, so good.
