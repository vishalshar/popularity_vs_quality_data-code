Outstanding jacket for riding and jogging!  I'm 6' 0" 200 lbs with an athletic build and originally ordered a Large based on some of the other reviews.  The Large did fit but it was too tight for anything more than a t-shirt underneath and it restricted my flexibility to get in a riding position.  The Amazon exchange process worked flawlessly and now I have an XL that fits great.  As with most riding tops, the sleeves and back side are slightly longer to provide coverage in a bent over riding position.One thing I would like to note is that the zipper attaches opposite what most men's jackets or pants do; the pull part of the zipper is on the left side rather than the right.  I'm not sure if this is a European thing since the jacket is made in the UK.
