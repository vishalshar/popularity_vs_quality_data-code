I met Joshua in Austin, TX a few weeks ago and finally found the micro wallet I'd been looking for. The perfect slim device to hold a few credit cards/ID and some cash. The bonus that makes this perfect is you can stick it on the back of your cell phone, or not, using the sticky pad for your ID if desired as a solo wallet without the phone.
