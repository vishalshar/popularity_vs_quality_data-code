I love the Rock Your Hair products! This works just like a leave-in conditioner/detangler should, and it doesn't leave my hair flat. I suffer from very fine, thin hair, so finding a product that doesn't weight it down is vital. Also the bottle is super cute, and my daughter likes to keep them to put water in. I usually like to buy these products from our Sally's Beauty Supply store, but I was visiting my sister and didn't have one close, so I ordered off of here. It is cheaper through Amazon, and Amazon always delivers fast, so it was a perfect solution to not being able to take mine through airport security. I just wish they had more travel-size bottles of their products. :)
