I've had this for only a few months, and it's already come in handy so many times.  It's small enough that I can keep it on my keychain on a permanent basis, so at any moment all I need to charge my phone is a USB slot somewhere - which at this point, are really ubiquitous.  I'm extra impressed that it can charge at 2 amps - meaning it can "fast charge" if the slot you're plugging it into is the right kind.  I have not honestly used it for data transfer, as I find transferring things cloud-wise to generally be easier, but I can see no reason there would be any issue using it for that as well.
