I bought this because the two pieces of the case could be used as a card tray as you pickup/discard the cards.  I think it has an innovative design where the two pieces are the same, but it fits together as the case and can be opened as a card tray.I honestly didn't try this with a standard deck of 52 cards.  I bought it to use for playing Uno and quickly realized that my set of Uno cards was too larger for this carrier.  I finally gave up and accepted that there isn't a case for my Uno cards and sewed my own in fabric.  Nevertheless, I'll keep this card caddy to use as a card tray so that I don't have to keep "straightening" the pile throughout the game play.
