I love this watch.  It's very stylish and is indistinguishable from a classic men's watch if you don't know what you're looking for.  Sleep tracking is pretty good, step tracking is great.  I don't need much more than that.The silicone band is ugly as sin, though.  I replaced it immediately with a leather band from the watch store down the street for $30.  The leather band from Withings is a disgusting $100.  It would be nice to have a quick-release leather band, so I could use this while swimming from time to time.  I'm not paying $100 for a watch band, though.In short, this is a great, stylish watch if you're willing to replace the band it comes with immediately.  If you want to swim with it, though, you might want to consider the Activite Pop.
