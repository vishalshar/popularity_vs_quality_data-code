We have 3 dogs - we drive them to the park everyday for a walk. And while we do our best to keep the car clean - dogs still smell. Sometimes it starts to rain on the walk, so you are loading three wet dogs in the car. Sometimes its super hot, so you load three hot drooling dogs in the car. After a while - it smells!! We tried cleaning more - nothing. Febreeze - nothing. Air fresheners - nothing. Nothing seemed to work, or it just smelled like flowers on top of dog stink. So I went to amazon to look for other options. I've always heard about the trick of putting charcoal in your car to absorb odors. And this PURGGO air freshener was along this line - but in a nicely packaged format. I figured we could give it a shot.We put in the car one evening....and within about 2 days, the smell was gone. The car didn't smell good or bad - it had no smell at all!!! Totally sold on this. I was so close to just giving in and assuming we would have a car that smells like dog - which is super embarassing when you have to use the car to drive friends and family around. Now, we don't have to worry about the smell. If PURGGO can now just come up with something to "absorb" the dog hair - then we will be in business!!!
