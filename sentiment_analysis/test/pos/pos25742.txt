The build of this device exactly matches the gold MacBook. That is something I liked about this. Pretty much everything works fine except a few minor things to take into consideration.1. The device gets extremely hot when plugged into the MacBook. I'm not sure why this is but evertime I go to take it out I'm shocked by how hot it is.  It's almost to the point where it may burn me.  I only plug it in for maybe an hour or so and it heats up.2. The device is hard to pull out. I struggle with taking it out of the MacBook. Sometimes I wonder if I'll break the device. It's to that point.3. It's pricey. I paid about 70 dollars for this.  Is it worth it? Depends if there are others on the market. I bought it when the MacBook was relatively new so it was pricey. There may be better options for cheaper.4. I wish they had put another port.  Maybe an HDMI port or another USB type c.This has all the necessary ports you would really need on the go. But you'd have to buy additional adapters for HDMI or thunderbolt.
