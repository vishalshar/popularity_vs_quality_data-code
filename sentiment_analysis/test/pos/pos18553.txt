How clever.  I gave this to my husband who often does not have reading glasses when out and about.  He put this onto his phone case and should be ready the next time.  It attached easily and I don't think he can tell the difference in the thickness of his phone. The glasses seem to work fine in an emergency. So far a great purchase.
