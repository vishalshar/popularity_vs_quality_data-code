I'm very happy with my choice in getting this drone. Its my first one and I had trouble deciding which brand to go with. In the end, I picked the Autel because it seemed almost identical to the DJI Phantom except this one came with a nice case, what seems like a better controller, and its orange. It looks awesome. Its been really easy to fly so far, and the shots i get are great. I'm excited to finally be a part of the drone movement haha.
