I am 4 weeks post-partum and able to fit in the loosest of my pre-pregnancy pants already.  I credit some of this to Mama Strut.  I didn't wear this until I got home from the hospital, but I went from looking 6 months pregnant to 3 months pregnant within a week once I started to wear this.  I didn't realize when I purchased this how much I would appreciate the perineal support straps.  I wasn't ready to use them initially but after a few days, I felt like I needed some added support and started to use them.  What a difference it made for me!  The only thing that I don't like about the Mama Strut is the bottom part which is sort of like biker shorts.  It stretches out and rolls up which means you have to wear loose fitting pants for this to go unnoticed beneath pants. Otherwise, this is on my must-have list for new moms.
