My dog is crazy for this!  Only a teaspoon, mixed with warm water, which I blend with her dry food, and she's entranced. The chicken and veggies magically appear as soon as the water hits the product. No lumps, no problems with dissolving.  A little goes a long way.  As soon as my dog sees me with the container in hand, she is wacko.  This has ended her finicky attitude towards her kibble.  Love this so much. I heartily endorse this. I've been using this for about two months.
