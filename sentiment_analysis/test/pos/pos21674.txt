I have tried Rhythm's kale chips in the past and always enjoyed them. I was looking to try other flavors so I went with the variety pack. Being a Prime member, I was able to get free shipping so that was a definite plus. I also saved a few dollars purchasing the variety pack on Amazon rather than buying them at my local grocery store Â– and I didn't have to leave my house! I have had mixed results when ordering grocery items from Amazon so I was worried about the kale chips getting crushed but I was pleasantly surprised. Upon arrival, the outer box was in excellent condition. The additional box inside holding the kale chips bags prevented them from sliding around or getting crushed. The Original flavor are your basic kale chip with a light seasoning. They have a nice, crunchy texture and aren't too hard OR too crumbly like other brands. My favorite flavor was Zesty Nacho because it gave me my Dorito fix without the guilt. The Kool Ranch is pretty addicting as well and I was happy that it wasn't over seasoned. My least favorite was the Mango Habanero but my husband loved them. I would definitely order again!
