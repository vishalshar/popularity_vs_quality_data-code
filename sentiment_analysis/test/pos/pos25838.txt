I was initially hesitant to pay this much for a lunch bag, but knowing now that it's the only one I'll ever need, I'm more than happy to have spent the extra money.It fits three cans of soda along with a medium to large tupperwear container and there's still room for a snack or two. It looks really professional and blends in with my laptop case when I walk into work everyday so I don't look like a grade school kid toting a lunch box around.
