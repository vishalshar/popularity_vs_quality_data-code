It is a very nice device. The heart rate does not always work. I wish the font was bigger. I also wish it was waterproof. I do not use it for tracking, so I am not sure about the syncing with other apps. The amazfit app works fine for me. I do love the long lasting battery, I have only had to charge my watch once since purchasing it.
