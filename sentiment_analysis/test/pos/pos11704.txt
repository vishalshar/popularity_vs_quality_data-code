I'd like to rate this higher, because I LOVE my Emberlit UL Stove, but 5 star is a s high as you can go ;-) This is exactly what I was looking for. My Emberlit Fireant stove came with a nice case included. Total weight of this ultra light Titanium stove in its pouch I just weighed in at 3.8 oz.I also bought the larger Emberlit Titanium UL and it too is a great stove and just a little bigger (2" taller and 7 oz total weight). However it comes with a cheap case and you have to pay $10 more for a proper pack case that will hold up. Boohoo. I love both stoves, but will likely opt for the tiny Fireant most of the time. Clearly it is a stove which you can use as a fire pit to where fires are not allowed . . . cause its clearly a pack stove.
