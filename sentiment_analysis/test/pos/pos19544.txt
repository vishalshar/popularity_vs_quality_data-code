honestly i didn't think it was gonna be this awesome. it effortlessly syncs and increases your macbook storage like WOW. i was considering buying a SSD and installing it myself but i was scared of voiding my warranty.... however, with this bad boy i no longer have to take apart my macbook or do much really because i now have like 370 gb vs 128 ?
