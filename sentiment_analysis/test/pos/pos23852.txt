MADE IN THE USA AND IT SHOWS! Before I bought the URB-E I bought an EcoReco M5 Air. After having to repair the EcoReco every week because something else was breaking on it, I finally gave up and bought an URB-E. It is SO nice to finally have a made in the US product that is well built and is quality and not some piece of crap thrown together Chinese piece of junk. This thing is SOLID and so well built it's incredible. I had to have a modification made to my URB-E and dropped it off today and had to ride the EcoReco to work. Guess what? The EcoReco broke AGAIN! This is about the 5th time the EcoReco has broke on me. Because the URB-E is made and built in the US, the quality is top notch. It's solid and nothing goes wrong with it. No loose screws, broken motors, wires, etc. Although it's more expensive than other scooters, trust me when I tell you it's worth it. There is nothing worse than being stranded in the middle of nowhere because your Chinese piece of crap scooter breaks on you.It's fun to ride, comfortable, and you don't have to worry about getting stranded. Plus, it goes an amazing 20 miles on one charge. I cannot say enough about how much I love the URB-E. I am going to throw out my EcoReco and be done with this garbage they call a scooter. You cannot go wrong with an URB-E. Made in the US and it shows. Never once has it broken down on me and it's rock solid. An amazing product!
