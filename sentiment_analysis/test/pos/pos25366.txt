At first my SEEK and Samsung Tab4 couldn't connect, but an email to the SEEK Folks cleared the situation up and all works fine now. I reinstalled the software direct from the SEEK web page the 2nd time. Don't know if this was the 'cure', but the first time was from the Play Store link. Perhaps the app was upgraded between my downloads (?)The folks at SEEK were right there to help and That's a BIG Plus, for sure ... Recommended if your device is compatible :-)
