So far so good.  I love the camera, altough I think the Support team stinks.  I sent in a support ticket the first week I had it functional and to date have not heard a thing from them.  That says a lot for the product.I like the functions of the unit.  On my wish list I would like for it to be powered by another source beside the light switch, as that can be toxic if someone acidentally turns off the light switch.  There goes ALL functionality if that happens.I have had only one issue with it.  It went offline for an unknown reason, and it took me a while to get it back online.I also think that the pricing is way too much compared to the other competitors.  That is the only reason I have not subscribed to it yet.The sensitivity can be adjusted, as well as the ability to turn the lights on and off.I also like the dog bark alert and it's really interesting how some people responds to it each time, because it does sound as if I have a dog inside the house.
