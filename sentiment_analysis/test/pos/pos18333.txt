This is really 3 questions to allow me to complete my purschase. Does the model Titan HD 550a have sensors including compass and accelerometers? Is a spare battery available? Gorilla glass or, should i get a screen protector?Update: Aug. 6; Received the phone today! 5 Stars based on the features. I took a chance based on the $69 Amazon price for this phablet. My questions were resolved very positively. 9 sensors! Makes this a good candidate for astronomy tools, as I hoped. Gorilla Glass 3, stated by support. Included case and screen protector with my shipment. Front and rear flash for the cameras. Dual LED flash for the rear camera may give a range of white balance for HDR photos. It looks great for the future....Oct. 14. 2015 - 2 months into my ownership and I am writing this update on the phone so, there is that.The amazing thing is ... A week ago I pulled up my pants and this phone flew into the toilet. I not so quickly romoved the covers and battery, laid out to dry and, moved my sim to an older phone. The next day my 4 year old grandson came to with the reassembled 'damp' phone. The rear LEDs are shining like nuts, I panic, fieldstrip it again and toss the parts in a box. I try it this week and, it's OK!I am very happy as this has exceeded almost all my expectations. 1st month I kept pushing the limits until I had 160 apps and, couldn't update any apps. I backed off to about 130 for the past month and it has gone well.  I installed the 64GB microSD, added tape to the back of my SIM to  make it more secure and, packaged the phone in the supplied gel case and screen protector. I try to keep it in my shirt pocket from which it falls from chair height weekly...I do wish I could use the camera(rear) in low light more easily.
