I bought this phone for my mother who lives 1200 miles away from me.  This company, Great Call, has exceptional customer service.  I've called them several times because it's taken a few months to determine which plan is best for my mother's needs and my budget. The representatives answer calls quickly, are attentive, understanding, and friendly.  Also, to my amazement, a rep recommended that my mother call them from her landline to go over features of the phone that she had trouble understanding.  Do the major carriers do that?  No way.  Also, it is very easy to monitor her usage on-line and the paper bills are easy to understand and in large print.  If you want to offer an inexpensive, valuable phone service to a senior loved-one, I highly recommend you use this company.
