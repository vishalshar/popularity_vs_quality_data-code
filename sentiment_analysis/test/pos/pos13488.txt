Love my Urban Leaf and its versatility on how I can wear it.  It tracks what I need it to track. I can check to make sure I've reached my step goal for the day and I like the little info tips it provides. My favorite feature is the meditation goal and it's instant access to meditation audio, definitely helps when I am having a stressful day.
