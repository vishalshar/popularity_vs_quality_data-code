We bought two of these for our LGDs in training and they have worked very well.  However, my only complaint would be that the strap portion of the collar is made of a type of rubbery plastic which the dogs chewed up in 4-5 months of use.  We only have the collars on during day time hours when we are able to observe them with our goats, but they still managed to chew them, not to mention it was difficult to wrap the strap around each time when putting it on.  We fashioned a new strap of nylon with a metal snap around the static unit and it is much easier to put on and adjust as needed, and no chewing.
