These Hickies work great and my son loves them.Your shoes are harder to put on but the elastic does stretch.They are comfortable and there are different ways to install them on your tennis shoes.They seem to last about a year before the friction and wear and tear on them start breaking a couple of the Hickies.No problem we always keep extras and my son's shoes never come untied.We have been using these Hickies for the last 2 years and now my son will be a steady customer.How do they say that.Your gonna like the way you look.
