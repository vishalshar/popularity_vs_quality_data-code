I bought this for my soon to be 6 year old.  He had a giggle before, so he doesn't have much bike riding experience.  I wanted him to learn to ride a bike without the use of training wheels, so I had my husband assemble it without petals, so he could use it balance bike style.  This has worked very well, and after less than ten times of riding, he has made tremendous progress and is nearly ready to get his petals put on.  This has been a good motivator to get him to practice because he still loves riding his ziggle.  He is 48 inches tall and the bike on the lowest seat setting is just right for his feet to sit flat on the ground.  I can tell the bike is just the right size for growing with him.  His 4 year old brother is about 46 and 1/2 inches tall, and this bike is too big for him.  The five year old can miner it pretty well, as far as getting it down a couple of steps and out of the house, but generally needs a little help getting it back up the steps and into the house.  So, I think it is a good compromise between weight and an affordable price.  Lighter bikes will cost significantly more.  He loves the color, and isn't bothered yet by the word baby all over it.  I have emphasized that Royal means he's a king.  He calls himself he kind of the house anyway, so this just confirms it for him.  The child was born cool, and he loves the style.  His favorite feature is probably the water bottle holder, though, the placement at the back of the seat is awkward, especially with the seat in the lowest position.  The provided water bottles definitely do not fit.  Regular water bottles fit well though.
