This thing is amazing. I have tried many of the leading self-massage tools for deep tissue/myofascial release and I can guaratee this is the best one. None of the foam rollers with or without spikes compare to this thing. Not even the coveted massage Canes. I'm able to do serious work with the massage track in 10 mins that would take me hours with my Theracane. I was skeptical when I ordered this, I thought it looked uncomfortable and I just didn't have high expectations. It totally blew me away and I'm just so glad I found this product. If you have deep knots and require deep tissue massage, you need this thing. I like it better than my massage therapist.
