I buy a lot of stuff off stuff off Amazon every month, but never review anything. I wernt out of my way to review this Charger as it really is a super cool charger. It syncs with my iPhone app no problem and when plugged in gives you this cool battery health report. I wasn't expecting that. If you set up notifgications , when you shut your car off, it will ask you if you want to set the parking meter timer. Cool feature if I lived in SF, but kinda pointless as I live in the country and parking meters don't exist. The reversible USB charging port is way more useful than you would think. All USB ports should be built like this. The design is beautiful and has a premium feel. My only complaint was that it was hard to remove from the packaging. Even after removing the clips, it was still a pain to pull out. I will definetly buy another one.
