This coding set was part of my newly turned 4 years old child's gift for his birthday. There were tutorials to help guide him in the beginning so that he was able to easily learn basic concepts. He then moved on to figuring things out on his own and was able to play independently, with occasional help. Though we've only used it one day so far, I feel like it will be easy to adjust as his skills increase and he will be able to do more complex tasks. The pieces fit together nicely and seem to be durable. Osmo also makes replacement pieces available on their website. I do wish overall that Osmo was able to accommodate an iPad in a case. My son's iPad case is too cumbersome to remove each time for play, so he used my iPad instead.
