My Dog goes absolutely bonkers for these treats!!  Buckley is "all natural", and my doggie deserves nothing but the best!  Buckley also makes Chicken Jerky for "joint" health, but I ordered the Chicken Jerky (regular), because it was such a good deal (15 oz. bag), which I cannot find in any of the pet stores.  Actually, "Fresh Market" is the only store in my area that carries Buckley Chicken Jerky (joint health) in my area, so I was so glad to see Amazon carries the Chicken Jerky!  Trust me, your Dog will love them!!
