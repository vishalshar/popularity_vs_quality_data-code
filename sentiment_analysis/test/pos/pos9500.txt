This is my third Zus charger. I bought two and was then sent this new model for review. I'm happy to say that the new version is the same bulletproof quality as the original, with the additional benefit of being able to plug cable in either right side up or upside down. It's slick looking when the lights are on but doesn't call attention to itself when left in a parked car.Zus has been the only charger in my experience that is completely capable of keeping my phone charging while running Waze/Maps and making calls while working on the road. Every other charger I tried couldn't keep up and my phone would always be close to dead by the time I stopped the car on my way to meetings.The app is a breeze to use and you're able to add multiple Zus devices and name them. You can then call up each one and check the map to see exactly where you left your car parked. The arrow and distance away from vehicle isn't always perfect, but it does point you in the right direction if you're in big department store lot. I find the parking meter timer very useful and use it often.
