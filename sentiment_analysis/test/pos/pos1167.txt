I was looking for a bluetooth speaker to play music and podcasts from my iPhone in bed. Compared with a few other products which are either too ugly, no power adapter or too pricey. Then I saw this on a blog, and I knew thatÂ’s what I needed. Simple delightful design, coloful lights react with music and two USB outlets for charging my phone etc. And there are more functions I have yet to explore. Five stars for all that.
