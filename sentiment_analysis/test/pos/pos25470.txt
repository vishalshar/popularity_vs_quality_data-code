My grandfathers rheumatoid doctor recommended we get him some adjustable wrist weights to help with his tremors in his hands. After countless hours of searching, and mainly finding big, bulky ones that would irritate and damage his skin, I came across these Toneybands. They look like a watch, are made of medical grade silicone and stainless steel weights that you can adjust easily by pulling out, or putting in however many you need, up to 1 pound each. My Gran and Papa both say they are comfortable, and that they like the easy watch type band. He's been using them whenever he eats or drinks and they've made a huge difference, diminishing the shaking he usually has. He no longer has to fight to get utensils to his mouth, and he doesn't spill his drinks anymore!!  I know these are advertised as workout gear but if you have someone in your family that suffers from hand tremors I HIGHLY recommend getting them a set of these! The owner replies to any questions promptly and makes sure their customers are satisfied with their product, and they come with a cute carry case for them as well.  Definitely a 5+ star product!!
