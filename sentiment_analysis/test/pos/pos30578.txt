I recently purchased the Whistle GPS Pet Tracker mostly to monitor my dog's daily activity and to see if she was getting her walks. It is amazing how fast I got an alert that she left the zone. She is not an escape artist but I could see the usefulness of the product.The app is fun and easy to use, there is a lot of uses for it as well. Such as medication reminders, which I use. Also, I get a text and a Whistle alert almost immediately when she has left her zone. Also the battery life of the device is great. I also love the community forum. It is fun to see what others are doing as well. I am very satisfied with this product.
