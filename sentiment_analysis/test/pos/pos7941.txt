I was drinking a lot of other name brand Energy Drinks that were full of sugar and got to a point where it was impacting my mood, sleeping patterns, and digestion.Started purchasing Blue Lotus a couple months ago - big difference.  They taste great, low on sugar, and I order then weekly.  I tried the pink lotus as well.  Same effect, but I like the taste of the blue or berry lotus drinks much better.They are not cheap, but in the ballpark with Red Bull, higher priced than Monster.  To me, the price is worth it.I did not recieve any discounts or "deals" for the rating or narrative.  I just like the product. I almost didn't write it because I don't want them to be out of stock when I placing my weekly order.
