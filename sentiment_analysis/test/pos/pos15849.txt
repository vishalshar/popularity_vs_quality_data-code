Call me a FAN of the Bakerstone.  Love this thing! It makes truly amazing pizza. Like every other good chef's tool there are a few tricks and things you need to know for success.  Here's some thoughts:1) You need a big, powerful grill to run this.  Our Weber Genesis did the job, but it did require using some heavy foil to block off any open space on the grill, and removal of the flavorizer bars so the heat would directly come up to the Bakerstone.  Once that's done, it heated up to 700 degrees in about 35 minutes.2) Plan on making a bunch - the time and fuel investment in getting it truly hot (and the way the pizza absolutely was devoured by my audience) warrants planning on making a LOT of pizza when you decide to use it.3) Invest time and effort in learning to make great dough - sounds like a strange hint, but you will be richly rewarded with amazing pizza if you do.  Lots of YouTube videos out there about that.I'm looking forward to this summer when I can host a major pizza fest on my patio - a bunch of friends, a cooler of cold beer, some good wines, great tunes, and an outdoor "build line" for my friends to make their own pizzas that I then slide into the Bakerstone and cook to perfection!Strongly recommend this product!
