I purchased this mount hoping to add it to the handlebars on my 2014 Honda CB500X. I wanted to mount my iPhone 7 Plus so that I could have a GPS for longer trips.I also own a Quad Lock windshield mount, bicycle mount, and an armband. All are extremely high quality and securely mount my phone.Beware though, your handlebars may be too small for this to work right out of the box. I found that there was a slight gap between the included rubber spacer and my handlebars. I contacted Quad Lock customer service, and they were unable to provide a solution. I had to improvise.I purchased a roll of rubber SBR (Styrene Butadiene Rubber) Sheet, 70 Shore A, Black, Smooth Finish, No Backing, 0.062" Thickness, 4" Width, 36" Length and cut out a strip the same width as the included Quad Lock spacer. I put it on my handlebars, and it fit perfectly!I am also using a USB power supply that runs to the battery MICTUNING SAE to USB Cable Adapter 2.1A Dual Port Power Socket for Motorcycle for Smart Phone Tablet GPS and a 12" USB cable [Apple MFi Certified] Zendure 12 inch (30 cm) Nylon Braided USB Charge/Sync Cable with Lightning Connector for iPhone 6 / 6 Plus, iPad Air 2 and More (Space Grey) to keep my phone powered.All in all, I am very happy with this Quad Lock OTF mount. I would recommend it to motorcyclists who want their device to be firmly locked onto their handlebars and not held on with spring tension like all the other motorcycle mounts I've seen.
