I bought this and the chair version. They are the most comfortable hammocks I have ever used, and unlike many of the other outdoor marketed hammocks these are actually UV and mildew resistant- something that will make these cheaper than the competition in the long run. Another thing I like about the yellow leaf hammocks is that they tend to be shorter than the other outdoor hammocks (10' instead of 13'). Ten foot is plenty long, and unnecessary extra length prohibits where you can hang a hammock. There's nowhere you can hang a 13 footer that you can't hang a ten footer with some extra straps or cordage.
