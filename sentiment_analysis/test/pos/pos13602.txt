I bought this for my 11 year old ( based size on waist size and that she is under 5 ft)The size of the velcro makes it adjustable to keep it a snug fit.This is her second one, she was out growing her child XL and since it was a year old,the velcro was starting to not work as well and outside starting to flake.  She used it almostdaily last summer then once a week during this school year, so she got a lot of use outof it and even though they are expensive she had outgrown the disposable ones fromthe store and this was cheaper that buying those.
