My kit arrived complete with a voucher to order 2 Guatemalan air plants free of charge. Set up both globes in seconds - air plants arrived about 1 week later. The plants are the perfect addition to my urban studio and make great companions for my bonsai tree!To care for them, you just spray them with water once a week (mini spray bottle is included), and you also spray them with air plant food once a month (you can also purchase the air plant food from Makerskit here which comes with 1 full mini spray bottle and a huge bottle of refill food).
