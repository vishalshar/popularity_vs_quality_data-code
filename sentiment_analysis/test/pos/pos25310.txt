The dogs REALLY love it!  This is their second or third toy that has a rawhide disc.  On the others, they eat the disc and ditch the toy.  With this dinosaur, they enjoy playing with it even after the rawhide's gone.  It also has durability and is holding up quite well, even against our power chewers.  VERY pleased, even bought another!
