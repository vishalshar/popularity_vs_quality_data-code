These are the best body wipes I've ever used. They are nicely wet, and very sturdy. They don't separate or fall apart, and they are SO REFRESHING!! Wow, oh man!! I would love to keep a supply on hand at all times, but unfortunately they are priced out of my day to day budget. I almost wish I'd never tried them in the first place, because now I pine for them lol :)
