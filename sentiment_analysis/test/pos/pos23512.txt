Been using this for 1.5 months and it's been working flawlessly. I was previously using another brand home automation hub but my devices were continually disconnection. I decide to give Abode a try based upon all the positive reviews and I couldn't be happier. I am running the items included in this bundle plus 2 Kwikset locks, 2 First Alert smoke/CO detectors and an Aeotec recessed door sensor. Planning on adding light switches also. I also love the option to switch between paid monitoring and self monitoring.
