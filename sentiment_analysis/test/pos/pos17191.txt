okay only 4 days to 12 weeks clear and... i have 2 stubborn spots on my scalp that still itch, but no longer flake.  my ears are a little itchy but no scabs or spots.  elbows are clear, hands are clear, back of my legs are clear, my butt is clear, wrists are all clear of itchy scaly flakes!  but the best is yet to come... this has cleared the adult acne i have had all of my life!!~!!  thank you thank you!  i am a loyal customer, just ordered my second tube!!!!
