After a bit of research I went with this model as it seems to be one of the only ones that you can control how much goes into each feed and isn't prone to jamming. Yes it is more expensive and yes it is a little loud (which almost made me put it at a 4 star), but the quality is great and you get what you pay for. Also, I had a hiccup connecting this to the wifi of my new place and the creator HIMSELF called to troubleshoot with me (embarrassingly the issue was my own negligence). The camera isn't too great, but to me it's more of a perk than requirement. The peace of mind that my cat would be fed properly and on time, even if the wifi goes out, is worth it. My cat would anxiously throw up if he wasn't fed at the same time every day and this product helps.
