There is not anything I don't like a about Osmo, oh wait there is just one. When playing letters or numbers the mirror very easily picks up pieces close by that weren't even played. Soultion keep them far away out of sight of the mirror.All other aspects of game play are phenomenal. Osmo forces our little ones to take breaks from looking at the screen to interact with the actual physical pieces that aide in game play. The idea of that helped shape an avid Osmo supporter. Game play ranges from easy to challenged and will increase depending on the progress of whose playing.You can also add your own words and pictures, or just visit the library to download lessons  other parents and teachers created. Setup is fast and easy as well as clean up!
