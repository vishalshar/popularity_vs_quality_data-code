Great product- I have a long (90 min) bike commute to an office with no shower.  By the time I get to work I'm usually pretty grimy in addition to sweaty.  One towel takes care of my 6'2" /175# frame from head to toe with a bit to spare.  The smell (on me right now) is very neutral "clean" rather than perfumed.
