I love this! I've tried a few other natural deodorants and this is my favorite. I love the orange Creamsicle scent. It feels nice and creamy not sticky and doesn't leave marks on my clothes. I work out usually in the morning and shower right after so I don't really know if it is going to keep the workout sweat stink away, I definitely don't smell awful while working out even though my deodorant has been on almost 24 hours at that point. I would definitely recommend this product. I have had it a few months and it's still half full. I will repurchase a natural deodorant for the first time!
