Not really sure why there were any bad reviews on this product. The case is so convienent because I don't have to change it before/after each ride. The case is thin, rigid plastic so if you're looking for some sort of heavy duty protection don't bother. The case is perfect for normal people who don't throw their phone around. The locking mechanism is perfect! It clicks to let you know it's locked in. And comes off easily by pressing the blue ring down. I did use the zip ties that comes with it because the rubber bands did not appear stable at all! I can't say enough how much I love this. When using the phone while mounted it does not move at all, so secure. If you're looking for a good product for a good price, this ones a winner for sure.
