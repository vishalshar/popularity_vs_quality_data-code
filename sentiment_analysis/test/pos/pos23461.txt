This laptop is incredible.  I have been shopping for a laptop for months.  It is very difficult these days to find one that is under $1000, but still has high quality.  I looked at HP, Dell, etc. and while they look nice, most reviews said they didn't hold up in the long run.  For instance, the HP 2 in 1's look really nice, but the hinges tend to break down over time.Anyway, I ended up finding out about this ASUS by chance and decided to give it a shot and I'm so glad that I did.  This is a NICE computer!  It is solid, fast, and reliable.  No it doesn't have a touch screen, but who cares?The only drawback to this computer is the speakers.  They are a bit low for my taste, as they are located on the bottom of the computer, so they can be muffled when sitting on your lap.  However, I did go to the setting session and found an enhancement labeled "Night".  This seems to have boosted the sound to an acceptable level for my needs.Kudos to ASUS for making a great product affordable!
