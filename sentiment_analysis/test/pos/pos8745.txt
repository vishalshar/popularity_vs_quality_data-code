This iPad Mini case looks nice and feels nice. It just does not smell nice. I was worried the chemical small could harm my daughter's health when I just got it. I am glad the smell has been fading slowly and I can barely smell it anymore when I use the iPad Mini. I recommand leaving the case in the sun for a couple of days and let the smell clear up before you let your kid use the Pad with it.
