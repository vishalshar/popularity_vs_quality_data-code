These things are the holy grail of snack food: Healthy, tasty, cheap, and non-perishable. I keep a stash at my desk at work and snack on these, rather than pretzels or candy, when I'm hungry or just want to mindlessly chew on something. They really are incredibly delicious and it's hard to believe the only two ingredients are apples and cinnamon.I do have two very minor complaints. 1) The bags are kind of an inconvenient size -- too big to really eat all at once, but not big enough to bother sealing them up with a chip clip for the next day. So I end up eating maybe 3/4 of the bag and then tossing the rest. 2) They aren't so much apple "chips" as apple "fragments" -- maybe due to breakage during shipping? It does make them kind of messy to eat (and harder to dip into peanut butter).Overall though, highly satisfied with this product. I just doubled the amount of my Subscribe & Save shipment because my husband is now hooked on them too.
