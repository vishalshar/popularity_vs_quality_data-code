One of the units stoped working . Unit well not turn on at all. But I'm very happy it did I e-mailed my problem and boy what a great experience it was there customer service is the best I've ever had .  Lady named Kati handled the whole thing. She e-males a return shipping label and a new one was here next day befor I shipped the old one back . She also talked me through how to setup the new one and any person that can get a 83 year old grouchy man to understand is great ! Would I recommend this to my family Yep! Will I order more of them through Amazon heck yes X -mas is coming
