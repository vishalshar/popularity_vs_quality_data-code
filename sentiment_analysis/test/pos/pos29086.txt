I purchased this for my 2013 Toyota Tacoma and my phone is a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge with a UAG case.  The dash is not completely level and I mounted this product on the part of the dash that is curved.  It won't come off easy on the flat part of my dash or even on the curved area.  By mounting it where I did it's right below my line of sight.  It makes it EXTREMELY easy to see directions, calls, emails, etc. without taking my eyes off the road for more than a second.  This is the best mount I've owned.  The last one I ordered was a vent magnet system.  The problem with those is it covered a vent, which wasn't good in hot weather, and if I used the metal plate behind my phone I couldn't use my wireless charger at night unless I removed the case.  This car mount doesn't cover the air vent in my truck and I can change the location if I want to.  With all the twist and turns that this device can do there's really no where you can't mount it.  As you can see from my pictures I folded the arm over and extended it to make is lower in my dash.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.
