I'm extremely happy with the router and drill press guides.  Installation was a breeze--the folks from Circle Perfect have thought of everything.  These tools are well made, very precise, and will be incredibly useful within my woodshop.  Prior to ordering the guides and protractor rings, I contacted Circle Perfect to discuss various aspects of the guides and company and was pleasantly surprised as to the courtesy, helpfulness, and professionalism afforded to me.  I am exceedingly pleased with the care and thoughtfulness Circle Perfect has given to their products and customers!
