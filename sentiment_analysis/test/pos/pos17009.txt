Am I alone in thinking that there is a need for comprehensive documentation about the programming and use of this device?I can understand shipping a "Getting Started" booklet with the unit, as things change rapidly in the consumer-electronics world, but something much more in-depth is sorely needed.Let me add that I've spent a career of 40 years in the technology industry, both in electronics and computing.  In that time, I've designed systems and programmed and managed everything from an IBM mainframe computer to DOS- and Windows-based microcomputers.  That said, getting this device working has been a challenge which, given the scarcity of documentation, has been a combination of experience and plain dumb luck.At the most basic level, the setup procedure (which I was walked through on my iPhone) was fairly straightforward.  The system was able to detect my new UHD TV and 4k Blu-Ray player in short order.  Surprisingly, it didn't detect the Time-Warner/Spectrum cable box/DVR.  Not surprisingly, it didn't detect the Samsung soundbar.  That being said, when I was prompted to enter the make and model number of each item, everything worked perfectly.  The hardest part was going on the Samsung website to find the model numbers of these two units which I had registered.On the positive side, I have control of programs recorded on the DVR, the volume of the soundbar, and the TV-viewing experience.  This has consolidated the functions of four remotes into one; five if it will control the Amazon Fire stick.  That leaves only the remote for the electric fireplace built into the media console, which is more than can be expected of this device.One the negative side, again without clear documentation, it was a challenge to determine whether customizing some capabilities of the Harmony was to be done on the computer, the iPhone, or on the Harmony remote itself.  The first thing that was necessary was to update the firmware in the remote.  For this, I assumed correctly that I would need to connect the remote to a computer with the furnished USB cable.Finally, and with the help of the MyHarmony software that I downloaded to my computer, I was able to specify my 50 favorite channels.  At this point, however, I can't seem the get the channel icons ordered on my iPhone or the remote as I would like to have them.  In other words, listing the most frequently-watched channels at the top of the list.Overall, I'm very happy with the utility of this remote, and would have given the fifth star if there were better user documentation.  Someone could get rich by writing a book about it.  Yes, I did look on the Amazon website to see if such a book exists, and gladly would have bought one.I look forward to using the Amazon Echo/Alexa in conjunction with this product, and I'm certain that I will be happy with it when I have mastered the desired capabilities and their use.If I am incorrect with any portion of this assessment, I am open to correction.Further, I will update this review as I learn more.
