I just received my G10, my first wireless system.  I've been interested in "going wireless" for some time as I often feel tethered with my cables and I like to move around a bit.  I also have several instruments so moving from one to another with a traditional wireless pack (like all other serious pro-grade systems prior to G10 use) was too cumbersome to be convenient.Along comes the G10!I've been waiting for this "dongle" type plug-in wireless (or bug as it's sometimes called) for some time.  I was thrilled when it was announced at NAMM 2016.  It uses the same Relay technology found in the other systems of the successful Relay lineup.Pros:-Superb sound quality!  It really sounds like I'm still wired.  Absolutely amazing.  I was hoping to detect some difference that I could write about, but honestly I couldn't tell the difference.  Whether I was testing quiet or fully cranked, there was full dynamics of sound, no compression or perception of signal loss.-Freedom!  It feels so great being able to turn around and take a few steps here and there without thinking about where your cable is.  Now I only have to think about where my head stock is poking.-Super simple operation.  Truly plug and play.  It will automatically select the best channel to play on.-"Pop" free plug!  There is a clever ground lift activator on the plug so that the plug only engages after fully seating in the guitar jack.  That means no loud pops and bangs when inserting and pulling out the dongle.-Lightweight, solid feeling dongle. It fits well into jacks, no wobble or looseness.  It can take jumping around no problem (not a usual thing for me but had to test it).-Bright LED on dongle.  Plug it into your guitar and and 2-3 secs, its solid green and ready to play.  It blinks red as a warning when you need to recharge (manual says 30min of play time, I never went that far, but I did 15min without any cutout or range problems).  Cool white LED halo on base, goes red when battery running low.-I had no problems with range in my 2 bedroom apt.  (50ft, near line of sight).  I had some difficulty going thru 2 rooms (room next door ok, not the 2nd one over.)  You should probably consider your stage environment to be line of site (the first scenario I describe).  Afterall, I assume you will put this next to your pedal board which will be somewhat nearing "kicking" distance.  I should note that it gets weird playing far from your sound source, so there is definitely some ranges you will not want to perform beyond irregardless of the wireless system you have(even an ideal 0 latency which doesn't exist).  This is probably due to the fact that radio waves travel the speed of light (the <2.9ms latency advertised is simply the encoding/decoding process at both ends), and sound FROM the amp/speaker travels much slower (~1000ft/sec, the speed of sound).  Perhaps with an In-Ear-Monitoring system (radio waves, speed of light in both ways) this would be no problem, but I don't have this.  With the G10 you won't be able to run around all over the venue while playing but you should expect coverage anywhere on a stage.  When it DID cut out in my testing, it did not give annoying garbage noise, but just dropped out as if the volume knob was off instantly, additionally there was no latency in reconnecting once I came back in range.  So even the disconnection-reconnection was pleasantly smooth.-No perceivable latency (see above)-There are 2 output options: standard 1/4" and a balanced XLR.  Not sure what to do with the XLR on my guitar since it wont have my effects.  But it is perfect for Bass!  Go right to the board with the balanced XLR (no DI needed anymore) and one to your monitor on stage!  (The output is simultaneous, not either or.)-There is no information printed, but I heard from Line6 sales that you can use up to 5 in the same venue without interference.  (This needs testing to know for sure.).-I have tested on 4 stardard guitar styles without issue (see pictures to follow):1995 Fender American Standard Stratocaster1963 Fender Custom Shop Telecaster (Reissue from 2009)2001 Gibson ES-335 DT2013 Gibson Les Paul StandardI have also tried on my fill-in 1986 Epiphone Rock Bass (too rare to be classic)...but like a Fender Jazz Bass.  Was wonderful!Cons:-?Sleep mode: (NOTE: This has now been fixed with firmware update.) If you are having problems with the dongle not sleeping when the base power is turned off, install the new firmware with the Line 6 updated on your computer.-The G10 comes with a charger pack with multiple adapters for your travel needs, however, its a little on the large size and feel kinda cheap.  I'm sure it works but I decided to use a smaller one I had laying around.  (The output rating on the power plug is 1amp at 5V, most USB chargers will be compatible with this).-The pilot's guide (instruction manual) is pretty sparse.  But maybe that's the idea...simple, don't need 'em.-The USB plug for charging is great, but uses a mico-USB.  I'm glad it's some standard but micro-USB is one of the lesser common standards.  Oh well.Length of Charge:This section will take some real life testing to develop.  The dongle is new right now and I'll update it.  The specs are impressive, but I want to see those met in real testing.  I was able to go from blinking red to solid green in a little over 1 hour which surprised me a bit.  I don't see any way to replace a failing battery either. Do we need to toss the system or can we buy separate replacement dongle?  Line 6 can earn a 5th star if it lives up to it's battery claims4 stars, for now.  Pending real life battery/reliability testing, my rating could go to 5.  It's just too early to give number 5, but it could get there.Otherwise, awesome!
