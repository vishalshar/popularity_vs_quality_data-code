Bought this as a gift for my sister in law, the week before Shakespeare festival in Cedar City Utah. For our family, after we see the plays, we tend to sit by the hotel and drink some beers and cocktails.  Our favorite cocktail happens to be an Old Fashioned, made a little sweeter than average. These glasses could not be spilled as long as they were on a flat and clean surface, which really wasn't too hard to find.  The only surface (of course) that it didn't work on was the wirey looking tables that are often outdoors, but we weren't expecting it to work there.
