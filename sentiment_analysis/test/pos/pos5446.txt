My husband is a High School football coach, youth tackle football coach and youth flag football coach.  He brings Grip Boost to all practices and games for his kids.  He says, "it brings the gloves back to when you first pull them out of the package."  Your not doing everything you can for your players if you are not using Grip Boost.
