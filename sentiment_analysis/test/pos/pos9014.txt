I absolutely love this sleep sack! I have a few with this similar design and price- shoulder snaps and full side zipper, and this one is by far the best. It's so soft and plush, but also breathable. We keep our house in the low 60s and my son stays warm all night. The smallest size does ride up on my 7 week old so I started snapping one shoulder snap above the shoulder and the other below one of his arms, and the fit is perfect and he seems very comfortable.
