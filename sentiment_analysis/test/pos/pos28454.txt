I originally purchased this to attach to my backpack while riding my motocycle because it looked more secure than the simple clips.The purchase price was my only hesitation as this was four times the price of a simple clip style mount. In the end I felt that this would be more secure and would hold my camera in place.The build of this product is great and as I expected it clamps to my backpack strap very secure. My only complaint is the bare screws poking into my jacket from the mount (they actually tear into my jacket).The camera mount itself is very solid and thanks to some great engineering removable. I have used the mount as a stand for my gopro (a bonus feature).I recently discovered the camera mount is part of a system that PolarPro is using that works side by side with a hand grip mount for a gopro.
