This is an outstanding phone case. It fits very well over the phone. It's durable and protects the screen and corners. It's also looks very cool and rugged. The buttons, headphone jack holes, etc align very well; I've had other cases that weren't good in this area. The case is also easy to remove and put back on.I used to always get Otterboxes, but wanted to try this one out. I definitely recommend it.
