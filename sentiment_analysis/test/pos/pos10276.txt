I love this face wash so much! I got a sample in my ipsy bag and I haven't used anything else since. I have combination oily and dry skin and this keeps my face so clear. My breakouts disappear almost overnight. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is the price. Almost $20 is a lot for a face wash.
