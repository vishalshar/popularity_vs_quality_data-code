I love this so much! I got it for my office. However, after using this for a week, I really want one for the home office as well.I write so many letters and not-so-interesting arguments on a computer.As corny as it sounds, this keyboard actually makes me want to type.---Update--I get so many compliments from clients. I have been using this for around a month. I did not need to charge once.I really want to get another keyboard... I just wish the price would drop a little, just a little so I can justify this luxury spending.
