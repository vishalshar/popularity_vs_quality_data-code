I really want to give this bottle 5 stars but there is one issue that I have had a few times. First, I will say that it is a great design and idea. I use my bottle all day every day. I use it for shakes as well as just water. With other bottles, there are issues with being able to clean the bottom of the bottle. This opening at the top and bottom solves that problem. The issue is the bottom of the bottle. It does not quite fit in my cup holder. If I try and undo the top of the bottle while it is in the holder, the bottom will come loose and leak. So I do not force it in the cup holder. Also, if I take it out of the cup holder and it was in there tight, the bottom gets pulled a little and causes a leak. You will not know about the leak until you take a drink and a small amount of water comes out on your lap. Now I know that sounds like a deal breaker but it is not. I just quickly figured out how to keep that from happening. If I were to lose this bottle tomorrow or mess it up in any way, I would pull my phone out and order another one. If you use a bottle for shakes too, buy this bottle.
