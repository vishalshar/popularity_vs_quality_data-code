I love my LEAF! Everything Bellabeat advertised about their product was true. As a 32 yrs old woman I try my best to keep an eye on my health, but a as a mother and wife it is hard. So when I saw the beautiful design of the LEAF I had to try it. As a nurse I am constantly washing  my hands and moving around. The Bellabeat LEAF is durable easy to change from necklace, would bracelet, to pants waistband. I won't lie it was gotten wet atleast four times forgetting to take it off in the shower (rushing and no sleep). I don't suggest it but it is still work the same as when I first received it. The only problem I have with it is the activities list. It doesn't have the activity class I attend so I have to settle for using kickboxing (the only one close to it). There are a lot of activities on the list but not a lot concerning martial arts. So 4 stars for the Bellabeat LEAF! It's one of my favorite accessories.
