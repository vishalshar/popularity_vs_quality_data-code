I love this safe.  It's sleek, elegant, and built like a rock.  Even given what I'm about to say, I'd buy it again knowing what I now know.  What I know is what many other people have said in their reviews: the fingerprint scanner only works on the first try about 20% of the time.  It's functional enough to access the safe if you're not in a hurry and don't mind scanning your finger 4 or 5 times; it will open eventually.  It's not a reliable means to access the safe if you're in a hurry or in case of an emergency, however.  That said, I have yet to find a safe that unlocks using a method other than key/combination that is quick and reliable, and I've owned quite a few in the past.  Where this safe shines is in the implementation of the available RFID accessories.  They work fast and accurately every time.  Currently, I wear the bracelet when I sleep, but I plan to buy the ring and just wear it all of the time.  It's not a bad looking piece of hardware and it means you'll never have to worry about losing keys, forgetting or mis-entering combos, or biometric reader failure.  Don't get hung up on the fingerprint scanner's lack of reliability.  It's a distraction and they probably shouldn't have even tried to include that type of functionality if they couldn't get it to work perfectly every time (like the one on my iPad does).  The RFID accessories work great and every other aspect of the safe is perfect and many of the features/functions are quite revolutionary.  Congratulations, you've just found your next gun safe.
