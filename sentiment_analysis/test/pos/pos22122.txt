Amazing product o introduce girls to science.  I love everything about this!!! My 7 yr old said she felt like a real scientist while working through each of the experiments. She has always been a little perfectionist, and it was great watching her embrace the idea that she was SUPPOSED to make mistakes!  Break through moment!  Love it, love it, love it.  Can't wait for Yellow Scope to create their next kit!
