The two things I seem to misplace more than anything are my keys and my phone. I love the fact that even though my phone is on silent, the trackR will make it audible so I can hear it. The unit is very small and compact. Although I have had a couple of minor glitches with it, usually it is resolved within a day. I am very happy with my purchase. Having my Bluetooth connected on my phone so that they are always paired doesn't bother me, although it might bother others.
