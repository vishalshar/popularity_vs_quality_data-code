So glad to find these and will most definitely buy again.  I've tried two other brands of sock liners, and the wear life was very short.  Holes at toe area on both kinds.  These have held up so far, and my toes don't feel bunched up at all.  Delivery to my house and I didn't have to search through store aisles.  These, are "men's"  and I'm a woman, but they have 100%ly replaced the other two brands in my sock drawer.
