This is a great product for use with (all too often) cables that fray and break. You can take the Sugru and put it at the point of greatest stress on a cable (for example, and iPhone cable) and it does a great job of protecting it.  It is also fairly easy to mold and use.  The only thing that I wish was different about sugru would be that if you do not use all of it from a given packet you basically have to throw the leftover away.  I opened one packet and used about half of the sugru to fix a cable, and then I put the remainder in a sealed Ziploc bag inside the refrigerator.  Even that did not stop the sugru from getting hard over time.  This is not a big deal, but it does mean that now I wait until I have several cables that need repairing before I open a packet Â– you really only need about a third of a packet to repair a cable.
