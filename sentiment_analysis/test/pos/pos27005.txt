I have purchased multiple Rokform cases and this is one of my favorites. It is very thin and light and the magnet feature is something that I cannot live without. I stick my phone to everything even the corner bead on walls to take the impromptu family photo. I have bought so many cases I have a collection of the magnetic mounts all over my house and in my car. Its nice to have the same spot for your phone every time you get home (magnet mount next where I put my keys), go to bed (magnet mount on my nightstand) or go to work (magnet mount on the dash of my truck) Its hard to explain just how useful the case, magnet and magnetic mounting really are until you try it. And yes its very protective too. My six year old runs around and drops it all the time. I added a video shows her sticking my iPhone to the corner of my wall.
