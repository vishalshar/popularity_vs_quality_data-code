My eldest son has ASD and ADHD and the thought of lacing and tieing a shoe not only fills him with dread but can be a deal breaker of how the rest of the day will pan out! He's nearly 13 and a size 8 shoe so Velcro just isn't an option anymore. I first saw these 'laces' in Texas airport but wasn't able to stop and inspect them too closely, however no longer willing to battle with laces before school led me to Amazon to research further... And oh my, I'm glad I did... They are fantastic! In fact I shall be buying more for all his shoes, plus he loves them too! I can't help but feel these would also be great for others both able bodied and with disabilities who find tieing shoes either problematic or tiresome! Great variety of colours and a fast and friendly service from the seller!
