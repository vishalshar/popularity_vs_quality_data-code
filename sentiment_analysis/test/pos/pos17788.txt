This is definitely the best auto feeder around, after trying quite a few models. My cats cannot open the food compartment no matter how hard they try. It is wet food-friendly, and I can keep food in there for two days (with ice) without it going bad. Being able to control via smartphone is priceless and the ability to look at your pet is a cute added touch.Even more impressive than the product itself is the company that makes it. The unit I bought ended up having a faulty gearbox. I wrote a nasty review on Amazon, and that caught the attention of Alex, the owner of Feed and Go. He snail-mailed me personally to assure me that he would take responsibility for any issue, even if it meant replacing the entire feeder. I called him back and he walked me through some quick tests, and assessed that a new gearbox would solve the problem. The next day, I had a new gearbox in the mail. After popping it in, voila, good as new. Alex even checked in with me to see if the new gearbox fixed my problem, even before I had the chance to put the new one in!I am going to be buying another feeder so each of my cats have their own. There is no safer feeling than being able to buy a quality product with the full faith assurance of the company to fully back their product. Such personal responsibility and devotion to your product is rare in todays world of phantom supply chains and umbrella brands. Thanks for the good feelings and awesome product!
