I somehow received this phone for $50 through a special only for members of Amazon Prime.  I am not a real phone junkie, but can tell that this is a pretty good but not top-of-the-line phone.  The screen is phenomenal--large and vivid--and web browsing is significantly faster and smoother than on my old Samsung Galaxy SII.  The camera, however, is only decent (see attached photos).At $50, this 6" phone is as as impressive as the 7" Kindle Fire.  It shows how far technology has come.  I would recommend giving this phone serious consideration if it can be had for $99 or less.Update: The phone is better than expected.  I have been able to take nicer pictures now with a little more skill on my part (and a nice camera app, Open Camera).  No bloatware; included case and screen protector; reliable calls, 4G, Wi-Fi, and GPS.
