In order to give a solid review of this product I waited until I had used The Dash in every way it is advertised. Plus, I didn't want my enthusiasm for the "idea" of this product to keep me from giving an accurate review. I received my buds on October 4, and I have worn them for many hours each day for the last 12 days. I am extremely satisfied with The Dash. I read all of the reviews and compared this product with others on the market. Although other ear buds offer similar capabilities, only Bragi offers true water proof technology. Yes, it is truly water proof. The ability to store music on the buds itself is one of the most desirable aspects of the device I didn't even know I wanted. The sound is amazing. Then to be able to wear these while on an extreme hike or a long distant run with know issues is almost priceless. The one thing I have not been able to do is down load audio-books to this device. I ask Bragi to add this feature to the Dash. As you will read in the other reviews, the blue tooth is the only grip about this technology. Even with the bad reviews, I still want to try this amazing technology. The Bluetooth technology works great indoors as it should. However when you walk outdoors it is a different story, it doesn't work so well unless you have your phone high up on the right side of your body. This can be cumbersome. Let's all be honest- Bluetooth technology has always sucked outdoors. Why penalize Bragi over this flaw in the tech itself? Every other feature of this product from the heart rate monitor, GPS tracking, music, and fit are extremely valuable and worth every penny. I highly recommend this product for your daily use and enjoyment. I have experienced nothing else of this kind of quality for listening entertainment. Thank you Bragi! You were inspired and you have created one hell of a product. I look forward to your research and improvement of this product.
