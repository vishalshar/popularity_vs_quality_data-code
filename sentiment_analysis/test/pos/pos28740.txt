I having this new version for a week on a road trip. It been great, park my car as soon as I stop, track back to your parking spot with a ease. This new version is super fast with Bluetooth connection compare to the first gen. The build quality is superb (seriously flawless) the universal USB connector is a great added feature which you can plug in any way you like!
