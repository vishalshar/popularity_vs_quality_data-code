I've only had this case for about a week, but I love it so far.  The case feels pretty rigid, is still very sleek, and looks awesome!  It really looks cool on my HTC One M9.My HTC pops into the UAG case super easy, but then feels very secure.  I tried to take the case off for the first time yesterday and actually had a hell of a time getting it out.  I have not dropped my phone yet.  But when I do, I don't think that this case will pop off my phone, like a lot of cases do.  That drives me crazy!I would highly recommend this UAG Case, seems to be high quality protection for your phone and looks awesome!Also if you're thinking about getting an HTC One M9, get it!  I've always been an iPhone guy, but wanted to try something different.  I was worried that I wouldn't like it and miss my iPhone, but that isn't the case.  I haven't even thought about my iPhone since the upgrade.  I have downloaded all of my songs from iTunes onto my HTC and love it!  The HTC is simple and just works! There is an HTC download manager program that you can download for a Mac computer.  The HTC download manager works seamlessly with iTunes.  My HTC One M9 has taken the place of my iPhone and iPod, and I couldn't be happier.  Best phone I have ever owned!  Hope this review helps!
