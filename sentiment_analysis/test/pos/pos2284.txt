I really wanted to like this mouse, and I most certainly did. It comes in a unique astecally pleasing box. The laser on this mouse had no problems tracking on my Aukey mouse pad and through the well designed software, I was able to set the mouse to a familiar DPI. The mouse has a nice rubberized texture. It's rubberized feel and weight are very similar to a Razer Death adder. Through the software you are able to choose any color you would like for the Mionix logo as well as the scroll wheel. Patterns such as "breathing" or others can be selected. The problem which ultimately forced me to return it, was the shape. In the search to replace my old CM Storm Spawn I have purchased, and returned five mice up to this one in hopes of finding a true fingertip grip mouse to replace the dated Spawn. I have pretty large hands and even still, the bottom of the mouse is too long, hitting my palm during fingertip use. This ultimately stops me from aiming further down in games, putting me at a huge disadvantage as a lift up and move the mouse.To end, this mouse would work great for Palm, or claw grip. Unless you are a titan, don't purchase this for your fingertip grip.I hope I was able to help other tip grippers in their purchase decision.
