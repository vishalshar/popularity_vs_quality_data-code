I also have the angled washers and the collar probes are black plastic cones with the metal contact at the very end.Luckily, I had to purchase a new collar, and found a customer service number on the back:800-732-2677. M-F- 8am-8pm/ Sat. 9 am- 5I spoke to someone who identified the correct part I needed. The pack came with two probes and two washers. Hooray!!!!Both times I have called, they have tried to send the wrong kit.  The right one has 2 1/2 inch probes with washers.
