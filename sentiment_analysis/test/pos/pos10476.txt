I just received my Riva Turbo X and I couldn't be more pleased! I had heard of this item last year at CES in Las Vegas and have been waiting for it to make it to market. I have to say that crew at Riva put a lot of time into making this a cool experience to open. The packaging and unboxing have a very Apple-like feel to it, making getting on a positive and exciting experience. A cool first thing you notice is that is is partially charged when you unbox and immediately upon power turn on it is ready to bluetooth pairing. Very simple and uncomplicated! My past experience with other products like my B&O Beolit 12 is a hassle to make airplay work simply and continually. In addition, the Turbo X has several unique features that other products do not have such as: Surround mode, and Speakerphone functionality as well as the Turbo mode which I will comment on shortly! They even made a decent app for the unit for  iPhone and android, which I hope will be allowed to access your music library in the future. The design of this speaker certainly has a Cupertino design influence, a lot of thought went into the look and feel of this device. It comes in either a white or black finish and has a precision feel to its looks and weight. But most importantly, how does it sound? It sounds terrific. There is a great balance of highs, mids and lows.  Their sound engineer certainly likes music and does not work for Beats with their sloppy heavy sound. The Turbo X  actually is a speaker that you can enjoy listening to for an extended period of time! On that note, you can use in either plugged in mode or on battery, if so, it has 26 hours of battery life when using in battery mode! For me, the first thing I  enjoyed was hearing that the purity of a singers voice was not compromised at the expense of too much bass. There is a good balance. As far as loudness goes.........it certainly fills up a room with plenty of sound and if one wants more you can activate Turbo mode(you'll smile at the sound effect!) and it lightly compresses the bandwidth to allow the unit to go louder without damaging the drivers in the unit. I let some younger college  guys use the device and they commented that it sounded great even listening to their style of music. I have not had the chance to use Surround mode, but if paired to a TV or computer playing video with surround,  the Turbo X is capable of playing in surround mode with a more expansive sound. I have to tell you, I own like I said earlier, the Beolit 12 and the Sound Dock 10 and I have found that this is my go-to portable speaker around the house because I don't tire of the good sound it produces! You really need to hear the clarity of vocals combined with a balanced bass bottom end. Finally, someone got it right other than just making their unit play loud. I think others would love this device as well. I hope the company does well!
