Second purchase of same Brand/Flavor (Victor Prof. Beef, etc.) - looked very different from the first bag.  I still had some left in my first bag, and when the second bag arrived torn with the contents coming out I was concerned.  I noticed immediately the second bag was almost black in color compared to the first.  I believe the bag was torn on the second because there seemed to be a tremendous amount of oil coming off the food, had soaked the bag from the inside, causing it to tear.  It was not torn in transit.  Given that, one star was removed but perhaps more should have been, for lack of quality control.  Now in a dilemma of what to purchase next time for my dogs.
