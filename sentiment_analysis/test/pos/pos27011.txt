*** Update on 08/31/2016 ***I won't say exactly why, to spare them a million similar requests, but I contacted LucidSound with a question.  It was a multi-platform question that was *not* a complaint.  It led to an amazing piece of customer service.  I wanted to mention it here on my review, but really don't want to say exactly what was done.  I will say that LucidSound really, really cares about customers.  Add that to an excellent product and I'd give this six stars if I could.***  Original review ***First of all, I'm just an average guy and didn't get a free set to write this review.  Second, I can't say anything about the long-term quality of these, and will update my review later.  For the time being, this review is for first impressions.I bought these to replace my faithful Sony pair that sounded excellent and lasted 15 years or more (I honestly can't remember exactly when I bought them, it's been so long).  The bracket inside one of the earmuffs basically fell apart.  I took advantage of the situation to get a built-in microphone and something of, I hoped, very high quality that will last as well as those Sony's.  I was also trying to find something universal instead of having to plug them into the TV's headphone jack, which I had been doing until now (and using the PS4/Xbox One microphone).First impressions are extremely good for the LS30.  The packaging is really very nice, and the headphones themselves feel hewn from solid.  Every motion feels tight and designed to high tolerances, and their heft is reassuring.  Some might not like the weight, and they are a little heavy, but to me it reinforces the feeling of strong, quality materials.  I hope it proves true.I'm small and these have a very snug fit, with plenty of room inside the cups for my ears.  Being wireless, this bodes well since you'll be able to move around without worrying about them constantly sliding off your head.  Wherever they touch you feels soft and padded.They come with the transmitter and all the wires you need to plug them into everything.  So far I've tried my PC, phone (a Google Nexus 5X), PS3, PS4, and Xbox One.  I'm going to look into getting a 2nd set of optical cable/transmitter so I don't have to swap it around, but haven't looked into it yet.Set up on my PS4, PS3 and Xbox One were all a breeze.  The instruction card is simple, accurate and complete.  These really do work on everything, including my phone and PC.Sound quality is not up to the standards of clarity you get from really expensive audiophile headphones, but is very, very good for something so packed with features - and at this price it's excellent.  Directional noises within games are very well separated.  Although they make no such claims, these sound like surround sound headphones.  Unless you're used to $$$$ headphones, you won't want for sound quality and volume.The controls are brilliant.  Turn the outer band on each cup for sound/chat volume, press the center to mute.  The buttons are easy to feel and use.  My only complaint is that the microphone is mounted on the left cup, but the button to mute is on the right ear (and the game mute is on the left).  So the chat mute is backwards, but that's a small complaint.I'm am so impressed with these.  Excellent sound, a solid, quality feel, packed with features, works on everything!, easy setup and controls.  I'm really hoping the quality impression plays out over time, because I'm impressed so far.
