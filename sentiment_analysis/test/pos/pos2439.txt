My daughter is crazy in love with the taste and texture of these vitamins. Most gummy vitamins leave a grittiness behind and these don't! Great flavor variety within the bottle. Three flavors include strawberry banana, orange, and lemon. Her favorite is the strawberry banana. I love that the ingredients are pure - no HFCS, Gluten free is clearly labeled, also casein free, no synthetic colors, flavors, or preservatives (which is hard to find in a kids vitamins). I really like that Smartypants has every single batch third party tested.These vitamins are also free of GMOs, yeast, wheat, milk, eggs, soy and fish allergens (yet they have omega 3s - from sustainable fisheries!), peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, salicylates, and are made in the USA!!!There really isn't too much that I dislike. I do wish there could be a little less sugar, but 5 grams for 4 gummies isn't terrible. The price is a bit higher than I would prefer to pay monthly for vitamins, but when I look at the overall quality, I guess it's worth it in the end.I did receive a free bottle of vitamins in exchange for my honest opinion about them.
