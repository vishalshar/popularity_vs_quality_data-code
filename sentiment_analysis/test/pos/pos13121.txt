Tried the URB-E out on my first official commute today and it worked great! Easy enough to park your car at a train station, hop on board and place the URB-E next to you (no need to bungee it down somewhere like a large bicycle), get off and ride the last bit to your building. It definitely can control a little awkwardly due to the small wheelbase, especially on bumpier streets/sidewalks but if you frequently ride bicycles/motorcycles already it shouldn't be much of an issue. The plus is as well if things are getting out of hand it is low enough to the ground you can simply stand up and avoid a nasty fall. 1 steep hill on my route managed to be no problem for the URB-E and it lives up to all of its claims (FYI I only weigh 170lbs so it may differ for others). It is even light enough to simply pick up and run down some stairs with to take shortcuts along the route!Note on customer service: When my URB-E arrived, the battery cap/battery itself was cosmetically damaged pretty badly. URB-E support was a cinch to deal with and shipped me a replacement immediately. This is the perk you get for buying an American made product with a good support structure.
