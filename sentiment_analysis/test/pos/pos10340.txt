Much softer and silkier than the chamois and cottony feeling towels (I've owned both). It's soft, folds up super small for its size, and makes a great blanket in a crunch (I have the larger size). It also stays on when you wrap it around your waist, unlike the other travel towels I've owned. One of the best travel accessories ever!
