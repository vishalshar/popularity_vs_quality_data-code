Our two year old male kitten has had several trips to the veterinarian in the past eight weeks.  The first time we noticed he was trying to urinate outside the litter box we got concerned about feline urinary tract disease, and took him to our vet right away.  Since he was able to urinate fine at the vet's office, they provided us with these little black beads to collect later samples in to culture some bacteria.  He refused to the use the litter box with the vet-provided beads in them.  My girlfriend read about these on Amazon after others said that nothing worked.  We figured we'd give it a shot since we have three cats and never knew when it would come in handy.  Not a week after our cat finished his antibiotics for an infection, he started displaying signs of difficulty urinating again. We collected the samples right away and got to our vet.  Note: it is helpful to provide a sample of this sand to your vet for comparison.  Our vet at first thought the sand were crystals.  I had been worried that this sand would make inflammation worse, but we seem to be doing okay.  Worth having on hand if you need to collect feline urine samples!
