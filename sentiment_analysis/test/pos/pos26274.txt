Love the case. 2 things though: There's no screen protector and I just wish it was designed less slippery. Slides out of your hands sometimes and needs a better grip.Every iPhone case should come standard with a camera cover! It's necessary for privacy and safety. I recommend this case. Looking forward to an updated version.
