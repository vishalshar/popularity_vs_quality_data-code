I am constantly forgetting to grab glasses out of the car when I go into a big box store or restaurant. Regular glasses don't work in the pants pocket when I drive or they are always falling out the shirt collar or pocket.  I stuck these on the back of my phone which is always with me and problem solved.  Would I wear them all day? No, but I have used them for an hour to read in bed.  I thought it might make my phone uncomfortable in my pocket or more tricky to get in and out of the pocket but I haven't even noticed them so far.
