Soft and comfortable.  I've been a regular user of earplugs, so needless to say my ear holes are permanently stretched -- so much so that the largest silicone cups in earphones don't fit me.  They fall out so easily during exercise.  These will hold your EarPods in place.  If you're familiar with them, you should know that they don't block out noise like those with silicone cups.
