This is a great stylish choice for the activity tracker. Amazfit app is easy to install and it's very user friendly. I've found the tracking to be accurate in comparison with competitors. Love the look of it as it stacks well as a jewelry piece with other bracelets. This is a great option for someone who cares about the tracking options as well as the looks. I'd highly recommend it.
