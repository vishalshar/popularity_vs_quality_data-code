Having had mixed results in the past with wireless speakers and my Apple products, I was very pleasantly surprised on how easy this speaker unit was to set up and how full the sound really is.  Setup took less than a minute.  Plugged the speaker in right out of the box, powered up, had my iPhone discover the connection, a single prompt for the app, and then the music played. Done.The real proof lays in the fact my teenager has already commandeered it.
