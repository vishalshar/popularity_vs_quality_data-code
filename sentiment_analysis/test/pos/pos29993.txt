I must admit: I love this bulb. I'm controlling it with an iPhone and it works great. The brightness and colors of the bulb are also really nice and overall it's a lot of fun. I do think it's overly expensive, though. I had an $50 Amazon gift card, so I only paid $15 for it on my own.I may buy a few more at some point, though, probably directly from Lifx. The Lifx website provides a discount when you buy them in pairs. And if you create an account on their site, they'll give you a 10% discount on your first order.I imagine in the future the cost of bulbs like this will go way down. It does seem little risky to buy a product whose category (smart bulbs) is really just beginning. These bulbs last 20 years, but who knows how much the technology will change in just a few years. But, if they were half the price, I think they would no longer be a luxury purchase and they would sell like crazy.I should also add: I did a bunch of research on smart bulbs before buying the Lifx and the Lifx seems to be the best of all the current choices available.Update Sept 26th 2016: The bulb stopped working this week so I wrote LIFX support. The support person figured out what caused the problem and the bulb is working again. So I was very pleased with customer support. The problem was that I had a 2.4Ghz Wi-fi channel and a 5Ghz Wi-fi channel with the same name. When I split them up so each had a separate name, I was able to get the bulb working again.
