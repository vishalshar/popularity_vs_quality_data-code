Set up through Bluetooth on settings because set up would not work via slide up control panel on Iphone. Spotify set up was easy.Speaker is actually bigger and heavier than I expected. It's portable but not one of those small 4" speakers you just throw in your back pack. You can turn the volume up and it sounds pretty great, better than those little speakers. With the app I was able to program the radio stations I listen to. Took it on a picnic with friends and streamed Spotify for pretty much the whole day and the battery held up without needing a recharge and was still working when I got home. Unlike traditional speakers sound comes from all sides of the speaker's cylindrical shape so everyone sitting around hears it equally well.
