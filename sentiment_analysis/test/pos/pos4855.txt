A great way to help me  improve my meditation practice and keep mindful during the day.  By monitoring my breath rate, Spire feedback helps me slow my breathing down such that I can keep my body in a stress-free and more focused state. Spire helps me achieve conscious control of my breathing which is a simple but powerful way to reduce stress and maintain equanimity, especially in stressful situations.  Thank you Spire :0)
