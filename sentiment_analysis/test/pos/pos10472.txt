Bought this for my girlfriend who broke her iPhone. She loves it so far and I'm pretty jealous of it. It looks so cool. All I did for her was throw on a Google now launcher and she has transitioned smoothly. No complaints so far. Also the speakers are loud and really nice. Probably some of the best I've seen on any phone.
