Played these balls in the Dominican Republic on a buddies golf outing, initially started using Nike one balls when I remembered I had these in my bag , off the tee my caddy said wow straighter longer shot and he was right i gained an extra 20 yards and was hitting bombs there after on par 4 I hit an errant shot to the right from there I had 244 to the flag when I grabbed my 3 wood my caddy said no grab 5 iron and lay up but I protested and declared hey I'm on vacation he acquiesced I lined up hit the shot and guess what ? I hit ten yards past the flag and saved birdie my caddy whopped and jumped in the air when I reached the green. I know I hit a decent shot but I also know the ball was instrumental in making that shot possible so I would recommend you give these balls a try I did and I'm a believer I just wish they were $10.00 cheaper but that aside a great deal ***
