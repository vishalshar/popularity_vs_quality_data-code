Worth the price! I was doubtful at first, but I love my Soma Carafe. My only with was that the filter held a little more water to process at a time, and the bottom catch was a little larger. I didn't want to go with the larger pitcher, because we're trying to keep away from long-term use plastic products. I like that these are more sustainable than something like a Brita (at least as sustainable as a plastic disposable filter can be). I was a little worried about the neck being hard to hold onto if it had any condensation on it, but so far that hasn't been any issue.
