This thick plasticized mat really holds onto the kicked out kitty litter. Has deep nooks and crannies just like an English Muffin.The litter will not be tracked around the house with this mat at the entry to your litter box assuming your litter box has a cover with just one entry pointHowever, when its time to shake out the mat, these nooks and crannies don't want to let go of some of the kitty litter.I found that if I beat on the back of the mat, the stuck litter granules will eventually pop out. Unfortunately my mat developed a split from too much pounding on the back.  I have taped the split with Gorilla tape and it still grabs and hold the kitty litter in place.Even with my negative comments, this mat is the best one I have used for keeping the litter from being tracked about the house.
