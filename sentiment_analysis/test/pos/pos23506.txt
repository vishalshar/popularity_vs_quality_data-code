OMG I can't even begin to describe how much I love this blanket! I love sleeping bags but I dont really want to just unzip one and throw it on my bed so I started wondering if sleeping bag blankets exist and stumbled upon Rumpl blankets and man... I'm soooooo glad I did! I live in Snowy climate and this sucker keeps me and the wife warm and its oh so comfortable :)
