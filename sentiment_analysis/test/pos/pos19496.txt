Im writing this review a couple weeks after I first used the Petzi Treat Cam. I wanted to make sure that I used it many, many times over several days, before I wrote my review. I cant tell you how MANY people will write a review about a product they have hardly used. You have to use something,,,for a fair period of time, THEN you can write a fair review.  I have two cats. 16 years old. Both very active still, but I worry a little more now, because they are seniors. So I found Petzi Treat Cam. I was so happy somebody thought to invent this!!!! I will always have pets in my life, so I figured it was an investment. Those of you who find the price scary, think of it as an investment. Plus, it can be used to just generally view a room,,,,,,,kinda like a nanny cam. The set up was pretty easy. It took me about 10 minutes. My cats learned within 5 minutes, that treats come out of the unit. I think it will be different for each pet,,,,every pet has a different personality,,,and although my cats took to it easily, there may be pets out there, that are timid, and maybe afraid of it at first. They will get use to it....no worries.  So, Ive never had problems with WIFI connections. Ive been able to connect each time I would like, to view my cats. When you connect, a bell will go off at your home, letting your pet know you are "there". You CAN remotely turn off the bell,,,so that you can view your pet without disturbing them. You can call your pet over to the camera. Its one of the features I like the best,,,,,that you can call your pet. I suppose it would be nice if you could hear your pet,,,,,but they can only hear you. You cant hear your cat meow, or your doggie bark. You can launch treats at them with a touch of the button!!! LOVE IT. OK,,,here is the important part. If you have cats,,,,cat treats are MUCH smaller than dog treats. The units will launch like 10 cat treats at once. That is too much,,,in my opinion. I think that dog treats, like milk bones,,,are better for the unit. I think it might just spit out one or two of those.  IF YOU HAVE CATS: This is how Ive worked around the treat issue. Ive been just dropping a couple treats in the unit, if I think I will want to issue treats that day. That way I can make sure Im controlling how much my cats get. Its not any trouble to load treats. Super easy.  The camera quality is a pretty good. Its NOT the best camera quality......but its good enough for what the unit is for. It also has night vision, so you can see your pet in the dark. You can snap pictures of your pet getting treats,,or just enjoying how happy they are when you "drop in" to check on them. The unit comes with a mounting kit, so you can attach it to a wall if you like. I was kind of thinking that I would not mount my unit, because I like the idea of being able to move it around. However, I have found that once your pet realized where the treats come from,,,,they want to touch, paw and lick the unit. So, if its mounted to the wall, the camera is safe, and cant be knocked over, and mauled by an excited pet.Well, I think that that is about it. I think I covered everything. I really, really enjoy the Petzi Treat Cam, and I would buy another.
