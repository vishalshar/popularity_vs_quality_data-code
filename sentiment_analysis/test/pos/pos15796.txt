Well, dang -- I just got them in, and was all excited about putting a Pickle Pipe on the batch of pickles that I put up in a half gallon wide-mouth Mason jar on Saturday.  That way, I wouldn't have to remember to "burp" the jar this Saturday.The Pickle Pipes came in on schedule, and they sure do look great.  But -- alas -- I messed up and bought the Pickle Pipes sized for a REGULAR mouth Mason Jar, not the wide mouth jars.  The solution?  Just bought some regular mouth Mason jars so I can use this set of Pickle Pipes...and I ordered a set of wide mouthed Pickle Pipes, plus the pickle pebbles and a wooden pickle packer too.Now, I suppose I need to order some pickle pebbles for the standard mouth jars, come to think of it.  My goodness.
