This is an unbelievable value! Period. This smartphone features a fingerprint scanner, NFC, an up-to-date version of Android (Marshmallow with Nougat planned to roll out soon) and dual front facing speakers. You cannot find any other smartphone for under $200 that includes fingerprint scanner and NFC for mobile payments support because it does not exist except for the Nextbit Robin. The speakers aren't the greatest but much better than most since there is 2 of them and they face you instead of on the back like other phones.Cloud Back UP:The cloud back up solution for Apps is not for everyone but it is easily disabled in settings. With 32 GB of on-board storage; your typical smartphone user really does not need the cloud storage anyway.Things I disliked: ( 1 very minor thing)The only thing I don't like is the power button/fingerprint scanner is "Robin Blue" in color on my Midnight version. I don't mind the blue USB type-C charging cable but the button annoys me slightly  because it clashes with my outfits. I would have preferred they went with all gray/black color scheme on the "midnight" version and left the robin egg blue exclusive to the blue/white version.But this is a minuscule concern for Phone that is such an incredible value.Wrap-Up:I would definitely recommend it if you are on a tight budget but want a brand new unlocked Android Smart Phone with lots of bells and whistles included.
