I am so pleased with this product. I was slightly skeptical because I haven't really heard of this company much before but I took my chances. Boy, am I glad I did. I would like to note how elegant these look. They are very pleasing to look and are uber comfortable to wear. I've worn them (with glasses on) and I don't have any urge to take them off. I plugged them into my laptop and they worked great!I want to note that I have not used this for its intended use as a console gaming headset. I used them for PC gaming (yes, I took a chance but reviews online said it worked). I have it hooked up to my PC and have been gaming for about 3 hours. Sound Quality is great and with the 3 different EQ settings you can pick up on very subtle sounds in certain stealth games. It's great for listening to some tunes on the laptop as well and includes a 3.5mm cable to connect directly if need be! I thought that was a great addition.I can't speak for battery life seeing as how it's too soon.Overall I'm very pleased with this product and would highly recommend to the gamer/music lover.______________________________________________________________________________________NOTE: There's a LS40 coming out December 2016 for about $80 more but with a bit better sound quality. If you have the patience/$$, I'd say go for that!
