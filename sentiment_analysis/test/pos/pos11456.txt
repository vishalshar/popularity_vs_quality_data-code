I've had this product for over a year now and I'm really enjoying it.  I won't go into explicit detail with info you can read on the box, suffice it to say that if you are on the fence about purchasing this product, just do it.  You'll be glad you did.The best part of the whole experience is the customer service of Arccos.  Eventually, sensors will wear out (I've had two so far and a couple others are on their way out).  I emailed Arccos regarding these issues and they have quickly responded with sending me out replacement sensors and paid for the shipping back of the faulty sensors.  That alone keeps me interested in continuing to use Arccos.
