This is a really great mask, and I would give it 5 stars if not for the relatively high price for just one use.  With that being said, the high price can be justified by some vs. comparable services in a spa or salon.  In my experience, this product is just as good, and it left my skin looking noticeably younger, tighter, and rejuvenated.  I will buy again, but it will most likely be reserved for special occasions instead of a weekly or even bi-weekly product
