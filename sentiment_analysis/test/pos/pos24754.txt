My 15 year old son has been pestering me to get him some pine tar. He wears batting gloves, so I was hesitant to see him ruin his gloves. I stumbled across Grip Boost, and, after doing a little research, I ordered a bottle. At first, my son was skeptical, but I convinced him to give it a try. He started using Grip Boost when he hit with his wood bat and felt like he was getting a better grip on the bat. He still wasn't using it with his BBCOR. "It already has a bat grip on it." I told him to try it anyway, and now he won't step to the plate without Grip Boost. It's a great product. Let's him keep a relaxed grip without losing control of the bat, and it doesn't stain his gloves. I definitely recommend it.
