Ok,So I have had my Robox for a week now. I can say I'm very impressed.I have to admit I bought it on amazon just to have the option of returning it, since I read mixed reviews, and in general there is still not much real world info on this printer out there.The intention of this review is to be as objective as possible, but to be honest I'm already in love and printing like a kid with a new toy.After using it EXTENSIVELY this week I can tell you that the SW and FW upgrades on the last few months have done their job.The printer just works.I've used other printers before, (stratasys profesional, makerbot, printrbot, etc...), but this is the first one I own.I wanted something fast for fun, yet precise enough to prototype my engineering work. I did not want to fidget with it too much, and I wanted to be able to teach my wife to use it, without having to earn an engineering degree.I got everything I wanted.I have done side by side comparisons on THE SAME MODEL printed on Form 1, Makerbot, and Robox. Of course the laser Form 1 does not present evidence of layering, but the actual dimensional accuracy of the parts was tighter on the Robox on both the Normal and Fine settings.The layer quality is better on the Robox than any other printer I've used. If you print on fine you can barely see it's there.Be aware that Draft is just that... Quality is decent, but it does sacrifice a lot of detail. That being said, I use this mode the most. It is super fast and usually good enough. Then, if all is well, I do the print on the desired quality.Again, quite impressed. Kudos to CEL.I definitely recommend buying this printer.Oh, and by the way, robyneil's review here on amazon of this item is a MUST READ, it'll save you a lot of worrying. Follow that, and like me, you will have absolutely no issues.
