I got one each for my family, our niece, and our nephew.  An absolutely adorable idea--our littlest loves to the doll and our oldest likes the story.  Really impressed with the packaging and whole concept.  Hope more families with food allergy kids will buy into this idea--better than the teal pumpkin campaign because you can just go to every house and then ditch the peanuts later.
