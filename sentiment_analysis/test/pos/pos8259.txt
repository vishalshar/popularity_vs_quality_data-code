My kids eat them without complaint. I decided to go with this variety, since two of my children have constipation issues. I as hoping for more of a result with the added fiber but to be honest, I haven't seen much of a result just yet. Maybe it takes more time for their systems to adjust. Altogether though, I am quite happy.A note for parents with children under the recommended age, I wanted to give them to my 2 1/2 year old twins but the bottle indicates for children 3 and up. When I asked the manufacturer why this was, they said it was due to a choking hazard. I am comfortable with my children eating them while seated and supervised so I didn't feel this was a risk for my kids. I have been giving them to them without an issue. I wouldn't give to a child who isn't used to eating and chewing on small things that size.
