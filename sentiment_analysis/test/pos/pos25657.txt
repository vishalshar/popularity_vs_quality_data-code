I am thrilled with my new Canary Flex!  I was already using the original Canary in my family room monitoring two doorways and had just added another one downstairs in utility room, aimed at the "doggy door".  Both of these work so well that I was anxious to see and use the new smaller, more discreet Canary Flex.It was so easy to just add yet another new device to my already downloaded Canary app. on my iPhone, and I have now strategically placed it aimed at my front door.  Canary and Canary Flex are definitely the answer for an inexpensive security system and one with the ease, notifications, and flexibility I needed.
