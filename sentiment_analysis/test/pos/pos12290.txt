So happy I found this mat. Love it for a number of reasons:1) one piece - doesn't come apart and easier to clean than those puzzle mats;2) simple design - two sided, both relatively simple compared to other options;3) size - about 4'x6' is big enough for my husband, baby, and I to play on the mat; &4) comfortable - nice, thick mat that's cushy and comfy for the whole family.
