I researched for days for a gaming computer when my home office laptop decided to begin having some death throes!  So, I got this laptop QUICK to both work (and play a little) until I can save for my dream gaming machine.  I'm so glad I had already been researching for gaming because I was able to nix several "seemingly good looking" lappies on amazon for this finely built gorgeous gray beauty.  I have been loading programs and am so happy with it. For the price, and for what you get with internal hardware, performance is awesome. Glad I was able to get an i7-6500U, even if only 6th generation. i7 baby!Since it is technically a "notebook" (aka no DVD drive, slimmer and cooler running than a classic laptop) it's a lot lighter than my old lappy and with the backlit keyboard, I can't wait to take it on my next trip home. The backlit keyboard, brightness, and volume, etc are all a function keystroke away, so it's easy to change those settings, but I never had a backlit keyboard before so was happy to find those controls there.One day I'll get that glorious beast of a gaming system, but for now, at least I have a nicely upgraded home office workhorse. Wish it had a 1T hard drive, but I need to wean myself off HD storage and store onto detached drives so that I use better practices, and can switch between systems, as I do intend to get another computer and want both to be able to work off of, so, easiest way to share files is a detached HD.I had been looking at Best Buy etc, during my research, and I am perplexed why the newer machines have the keys so far away from the front edge of the keyboard area. My old lappy has the keys 3 3/4 inches from the front edge of the key panel area and this new one, and a lot of new ones in the store, have the keys farther back. The new notebook has the keys 4 1/2 inches from the front edge! That's quite a difference and it can be hard on the shoulders and neck to reach farther forward to reach your keys, so will have to adjust workstation to compensate (ie move lappy closer...). That means the screen will be closer to my face, which in my opinion is not a good change.... save your eyesight, people. It's weird. Maybe I'll wear sunglasses, or dim the screen a bit if working on docs with white backgrounds.. will have to test it out to see if it's an issue..  cmon lappy engineers don't do that to us.. But all in all I love this thing, it's only the first day, but I've customized icons, changed start menu, turned off wifi suckers, got rid of candy crush (really? why was it on there) and other non-essential stupid programs, explored W10  (some sucky bits there, but hey it's Microsoft whaddya want, I'm gonna curse under my breath - or loudly- depending on any more issues there because we hates it my precious --namely setting "default programs" for file types.. it wouldn't let me choose from programs.. only what it *thinks* is logical.. grrrr)..  now loading the one game that I hope to really test out the graphics card on, hopefully it will be a nice surprise, should be, since this is an upgrade from my old lappy. C'mon SWTOR load.. load... load.. hey it's a big game.. load... load  ok chant over, sry.UPDATE on gaming - tried it out last night loads game cut scenes and game itself at least 10x times faster than my older lappy (not exaggerating), and the graphics are SWEET!!! I'd give it six stars if I could.
