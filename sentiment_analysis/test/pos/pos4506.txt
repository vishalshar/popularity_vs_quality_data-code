My older Golden was looking chubby so I was looking for apps & stumbled on this. People think it's so funny to have a Fitbit for a dog but I had cut back on her food & wanted to work on her exercise. This has been a great tool! I found out on the 3 days I work she doesn't move much even though there is another dog there ( who's thin). So I'm walking her before work. You can track the hours she's active, days & months, even compare with other similar dogs & compete with friends dogs.  They set a goal for you or you can customize it which I did cause we'd never make the one they had set- I will increase it as we go along. I especially like that when summer comes we can count her swimming too. She has lost 3 pounds! Only 2 more to go. I can tell she feels better.  I didn't want to have her die early just because she was fat- that's the owners fault. This app helps me stay focused & not get too busy & forget to help her stay on track. Oh & you can even track your own Fitbit next to the dog if you want too. Everything was easy to use & understand. So glad I found this.
