Works as shown in videos and as described. tricky to use with 2 per-day treatments of Rogaine which can cause fibers moving into balls and coming out.  I've just tried to be more careful with timing of application around shampooing, Rogaine application, let dry, then styling and finally the Hair Fibers... Probably making more work than needed for myself, with the included product directions being less than desirable.I'm just using it now if being around others, including the gym, tho fibers due end up on gym towel frequently. Without gym sweat, as at home, I am not seeing fibers on pillow cases to be clear.Very glad I bought the largest size available...great product.
