As a tutor for children with autism, I use these cards A LOT. I've tried other sets, but none are as complete and well-thought out as this set. It has almost every visual category you can think of, identical matches, non-identical matches, an organizational system within it so you can put the cards in whatever you want. All of the cards are bright and easy to see, and on the back have a label, along with space to record when your child has mastered a particular card. Very useful teaching tool!
