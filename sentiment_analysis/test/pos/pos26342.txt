From the moment I heard about a portable pocket sized projector, I knew I needed to add this to the "must haves" in my briefcase. Being a salesperson that travels from meeting to meeting, unsure if the team I will be meeting with has guest access to wifi, a dongle or AirPlay so I can present on the big screen for the room, it could be nerve racking... and a complete waste of 15 minutes waiting for the prospects IT to set my computer up. I now have the cube in my arsenal to guarantee I can present anywhere that I go... I fully recommend this product for any salesperson looking to guarantee a smooth pitch.
