My overall impression with these car GPS mounts is rather pessimistic. I have tried replacements for Garmin, TomTom and SmartPhones. In all cases, Ive got weak, crappy and low quality mounts or bulky, impractical and low quality ones.Im glad to report that this particular mount is a nice exception. I have been using it for about 2 months, through the summer and it is holding nice and tight. Here some details:- Great iPhone Grip: It holds iPhone 4/5 without any problems, on the road and on the dirt. My previous experience with other holders is that some bumps in the road will cause the iPhone to go down. This one holds nice.- No shake: The structure of the holder is stiff and solid. It stays put.- Suction Cup: Nice design, it sticks to the windshield very nice. I have changed it few times from one vehicle to another and is still holding strong.- Size: It is not bulky and it is not small. I think the designed balanced the structure very accurately.- Assembling: Really a no brainer. One snap and one click and it is on.- Cost: at $16 bucks I think is money well spent. I you happen to planning on buying this and you have a cheaper hold in mind, please think carefully and read reviews. You may want to check my reviews, dont buy the cheap holder I reviewed, that was money out the window (and lots of frustration).
