These bars are fantastic! They are the perfect combination of flavor, performance, and nutrition. I love the fact that they are made from whole food ingredients and that I get a boost of caffeine energy along with them. My boyfriend and I take these skiing, hiking, and road tripping. I can't wait to try the other flavors, since the mocha latte is delicious!
