I absolutely love my LEAF! When I received it I was so excited! I work a lot and my job is a stressful job as well! The reason why I bought the Leaf is because I wanted to have a healthier lifestyle, stay more focused on my health goals and the Leaf is exactly what I needed for the extra push! I love the fact that it reminds me to be more active, do breathing exercises and tracks my period!!! I had no problems with syncing the device to the app, it was very easy to understand how it works and I absolutely love how beautiful the Leaf is!! My favorite way to wear it is as a bracelet but the other day I wore it as a necklace as well and I get so many compliments at the office! Now let's talk about the accuracy. I am beyond surprised to see how accurate the tracker is! Wow! Also most of other trackers don't store the data for more than few hours but the LEAF stores it for days and if I forget to sync it once my day is over the data is still stored the next day and once I sync it all my information are on my phone!!! LOVE IT! I love it at the gym, during the day and during the night. But what I LOVE the most about it is the constant reminder. I work out more, I am more aware of my monthly cycles and my favorite part of all, I started to do breathing exercises in the morning, which helps me tremendously!!! Every time I see my Leaf is a constant reminder towards my goal to a healthier life, physical and psychological!! I would gladly recommend Bellabeat LEAF to everyone. It is indeed a very smart, beautiful and very helpful piece of jewelry. Amazing!! Just amazing!!!
