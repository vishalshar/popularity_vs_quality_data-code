Fantastic. Takes 5 mins to break down and set up. Can fit on a 4 person oval dining room table. Charges all the cars at the same time and they actually last for a pretty good amount of time between recharges. Prefect mix of slot cars, mariocart and new technology for 90s kids and 5 year olds and up. Had it for 8 months now and still works like new with just cleaning the tires and wiping that fingerprints off the track every now and then. Great product
