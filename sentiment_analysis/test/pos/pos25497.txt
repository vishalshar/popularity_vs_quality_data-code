I saw a video on YouTube about this little invention. It was exactly what I have been looking for. Its perfect for storing brushes or letting them dry upside down after a wash. The price is decent, and worth the money. Makeup brushes are expensive, and this is a small price to pay to keep them in good shape and lasting!
