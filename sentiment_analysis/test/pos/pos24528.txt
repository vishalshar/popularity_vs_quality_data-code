This is a preliminary review. I plan to update this once my product is replaced.My initial impressions are that this is a nice laptop. Not much bloatware, if any. Nice and crisp boot up time. Surprisingly light. Definitely lighter than a Macbook Pro of the same size. I did notice what some have said about the screen and yea, I agree. As long as you're directly in front of it, it looks good. I didn't exactly buy this for gaming, more for coding so I'm fine with it. Would have paid $100 for it to have a nicer screen, though.I spent an hour or so "tweaking" Windows 10 to my taste before I noticed that the keyboard backlight feature wouldn't work. The hotkeys that control them would try to launch my web browser instead of controlling the backlight. All other hotkeys worked as intended. I contacted Asus support through their online chat. Very nice people. We tried uninstalling and reinstalling all relevant drivers (3 total). The issue remained. We tried resetting Windows 10. Again, the issue remained. At this point they told me it had to be hardware related and I'd need to contact the seller or try to warranty it through Asus. Immediately filed a return with Amazon.I'm disappointed that I had to send back the laptop the same day I received it. I'm happy Amazon is replacing it. I'm further disappointed that Amazon is taking 7 days to get it out to me.-1 star for the meh screen-1 star for broken feature (will add this back when I get a new, working, one)I'd deduct another star for Amazon's slow replacement shipping but that's not related to the item itself.edit: I've received the replacement. Seems to work great over the last week. Will add that 1 star back for the backlighting.
