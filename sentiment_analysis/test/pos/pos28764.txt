Put this on a 2015 Harley Davidson Street Glide and its awesome. Easily mounted up and I was able to adjust it to the angle I needed so it was not in my way but I could easily see my GPS map when I need to. The black anodized CNC machined aluminum looks great on my bars and it is very well built and sturdy. I use it for GPS and bluetooth. I use the case every day and surprise people when I stick it to various things around the office.
