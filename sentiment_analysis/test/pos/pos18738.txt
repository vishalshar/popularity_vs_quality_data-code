Recevied my new Bragi Dash's yesterday.  Finally decided to plunk down the $250 for these little earbuds after reading the positive reviews after the 2.2 update.  The packaging is extremely well done, better than Apple's packaging in my opinion.  I like how the box unfolds like a book. Very nice.  The aluminum metal material of the charging case and its sleeve feel great, and i like how the metal sleeve is designed so you can push out and expose the charging cradle.  So far they're working wonderfully.  No dropouts yet...but I'll test them really good this upcoming work week to see how they really do.  How do they perform while I'm out walking with my iPhone in different pockets or in large crowds?  We'll see.  But wearing them getting used to them around my house with my iPhone 6s plus & other devices has been a wonderful experience so far. I love the freedom of no wires getting in the way or tugging at my ears like my Jaybird Freedoms.  And like I said, no dropouts or lost signals or anything....yet.  I did hear some static interference & temporary lost signal (very brief) when using my Macbook Pro at times.  Nothing to warrant red flags as yet though. I paid $250 bucks for these little things so I REALLY hope i won't start having problems....the negative and pissy reviews concern me.  But I really like how they look and feel in my ears.  I don't like the stupid design Apple chose for their Airpods with that silly dangling extension for the mic.  Pretty dumb design choice in my opinion.  I have noticed that when switching between devices, like my iPad Mini 3 or my Macbook Pro, I'll have to disconnect them first in bluetooth settings and then go to the new device and switch it on there.  Kind of annoying because I had gotten so use to how my Jaybird Freedom F5s operate, how they so easily switched between 2 devices without the need to disconnect them first in bluetooth settings.  But still I like how they're performing so far.  They feel very comfortable in my ears (I'm using the Medium sized fitsleeves).I also purchased the new Muse 5 earbuds from Erato at the same time when i purchased the Dash.  The Muse 5s will delivered sometime in a couple of weeks.  Can't have too many wireless earbuds in case one has problems.  But as for my new Bragi Dash's, for the moment i'm happy with them.
