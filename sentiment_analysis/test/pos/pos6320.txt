I really wanted to love this product. Well, I don't love it, but I don't hate it either -- but only because I've modified it. Allow me to explain.The center holes in the two halves made the card case relatively easy to pull apart the halves ... until you actually put cards in the case. At such time as cards are enclosed, the halves are nearly impossible to get apart. There were no instructions, so it was a matter of trial and error - and a few broken fingernails -- to pry this thing apart.Since the implied primary usage is to protect card during travel, that is what drew me to the product. Well, a product designed for travel should actually consider HOW that product interacts with various methods of travel. One method of travel is camping and backpacking. During these types of travel and usage regular campers and backpackers learn to stay away from products with sharp edges that can snag or puncture expensive equipment.In the open position, this Card Caddy has 28 sharp edges. SERIOUSLY SHARP. In the closed position, there are still several edges that can snag.To solve the difficult opening problem, I filed off half of the little nubs that "snap" the card caddy closed. Should the card caddy ever become "loose", I can always use a simple hair bungee to keep it together in my pack.To solve the crazy sharp edged, I filed them down. None of  my filing affects the operation or utility of the card caddy.This is a clever design that is filling an need, but there needs to be a version 2.0 that more fully considers the end user and the uses.I'm still giving it 3-stars, and I don't think I'm 'bashing' the product unfairly.----- UPDATE -----Having used this deck keeper on two camping trips now (and I actually bought a second one), I've upgraded my rating to 4-stars. My fellow campers really liked the card keeper and the way it kept our card stacks under control with 5 people in my 3-person tent for the card games.In my photos you'll see how a simple hair bungee can be used to hold a set together -- note that you would only need to do that IF you file down the nubs like I have. Otherwise, the deck caddy snaps together TIGHT -- no bungee needed. In my other photos you will see the very subtle filing I did to sharp edges. Doing that helped me feel comfortable carrying the card caddy without fear of it snagging on other gear.
