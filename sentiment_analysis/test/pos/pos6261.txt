The Singlecue is not perfect yet, but very fun to use and explore. The immediacy of the gestures, such as volume and mute, is unrivaled. And, I have to admit I enjoy knocking guests' socks off :-).At first I thought my Sony TV isn't controlled well, and gave support a call. They suggested I try re-positioning Singlecue, so I moved it a bit, and all of a sudden the TV worked. I did feel kind of silly for not trying it myself before calling Bottom line, at this point it's for folks who are willing to try out new technology. The upside is you get to enjoy it right away. The downside is not everything is in place. Personally, I prefer enjoying what this device offers now, and am willing to wait for the rest to arrive later on.
