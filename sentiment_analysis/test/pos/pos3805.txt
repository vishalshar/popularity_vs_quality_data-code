Had to try 3 locations for the main unit because our house is a long ranch style with a basement, and the yard is lower on one end and downhill in the back.  So there was a spot where there was a narrow path out of the area with no signal or however you'd describe it, but then way out there it would shock and it was a long way back to safety.  We tried a couple of other spots to place the unit and found a good place where the boundaries were a good sweeping circle all the way around the house.  Being a long house, the area is smaller on the ends, and bigger on the front and rear.  It took time to train the miniature schnauzer and he would not get very far for awhile, but now he has become comfortable with his boundaries and we can just turn him out to do his business.  If we want to do a long walk, he knows when the collar is on him or not, and enjoys a leash walk from time to time.  We would buy this again but be advised to follow the directions and training procedure, and expect to take at least a couple of weeks.  Do your due diligence with the placement of the flags and check the signal so you get it right.  We put the collar on a stick so we could hold it at dog height and watch the red light without bending over the whole time.  That way we could mark the boundaries correctly.
