I bought these to keep on hand for when the grandkids are visiting, which is often.  For all the grandkids this year, I bought them all their own popcorn poppers but didnt realize how much they loved flavored seasonings on their popcorn.  So I decided to try this variety pack out so the kids could decide what their favorite was.The experiment was to see which ones they liked the best.. then later for birthdays or gifts.. I would give them full size jars of the favorite flavor...but the experiment was a dismal failure..  because they liked ALL of them though the Kettle Korn was the least liked.One thing that you pretty much have to do with these seasonings.... they work best if used on oily popcorn.. if you dry pop the corn there is nothing on the corn to hold the seasoning and will simply fall off the popcorn.. so even if you do not pop the corn  in oil... if you have a oil spritzer or some butter flavor spray...spray the popcorn or mist it with the oil so there is something to grab the flavors.I think it is a bit pricey for the size of the jars you get...for each one does not last very long.. but  yet... you get variety and choices.
