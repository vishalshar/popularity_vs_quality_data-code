Very sharp and seems good and sturdy; fortunately I haven't had to use this for its intended purpose and hope I never will.  The strap for the case could be a little longer and a little better quality (it doesn't have as much elasticity as I would have hoped), nonetheless,  it works.  Overall, I'd say at $12.99, it is very reasonably priced for what it is.
