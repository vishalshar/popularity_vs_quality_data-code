Greatest purchase i have made in years. the quality for watching movies is incredible and if positioned correctly larger than life. i use it for my play station and wii set up also and is awesome. i have used it to do power point presentations and eliminates having to transport conventional projectors to meetings. you will also have the ability to view photos and videos from the phone on family fun night that we have begun since the purchase. i recommend it to everyone and i have had 9 friends get it since I got mine. in addition, the cube is an awesome tool around the office.
