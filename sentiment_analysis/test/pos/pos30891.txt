I've had this mount for exactly 1 month and I'm largely happy with my purchase. I got Mountek after researching the many other mounts of this type, both magnetic and clamp style.On my iPhone 6, I placed the smaller magnet on the inside of my case without adhesive. It works perfectly and doesn't fall, the grip is very strong.On my iPad Mini 4, it's another story. With the larger magnet  inside the ? brand silicone case, the grip leaves a lot to desired. On repeated or one large jot, the iPad slides down and ultimately falls. I didn't want to attach the magnet on the iPad itself, so I put it on the outside of the case. Also not desirable but the only other solution. The magnet sticks with adhesive to case and grips strongly to the mount in my car.I would ask Mountek to strongly consider a discreet mount like this with magnets large enough to hold an iPad Mini 4 with magnet hidden behind case.
