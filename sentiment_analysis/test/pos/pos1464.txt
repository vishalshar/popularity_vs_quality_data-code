I first used a Grmin vivofit activity tracker, I used to love it because it was simple and it even counted my calories while I worked out, very specific with the chest strap on. However, I changed the battery on it and ruined it, got a Vivosmart afterwards, but the screen started fading after a couple of months and it is not stylish at all. I don't like wearing black and it was the only color option (even though underneath it has other colors). When I saw the Amazfit I fell in love with the design and price. I knew it was going to be much more simple than the other activity trackers and that I could only see my progress on the app, but I didn't mind.The reasons why I love it:- Vibrating alarm, I use it to get up, for daily reminders.. I have a short daily meeting and instead of having my phone ring, this vibrates wherever I am, even if I am away from my phone. I never miss the meeting.- Activity Tracking, it automatically detects when I jog and accounts it as "excercise" even though I am aware that these calories are estimated and not precise as with my previous tracker, garmin. It still provides some gratification for having worked out a bit. It does count my steps and keeps me motivated to move more, which is the whole point of an activity tracker.- Sleep tracking, again, it does not track naps but it provides some cool tips for getting better sleep and provides the basic info. Total sleep, deep sleep, light sleep. Ever since I got it, I have been sleeping a lot better, thanks to the tips it gives me... like getting up early every weekend instead of sleeping in.. who knew! I also stopped drinking coffee.- So stylish! - Even though I am using with the original band it came with. I still think it's stylish enough that I can wear it even with an evening gown, unlike the Garmin which I struggled with and which I usually tried to hide.Summary: It is basic but it works, nice tips feature to keep you motivated, vibrating alarm, stylish but not overpriced!
