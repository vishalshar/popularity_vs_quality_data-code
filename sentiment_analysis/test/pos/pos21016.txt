This is my daughter's all time favorite sleep sack.  It's warm and soft, easy to put on, and a durable product for how much use I have gotten from it.  I will also say that Catherine is wonderful at customer service, if you are having any issues whatsoever with the product.  The zipper on my sleep sack broke after fair use, and she immediately proposed to replace the item.  We are back in business for bedtime, and this sleep sack is one of the main reasons why our baby sleeps so well!
