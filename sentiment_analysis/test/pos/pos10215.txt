Pretty nicely made...seems like good quality.  It was a little difficult to make it fit in my GMC truck because of the way the dash is made.  The "insert" doesn't go deep enough into the CD player unless you tilt the brackets forward a little.  Still works fine and is holding my iPad Mini in the landscape orientation.
