The Bluesmart suitcase is awesome. It's a powered suitcase that has a bunch of neat features that really set it apart from other suitcases available on the market. It conveniently links up to your phone via bluetooth and an app. The interface of the app is clean, simple, and easy to navigate. Using the app you can lock/unlock your suitcase, keep track of it's location, weigh the contents within the suitcase, and keep track of it's own battery life. One of the things that really attracted me to the suitcase was the fact that it has two USB ports that you can use for charging your phone or mobile device in a pinch or on the go. No more huddling around power outlets in the airport while you wait for your flight! The suitcase itself is roomy and fits enough inside for your typical business trip or weekend getaway. There is also a convenient and surprisingly huge front compartment that has a padded laptop pouch, two padded pouches for other mobile devices, and more space for other things.The price of the Bluesmart is a little high, but definitely makes up for it with all it's features. It would also be nice if the Bluesmart came in other colors and sizes, but i'm sure we can expect this from the brand in the future.Overall great purchase! Easy to use smart luggage that will make going through airports a lot easier and more enjoyable!------------------------------------------------------------------Some tips on getting started -Before you can use smart features, you must charge the suitcase for at least 30 mins.Quick start directions are on small tag on the outside of bag.
