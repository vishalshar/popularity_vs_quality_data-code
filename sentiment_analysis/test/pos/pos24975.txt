I got this phone for my wife for Christmas.  She broke her previous two!!  When I saw the price I immediately jumped at the opportunity to get it.  A snapdragon 808 and 3GB of ram for under two hundred dollars is an incredible deal!!  I can't believe they have dropped the price AGAIN(wonder if I could get some money back, hmm)!The phone performs better than my wife's previous phone the Oneplus One.  Of course it does, the processor is better!  I think the One has an 801.  She is able to comfortably search the web, facebook and whats app all while on the phone with me AND sending me an MMS.  She absolutely loves it.My wife was concerned about the cloud storage and low on phone memory.  She actually uses most of her storage for photos and videos that she takes.  When I showed her how to free up the phone space using google photos she was OK with it.  We have yet to need or use the cloud backup that Nextbit provides but I am sure that we will need to in the future.  We just recently turned on the feature but I don't have any feedback on that yet.The cell call quality is great.  The speakers work great for voice but the bass while playing music is kinda muddy.  The camera is very satisfactory although slow.  She has yet to turn on the finger print lock yet so we can't comment on that.Battery life has been fine for my wife as well.  She doesn't use it all day long and the quick charge has surprised her and changed her charging habits.My wife went straight to the google now launcher because she loves the swipe left for her feed so we also can't comment too much on Robin's stock launcher.  But everything else looks fantastic!!  They clearly put a lot of work into the interface and it looks beautiful!  My wife is a huge fan!At this price I am actually thinking of getting one as well, not to replace my Oneplus 3, but for a backup phone!Overall HIGHLY recommended!
