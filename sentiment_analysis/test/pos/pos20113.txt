Love it! Bought it for my 13 yr old daughter who's started struggling with acne.. I don't believe in using loads of chemicals on a child's face ( or an adult for that matter) so I wanted something natural, safe and chemical free! She loves the way it makes her skin feel, doesn't dry it out like typical acne cleansers.. It's only been a week, and she said there is a small improvement.. Even if it takes awhile, I'm glad to know I'm not feeding her skin full of bad, icky chemicals!
