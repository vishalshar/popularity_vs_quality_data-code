Excellent Product at the beginning i was skeptical about it due that is a kickstater phone, and its a plastic phone, usually they are not as good as flagships, heard a lot of things of the phone having 100 Gb on cloud sounds cool, having dual stereo speakers its more than okay for today flagship phone, then i saw a lot of reviews and one of the best was from Android Authority is one of the best, phone is snappy and works perfect for having social media and other stuff like calls and watching videos is totally worth it for this piece of tech for $149.99 is more than good this phone was at $399.99 i just got the Honor 8  that is twice the price and the NextBit Robin works perfect and had previously an Samsung S6 Edge + and still quality of the phone is really good for price of the Honor 8 and NextBit Robin are great phones, For the Buck is really a good phone, just look out to have a protector on the phone to makeit las longer due that is quite delicate with skinny jeans. beyond that if you have the money its worth it for this price you can't get any better than this most of the phone are slow and suck big time.
