I buy lots of stuff from Amazon but don't write reviews unless the product is an utter standout.  The Mountek nGroove Snap+ is far and away the best car mount I've used.  It sets up in seconds - you slide it into the CD player (or a groove in the dash), tighten a knob, and touch your device to the mount.  The magnets hold the device firmly in place, and when you need to remove it, you just pull.My package contained two plates.  I stuck one of them to the back of my phone.  However, you could also just stick the plate inside your phone case.There's not much else to say.  This product is the best!
