I've been searching everywhere for a healthy snack that actually tastes delicious.  Finally, I found Think Jerky!  I love all the flavors and that makes a lot of sense because all of them are recipes by really famous and accomplished chefs.  Unlike Crave or other bland, dry and inferior jerky's you'd buy at a gas station; Think Jerky is a burst of flavor and I can't believe its all under 100 calories.  Highly recommend!!!!!!!!
