This has been one of the best buys in cellphone technology we have made in a while. The phone runs apps seamlessly and here is no clunkiness to the interface. I am not a fan of Android, but this phone has me close to sold on the idea that Android might be the way to go.We purchased this phone for our tech savvy teen who had researched all the best possibilities within the budget. We were skeptical at first becuase of the independant brand, but we quicklylearned that their reputation was pretty solid.So far it has exceeded expectations in everyway with a great clear screen, fast processor and extraordinary camera!
