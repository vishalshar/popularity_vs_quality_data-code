Moving from the Aria to this after a few years, I immediately found that the Withings scale was FAR more consistent. I have been weighing myself every day, several times in a succession, with each scale.What I found is that the Withings first is consistently giving me a reading of about ~2-3lbs less than the Aria. That doesn't mean as much as the consistency for me, personally. When it comes to scales, I'll take consistently off over randomly right~5 weigh-ins with the Aria and I'll see up to 1.5lbs of variation.~5 weigh-ins with the Withings Body and I'll see less than .3lbs.This is why I'm sticking with the Withings scale.The app is also great and syncs up with all the major services (Google Fit, MFP, Fitbit, etc.)
