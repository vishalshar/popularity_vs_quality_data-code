Simple design, reliable and easy use.  Bought a makerbot Replicator 5gen 2 years ago for about $3,600 and it never work as well as this device for $300 on sale.  Produces accurate prints that a XYZprinting da Vinci Jr doesn't.  Can't go wrong for the price.  A makerbot Smart extruder cost $200 along.  So I highly recommend this printer.
