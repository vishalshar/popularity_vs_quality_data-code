I love these things for splitboarding and backpacking. They definitely help me focus and give me a boost without any jitters. My favorite time to take them is when I am slogging through the last few miles of a long trip. It's also nice waking up and being able to get after it without a stomach full of coffee.  When I use them, I take anywhere from 1-3 a day, depending on the activity. I also use them for studying or when I am working late. I like the taste too, I'm not sure why some people are put off by it.
