Wow! I absolutely love this laptop! I had a desktop computer for a very long time and just recently I've had issues with having to lug around heavy college books around my university. I finally decided it was time to invest in a good laptop that I could use for school (and also be able to play some video games on the side). This is my first time owning a laptop and I had very low expectations because I was trying to find a decent one under $1k (that would still be able to handle pc games). While comparing all other laptops, I found this one to be the best quality at the right price. Once I received it, turned it on, went on the browser, did my homework, and installed and played several pc games, I found this laptop to be amazing! I've used different games on the highest graphics settings and this laptop handles it like a beast! No lag, no errors, nothing! The only thing I thought was weird was that it had no CD Drive (but I've managed without one) and the headphone and microphone jack are combined into one (which is actually really convenient).
