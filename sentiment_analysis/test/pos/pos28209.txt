This is my third computer with an i7, 16GB of RAM. What really sold me was the 4GB Graphics card, 512 SSD, and the ability to add 8GB of RAM as well as an extra HDD. It's able to play games on the highest graphic setting. It boots up as fast as my phone and tablet. It's able to handle intense programs, such as music editing software, programming, games, etc... It's a sturdy build, I personally like the size, 15.6 inch screen. It's not a touch screen or a 2 in 1 like other high end laptops, but I don't find those features particularly useful. I just sold a Microsoft Surface Pro to get this.I've never had a machine as great as this one, and honestly, the specs don't get much better than these. While I got mine for around $800, I'm not sure how much better a $2000 machine would be.
