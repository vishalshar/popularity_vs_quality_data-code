Thin and light case, protective, holds my iPhone 6s Plus very securely to my Quad Lock Out Front mount.The case fits on the phone very securely.  But it's not hard to remove the phone from the case.  Some people like this case enough to use it daily, even when not biking. I have 2 other cases I prefer when not biking, and it's not hard to swap out the cases.I like that the case is sold separately.  You can invest in bike mounts for each of your bikes, and if you get a new phone, you can buy the quad lock case for the new phone but keep all your same mounts.I wish the case came with the clear cover.  The price for the case alone is reasonable, but the case + cover is more than I want to spend, especially since I've separately purchased the bike mount.One tip for people who haven't used a handlebar mount for their smartphone:  leaving the map app open and the phone's GPS on will drain the battery quickly.  Make sure you're fully charged before a long ride.
