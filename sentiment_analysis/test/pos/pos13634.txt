I love being able to use the grid and the notes sections separately but have access to both. It is a nice balance that makes it easily multipurpose. I use it for some of my most important ideas and notes that I have throughout the day as well as simple wireframes that I want to jot down.One of my favorite features is that it lays flat without bouncing back up as well as when you close it, it actually stays closed. It's the simple things but these really matter to me.
