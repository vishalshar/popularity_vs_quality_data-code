I can see why Oprah recommends this product!  It came packaged nicely and all I had to do was plug it in, configure it and I had video surveillance on my phone in about 5-10 minutes.  I have the original canary and this seems to work well together.  I cannot comment yet on the extent of battery life but it is still going strong at 5 days.  I plan to buy a few more and give one to my parents as it is definitely easy enough for them to handle!  It would be nice if they eventually make on that can be linked to a data plan...there are some places outside my house that don't quite reach my wifi signal.Anyway, I would definitely recommend this product and hope you enjoy it as much as I do.  I cant stress enough how easy this is to use!
