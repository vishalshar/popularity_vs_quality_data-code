Works great, right out of the box. Whomever is having trouble using this as a separate monitor for Mac needs to uncheck the mirror option because I am using it as a third monitor along with another external monitor. Nice to be able to not have to lug a full size monitor around and I also use it with my Note Edge when I want to leave my Mac at home. Great Buy warning doesn't work well in well lit rooms but has been very helpful for presenting on the go when projector is not availableUpdate: 5 Sept 2016 The included cord is short and is the ONLY one that will work with the projector, if you want a longer HDMI you will have to buy a female to female HDMI adapter to extend it. I have had an adapter with a 7 foot cord on it. When I have company over for football during the season we watch I project on the side of the house as pictured. The power outlet on the side takes a normal droid "tip" usb connection, so I plug in a fast charge power adapter and have gotten up to 5 or six continuous hours of play out of it.  My son has used it for XBOX I use it for some office presentations though the text can be a little difficult to read do to resolution, no complaints from who I used it to present to. Ambient light kills the screen with light wash out but it's very clear in pitch black conditions and projects up to a 100 inch screen with no issues IMO. Worth the investment for me just be careful not to break the charge connection as it is extremely delicate. I got an HDMI extension for my cell phone and I have a 100 inch screen that I can use my Watch ESPN mobile app anywhere I go as well as any other mobile app such as NFL Sunday Ticket, programs on Kodi, etc....
