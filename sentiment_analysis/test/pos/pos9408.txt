Works correct, set up is easy. Distance sometimes not big enough. It takes time to update ( I was traveling from Zimbabwe to Namibia by plane and in Namibia it show me the piece im Zimbabwe). It works not with my aluminium suitcase. You can find easy your smarphone ( the other way around) from the xy3. Is not a solution against stealing.
