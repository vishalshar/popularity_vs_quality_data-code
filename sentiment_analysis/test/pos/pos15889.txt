If you need to satisfy the urge to crunch and do it healthy, these are for you!  They are the best tasting baked apple chips I have ever had.  They taste delicious alone or paired with a fruit dip.  Fuji apples provide a slightly tart, slightly sweet flavor that is perfect as a chip.  Will order again and again.
