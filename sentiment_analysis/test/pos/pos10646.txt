Loved it from first application!  Dark rich black.....makes my long light colored eyelashes visible.  No stiffness/flakes as noted by others.  I prefer a natural look and therefore I HATE mascara....the clumps, the racoon eyes, the horrible obviousness etc...This is perfect.  Looks as natural as possible.  Applied once three days ago.  Can still see evidence of the tint.....no running, no flaking.  I'm sold!
