There is some value to this case ... it is a bit thick be forewarned.  Looking at the pictures, I was under the impression that there would be a type of sleeve for credit cards.  There needs to be a staggered clear plastic sleeve for four or five cards.  As it stands, there is one plastic clip.  It is not ideal.The other issue is that the plastic is a bit slick.  NOT outright slick, but not like other covers that offer better grip.  When you are dealing with a 6 +, that is a big phone.  Grip is an issue.The mirror is fine ... no complaints there ... but then again, not my primary concern.Bottom line:  The case is useful (and has replaced my wallet), but it needs some tweaking.  It IS worth the $20 or so it is priced at and I'd buy it again.  That said, I'd buy its replacement if it was a bit thinner, offered better grip and had a credit card sleeve.
