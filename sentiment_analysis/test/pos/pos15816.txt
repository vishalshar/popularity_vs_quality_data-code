I bought them kits for Christmas and they love them!  They can do this independently, but also fun to play with them.  I know there are more/ additional instructions on YouTube but so far we haven't needed them!  Instruction booklet is self-explanatory and has great pictures and descriptions.  I see this as a toy that will last us years!
