Just hooked mine up - worked like a charm.  App connected right away, very simple.  I was also intimidated about wiring it into my opener and potentially short circuiting but it was really easy, first try, and I'm not handy at all.  It doesn't come with directions but there are very easy yet detailed ones online and even within the app.  So far, so good.Addition: hopefully in the future they'll sell additional target stickers
