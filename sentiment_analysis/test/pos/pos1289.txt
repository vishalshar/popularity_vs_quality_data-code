I couldn't quite believe it,but purchased the bags anyway.I had two large chunks of pepper jack cheese and put them into one of the bags and then into the refrigerator and then promptly forgot about it.Yesterday I wanted something to nibble on and remembered the pepper jack.I was kind of afraid to open it for fear of what I would find,figured all I would find was two lumps of mold.Well- what I did find was perfectly good cheese after it has been in the bag for almost a month.Needless to say - this was one of my better online purchases.
