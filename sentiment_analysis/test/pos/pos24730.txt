I la-la-love ALL the Barnana flavors! The peanut butter though has got to be the BEST! At first I was hesitant to order these online because I was afraid they would melt on the way here. I went ahead and ordered a box of 12 bags since I go thru these little suckers so quick! Contrary to my believe, they were so well packaged w/stickers on the outside of the box that read "protect from heat". In addition to that, once I opened the box I saw the thermal insulation packaging which assisted in keeping these from melting. Thank you Barnana for thinking of every detail when shipping packages to customers! I will definitely continue to order theses vs buying them at the store. The convenience certainly out ways having to drive from store to store to hunt for specific flavors.
