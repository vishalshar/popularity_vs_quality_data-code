I am upgrading to this device from the Misfit Flash. I received this device on the actual release date. I heard some people who received it early and experienced some issues upon syncing with the app, however, if you are looking to buy this device now I am happy to say syncing issues should be solved.I of course removed my flash before syncing to prevent any problems and within minutes the Misfit app recognized and synced the Shine 2 with no issues.The Shine 2 worked just as well as my Flash in tracking my steps, sleep, and other activities. The notification alerts are great (my new favorite feature) and the LEDs are brighter than the Flash.I did have some trouble with the Shine 2 popping off when putting on the wristband and once when I woke up BUT that was my mistake. Since I did not have the original Shine I am not sure if this was included, but the strap has two slots to secure the plastic back cradle. Make sure the strap and cradle are secure and also the Shine 2 itself has indentions on the back that are supposed to lock into the cradle! After realizing that I have had no issues with it popping out again.When I do change from the strap to the clip I always have to make sure the strap, cradle, and Shine 2 are attached properly.It is a really beautiful device and is perfect for those who don't want an activity tracker that sticks out like a sore thumb. The Misfit Shine 2 does what it advertises and looks professional as well.Check out an unboxing of it: http://youtu.be/TcyqS2kQ8Wo
