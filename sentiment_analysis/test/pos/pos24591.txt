The drawing app that works with this takes some practice, but is AMAZINGLY awesome once you get the hang of it.  Love the games.  Let's face it, kids are obsessed with devices these days, and this brings the game back OUT of the ipad into the physical world.  There are so many positive things to say about that when everything seems to be virtual these days.  I highly recommend this!
