This is a great water pitcher. First all, the water comes down so fast that you can have at least a full cup of water right away. I have used other brands (at least 2 different brand), both would take at least 1 min to have a full cup of water. Second, the design is great and stylish. The nice touch of wood makes it look so much better than the other plastic ones. Last but the most, it does the job. We moved to a new area and we started noticing that the water tastes funny. The taste completely disappeared after I started using this. A great product! I would recommend to everyone who are looking for a nice water pitcher
