I give this 5 stars because:* Small enough to always wear incase accidental escapes* Lasts a month between charges* Actually finds dogs!First and foremost, Whistle helped me find my English Setter today. I mention the breed because everyone I've meet that has had an English Setter remarks on how they love to run. This morning, I accidentally clipped the leash to loop for his tag rather than the loop for the collar before going on our run. Shortly after we started, he pulled that loop apart and ran off. Since he broke the loop, his tag with our phone number fell off and he's running down the street like a maniac. He's ridiculously fast, giving me no hope to keep up on foot, I started the tracker and went back to my car. By the time I was in the car, he was already pretty far away. Before having the tracker, if I lost sight of him, it was like finding a needle in a haystack. Having it tell me his last location, I at least know the general vicinity.During the frantic time of trying to find him, I was frustrated on how infrequently his location updated, maybe every 5 minutes or so, but I think this is a good compromise to ensure the battery lasted long enough for me to find him. It actually took me three times of getting out of the car and chasing after him (and loosing sight again) over busy intersections before actually getting him. While searching, I thought of a couple app improvements that would have helped:* Sound notification when the location is updated. While driving, it was frustrating to have to constantly look at my phone to see if his location was updated.* Night mode. It was disorienting to look at my bright phone then back up at the dark surroundings.I've had this tracker for 5 months and this is the first time I've had to track him. I was slightly nervous if it actually worked, but I'm glad to know it does. Sure, there could be improvements and some of the complaints, particularly from former TAGG owners, made me really question getting this, but I am so glad I did. From a hardware perspective, this device is solid. The software is good, but more importantly, Whistle is always making improvements and those things can be fixed after you buy the device.This is my first Amazon review. Everything else I buy already has great reviews, so there is no need for me to contribute to the praise. But in the case of Whistle, there was that brief transition period where apparently the software did not work well and people were outraged. I got my Whistle after the big app update, so I didn't experience the previous issues. Since I don't use any of the activity tracking features, it sounds like I would have liked TAGG better, but I don't really care. The fact is, this is the current best product for finding your dog.Another common complaint is about the activity tracking features. I don't use them and couldn't care less about them. If this is important to you, I can't speak to how well that works. I set an unobtainable goal so I don't get notified about him meeting it (there's no notification for not meeting the goal). Although, I was injured for about 3 weeks and the Whistle app did notify me that my dog wasn't as active as usual. I thought that was kind of funny.One undocumented feature is the burglar alarm capabilities. If someone broke into my house, my dog would be gone so fast, thereby notifying me he left the whistle zone. I would know immediately someone broke into my house :)If you're on the fence about this product because of the negative reviews, they have largely been resolved. The Whistle GPS Tracker probably saved my dog's life. My dog would literally run himself to death, either by getting hit by a car or pure exhaustion. Before Whistle, we got extremely lucky that he was found before either of those things happened, but it was only a matter of time. The investment is well worth the piece of mind.
