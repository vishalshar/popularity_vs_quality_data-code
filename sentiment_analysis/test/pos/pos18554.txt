They fit easily on the nose.  although they are delicate, they don't seem cheap.  The two problems I had with them is : 1  don't stick to sillicone or rubberized surface,such as my cellphone cover.  2. I have an older smartphone,a 4s,if I adhere the glasses ,they block the camera and light.  I was forced to put them in my wallet ,where their thinness made them an unobtrusive fit.
