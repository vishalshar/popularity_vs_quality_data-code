My fiancé needs the sound of a fan to sleep. He usually uses a real fan which drives me nuts! The real fan is too big and takes up too much room in the small bedroom in our condo and since we live in New England the room is typically freezing when he uses the real fan during the fall, winter & spring. I would crank up the heat (and my heating bill) or sleep in another room. He would take a smaller real fan on business trips because he has trouble sleeping in hotels as well. Taking the smaller real fan takes up too much room in the suit case. He's used various apps but they just do not work the same way (complains of the looping). I bought the LectroFan Micro for him for Christmas.... This thing is TINY (fits in the nightstand drawer when not in use or right in your purse). Almost the size of a make up compact or small travel jar of face cream. He raved about this product and so do I. No more big ugly fan and freezing cold bedroom. Bonus is you can play music using blue tooth (great for the beach). There are several sounds on the micro. It's not a huge sound menu but typically those who need a sound machine favor one or two sounds anyway. I highly recommend this product! LectroFan - Micro, Wireless Sound Machine With A Twist, White
