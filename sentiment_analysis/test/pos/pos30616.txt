I have the original Mountek CD phone mount, and now own this one too. The reason I got this one is because I recently bought a new car stereo with a volume knob the size of jupiter, and I discovered after I had already installed it that when I inserted the original Mountek mount, the edge of it presses against the knob, making it impossible to adjust the volume when the mount was in.So I bought this new one in hopes that it would fit better, as it looked a little sleeker. Well, it helped a little, but I had to be VERY careful how I positioned it. However, while I was testing it out, the volume knob actually fell off, leaving a little nub I could still adjust, thereby indirectly solving my problem :)As for tablets, I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.1... figured I'd try it out for the sake of this review, even though I didn't plan on using it this way. Well, it *does* fit, but the mount doesn't feel all that sturdy to me, so I don't think I'd actually drive anywhere with it. If nothing else, it would probably wobble a lot. However, I feel pretty certain it would work fine for a smaller/light tablet like the iPad Mini, although I don't have one of those to test with currently.That being said, your mileage may vary with big tablets ...
