I absolutely love these things and original is the best flavor, I like all the flavors except the hot chili one which I had to throw away. The price on Amazon was great compared to the store although they are so delicious I would still pay the $3.69 a bag in the store for them.They are a healthy anytime of the day snack and have the perfect crunch and sweetness.
