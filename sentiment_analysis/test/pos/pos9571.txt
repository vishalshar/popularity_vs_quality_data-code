I've tried sturdy window, cup and vent mounts before and this is by far my favorite. My reason of preference is the location of this mount.I don't use CD at all, so this mount works out for me. It was very easy to set up, came with extra padding sponge for the arms. The mount feels pretty secure, but I wish it could improve is ability to swivel more left and right. It's pretty subtle for now, but i'll gladly take subtlety+stability over flexibility+instability/shaking. Otherwise, it's absolutely fantastic. It's located just enough from the vent so no AC vent is compromised!I have IPHONE 5S, and I use 35mm port for earphones or auxilary cable all the time in the car. When the phone is in this mount, there is PLENTY space for charging port, but the 35mm entry was blocked by left of the bottom support. So I just added an extra padding to RIGHT SIDE, so the phone is now off-center pushed to the left. Now there's still plenty room in charging area and i get to plug in my cables easily without any problem!

But like i mentioned, i don't really use CD, so it doens't matter much for me. Cosmetically probably will be less attractive, but i guess i'll find out how i'll feel when that time comes. :P
