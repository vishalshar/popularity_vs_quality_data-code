I have been feeding this food to my Groanendael aka Belgian Shepherd since he came to me at 12 weeks. He is now 18 months old. I chose Victors originally, based on the breeder's recommendation. He has always eaten it without problems. He has grown into a happy, healthy high energy boy without any health issues. His coat is gorgeous. His teeth are clean and bright. I have thought to try another formula / brand but why? Victors has an excellent reputation,  excellent formulation and for me, excellent results. The price is reasonable for a premium dog food.
