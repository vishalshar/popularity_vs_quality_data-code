Just got a chance to use the bag for the first time on a trip an overnight trip to Seattle and couldn't rave about it enough! I even had one of the flight attendants on my flight compliment my bag.Had a long wait at the terminal on my way home and the dual chargers really came in handy! I forgot to charge my iPad before I left and thankfully I was able to charge it enough to watch a full movie on the way home.Size of the bag was just right for my trip, was able to pack my computer, iPad, chargers, extra pair of shoes, business outfit and all my carry-on toiletries and still had some room to spare.If I had any complaints about the bag it would be the bluetooth lock - while it did provide me with an extra sense of security, it did take a few extra seconds to take out my phone and unlock the bag when I wanted to access it quickly. But I think this is the tradeoff you make by having an extra secure bag.Overall, love the product and looking forward to future updates to the app.
