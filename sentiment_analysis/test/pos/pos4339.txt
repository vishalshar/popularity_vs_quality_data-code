I preordered this after having a good experience with iHome iSP5 - the main difference is that this plug has an additional remote that allows you to control power to the outlet, in addition to using your app to control it. I am mainly using these outlets to control floor lamps.After receiving this in the mail, I was able to set this outlet up in less than 3 minutes for Apple HomeKit usage. I can't say that I use the remote that often since I have automation set up, but it will be most useful for those that come over to turn on the light. The outlet itself is fairly wide, but does not block the lower outlet when plugged in.
