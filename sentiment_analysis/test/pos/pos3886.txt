I am still playing with it, of  but it is very promising for hunting purposes. I can detect thermal images of living objects such as dogs, flying geese and even small common birds up to 30 yards. The furthest dog has been about 70 yards and was not very distinct, but was visible as a moving warm object. A human can easily be identified as such at 60 yards, and that is as far as I have tried. I hope to use my Seek thermal to spot living deer movement in the darkness, and for trailing and recovering deer.
