We purchased the Kitty Kat Loo for our Chihuahua puppy and he used it without fuss from day one. He started to chew on the fake grass layer after the first week while we were at work. So, we bought four giant river pebbles to weigh down the corners and haven't had any issues since.If you don't flush the Loo and empty the tray every night, the smell can get a bit much. To combat this, I'm now experimenting with bags of activated carbon etc that you can get from aquarium stores.Overall, great product. Really light so it's not too much of a drag to perform weekly cleaning.
