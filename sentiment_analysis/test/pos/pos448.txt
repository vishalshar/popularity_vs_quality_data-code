This Filament is really good so far. I've been using it for a couple weeks now and I haven't had any problems. I've found a good temperature for this PLA is 200 degrees. The price is right for 0.5 KG, so you can buy two colors for around the same price as 1KG of a single color. Another nice feature is the resealable bag that the roll comes packaged in. It keeps your filament fresher for longer and you can also fit a 1KG roll in it as well.in Picture: Print on the left has some imperfections due to setting the temp too high, but the print on the right is a raspberry pi case that came out pretty goodAIO Robotics AIOBRIGHTBLUE PLA 3D Printer Filament, 0.5 kg Spool, Dimensional Accuracy +/- 0.02 mm, 1.75 mm, Bright Blue
