Bought this as a gift and both the human and the cat love it. I think its absurd, but they think its fantastic. The human gets to see the cat, talk to the cat, and give treats to the cat. The cat gets to hear the human and get treats.Connects easily enough to wifi and the mobile app is pretty good. There's a "social network" of sorts in the app, which again, I think is quite absurd. But then again... it's my fault for buying the silly thing.
