The entire system is by far the best I've seen for mounting iPhones. I tried and returned a few other systems throughout the years. I was concerned about the "hump" on the back of the case with the Quad Lock system, but it's hardly noticeable and sits much more flat than I expected. It sits on a table better than the iPhone 6 does with its stupidly bulging camera lens. I will likely be getting the car mounts and got some wall mounts and eagerly await the new style of bike mount that may work better considering my tubes make an odd angle of viewing on the handlebars. It will also fit more securely on my motorcycle if I want. Other mounting devices would no way work on my motorcycle as they seemed cheaply made and overpriced. This was well worth the few extra dollars.
