This filament is consistently great. It comes fast and is a good price.  I've never had any problems and I've used many spools from a AIO.  Consistent quality is key. The new packaging, shown in the picture, has a big sticker that tells you the color of the filament inside. That helps me a lot in my shop so I can quickly see what I have without having to read the boxes. Small details and make a big difference.  The older boxes in the photo I hand wrote the color on,  So you can see why I appreciate the upgrade. It works very well in their Zeus printer. The filament is tuned to work with their printer so if you have an AIO robotics printer this stuff is excellent. It also works beautifully and all my other machines.
