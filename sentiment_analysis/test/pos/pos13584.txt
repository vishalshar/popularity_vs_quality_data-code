Got it for my son's 13th birthday, he's played hard with it and it still works. He liked it so much my daughter (10) scraped together her birthday and Christmas cash and got one for herself. It seems to live up to the ads, and unlike other drone-type toys we've bought, it hasn't broken and they still play with it after a few weeks.
