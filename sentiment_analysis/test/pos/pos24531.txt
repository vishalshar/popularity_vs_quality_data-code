Only had this laptop a couple days, bought to replace a 14 month old ASUS Zenbook UX303LB QHD with a broken hinge.  I'm writing to add to the discussion of screen quality:  This laptops screen is definitely not as nice a screen as the Zenbook, but its a lot cheaper laptop so I'm not feeling cheated.  The biggest difference (other than matte vs gloss finishes) is that the K501 has more limited vertical viewing angles, which leads to some fade or excess brightness toward the top / bottom.  Otherwise it is every bit as fast as the Zenbook, and the screen is not bad, just not excellent like the Zenbook.Overall I'm happy with the K501, for the money it is a good deal.  I just hope the screen hinge holds up better than my Zenbook hinge (they look frighteningly similar from the outside).  I'll report back if I have any problems with it in the future.  Bottom line, unless you want to pay the premium for a Zenbook, this is a great laptop for the price.
