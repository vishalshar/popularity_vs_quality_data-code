I have two huskies and a GSD, and I only want the BEST for my babies. I am on a budget, but I want a 5 star food. I went on dogfoodavisor.com and priced every single 5 star dog food, and this one among three others had the best value per pound. We chose Victor because it comes in 40lbs rather than 30lbs.My female husky was losing the softness in her fur and we decided to upgrade to Victor dog food. Literally two weeks later, her fur is back to it's super softness! All three of my dogs love this food!Shipping was super quick, and the food doesn't smell bad! We will DEFINITELY be buying this again next month!
