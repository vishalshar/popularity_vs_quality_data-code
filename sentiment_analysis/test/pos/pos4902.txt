I have been toying with the notion of buying a flir (forward looking infrared) camera, but because of the cost. (They can be several thousand dollars) I had not done it. So when I found this camera, I was sure this must be too good to be useful or true. I was expecting the "Sea Monkeys" of thermal cameras. But unlike Sea Monkeys, the product was very useful. The rainbow thermal effect was fun and looked very interesting, but after using it for a while, I realized the other modes work much better for useful information. There is a mode where you can set a threshold that shows shades of grey for everything below the target temperature, and bright yellow above. I found this mode to be incredibly useful. We had a bat problem, and the bats are pretty small and hard to find, but with this camera in that mode, I could see them right through the plywood they were hiding behind. Saved me a ton of money. You should not be disappointed by this product. well made and useful. ( I have been using it on a Samsung Note 4, in case you are wondering if it will fit your phone).  Thank you for your time.
