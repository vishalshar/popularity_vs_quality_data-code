What I love the most about the Cube is that I can throw it into my briefcase or backpack and have a projector screen wherever I go. If I need to project a presentation at work, I can easily connect the Cube to my computer using the included HDMI cable and it's up and running without any effort. It's also great for hotel rooms when you want to watch Netflix on something larger than your tablet or laptop.RIF6 Cube 2-inch Mobile Projector with 20,000 Hour LED Light and 120-inch Display, Portable, Rechargeable, includes HDMI Cables and Tripod
