An impressive, nicely-sized way to inconspicuously have a Lightning cable wherever you go. I wish they came in more colors, but even so, it's nice the way it blends in with my car keys. I hope the price means it's a much better quality than the cheaper competitors that have popped up. Makes a great stocking-stuffer for iPhone-enabled teens. I can't think of anyone, other than Android and flip-phone users, who wouldn't love to receive this as a gift!
