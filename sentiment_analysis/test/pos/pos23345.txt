The bag is the perfect size and nicely designed. I was looking for a bag that could hold my gym clothes, shoes, toiletries and not be as big as some of the duffle bags out there. The strap is not adjustable, but, is at the perfect length for me. My last gym bag had an adj strap that kept lengthening itself, so, I am glad this one will stay put. The shoe compartments are good - fits my size 42 shoes. The fabric and zippers are of a good quality. The placement and size of pockets gives a good range of options on where to shower shoes, wallet, phone, ipad, papers from work.
