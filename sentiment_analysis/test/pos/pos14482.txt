These lights are incredibly bright, like don't stare at the sun bright (like Bug's Life bug zapper bright), though just remember the brightness is adjustable! After you read the instructions they are easy enough to use/program. They are about the same size as your generic light bulb though a tad heavier. We are currently using our first set as a more functional decorative piece for our kitchen pendant lights. You could put a covering around them, but I personally like the new age look that they bring all on their own (like hipster chic). Overall a great purchase; I love the fact that they are unique looking, smart lights and can put of an immense amount of light. More than likely we will be purchasing more bulbs in the future for other rooms in our home!
