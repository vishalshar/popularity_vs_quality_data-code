This was a blind purchase based on reviews of others. I play Call of Duty on PS4 exclusively and I couldn't be more satisfied. I have has several Turtlebeach headsets including the PX 4 and the Stealth 500, both of which I liked. However, this blows them out of the water. You can hear footsteps exactly where they are which is a great advantage. No plugs to controller make it easy to move around. The equalizer gives you different perspectives to work with.It is very sturdy compared to the Turtlebeach, too.The only thing I wish was for it to have Bluetooth capability. However, then it would cost more. I like the price.!!Edit!! I have returned these ONLY because they are not surround sound. The sound is awesome, but I realized that I couldn't hear if they were above or below which has helps. The LS40's come out in October and I can't wait. I will leave a review then.
