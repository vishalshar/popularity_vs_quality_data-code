**UPDATE**Kids on Christmas break played no less than 20 rounds of this game and didn't want to stop. Next day, they asked if we could play again. My 18yr old, who is ultra competitive, even wanted to play. Why he would like this, is because the player interaction outweighed any frustrations he may have with having to wait on people to make a decision. Raising the review a star because they really, really like it!By the way, out of 20 games, our group of five players (ages 12 to 40-something) only won once as the Investigators.The murderer won ever time. The success of the investigators hinges primarily on the Forensic Scientist (most difficult role to play) in guiding the investigators as best as possible.In a six player game you now add in the roles of accomplice and witness. Our investigators won 60% of the time, thanks to the witness.======================================================OVERVIEW:Reprint of CSI Files, which I never played but have heard good things about.Initial concept is similar to Mafia, Werewolf, ect. where you are using deduction to guess the identify of someoneOne person is the forensic scientist and one is the murder. These are the must-have roles.You may have the optional witness or an accomplice, depending on number of players.Most of the cards are all the different causes of death.The forensic scientist will use tiles to give the other players clues (without talking) by putting markers on the tiles. Everyone gets 30-seconds to talk and then a tile is removed and replaced with another tile. This keeps going on until someone spends a token to guess the murderer and players win or murder wins if the guesses are wrong.COMPONENTS:Excellent quality components on tiles, cards and token markers.THEME:The added Asian symbols makes this feel like I'm an American detective in Hong Kong working with the other detectives trying to solve the crime.The team of detectives (players) are simply "reading" the forensic scientist's report and between that and the conversation it feels like the group is really working together to solve the crime...plus there is the murderer who is a mole in the group.LEARNING CURVE:Super easy to teach anyone. So easy in fact I guess you could treat this as a gateway game, which means it is easy to introduce to non-gamers and they should be able to have fun without getting overwhelmed by a bunch of rules.OTHER NOTES:When it is the forensic scientist's turn, they have to keep a straight face through the whole thing or they give away too much information.When everyone has their heads down and the forensic scientist asks the murder to reveal themselves and point out the causes of death, it really is difficult in these games for folks not to hear or feel the person next to them moving. So people need to be careful and quiet when playing the murderer.OVERALL:This is not exactly my cup-of-tea, but I do like it and have fun. I'm more a 3-4hrs armies battling game kind of guy or tabletop roleplaying game if I was to pick my favorite type of game to play. Maybe I should not ding the review a star, but that's just how I feel about it. . .right now.On the other hand, my kids love...just love playing Mafia or Werewolf at youth group and this is yet another game they are enjoying adding to the mix. It is a good party game, but requires people who won't cheat, which is why the age requirement is a bit higher than maybe expected (plus the theme has to do with murder). Overall, we really like this and it joins the other 200 games we have on our shelf.Two-thumbs-up!!
