I bought this for my husband's 60th birthday.  The drone has been a huge success, he flies it nearly everyday and took it on a large group camping trip, everyone was amazed by the overhead views and simply the fun of flying it.  Most of his friends want one. The "HOME" option is very useful and clever.  We will also use it in our construction business for overhead progress photos. We bought a second battery very soon after the drone arrived.  I suggest everyone ordering purchase a second battery.  I am one very happy customer with a very happy 60 year old husband and his new toy!
