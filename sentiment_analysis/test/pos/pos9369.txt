I didn't expect miracle results..I am giving five stars because it is very soothing..I stopped all the prescription creams and was getting tired of hearing, 'we need to get more aggressive with this problem'..no, we don't..this problem is on my body and it hurts..we need to play nice and this cream is the first soothing preparation I've found.. I've only been using it a week, and the fact that it relieves so much discomfort and itching is good enough for now..gentle, clean smelling (no fragrance), super moisturizer..I'm ordering more
