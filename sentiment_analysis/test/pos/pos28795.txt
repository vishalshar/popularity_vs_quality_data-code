Was about to give 1 star and return but with A little trial and error, and you'll be having some amazing cold brew. Just give it time. I bought for travel purposes and works perfect.Tips:Find a grind that works for you. I had a shop grind 3 different levels, ended up just a bit finer than a filter grind for strength but choose to your liking. I believe around a 4/10 on the grinder (1being fine/10 being course)You HAVE to tamp down the grounds or you will end up with weak cold brew. I also highly suggest a filter to even the flow of water over the grounds. You may need to unscrew the bottom portion slightly to allow for air flow so the drips can flow. Too tight and it may stop partial way through the brewing process.Made some amazing cold brew for the morning and works very fast. Great for travel and makes great coffee.
