We just got this game and my 3 year old daughter loves it! If your child can do basic math (counting up to 4) they really can play this game! We play with all of our hands showing because it is easier for her to understand and for us to help her. Just get the game. Most fun we have had as a family in a long time! The family that games together stays together.
