My son and his family moved to Colorado a few years ago.  They live about 40 miles west of Denver.  On occasion, there are mountain lion alerts given for his area.  They are raising my wonderful grand daughter and have 3 dogs.  When the alerts go out about a mountain lion sighting, they become very concerned.  The alerts give people time to bring their pets inside and to take care about safety of their household during the night hours.  My son tells me this unit does exactly as stated.  My daughter-in-law has the an iphone, so I chose that model.  He says the heat signatures show up very well.The only negative he found is how the unit eats up the phone's battery power.  Because the unit is powered by the phone's battery, I can understand that.  But, you do not have to mess with other batteries.  This method used to power the unit does save money and time by not having to purchase or constantly recharge another set of batteries.  Also, if you research other thermal type detectors, you can see where they could cost thousands of dollars.  Even though this unit eats up the battery power from the phone pretty quick, you would be hard pressed to complain about it versus paying the money for those other types of cameras.
