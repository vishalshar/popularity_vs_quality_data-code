I had to change (upgrade) my phone from the Samsung s3 mini to a samsung S5 in order to get the camera to work.  Storage case is robust. Imaging is pretty good, considering the low cost.  I am able to demonstrate heat loss and cold air infiltration. It also helped identify a wet ceiling area due to a roof leak.
