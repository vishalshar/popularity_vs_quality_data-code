A superb piece of equipment that does everything it should. Would have received five stars if it had incorporated some form of slim plastic clip on the end away from the connector. I us mine a lot and tend to leave it connected to the computer for convenience and versatility. However, because of the lack of end-support it would be possible to strain or break the connector ... a potential problem easily solved with a slim, u-shaped plastic clip. Nevertheless, it's a great and highly recommendable accessory.
