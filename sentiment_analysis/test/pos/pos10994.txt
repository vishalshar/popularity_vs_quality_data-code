I wasn't able to shower for a week while I was at Burning Man and these were a God-Send.I brought baby-wipes, but those are small and flimsy, these towlettes are more like a hand-towel (about the same size). I was able to use them to do heavy duty cleaning after using the baby wipes to get rid of surface layer.It's too bad that they didn't come larger.
