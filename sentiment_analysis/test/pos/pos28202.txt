Before buying this, I researched a lot of other options, with the exception of HP. Some people have written that this is like a MacPro, which I don't agree with at all. Size and weight are similar, but you simply can't compare the build quality of the two. I'm not a big Mac fan, but there's a reason you pay a lot more for a Mac. Having said that, this pc is better value for your money.The good/expected:- Little or no bloatware- Form factor, size, and looks (it's comparable to MacPro)- Battery life is expected- Performance is good and the SSD rocks- Mouse pad has the standard multi finger functionalityThe not so good:- The mouse pad seems cheap (you can tap it i.e. not required to press the buttons all the way down)- The back lit keyboard is sub par, with the letters not really lighting up as much as you would expect- The screen is by far the worst feature of the pc, but I didn't expect anything else for this priceAll in all, this pc has a lot of value for what you pay. I'm picky on performance because I develop software and hate waiting time. The dual core is sufficient to get the job done in style (combined with the solid state and fast memory). I only play one game and that's world of tanks which works very well with 80-90 fps on high settings. If you are a hard core gamer and need a fancy screen, this is not for you. If you're not too concerned with the screen you want value for you money and a fast practical laptop, this should definitely be considered.
