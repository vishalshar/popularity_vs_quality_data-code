Emily and Maria from PICCPerfect are absolutely among some of the most amazing women I've met. Not only are they business savvy, they're wonderful people as well. They're kind, patient, understanding, and have a wonderful way of relating to customers. Whenever you have a concern they address it in the quickest, most professional, and pain free manner. I've had TERRIBLE luck involving PICC sleeves and other companies, and am so grateful to FINALLY have purchased at PICCPerfect product. I recommend it 100% across the board. It's comfortable, breathe able, and also great for those of us who have incredibly sensitive skin that get hives easily. PICCPerfect's Maria and Emily are just fabulous, I absolutely would recommend their product to everyone who needs a PICC sleeve.
