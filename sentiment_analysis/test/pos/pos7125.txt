This changing pad was a lifesaver! It's the easiest way to track weight and diapers.  I also use it to track how many ounces my baby is nursing, which is beyond helpful in those early and important growing days. It's also helpful to have stats about her sleeping, how much she's eating each day, etc for sharing at our pediatrician appointments. The changing pad is easy to use, the app is amazing, and the customer service was fantastic when I had questions. I highly recommend this changing pad for making your life easier with a newborn!
