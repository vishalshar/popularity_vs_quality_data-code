Outstanding product...I bought this shampoo and the conditioner...I usually only take the time to write a review if the product is very very good, or very very bad. This product is very good..my scalp was feeling very sensitive and dry..it hurt me to brush my hair even, plus I had some dandruff flakes..After just one use I noticed a difference in the flakes and dryness...today was my third time using this product and my hair is so shiny, my scalp doesn't itch and I didn't notice not one dandruff flake. And my hair is so soft, I've tried many hair products for dry scalp and dandruff, and so far this has been the only one worked for me..I love the ingredients, the smell is wonderful, it lathers nicely and the conditioner leaves my hair very easy to comb through and soft and shiny...so glad I found this product...it's deserving of more than five stars in my opinion.
