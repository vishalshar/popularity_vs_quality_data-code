Really easy to install and comes with a tempered glass screen protector preinstalled. The warranty is good and they are very nice and helpful.Make sure you clean the contacts for the ribbon cables really well with alcohol before reassembling. If your digitizer doesn't work reliably, you didn't clean them well enough. Follow the instructions very closely and don't lose any screws.The iPhone 6 seems to have the easiest screen to replace of all of the iPhone's I've worked on
