This product has met my expectations so far I bought it for my young daughter I was looking for a vitamin that didn't contain a million different preservatives this one also contains DHA which I was looking for my daughter loves them they taste good I've taken them myself don't upset my stomach or my daughter's stomach I just purchased another bottle overall I'm satisfied with the product and will continue to buy the only downside I can think of is they may be a little bit more expensive than other vitamins but you get better quality
