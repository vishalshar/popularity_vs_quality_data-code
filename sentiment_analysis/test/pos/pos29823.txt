I find this helpful to have for storing less frequently used brushes and for travel.  But for everyday use brushes, it is too troublesome to use and not necessary.  I cut one in half to see if I can get two uses out of one sleeve.  The mesh did unravel a bit, but I used a low flame on the stove to slightly melt the edges (do with caution).  It held together sufficiently for storage purposes.I would recommend the larger sleeves to encase the powder, foundation, and maybe blush brush bristles, but it seems unnecessary to use the smaller ones because those sleeves are so tiny (narrow).  Personally, I wouldn't use the guards for drying brushes since I believe it is better for them to air dry laying on their sides without compressing the bristles.  I would first blot off excess water with clean paper towels and then lay the brushes on clean paper towels.
