This product is amazing!  Our 4 month old puppy ended up with Demodectic mange.  We tried several different topical meds our vet prescribed.  After research I found that this form of mange is all to do with his immune system.  I purchased Organic Pet Superfood and within 2 weeks my pups hair was growing back and is no longer itchy.  It is well worth the price.  I am saving a fortune not going back and forth to the vet for treatments that did not work.
