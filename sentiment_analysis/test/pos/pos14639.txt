This little fitness tracker is ingenious.  First of all, it is virtually indestructible, and I love that there is no display on the wristband itself (less distraction for kiddos).  The game-ification of play and activity is a big motivator, and my family is having fun competing and updating our avatars.  I also really like that this is about play and fun - not weight, weight loss, or "getting fit."  Movement is great for kids - but shaming them about their bodies is not.  Bravo Sqord!
