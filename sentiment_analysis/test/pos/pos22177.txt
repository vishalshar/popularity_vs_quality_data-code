I've been using the spire consistently for about 3 months. I think it is a great way to measure the amount of calm breathing one does throughout the day and have recommended it to several patients with anxiety problems.I've been measuring my heart rave variability daily for six months. After using the spire for a few months to see a baseline, I decided to do an experiment. I increased my minutes spent in calm breathing per day from the previous levels of anywhere between 8 and 60 min up to 120 minutes a day. Within a few days I saw my HRV rise from the 80s to the high 90s and my parasympathetic tone (HF) rise from the 2000s to the 8000s. I was blow away. Previously it would take several days for my HRV to recover after a hard workout, with the spire motivating me to get 2hrs of calm breathing worked into my life (ie during e-mails) I am recovering in half the time.
