I must admit that I thought I would have problems setting up this bulb, but honestly I did not. The fact that you don't need a hub to operate these lights makes it easy for anyone to set up a smart Home. Each bulb has wifi built in so each light can be controlled from the free app. This particular bulb provides light for security cameras utilizing IR . In other words, my outdoor security camera can "see" outdoors in total darkness. It is not a lot of light but enough to view the exterior of my home. This feature does not work with all night vision cameras, so contact Lifx first to determine if this bulb will perform the way you expect it to.You also have the ability to change colors and how bright the light is, as well as turning itself on and off at specific times automatically.The only slight negative is getting used to the app. For instance, when you program the light to turn OFF it reads START TIME. ToMy mind, that meant when it would turn on, but. O, it means when the event occurs. Little confusing until you get used to it. This bulb works great and involves no ancillary equipment, just the app!
