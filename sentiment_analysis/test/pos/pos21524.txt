Very comfortable and very clever. Fits a decent-sized item, washes well, and thus far has been very useful. Definitely gonna more in different colors. For any trans* masculine people, really good for a small to medium packer (you don't have to worry about anything falling or having to constantly readjust, no matter if you're just around the house or if you're working out), but won't work for STP.
