Thrive thrives on my stubbly skin.  It's amazing product, and I have never used anything like it in my 30 year history of shaving.  Unlike other products, Thrive's Shave Oil allows for a super close shave and leaves the skin feeling as smooth as a baby's.  Really.  It's that good.  I'm hooked and will never again waste my time and money on any other product.  Keep it coming, Thrive.
