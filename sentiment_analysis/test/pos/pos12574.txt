The Tl;dr (short) version:I am keeping mine.Incredible engineering feat and build quality!Amazing fit. It goes into the ear-canal.A good in-ear seal is paramount for good sound/ volume and accurate Vitals data!!! Learn to fit them properly.Simultaneous LE BT and A2DP/ HFP connections but no multi-point.Reconnects to the last device used if within range but does not resume playback automatically.Playback from the on-board audio files not possible while connected via A2DP/ HFP.Tested and used with 3 cell phones and 2 laptops, indoors and outdoors = no issues while basking in radio interferences on the same 2.4GHz spectrum and with my Dash reproduced music from my phones and allowed me clear calls. YMMV.Buy from Amazon for easy refunds/ exchanges.I love mine and would buy them again knowing what I know now.I have started recommending them to friends and clients.Want BT Multipoint and better drivers/ sound quality.Read on for more details. Why do I love them?Background with relevant devices: Frequent flyer, 16h/ day on screens with Jawbone ERA, Motorola Hint (2d gen), Parrot Zik 3.0.I love my Zik 3.0 for their incredible sound. The best I found. And I will be using the Dash now when I dont need the headphones immersion (too big etc.) and selling the ERA and Hint.Their amazing fit, small size ,the special experience this product is right from the unboxing, the attention to details, great taste/ choices in design, build quality and software touches.I love that these earphones exist and I have been enjoying them immensely since I got them.I can put them on and an hour later I will have forgotten I am wearing them.I can node my head to pick-up an incoming call (ringtone gets pass on in ear so personalized rings lets you know whos calling without looking at the phone) and the music will pause and resume.While in your hand, shake them to check on the charge level.When done, place them in the case and they charge up while stored safely.If I want to bypass the cell phone, I can play music right from the built-in storage. I dont need to listen to the annoying PA in flight while my phone is in Airplane mode.I can use Transparency mode so I dont have to take them off to ear out and lose a great fit/ positioning I found.Finally the huge potential for software improvements and features that can be added using the built-in sensors, the cellphone GPS (think geofencing) and opening them up to 3rd party developers.Happy to support the company and look forward to seeing what they do with these. The experience:I received mine this week on Sep 14 and I was blown away by the design, small size, quality of the materials and finish.These are manufactured by vtch (a Hong Kong, publicly traded company) for Bragi (a German tech start-up).I read the bad reviews before buying.I found most to be short on details and written by people who do not care about details (many sounded technologically-challenged based on the wording and what they wrote). So I took a chance anyway.The negative reviews are about half the ratings on these (posted mostly by Amazon accounts with non-verified purchases).They look at them and dismiss the Incredible engineering feat. that these are.To me it is not easy to imagine, finance, manufacture and bring to the market anything, let alone something with the fit, finish and quality of this product.Whats the deal with the Bluetooth connectivity mentioned by everyone?It is worth also noting that Bluetooth (itself, as a technology) has its inherent limitations which will produce interruptions in audio streaming in some cases. These use Bluetooth 4.0. Bluetooth 5.0 was just announced and we may see the first crop of devices with 5.0 at CES in Jan 2017.So, Indoors, I can go upstairs right above where I left the cellphone and the signal will be good enough. In a room, its good for 20ft or more.With no walls or obstacles to bounce off the signal outdoors, the range is not as good as indoors for some with any BT earphones.In these, because they are so small everyone is smaller, including the BT antennas.Personally I haven't had any issues with the way I use them. I haven't used for sports.Interferences from WiFi, cordless phones, microwaves and water mass greatly degrades the signal. For instance the human body is mostly water.Low Energy Bluetooth is even worse.In those cases, some may want to copy their music using the 3.5GB on-board storage space avail instead of streaming from their phone.Ditto when swimming with these (they are waterproof) which I did not try.My advice is to buy from Amazon for an easy return/ refund (30 days) or exchange if you have issues.This way you can bypass Bragi which is a small tech start-up with limited "customer service" resources thoughI contacted them to test and report all the bad reviews about their product and received a reply overnight.Note: many of the bad reviews are also people whom stumble over the pairing and creating a proper fit and seal in the ear.See how to pair them below.The above was written based on the reactions I got and what I learned after posting this review for the first time right after getting them. Now, what did I wish someone wrote before I bought them?1 - These are Bluetooth Left Right non-teetered earphones (not headphones).So you'll be getting two small earphones that go into the ear canal.Blown away by the unboxing and quality of the earphones once you get to hold them.2 - Unbox and charge them before you do anything.Again: charge them before you do anything.If the battery level is low and they deplete while you are trying to pair/ use them or update the firmware, you will have a bad time with these.So charge them first.3 - Next plug them into a computer (Windows or Mac OS)Make sure they are resting properly on the contact pins to avoid errors when plugged via USB to a computer.****Also use the right cable or the one in the box:  some cheap 3rd party cables only support charging and NOT data transfer.You will have a bad time with these running into USB connectivity issues otherwise.The DASH will mount and appear like an external drive on your desktop in Mac OS and under My PC in Windows.Double-click the file named update inside the DASH drive.This takes you to Bragi's web site.There you can download software to help you handle the update or simply download the update file itself and copy it the root folder on the DASH drive (eject and unplug the DASH drive to start the update in this case).**** The updates took over one hour in my case: leave it alone and check on it later. The light on each will stop blinking and start fading in/ out instead. The update is then done. The update will be confirmed in spoken words once you put them on.4 - Light touches to toggle the Transparency mode and up- down the volume work.However tapping the earphones for pairing and functions requires a confident finger tap. The earphone won't otherwise pick up on the tap.5 - Pairing:Do the LEFT one first.Tap and maintain contact for 5 seconds on the LEFT side to pair the Low Energy profile with a supporting device/ app.Install and launch the Bragi app. Connect. Tap Settings and rename the left earphone (both are called "The Dash" and you can't tell them apart by looking at your Bluetooth settings screens on your phone or other devices, I called mine The Dash Health)Then do the right one.Tap and maintain contact for 5 seconds on the RIGHT side to pair the Audio (A2DP) profile with another BT device.It default to the built-storage otherwise. You'll be playing content from your phone and nothing will stream. SO once paired, tap and hold to launch the external player which is your phone.It is possible to have both earphones connected to a device at the same time but not to have them connected to several cell phone at the same time.It is also possible to use the RIGHT earphone alone in Standalone mode.Make sure to turn off the Bluetooth radio on previously paired devices before trying to pair them with a new device.I have tested the Dash on two iPhone 6 running iOS 10.0.1 and one iPhone 4S. Also used them with a rMBP and a Windows laptop with no issues at all.6 - A proper and good in-ear seal: it is crucial you try the different sleeves.A tight fit is paramount for the best noise suppression, good sound reproduction, in particular for the low frequencies and volume.I started with XS. Use the provided sleeves if you have bigger ears than me. Try them all and pick.7 - the steel (metal) case they come with is both a way to cary them safely and to charge them on the go when not in use.I cant comment on battery life just yet but I havent ran into a low battery warning or limitation with my usage pattern so far.8 - inside the box are a USB to microUSB cable, several sleeves to try on to find the best fit (they comes with the XS size on them), a lot of Bragi stickers and a small regulatory boiler plate pamphlet. When done, the packaging can find its place in your library for a clean look/ storage.9 - Sound quality: 6.5/ 10. This could be improved by adding an EQ in the Bragi app.I would expect that the sound quality will get better over time. I hope it does.Burn In: I  have been subjecting mine to a few hours of playback at max volume per day.10 - I found the volume: max volume is adequate and with a tight seal, there should be no need for more if you have no earring loss.That's where I will prob. use mine most often.The volume can be adjusted in the Bragi app when connected or by sliding your finger on the RIGHT earphone.11 - Smart movements or Macros as they are called in the App:The Dash has sensors which will detect head movements and that can be used to pick up/ reject a call etc.This is very promising and the included Macros are evidently just the beginning. Future updates will prob. add to them.12 - Health data and support for Apple Health kit:A proper fit is essential or the data wont be accurate.Again, like the sound, volume, for the sensors to do their job properly, the earphones must be fitted snug and properly.The Dash then becomes an additional source in the Health app in iOS.I don't really intend to use them for this. I can see my heart beat update in real time in the Activity in the Bragi app and found that it refreshes in real time like the one on the Apple Watch does once you have initiated and completed a measurement, but apparently at a slightly longer interval. They are within 2-3 bpm from each other. Not sure which is correct.It is also possible to start activities tracking (running, swimming, cycling) using taps on the LEFT earphone.13 - The small details:How I wish Bragi would use a similar voice to the Bombshell in my Jawbone ERA!!! Owners will know. :)I really love that voice prompts and spoken confirmations don't suppress the audio source playing the background. Excellent level-mixing Bragi. Attention to detail at its best. Bravo!The cover for the case slides over and has a horizontal cut through/ vent (to peek at blinking lights). Suggestions for Bragi:Multipoint connectivity for A2DP and HFP please.EQ in the app please. Study what Parrot have done with their Zik 2 and 3 and the custom EQ in their app. Incredible sound in those with tight and punchy bass. Yes, I the Dash doesnt have the same drivers but manual control should help maximize the hardware in use currently.And bravo! Thank you for making these. I love my earphones. Amazing engineering and taste in design.
