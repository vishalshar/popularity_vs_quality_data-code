Two weeks ago, my wife gave me the PowerUp 3.0 for birthday.  It worked great up until yesterday... it was paired with my phone while I was holding the plane in my hand ready to launch it, when all of a sudden the motor started to throttle up all on its own (all the while, the app throttle display was at zero).  I proceeded to shut off my iPhone bluetooth connection, but the motor continued to turn at full speed.  I then turned the device switch to the 'offÂ’ position, and this shut off the motor.  But then when turning the device switch back on, the motor immediately began turning at full speed, and then it did this every time when I would toggle the switch from 'off' to 'on'.  Upon inspection of the unit I noticed that there was a small blackened area in the transparent nose casing (looked like a burned-out transistor), and it smelled of burnt electronics.I contacted PowerUp Toys right away about this issue, and very shortly afterward received a reply from them that they were sorry that this happened and that they would send me a replacement.  Great customer service, in my opinion!I also just want to say that this device is really quite amazing... these last couple of weeks I experimented with several different paper airplane designs and it works great on a lot of them.  A lot of fun to use this with the kids... they are learning so much about aerodynamics as we look at what could make the plane fly better, stall less, fly faster, etc.  I'm sure that it was just a glitch with my particular device (...problems can potentially occur with any electronic devices).  And it's great to see that the company values customers and stands behind its products!
