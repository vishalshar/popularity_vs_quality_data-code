Nice packaging and smart design. This would be a great item to give as a gift for someone that loves to cook with fresh ingredients, but doesn't have a green thumb.Excellent instructions, very easy to assemble, although there really isn't much assembly even required. Well constructed plastic parts. Everything fits together well. The plant cups click into place firmly, but are easy enough to remove if needed. Setting it up is fun and the product's design is something you might like to display. It reminds me of a nice piece of IKEA furniture.LED lights (2 of them) run on an 18 hour cycle. Follow the recommendation and plug it in as you wake up to reset the timer. It is fairly bright, so finding a place to keep it where it won't bother you might be tough in a small home or apartment. If there is one thing I'd like to see changed, it would be for there to be more of a hood on the lights so that light doesn't get cast across the room.I don't know why, but I had expected that it would have pumps or other moving parts that might buzz or make noise, but it does not. It is completely silent, and the LED lights give off very little heat -- warm to the touch, but not hot.We have it up on top of our fridge. The float water level indicator makes it easy to check even with out being able to see it. I can just tap it and see if it is still floating, or if it is sitting on the bottom and more water is needed.The basil that shipped with it sprang to life quickly -- all we had to do was add water and plug it in.I look forward to ordering some other herbs and getting a full herb garden going in my kitchen!
