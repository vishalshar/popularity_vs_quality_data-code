Of all the products I have purchased from Amazon, this one was the most difficult.  No matter which iPhone 6 bike mount you look at you will find a lot of people who absolutely love the product and then you will find a handful (many of them recent purchasers) who say the product is cheap, breaks easily, doesn't hold the phone, etc.  After reading over 100 reviews of various mounts I chose this one.  Before I go forward I need to give you some caveats. I ride a road bike on paved bike paths so I do not deal with many bumps, etc.  But I have one of those "extenders" that allows me to lean forward so the actual space for installing the mount on the handlebars is limited. (See attached photo) In addition, I have a headlamp and a bike computer so my handlebars area is a bit crowded.  As you can see, I installed the mount on the extender.I first noticed that with the case on my phone the mount did not appear to hold it very securely. I took the phone out of the case and it held it a bit better but not substantially better than it did with the case so I put it back into the mount in the case.  I then found that by pushing a bit harder than expected against the side brackets I could get them to lock one notch tighter that felt a bit better. But I, probably like you, do not want my phone falling out of the mount under ANY condition and I quickly figured out that adding a plastic cable tie that is snug but not tight will keep the phone in the mount but will also allow me to install and remove the phone without using a new cable tie every time.  At this stage I feel comfortable that the mount will serve just fine.As a note to the manufacturer (should they read this)--you need to put some tabs at a 90 degree angle to the top and side brackets to better hold the phone in place.  Although the rubber padding on the sides of the brackets offers some friction and security, molding the brackets so they have a "lip" on them of about 1/4" will greatly add to the security of the mount and will help tremendously at keeping the phone in the mount. An alternative (although I am not sure it is as good) would be to add a thin (1/8") flexible / stretch cord that could be wrapped across the face of the phone and secured to each side.  I have some of that type of cord and I am going to play with it to see if I can come up with an improvement over the plastic cable tie.  But overall I think this is a good product (4 stars) but not a perfect product.
