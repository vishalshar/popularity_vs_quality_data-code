My pets go nuts for the freeze-dried chicken, turkey and salmon. I buy it in large quantities. It can be offered as dry treats or reconstituted with water.  While expensive, the cost is usually justified due to quality of meat and expense of freeze-drying.  Sometimes you can get it slightly discounted; it seems to be when they're changing the cutting templates and want to clear out previous inventory. Overall quality remains high. Word of caution, as one who's bought from several (ok, MANY) lots.  The cut size of the chicken breast varies. In some batches you'll get larger pieces and more powder at the bottom, in others you'll get a great deal of smaller pieces but more conformity.  Ultimately it doesn't affect quality or palatability; my cats and dogs love it.
