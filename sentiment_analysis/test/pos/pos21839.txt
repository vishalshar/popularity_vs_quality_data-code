For the most part, the Hickies appear to be working.  My husband is one of those people who can never seems to keep is shoe laces tied.  purchased the Hickies to possibly prevent an accident. The only negative that I have observed  if all the fasteners are in place he can't get his shoe on, so he leaves the top one out.  The second then pops out of the eye. I probably won't buy them again but for the most part they work.
