This is a truly exceptional, high-end bluetooth speaker.This unit has the characteristics of real great speaker for demanding bluetooth fanatics.  Since many years back, I have bought, tried and returned so many bluetooth speakers with so many disappointments, however, I believe that this RIVA TURBO X is the real thing.  Of course, it comes in hefty price at $300.00, but if you have the money and if you have the desire to get the best of best, this one will do for you.The frequency response is FLAT all the way from the deep bass to clear mid & defined treble and it is so refreshing to listen to a great bluetooth speaker that can really reproduce a clean and honest sound.  Nowadays there are so many bluetooth speakers on the market, but some has the huge bass, some with great mid and some with refined treble, but it is so difficult to find a bluetooth speaker that can completely balance out all the sounds and be able to play all different types of musics.It looks great and solid.  And all the features and functions work just about perfect along with great battery life.So, basically, if you have the money to spend, this one is the best choice that you can make.
