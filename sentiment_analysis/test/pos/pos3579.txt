This oven ROCKS!!!  It helps you make the BEST pizza.  You will be hesitant to get pizza out when you can make it at home so much better and cheaper.  I can easily get oven temperatures of over 600 celsius needed for my New York style crust recipe.Afterthought hint.  To get the temps needed you do have to remove and splatter shields or other obstructions between the burner and the oven.  You want there to be open flames under the oven otherwise you can not get enough heat to it.
