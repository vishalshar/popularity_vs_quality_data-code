The bike is slightly heavier than I expected, and the lack of cross-bar makes it slightly more difficult to hang by the front wheel on the wall. That said, overall it's a great bike, and they even include a little bottle of extra paint. If you attach a rear rack, there isn't a great place to put a rear light, but they do include a reflector with it. I appreciate the summer sale they just had, making the bike price a little easier to afford :) Slightly nervous about the white wheels (if I ever need to replace them) but thankfully there's a cyclery nearby that sells Public Bikes, so I anticipate them having spares. To anyone who lives in NYC, 318 Cyclery was conveniently located in Brooklyn off the Union R stop, and they assemble the bike for you and are really nice about everything! Highly recommend speaking with them before purchasing on Amazon.Gears work great, and overall the bike has held up against the Manhattan Bridge. Have received many compliments so far!
