These really do extend the life of produce. I have been using them in the crisper drawers of my fridge and in the produce baskets in my pantry. They truly do keep fruits and vegetables fresh longer. They will need to be replaced after a few weeks but  Produce Saver Sheets work !I wish they weren't so expensive.
