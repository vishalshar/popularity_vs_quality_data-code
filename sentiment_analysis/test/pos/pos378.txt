This was so easy to set up I couldn't believe it. Out of the box, I plugged it in and sat on my couch to get it set up. Within minutes it was working with the android app. I unplugged it and moved it to the ceiling of my garage where the garage door opener is plugged in and it connected with my wireless network effortlessly and within seconds. It has worked every time (when I have it on based on my settings on the android app) I needed it to work and also tells me when my network goes down, or when it gets unplugged. (like when my future x wife found it and threw it in the garbage). I love it in the garage, because I know whenever someone comes into the garage, or when I am at work, I know when the kids get home from school. I am now going to purchase the video recorder as well!
