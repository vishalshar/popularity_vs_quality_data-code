So far - Works as promised!I had been getting concerned about the hacking potential with all of our connected cameras, switches (Wemo), lights (Hue), doors, server, and more.  This seemed to be a good solution but was initially concerned it would stop items from working (like being able to access our cameras from outside the home network).  Works great.  Set-up was easy.  Set-up in bridge mode - sitting between the DSL modem and the gigabit (unmanaged) switch.  Everything goes through CUJO and with almost 50 devices connect have not noticed a slow down in network performance.After set-up our WEMO switches were unable to connect.  Sent a ticket into Customer Service and received a Firmware in the middle of the night that fixed the issue.  Now everything is working.  I'll provide updates with more use as time goes on.UPDATE: This works and works well! CUJO reported an increase in attempts from the outside to gain access to our cameras - I even attempted gain access from the outside several times, and CUJO stopped each attempt.  I now have updated modem settings and port forwarding to increase security - but wouldn't have known if it weren't for CUJO.
