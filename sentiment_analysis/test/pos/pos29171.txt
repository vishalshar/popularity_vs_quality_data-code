I work in a fairly loud office and I'd rather not talk to people and just do my work, if I can help it. To that end, I have several different types of headphones and earbuds. I've spent a lot of money on earbuds that just haven't worked out. My ears are too small. The only earbuds that I can comfortable wear for hours on end are Bose earbuds with the wing tips and I'm not ecstatic about their sound profile. Over the years I've experimented. I've dabbled with bluetooth headphones with mediocre results previously, but I saw the BTunes adapter and decided to give it a shot on a funner pair of over the-ear-headphones. At this point and time, I've used the adapter almost every day at work for the last 6 months.My sound setup at work is now amazing. I'm unencumbered by wires. I can run to the printer and music cuts off around 20ish feet or so. But consider, My phone is blocked by several cubicle walls and is kept on a desk dock nested beside my desktop PC, so there isn't a direct line of sight from the adapter to my phone. How do I have my audio situation set up at work?My phone isn't anything impressive. I have a 2014 Moto X. I stream all my music via Google Play Music and I use Viper4Android as my sound equalizer. I keep a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50Xs at work. They have a 2.5mm cable jack, so this BTunes model works great. I've replaced the Audio Technica ear pads with a pair of Brainwav Memory Foam Ear Pads (all products found easily on Amazon, by the way, except probably the phone and the EQ, which is free.)  This set up is magic to me. If I were at home, I may choose a different pair of headphones, but to get through the work day? The fun nature of the M50xs and its V shaped sound curve is great. Also, many have criticized the M50xs for being too loud. It's a positive, in this case. On that note, there's no sound leakage either, even on max volume.That's a specific note I want to make, and there are two reasons why I'm not giving the BTunes adapter a full five stars.I can never get it to pair correctly using NFC pairing. Never. I don't know why. It just doesn't work. It's not a huge deal, but I spent 15 minutes screwing around setting it up as a trusted device with my phone initially, looking like an idiot, rubbing the adapter against my phone trying to trigger the NFC tag.  Secondly, if not for the inherently loud nature of the M50xs, I may be concerned that the adapter might not be able to push enough power to the headphones for an adequate volume. I think this will vary depending on headphones and driver size. Or perhaps this is just inherent to the nature of bluetooth audio being somewhat lacking in comparison to a wire. That being said, I'm satisfied with my setup and my purchase. There are cheapo BT adapters out there that require varying levels of DIYing to work with your favorite set of headphones, but as far as I know, none of the cheapo BT adapters have the AptX codecs. Speaking of, you should make sure whatever device you're pairing the BTunes with is AptX compatible as well (like my 2014 Moto X.) It means less compression of music and better sound quality, which matters to me, and is worth the extra money.Your mileage may vary.Honestly, I don't even want to dock it a full star. I'd rather rate this as 4.5/5 stars. I was really hesitant to buy this $100 adapter going into this, but it's really exceeded my expectations....a day in the life!"...""...""..."*tap tap tap**looks at exasperated co-worker and motions to headphones while shaking head**co-worker quickly motions back and forth between the two of us while moving their lips**Realizing conversation,and by extension, office politics/drama are now unavoidable, pause the music by making use of the handy dandy button on the BTunes adapter and gather myself and my resolve to go forth, once more into the breach.*
