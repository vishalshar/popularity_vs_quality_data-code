what's better than kitten videos on youtube?nothing of course.but i do like the mevo quite a lot. i'm a fashion photographer and i was curious about this camera because many clients like the idea of having behind the scenes video coverage of their shoots, but most of the times there's no budget to hire a videographer. so i saw an ad for the mevo and figured i'll give it a try, worst case scenario i can just return it plus its affordable enough. but i have to say it's actually a really neat machine!! i like the way its built, very straight forward and it makes a sturdy impression, feels like a high quality product. also i really like how the parts snap together with magnets. connecting it to the iphone is straight forward, automatic firmware update happened, no glitches. the app is neat and simple, seems like there are tons of hidden features that I didnt even explore yet.to try it out, i put it into the makeup room during a photo shoot and let it to do its automated thing, follow faces and zoom in and out, switch between persons, then i carried it on our set whilst taking photographs and so on. the footage was edited by the camera - so at the end of the day it just needs to be shortened. pretty dope.the battery only lasts for about an hour, so ill make sure to plug the camera into a wall. obviously this camera doesn't replace a videographer, but it's fun to see this thing follow faces around and crop in and out on its own. obviously the footage coming out of the mevo is much more interesting than if i put a static gopro into a corner. the pans work really smoothly.but to be fair, i love the gopro because i love extreme sports, and this camera isn't an extreme sports camera, so dont buy it for that purpose. also once it gets dark, you need to put lights up. obviously it would be fantastic if the camera did 1080p instead of 720p, but the quality is stunning. i think that the biggest difference between this camera and pretty much any other small HD camera thats out there, is the software and the brain behind it, I didnt expect to be so surprised by the software, its obviously been engineered by geeks with hands-on video experience. thanks guys.next step for me is to try to live stream to the internet (from the models changing room haha - NO!) because that's what the camera is supposed to do.. i'll let you know how that goes!conclusion: im used to working with cameras that cost a fortune, and i didnt get the mevo to see how it compares to those. it is for me a really fun addition to my kit, the camera takes hours and hours of editing work out of my hands and the app and software is really powerful (thank you mevo team - really clever!). 4 out of 5 stars because I wish the camera was waterproof.
