I have a Nexus 6 with a thick case, so for those of you with the Nexus 6 of iPhone 6+, you don't have to worry about it. I bought this mount because my phone's buttons are near the side-center, and the holding arms looked thin enough that they wouldn't interfere (they are). I usually place the phone just off-center so the arms support the phone underneath the buttons.The mount pivot ball can be tightened and loosened. I tightened it to allow me to easily rotate the phone 90 degrees and yet not allow the phone to rotate or change position when I hit a bump in the road. Even with the Nexus 6 being heavy and supported off-center, I can rotate it 90 degrees and it will still not rotate or change position on its own.I have not seen any compromises with the quality and the price is excellent for what you get.
