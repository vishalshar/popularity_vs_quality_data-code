I got this as a gift for my 10 year old.  The items are all simple - you don't need a "kit."  As a gift though - it is perfect.  It comes really well packaged and is just cute.  Instead of directions there is a paper directing you to their You Tube videos which are easy to follow.  What you get is the jars, perlite, rocks, oraganic soil, seeds and super cute labels.  These items are easy to obtain on your own obviously but it makes a fabulous gift.  My daughter loved it and it took us about 15-20 minutes to get it all set up.  They look really cute in the window.
