I'm not sure why there are so many mixed reviews on this. I am absolutely happy with it! The video quality is great, the laser is awesome and easy to use, when I talk to my cats through it they come to the Petcube to see me. I can connect anywhere to check in on them which is absolutely amazing! Setting this up was insanely easy. The steps were clear and easy to follow, and I didn't run into any issues or errors. I HIGHLY recommend this product. I've been raving about it to all my friends with pets!! Not to mention, you can download the app and check out the product before you even buy it so you can see the quality of the camera, use the laser pointer, and connect with other pets. Love it!! Very happy I finally bought this.
