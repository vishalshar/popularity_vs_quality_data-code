What a great way to get your coffee to go! These are yummy, they taste exactly like coffee. I am not actually a big coffee drinker as I could take or leave the taste and don't want to stain my teeth. Plus it is fairly inconvenient for me to stop and get. It's so easy to throw these in your purse or pocket for a little burst of energy when you need it. It actually satisfies my sweet tooth also which is an added bonus. I would highly recommend these.
