Super fun game. This is our go to party game. Very easy to pick up. We always like to compare board games. This game reminds me of a mixture between Mysterium  Ultimate Werewolf.I This is a good game for groups 4+. Ideally I think it's most enjoyable with 6+ because you get to play with the accomplice and witness. It's like Mysterium is the sense that one person is giving clues to everyone to help find the murder. The person giving the clue is the Forensic Sciences and hes giving clues to the detective to find the true culprit.  If you're looking for a fun party game that doesn't have people shouting over each other this is the game for you.
