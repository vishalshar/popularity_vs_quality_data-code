These banana chips are super crunchy!  I love them because they're baked, & imo the best flavor is the cinnamon.  They're generously cinnamon dusted - so yum!  And NO added sugars at all.  Once I open a bag, I mow through them - which is good bc otherwise moisture gets in & they lose their crispiness.  This brand has yummy apple & coconut chips (the coconut ones have sugar added) too, but the banana chips are my fave.
