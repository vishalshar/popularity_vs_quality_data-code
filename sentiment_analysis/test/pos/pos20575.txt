I've lived with this for several months, so I can write a fair review.  I really wanted to love this but I don't.  I like the idea of it, so I kept it.  But don't expect miracles.  I tried washing clothes in every which way to find the best solution.  I decided I need soap.  Good news is I only use a tiny bit of detergent with this machine.  I tried to go without but I just have to see bubbles.  Stain remover does seem to work better with this thing.  The best part of it is it makes your clothes smell like they have been hung outside to dry.  It's that really fresh and clean smell.  I have older white towels and they have not become gleaming white again because of this machine.  So, maybe if I bought some new, they would remain that way.  I can't speak to that.  Overall, I like it.  Not floored by it but I do love the smell and that, to me, is worth it.
