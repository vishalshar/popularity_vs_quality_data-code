This is perfect for getting around in the city.  I have some hills here (decent grade), and it does struggle to maintain speed, but kicking it as I go up them will keep the speed up easily enough.  I wouldn't mind a bit more power though, but I'm not exactly a featherweight so the performance is understandable.The brakes take a little getting used to, but they do well enough.  If you're going fast, it's best to lean back a bit since they do feel like they come on a little sudden, but it's very manageable.  The problem is when going down a steep hill, the brakes I feel are not strong enough.  The stopping length is quite long going down a steep hill, so you either need to keep your speeds way down when going down a hill, or make sure you have plenty of room to stop in case a car pulls out.  At least with scooters like this it's easy to bail and stop using your feet, but you really have to take into account weaker brakes when doing down hills to be safe.The handlebars are a bit short like others have said, but that's a very minor "issue" if it can be called that.  Once I got used to it, I have no trouble controlling the scooter.This is a great scooter, and I'm very happy with the purchase despite the small nags above.  Rolling it around while folded was a big selling point for me and why I picked this over other scooters available, and this works great!
