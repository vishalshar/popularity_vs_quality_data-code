When I purchased this product, I thought there were a few obvious places to use it as they described it on their website like sticking it to windows for pictures of me and my daughter, and using it occasionally at work.  But since then, I've found other unexpected ways to use it like sticking it to the microwave above the stove while I cook, etc.  I love the attention to details and the quality - the little Robot etching on the inside won me over!
