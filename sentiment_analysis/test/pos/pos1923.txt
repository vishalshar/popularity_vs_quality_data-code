I love the look and feel of the case and band. Adds much needed bulk to make it feel like a mans watch. Gray is more like an olive drab color but that's okay as it matches my AF uniform. Not a case to swap daily. Installs with screws and if tightened down back and forth there are no issues with it fitting.Two cons so far. Had it about a month and the underneath seems to be showing some cracking near the watch sensor.  Might be just a bad case. The other issue is that if you get a full screen protector like the supcase glass it won't fit properly as the glass has some plastic that cover the watch glass edges. That's needed but as the case splits in half to slide together it won't allow a good seal with that type of glass. That being said, the case covers the edges of the glass fairly well so you might not need glass unless prone to direct impacts to it.Will see how it holds up and repost with more info.UPDATEAlmost two months into the case and there are a couple things worth mentioning.First and foremost the case is completely cracked in four spots. The case screws were not overtightened. Haven't banged it against anything either. It's too late for a return so I'm going to work with the warranty to see if I can get it replaced. And replace it I will because I really do love the look and feel of the case and band.Second thing addresses the inadvertent Siri call up. I simply turned the band around so the crown is facing my upper arm and changed the settings of the watch. Problem solved immediately.If the company honors the warranty I will be satisfied and still recommend the band/case. Will update once I get a new one in.
