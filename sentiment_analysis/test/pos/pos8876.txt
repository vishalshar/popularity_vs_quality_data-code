If anyone else has figured out the secret to get live video at near real time, please comment.UPDATE 2: They updated their app software on Dec 23rd and that made a dramatic improvement (give it a 3 star now). I've been in conversation with the CTO. He and his team have been ruthlessly working though the holidays getting the bugs worked out (added a star, make it 4).  Based upon my exchange of information with their CTO, I feel comfortable they will have the Skybell HD working like a champ before long. Just remember, you need to have a decent WiFi signal at the doorbell, w/o that, you cannot blame the product. If your house is like mine, metal doors don't help the signal at the doorbell.UPDATE: they pushed a new firmware to my skybell.  Working better but still get white circle of death when trying to view live video.  There's a delay with the camera when motion or doorbell starts recording.  Additionally, after you get the notice on your phone, it takes too long to answer the door.  I'm gonna time it, but I'm guessing 20 seconds. That might not be too long for some but it is for me.  Still not able to see video consistently on demand or play history.Ok, I received my SkyBell HD on DEC 11, installed on the 12th.  Not doing what it should for the past 4 days. It records video when there is motion at the door or someone pushes the doorbell, I get door bell and motion detection but am unable to see the video live on my Android Phone (Samsung S7).  Also the playback of video history takes forever to open.  I have traded 2 emails with tech support... 1 per day, not a quick turn around.  Concept is awesome, but I cannot immediately answer my door bell or see live video.  If tech support cannot solve this in the next day or two days, I'm sending it back.  I don't know if I got a faulty one or what.  I have Cable Internet with 20mbps upload speed, my SkyBell is receiving a decent signal (-60db) and can upload at almost 20 mbps at the door bell according to my phone (not sure what's in the skybell hd, it's transceiver might not be as good). I have tried all the different video sizes, 480, 720 good, 720 better, and 1080, and still get a white circle of death and sometimes a message saying "streaming services are not available" will come up after a couple of mins. Lately, it's been white circle of death forever less the incident below.Weird thing happened yesterday, I was trying to view live video and I get the white circle of death.  I let the white circle of death go for like 15 mins and someone else's doorbell popped up on my screen.I think the issue with all of my problems is with SkyBells' servers.  It seems like the video feed goes to their servers then comes back to your device. I have a drop cam at home and it has ran fine, no "real" delays when you want to view live video for over 2 years.I chose this system b/c I read where Nest is involved with the effort.  However, my nest app doesn't let me add the SkyBell HD?  Anyway, no batteries required, uses existing power wires, was a big plus for me. The picture is clear.  The set up process on the phone app is straight forward until the last step.  After the last step it seems like everything failed from what you see on your phone, but after a few seconds the SkyBell HD looks like it's sync'd.  They should fix what the user sees during the last step of the set up.  I think it shows "disconnected from SkyBell" which makes you think everything just failed.
