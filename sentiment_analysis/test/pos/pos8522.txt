She loved assembling her Piper computer.  The blueprint was all she needed.  The kit came with a screw driver, so, she really didn't need to borrow her dad's.  She was able to follow directions to put the kit together.Once it was done, and she connected the cables the computer didn't turn on.  After a couple of emails to LT Tommy, we realized that the power pack needed to be charged for at least nine hours, and the speaker needed to be charged for an hour.  After that she was busy playing Minecraft.  I am happy with my investment.
