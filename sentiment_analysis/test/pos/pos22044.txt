Purchased for my 9 year old son and he loves this robot! The whole family has enjoyed playing with it. Only negatives are that it's hard to figure out (does come with manual that is very helpful) and it is smaller than anticipated, but that is my own fault for not reading the specs closer. Over all, very pleased
