Works well. Down side is having to remember to put the plastic cover on so it doesn't get damaged going in and out of a phone case/sleeve or pick up dirt. Kinda limited on mounting options in the car too. Outside of the windows and windscreen which are both awkward in terms of viewing your phone there aren't many surfaces large and smooth enough to work with this.
