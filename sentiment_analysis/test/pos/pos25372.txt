I love new tech things on the market and this isn't brand new but is still top technology and super cool. The PenPower Beescan is small.  Fits easily in my purse or jeans pocket.  Is light weight. Great for museums, traveling abroad, etc.  We homeschool and so this is a great education-on-the-go device for when we are on a field trip, at a museum or studying old books and we want to be able to scan pictures and documents, magazines, newspapers, etc.It even corrects for poor lighting.  Not only will it save the documents but it will translate and pronounce sentences in more than SEVENTY languages.  WOW, huh?It works with a smartphone and needs Windows 10, Mac, Android, iPhone or iPad to work.It comes with a USB cable too.This is going to make homeschooling easier since we can scan things to translate, read, discuss and learn about and do it immediately or save it and wait until we get home.
