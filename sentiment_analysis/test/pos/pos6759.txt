I love these things! I have them into pairs of shoes, both tennis shoes. The first pair I wear to work every day and they have held up and function  very, very well. occationally, however, they will come "untied". It would be nice if hickeys redesigned them to be a little more secure. My other shoes I use for yardwork.  3 to 4 of the ties have broken on me in those shoes,  so, it seems like they won't hold up to rigorous use.
