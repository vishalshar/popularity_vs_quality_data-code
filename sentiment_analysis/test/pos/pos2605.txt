I found a crying kitten six months ago in front of my rented property. Approximately two (2) weeks old, unweaned, and tiny.Six days later, I bought Superfood Immunity. I started giving it to him when he commenced eating solid food. The free scooper is great touch since I dont have to guess how much to give him.My boy is now six months old, a great hunter, and a loving kitten. This is the only supplement I've been giving him and vet visits are nothing out of the ordinary (thank God!).
