I found these vitamins because I wanted to replace my other gummies which had run out, but I wasn't certain I should buy the same brand again because of the quality. (I was takingÂ Vitafusion Multi-vite, Gummy Vitamins For Adults, 150-Count.)So I read a bit online about how to tell if your vitamins are good quality. What I found is, if you look at the ingredients, and if you see "Vitamin B12 (as cyanocobalamin)", chances are it's a more cheaply made vitamin.  There are apparently other forms of b12 which are healthier -- hydroxycobalamin and methylcobalamin. According to what I could gather on different websites, if you see the label on your vitamins says "Vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin)," you have better quality vitamins. It means the manufacturer spent more money on the ingredients. After searching Amazon for adult gummies and zooming in to read a few labels, I came across SmartyPants; they are indeed using the methylcobalamin. I confirmed my suspicions about the quality of the Vitafusion Multi-vites (suspicions which arose from the clear plastic packaging, as anyone knows it's good for marketing but terrible for storing vitamins,) they are using the cheaper ingredient, cyanocobalamin.Yes, the serving size is 6 and I am getting a little bit more sugar in my day, but it's organic cane sugar, and it's worth it to take one less sugar in my coffee, or deduct it from elsewhere. I've already shared these gummies with my family, highly recommend.
