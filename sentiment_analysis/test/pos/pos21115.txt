These are pretty sweet. It's the first time I've ever really purchased nice speakers/headphones, so I can't give a technical review compared to anything else that's out there. But they feel super comfortable, they deliver an awesome, close-up music experience when plugged into my Mac or iPhone, and I can't hear my kids when they talk to me so they shut out other sound just fine.The packaging is a nice touch. The box looks like an Apple product, sleek black with a magnetic closure. I actually saved it to store things in, it's that useful-looking. Included with the headphones is two different cables, one for Apple and one for Android, and a nice carrying pouch. These headphones can't fit in your pocket, but they do fold flatter and fit in the pouch (which is just a little smaller than my 12" MacBook) which means I will happily travel with them.The customer service is also nice. I received a personal email from the co-founder of Plugged Labs when my package shipped, which included tracking info, and another one after I had had the headphones for a few days. I don't anticipate any problems, but if they do arise, I certainly feel like I could get a prompt response from the company.These let me shut the rest of the world out and work or bounce on my rebounder in my own musical world. Can't say anything about durability yet b/c I've only had them for a few days, but I am highly satisfied so far.
