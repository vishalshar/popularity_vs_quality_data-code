Long story short.  This is the best smelling soap I have ever used.  It is a more masculine, woodsy type scent just for the record.  However, it is a very dry soap.  After a couple uses, I noticed my hands were feeling very dry.  But, that is what hand lotion is for right?  I love this stuff, and have never gotten more "where did you get that soap?" questions from guests...
