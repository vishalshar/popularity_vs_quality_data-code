This bike is perfect for our 6 year old. He is 45" tall & had little previous bike riding experience. We purchased the 18" bike in red. He loves the color. It came in perfect condition other than needing some tightening on previously assembled parts. The assembly required was simple enough. There are NO pedal breaks as explained by other reviewers & they are not listening the description. I felt this was a downside initially until it was pointed out to me that as our little guy grows into larger bikes he will need to only rely on handle bar brakes anyway so he may as well start off with them now. The water bottle is a cool extra feature. This bike came with a kick stand for when we take the training wheels off, which is great so that it is less likely to just be dumped on the ground.
