my daughter LUV's her Switch Witch!..she came as a gift from Santa, becuz we learned about her just days before Halloween ;) ..my daughter's Switch Witch's name is Zelda & yes, she couldn't wait til Halloween to interact with her, so already Zelda has switched out candy canes and candy coins on 2 occations, for a handwritten poem & a $5 bill, lol :)
