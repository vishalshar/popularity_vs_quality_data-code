I typically do not write reviews but wanted to share my experience with this product. I only just received it yesterday and used it first thing this morning. The product is gel based with beads of pumpkin, apple and apricot pieces that scrub off dead skin without the harshness of sand. The gel is soothing and overall the product smells great. A dime or nickel-sized amount is enough to cover your entire face and neck. My face looked pinker, fresh and my skin felt thoroughly cleaned.
