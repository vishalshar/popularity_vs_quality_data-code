FINALLY --- a phone holder that works in my Lexus RX330.  No blocking my AC vent, no rattles, no suction cups. Phone (Galaxy S5) stays put and is easy to use.  And my multiple CD player still works great.  My husband never felt like he needed one because he kept his phone in his shirt pocket.  We now have new laws forbidding the use of hand-held devices while driving, so I got one for his Toyota Avalon too ... he loves it.  Worth the money!!
