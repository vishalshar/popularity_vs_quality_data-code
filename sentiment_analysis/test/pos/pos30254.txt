Upon receiving the phone I was highly impressed with the packaging and the design of the phone itself. I have been using the phone for a few days now and I must say the phone is very quick and snappy. The sound from the speakers is very crisp and clear as well. The phone is just the right size and feels great in the hands. I must say the OS design and layout definitely had a lot of thought and design put in them. The cameras are clear as crisp as well and the fingerprint scanner is very quick to unlock the phone.However with the good does also come the bad. I have been using the phone for about 4-5 days now and have noticed the phone does get quite warm quite quick when streaming video or playing games. I removed the phone from the case to clean it and upon removing from the case I noticed some marks on the back of the phone which look like scratches which would be odd as the phone has been in a case since the day it was purchased. Upon looking into this further I notice a bulge on the back of the phone around where the said marks are appearing. I am not sure if this a design flaw or from the phone getting to hot. I will be reaching out to Nextbit support to see what can be done about this.Nextbit was extremely helpful in getting a replacement sent, and live chat was pleasant. Its definitely nice to see a company very open to their customers feedback. I am still puzzled how that happened however the replacement phone is working great. Awesome Job Nextbit!
