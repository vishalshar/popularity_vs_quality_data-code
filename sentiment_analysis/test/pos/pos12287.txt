This is a great mat! I did a lot of research looking for an attractive one piece play mat, versus the foam tiles that my baby liked to take apart. Compared to other similar mats I saw, this one seemed more high quality with a thicker and denser foam, creating a soft and safe play surface. One of the other mats I had purchased came with a cheaper price tag, but was also made with a thinner foam that left deep indentations from even baby knees and elbows. I also liked the design of this mat over other more loud patterns.I had a check list of wants and this mat met my needs:one pieceattractivelarge (this mat is 4' x 6')soft and thickeasy to cleandurable
