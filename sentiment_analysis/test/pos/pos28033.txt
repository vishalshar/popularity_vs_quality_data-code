Excellent product!  (One minor quip - I bought this to save $$$ on my water bill.  It rained last night, and the system watered the lawn ANYWAY - even though Auto Scheduling was turned-on.  Will likely invest in a rain sensor for it.)  Also bought it because it is made locally by a company down in Denver.  All things considered, a pretty decent peace of technology - worth every penny I paid! :)
