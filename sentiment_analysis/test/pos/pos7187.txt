read the reviews and saw the complaints about the dial not functioning properly.  i liked the way it looked and for $20 it was worth a try. I received it and after a 5min install I was very impressed. No issues with the dial and the install wasn't anywhere near as difficult as some made it out to be. Only downside is it doesn't sit well on my spigen charging stand. I would highly recommend especially for $20
