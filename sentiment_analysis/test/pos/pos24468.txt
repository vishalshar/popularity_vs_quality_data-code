I'll try and keep this as quick and short as possible. I've been using this item at least every day since the past 2 weeks for a minimum of about 15 minutes a day. This allows me to actually use chairs that use to be painful for me to sit in. This product has not fully magically cured my lumbar spine issue (slipped disks) but it has help me cope with pain promoted by the issue. The pain overall has lessened during my time using this item, but I've also been actively stretching and doing body weight exercises to help strengthen everything. I cant say this this will be a magical cure, but its definitely a nice addition to your routine. I will say it has helped me remember to sit more upright constantly and if i neglect to, it will still hold you upright and prevent slouching. Everything about the product is well built, I see this item holding up for a long time before breaking. If anything breaks it'll be the plastic clip used to link both leg bands together. I wish there was some locking mechanism to prevent it from slipping out, but that is a minor issue. I've seen a review or 2 that talks about knee pain....yes you will get knee pain if you use this for an extended amount of time. My suggestion is you move it lower on your legs or higher to help lessen the pain. But other than that I would recommend this product to a friend or family member suffering. I do believe it has helped me recover quicker, but hey every one body is different.
