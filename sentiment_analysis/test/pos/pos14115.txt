I bought it for my toddler who spend as much time on his iPad as he does playing with physical toys, and figured this will fit in well with the other toys that he already play with. This particular piece is an additional race car for his Anki Overdrive Starter Kit(http://www.amazon.com/Anki-000-00031-OVERDRIVE-Starter-Kit/dp/B00V6951I0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1448036591&sr=8-1&keywords=anki), which comes with two, and we needed a third car so that he can race with grandpa as well.The Thermo car itself has four RGB LED lighted areas: 2 on the hood, one on top and one in the back that act as indicator lights which tells the players if it is their car, a second player, or an AI player. It is a rear wheel drive car and the back tires are rubber. The front tires are smooth plastic so it can pretty much drift and slide. The rear tires are independent to each other with 2 separate motors controlling them. The rear tires control the steering, and the front tires are on a fixed axle.Performance-wise, it works just as well as the other cars that came from the starter kit, and it does have some funky virtual weapons like a flame thrower. We used iPads (iPad 3, iPad Air, iPad mini 1) and iPhones (6+) to control them, and they worked fine. TIP: try to level up the ANKI app in each smart device you will use for racing so that no matter which one your little guy picks up, he's not going to complain that the one he's using is too slow.After a half a dozen races or so, check the rear rubber tires - if you have a dusty house like most of us do, the traction will lessen as the tires pick up whatever dust that floats down and lands on the tracks. You can use the tire cleaner that came with the starter kit, or you can also use a piece of tape like (blue painter's tape) to clean them with.Battery Charge on the car: I think it was almost an hour of racing before the iPhone notified me to charge the car, so I popped it on the charging cradle that came with the Starter kit.Overall, it is lightweight, sleek, and well made. So far this little guy has taken enough abuse and still holding well.
