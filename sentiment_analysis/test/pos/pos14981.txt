As a disclaimer, I did receive a significant discount from Brushee to test their product and provide a review.To start with, I'm in the Army and I spend a lot of time in the woods, without running water. These guys are useful because they're very lightweight and you don't need running water. They feel a little flimsy in the hand, especially when I'm working my back teeth or using the floss bar, but they definitely do the trick.The packaging is annoying. They don't tear off as single brushes. It's either the pack of three or bust. It's poster board backed plastic, with a perforated back side. The perforations are a little smaller than the brush, so they don't come out easily. It's also at risk of degrading if it gets wet, which is common when sleeping in the field on the gulf coast. It would be nice if they were waterproof sealed in individual packs. The toothpick works fine, but I'm not much of a toothpick guy so I can't comment much on that.Bottom line, they're very handy and do their advertised job well, although it would be nice if they were a little stiffer and flexed less when brushing or flossing and the packaging could be improved. I will definitely be making these a regular sundry as long as the product is available.
