A fun present for the whole family, it lights up just as beautifully as in the pictures. It requires more care than a pet rock, but not much. Feeding dino is very easy, but it does require pouring liquids accurately so adult supervision may be necessary. The same goes for shaking the dino to light him up, this must be done gently or the colony could die.
