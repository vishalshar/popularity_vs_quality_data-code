I was at a trade show when I first heard these speakers. I was looking around the booth to see where the sound was coming from. To my surprise, we found that it was the bulbs that were actually the speakers. With such amazing sound quality I needed a pair for myself. When I received them the quality was much better than I expected. Screwed them into a standard light socket and I was blasting music through my house like a high end pair of stereo speakers. Easy to hook up and connect to your phone or tablet. I was even able to hook up to my TV via Bluetooth transmitter. Highly recommend to anyone looking to add music to your office or house.
