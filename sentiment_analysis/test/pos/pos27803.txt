I have had my Torch T2 helmet coming up two weeks now, and it's just fabulous. i have no complaints so far. Everything is as described. I was concerned that the One-Size-Fits-All helmet might not fit well since I wear a XL size helmet, but I didn't have a problem. The box also came with plenty of extra padding for those with small heads.  Front light on helmet is not bright enough to illuminate the roadway, I knew that before I bought it. I will still need to get a real bike light. But the built-in front light is bright enough to alert oncoming traffic, and most importantly alert cars ahead of me going in the same direction, and in the process of crossing into to the bike lane to make a right hand turn as I am riding up to an intersection. They can see me coming in their side mirrors.The rear built-in light is golden. Obviously the light is higher than typical bike lights which are usually attached under the bike seat. These Torch helmet rear lights flash brightly. I have definitely noticed a big difference having a flashing light as opposed to no light at all. Cars do carve a wide path around me  when they pass me, and having the light high up at head level makes me stand out even more. The fact that the lights on the helmet are easily charged via a USB port is a big plus. No changing batteries and all that crap. I charge it once a week for 5 nights of riding home from work on a 15 minute ride. I have not yet tested how long a charge last but the specs indicate something like 6 hours I think (but don't quote me).Finally let's talk about the coolness factor. Can I just say how dope this helmet looks? I have resisted wearing bicycle helmets for a long time because I don't think they are attractive (not a good reason compared to a cracked skull, I know). Most have the Function part of the equation nailed down,  but Form and aesthetics leave much to be desired. These Torch Helmets got Form and Function in the bag. I get drivers and pedestrians checking my helmet out all the time. I bought the black Midnight edition which is super cool. You can't tell the helmet has built-in lights when the lights are off during daytime riding. The front and rear lens are tinted black to match the helmet for that monochromatic matted look. But come night time, you click on the rear lights, and suddenly the back of your helmet comes alive in glowing red. Now the only thing left is to see how long these helmets last. I take care of my stuff so I am expecting not to have any problems in workmanship showing up anytime soon.
