I was on the fence about spending so much on this kit but my son (11 years old) LOVED his Lego EV3 and this had the level of fun and complexity he was looking for. I had a $100 Amazon gift card so that took the sting off a little bit. He opened it on Christmas morning and it was probably the toy he liked / played with the most the rest of Christmas break. (He wanted it but thought it was too pricey to actually get.) He likes the Bluetooth integration and the apps for iPhone and has been playing around with it a lot. Cousins and even the grandparents were impressed by it. He has been building all kinds of stuff, that doesn't stay together for long before he takes it all apart and start on something else. I'd like to see a block that allows integration with Lego for even more imaginative play. (The yellow Cubelet brick adapter does not work with this set.) Overall, neat kit and has all the goodies.
