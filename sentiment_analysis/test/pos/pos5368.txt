I first found out about this microphone when a local reporter needed to interview a colleague of mine at the Delaware State Fair. He pulled a small bag from his pocket and I asked what it was and he said, Oh, I was shown this and had to get it it has changed everything. Reporters now have to do it all, interview, shoot companion video and edit.  I ordered mine the next day1 The MightyMic is a Bluetooth lavalier mic that pairs with your iPhone. Now I have an iPhone and had been long frustrated with recording and having wind sheer in the audio. I shoot a lot outside in agricultural settings. No real easy solutions out there - while possible, you have to have an array of items linked together and I was hoping for something simple. Of all the options out there, this is the best one for iPhone audio recording.The trick with this mic is you cannot use the native or default video that exists in the camera settings. You must use Movie Pro app, a one time $6 investment.  What's in the bag is shown, a tiny BT adapter for computer, which I won't ever use, the mic and a USB charger. There is a small on and off button at the top of the mic. My only complaint is it is hard to see the LED indicators telling you if it is on and off. That could be improved upon. I had it in the pouch and when I needed it, it had been left on and discharged, so pay attention to that. Fully charged, it works like a dream. The MoviePro app will tell you immediately if it is using the built-in mic from your phone or the Mighty Mic. That app, by the way gives you a lot of options, such as changing the fps, white balance, audio sliders, etc. Well worth the $6. I keep it fully charged. Being somewhat disorganized, I lost the small charging cord, wrote to Ampridge to order another, and they sent me a new one in two days, free of charge. Very nice and impressive.  Personally I'd pay a couple of dollars more to have two of those chargers included, one for home and one for work, then I can keep the unit charged wherever I am. Sound is terrific. If you want to see how it sounds view the link from the state fair interview [...]  I highly recommend getting a collapsible mono pod with a cell phone grip, or a stabilizer or selfie stick. Together, you will have an awesome mobile studio.
