I really like the convenience of these.  They are perfectly adhering to the back of my iPhone with a Garmin Defender case (or something like that).  I didn't use the adhesive that was included because I believe it wouldn't have worked.  I used (3) 3M hook adhesives instead trimmed up a little.  This solution has been secure since I put it on.  We also bought another pair of these glasses for another phone and used the adhesive that came with the product and ended up going the 3M hook adhesive route because it came off the other phone in 1 day.  I keep my phone in my purse when out and it really doesn't get bumped around a lot.  A couple of times the glasses have partway popped out maybe because something got caught on them or when I am taking my phone but it hasn't caused a problem.  It is so handy to have readers so accessible!  Before I was digging around in my purse and sometimes would just give up.  I have used them a LOT.  They aren't really that comfortable to wear for a long period of time but then I don't believe that is what they are intended for.  I have and will recommend.
