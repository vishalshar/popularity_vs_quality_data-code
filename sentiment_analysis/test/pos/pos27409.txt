Very nice filament.  It's well priced, the ziplock bag is helpful.I do like 500g spools, as it allows me to get more variety.  One spool goes a long way, and as its subject to moisture issues, having smaller bags means less waste, or less exposure to humidity for a given spool anyway.  if you are not printing constantly, this seems a better route.
