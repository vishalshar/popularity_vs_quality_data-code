This is a great product that is keeping my bike performing and helping keep me safe.  I don't have to climb under the bags trying to check the air pressure, but I always know when it needs it.  Easy to use, easy to install.  The only downside is having to relink it after you take it if to add air.  But that is minor.  I'd buy them again in a second
