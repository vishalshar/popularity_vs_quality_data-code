Oh my god, this is so much fun!!!!I bought it for my 7 year old boy (and really a little for me too) and he absolutely LOVES IT (as do I). This is a ridiculously fun toy that kept us up until the wee hours. My boy actually said "dad this is too much fun, I can't stop". Love it :-DThe app that runs the cars is great. It's very responsive and allows you to adjust sensitivity to your liking.The cars are ridiculously fast. I mean these things just go! And they don't run out the batteries too bad. We got 3 hours out of them before the cars showed signs of tiring and were still okay after 5 hours of play (it's actually kinda nice that the cars run a bit slower).Best birthday gift ever!My 5 year old also had a bit of fun running the car around and was able to control it okay, but I would not recommend it for that age.The one gaming comment I would make to the manufacturer is that when you get into "My car" setting on the app, your opponent cannot cause you damage, which is a bit of an unfair safe heaven. It's certainly not a design feature.For the next gen cars I'm plugging in a request for an on-car video cam and in-app viewer :-)
