The sound put out from this little speaker is amazing. It has a full sound with good bass. You can control the volume on your phone and on the speaker itself. This allows for a great range from soft to super loud. It's very portable with a good range on the Bluetooth signal.  I've been impressed with it's battery life and haven't had to charge it much. Compared to my iPhone 4, it's approximately the same length, a little wider, and as tall as 3 iPhone stacked on one another. It's small and light enough that I carry it around in my purse.  A great purchase!
