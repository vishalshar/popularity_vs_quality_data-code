Love it and feel like my phone is encased in a tank now. The downside of that is the case is too thick for my wireless charger to work so now it's back to jamming the card in daily and hoping it doesn't get damaged.  Wish there were magnets at both ends so I could have some flexibility in phone position as I had only a few flat smooth places free to put the sticky magnet in my car.
