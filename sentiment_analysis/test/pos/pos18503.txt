The ABSOLUTE best invention for pet lovers/owners!  I cannot get enough of this camera, and all the features are great!  The treat dispenser helped to make my dogs more comfortable with this weird box that projected my voice.  I can take pictures of them listening to me talk through the camera, which is a great way to remember how far technology has come.  They truly enjoy it, and so do I!  I would HIGHLY recommend!
