This is my second 3doodler, I owned the first version that came out a few years back and upgraded to this version recently. While the first one was really cool, worked well and was fun to use, this version is clearly a vast improvement. Easy to load plastic, no clogging, really light, great product dimensions, more comfortable to grip over longer periods and cool colors!I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and, while I'm no artist, I've created some pretty cool things with it. It's a steal for the price. I would highly recommend going with the quality product over other options, particularly if you want to spend any meaningful time using it.
