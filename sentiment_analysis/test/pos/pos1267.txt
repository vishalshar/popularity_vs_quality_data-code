My husband bought me the URB-E as a Christmas present but when I saw the box I had to open it right away ( since I had to sign for the delivery).  The scooter was well packed and assembly was a matter of installing four bolts... It was that easy.  Then of course, I had to take it for a spin.  I LOVED IT!  The ride was so smooth and comfortable even in the rain ( which it was raining when I took it for a spin).  It was easy to maneuver and it felt really balanced.  Also wanted to indicate that the customer service from URB-E was excellent.  My husband received a call from the customer service rep AND the CEO of the company when he placed the order with Amazon.  We highly recommend this scooter for those interested in a fun ride.
