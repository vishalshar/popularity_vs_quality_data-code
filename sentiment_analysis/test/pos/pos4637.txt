Easy to setup, activate & sync. Extremely accurate distance to target. I've compared the TLink yardage to the yardage markings of the courses I've played and its spot on. I played 4 rounds on a single charge. I've only used the clip-on holder to avoid being distracted by the wristband. If it could only find my golf ball!
