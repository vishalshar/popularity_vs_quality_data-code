I received these as a thank you gift in a Bark Box. My Keeshond liked these so much that I ordered them from Amazon. These are a small and soft, have an herbal scent, and are a natural healthy treat. They are made in USA. My dog is allergic to most treat ingredients so I was pleased to find a treat she likes that she can tolerate. These are a great size for training or reward. These are soft so not great for teeth, but good for a post walk snack.
