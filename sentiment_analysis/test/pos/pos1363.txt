I was looking for a hotspot that would help keep us connected when we were traveling overseas. I am not much of a technophile and wanted a device that would be simple to set up and operate. The description of this device seemed to fit the bill so I bought one last month. We just completed a three week trip to Australia and Thailand and this device performed very, very well. I bought 1GB of worldwide service before we left and then upon landing in Perth, Australia I purchased a local sim card for about US$20 which would give me a slightly better cost for data there.  Even the tech guy at the phone shop was pretty amazed at how easily the device recognized the card. It was easy to switch between the two SIM cards and that shortly came in handy after we ventured out into rural Western Australia.  Out there, the local SIM card was of no use. But the cloud SIM in the device worked perfectly and provided a nice 3G signal and 4G service where available. After we got back nearer large cities I went back to the local SIM and it worked fine.  I also found that the cloud SIM worked fine in Thailand too when hotel wifi was spotty.
