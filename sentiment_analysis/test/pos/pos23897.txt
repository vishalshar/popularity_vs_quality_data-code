With the SSD on my MacBook Pro running low on space, I moved my Adobe Lightroom catalog to the flash drive inside  the Nifty MiniDrive and now I have a ton of space. It's like I added a second hard drive to my laptop. The speed is fine for how I'm using it as secondary storage.  I do need to remember to specifically include it in my backups though. And I wouldn't run applications from it. I'm not sure it would be fast enough for that. But otherwise, I'm very happy I was able to add 128GB of storage for under $100.
