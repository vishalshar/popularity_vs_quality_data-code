absolutely love these little fruit packs! I'm a vegan and find these perfect for snacks or even breakfast if im on the run and have time to eat anything else. Their very filling and only 90 calories for the apple flavour. I also love throwing these in my bag if i'm hiking as they give me lots of energy when needed. I also keep some in my purse, car, etc. They really come in handy if you need energy, are hungry, need energy, etc. Love MunkPack and will purchase again!! :)If you have kids this would also been something awesome to add to their lunch boxes! They do have an interesting texture of applesauce/oatmeal type texture but i absolutely love it! You should try this product in stores before you order an entire box (I bought mine at a grocery store called Earth Fare before buying here!)
