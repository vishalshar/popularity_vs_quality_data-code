Not bad.  I didn't fill it up past half way which seemed like a good choice.  I didn't jump around, but I was going up and down a ladder multiple times to paint a shed and not incidents.  The magnet dropped the brush in the paint a couple times, but that was a minor inconvenience.  Held my 5 way scraper tool...didn't really use the "rag" hooks yet.  I'll update when I try that bit out
