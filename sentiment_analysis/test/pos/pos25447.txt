I am a guy that does 15-20 Red Rocks shows a year and a good 20-30 other live music sets in any given year. A huge reason is the feel. I have now used this continuously for weeks and it is just amazing. I have sat on my couch at night with this and just catch an hour gone by and you get so lost in new layers of music you have heard a thousand times. If you really like music a lot this thing is incredible.It does take a bit to dial in. The very first round with it I was not impressed out the gate. It made me feel almost tired. I had the intensity way too high and it does take your body a bit to get used to what is going on. As I dialed it in, took time to get to know it just wow. Most of the time I have the intensity at ~25%. Have gone up to 50% but you don't need a lot. The more I've used it the more I've turned down the intensity and the results have been amazing. Overall I'm probably going to end up getting the backpack version too. I got this version as the Subpac website described this one as having the biggest depth to it because it comes with more surface area, but I'm so impressed ideally I'll get the M2 down the road as well.
