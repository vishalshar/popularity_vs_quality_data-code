It's easily accessed on both my and my hubbies' phones. Night light is not satisfactory but there is still the sound updates for during the night. Can be easily unplugged which defeats the purpose of security in case someone breaks in. Overall,  if we have an idiot break in, it's great & I love being able to talk through the speaker. This is much better than a child monitor which is why I purchased it with the benefit of security.
