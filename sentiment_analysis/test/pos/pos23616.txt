Awesome sippy! I have been searching for a good plastic free sippy since my son started using one. Even the bpa free is supposedly bad now too! This sippy is So easy to clean as it's just the silicone cap that you slip over the cup. I was suprised to find that the flow was just right too. I haven't worried about it breaking. My son is pretty good about keeping his cup on a table and getting a drink when needed though. We do use a different stainless steel straw sippy for travel though (pura)
