My first experience with a Sphero product was the BB-8 droid. She was such a huge hit that I decided to get this one as well. It's wonderful to be able to show kids how the robot works and all the parts that are inside. I'm also enjoying the more in depth apps that allow you to program the robot using a visual programmer.
