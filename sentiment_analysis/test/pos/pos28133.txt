My wife uses this quite regularly, and finds it very effective, with no aftereffects.We have only two gripes:(1) The expiration/use-by dates are on the bottom of the individual bottles, but not on the outside of the  boxes, which can mean inadvertently buying expired goods.  The (relatively) good news is that the boxes are not tamper resistant, so one can open a box, take a bottle out and check the date on its bottom, but  that would look like, to the casual observer in a store, either potential tampering or theft.  Of course, that  may  be another reason to purchase it from a trustworthy online source, in the privacy in your home.  However,(2)  The bottles are definitely "tamper-proof," nearly to the level of being bomb-proof.  The thick shrink-wrapped band around the cap goes far beyond just warning if the bottle had been opened, or keeping kids out; many customers will be seeking a sharp tool to cut the band open when they were originally just seeking a good night's sleep.
