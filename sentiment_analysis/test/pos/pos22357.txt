OK, these are great. The design is kinda fun and the labels are easy to read. The cheese stays fresh. Yep, it does what it says it will do. We cannot ask more. And, I want to say that I live with a lot of people in a co-housing situation and this paper really doesn't last more than a week with people going in and out of the cheese drawer trying to get their fix. I hope Formaticum keeps going with design innovations to both improve durability and give us some choices with size and design of the paper...why not give us an entire roll instead of sheets for those of us who--yikes--get humongous cheese blocks from Costco?
