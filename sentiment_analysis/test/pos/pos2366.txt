Ok I'll give my honest review. It works as advertised. It does what it says. But the images are not as clear as I feel it could be. I guess you get what you paid for. I recommend cable extension this will make it much better for operating.Pros:Easy to useVery small foot printGood priceComes with a nice caseCons:Image quality is not so goodFeels fragile (may not be)Well not work with a case on your phone
