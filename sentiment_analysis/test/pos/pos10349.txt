The Spire tracker is an unusual combination of fitness tracker and breathing monitor, and it does both exceedingly well.  Compared to Garmin and Jawbone, the activity tracking is spot on probably because it is worn (via belt or bra) where extraneous movements don't result in "false" steps.  I have worn it indoors on a treadmill, outdoors while running, on a elliptical machine, and even while spinning (clipped on my sock).  The agreement with both Garmin and Jawbone was excellent.  But the unique aspect of the Spire is that it functions as a breath monitor.  By comparison to your normal breathing rate, the smartphone app provides real time assessment of periods of calm, focused, or tense breathing patterns which are incredibly accurate and reproducible.  For example, watching a thriller on video seems to elicit a "tense" response from me, while reading a thriller novel does not.  Additional smartphone "cues" suggest breathing exercises which can reduce tense breathing within a minute or two.  I find this approach more useful than standard Mindfulness exercises because you can see your breathing pattern change on your smartphone screen, enhancing feedback.  So, an accurate activity tracker AND an effective stress reliever in one, durable and unobtrusive device (with a battery life of a week).  Almost too good to be true.
