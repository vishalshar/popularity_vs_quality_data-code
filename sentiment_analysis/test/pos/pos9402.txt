The bluetooth "hot/cold" location is pretty accurate, although it takes a minute or two to warm up, and the map feature is excellent. I was concerned at first this product would drain my iPhone battery, but I haven't noticed significant change since using the app. The size is perfect for almost anything you'll ever be trying to find.Great for keys, awful for swingers parties.
