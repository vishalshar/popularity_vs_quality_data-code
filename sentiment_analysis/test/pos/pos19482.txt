Beautiful case - the natural wood is an eye-catcher every where I go. Super slim, almost no bulk or extra weight. While the wallet pocket looks like it's a flimsy knitted sweater-like material in the pictures, don't be fooled -- it's actually a very robust stretchy elastic that holds your cards in very, very tight. Not so tight that you can't get them out, but tight enough that you feel safe.
