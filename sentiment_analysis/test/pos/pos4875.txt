My cat has been having blockages in his urine for a few months.  The vet gave me NOsorb to obtain his urine samples with. The first time the cat went to the bathroom in it there was no problem, but the second time he was too smart for it!  After waiting for the poor guy to pee for almost two days I swapped the regular litter back into the box.  I heard about Kit4Kat and put it in his litter box last night.  This morning I had a perfect sample.  This was so much easier and the cat obviously was fine with it.  I wish the vet would give these out instead of the Nosorb!
