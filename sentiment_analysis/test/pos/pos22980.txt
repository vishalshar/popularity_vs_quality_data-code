Only took a couple of tries to hide my frown line.  Areas that move more, like around your mouth, won't work with this product.  Still, only having to use a very small amount of product on my frown line every two or three days will make this a bargain.  HELPFUL HINT:  I've found you can make it last for a day or more longer if you take nail clippers to the edges that start to lift up!
