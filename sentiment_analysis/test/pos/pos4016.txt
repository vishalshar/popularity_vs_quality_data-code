Purchased for my emergency bag, this kit is very well made.  The spoon, fork, and knife are all very durable...  and come in a very nice container that they all snap into.  The knife has an added bottle opener on it as well that is metal.  Where they appear very durable, I don't think they would hold up under alot of pressure ( cutting things with the fork ) even though the edge is beveled to be able to do that.  I feel that if you put to much pressure on it, it could snap somewhat easily.  Still for an emergency kit and to keep weight down...  it is nice and compact!
