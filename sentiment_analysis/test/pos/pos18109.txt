My husband and I were very hesitant after months of researching. We finally decided on the ghost bed. We even considered returning because the first 3 weeks or so, we were still uncomfortable. You do have to wait 30 days for a reason ;) now we couldn't be happier and so glad we stuck it out. We are actually sleeping. Woo hoo!!
