3Doodler Create 3D Pen With 50 Plastic Strands, No Mess, Non-Toxic, Smoky BlueÂ This is a great 3D pen as compared to others I've tried. The ease of use, available options, and choice of filaments that can be used all add to the feature list. I started out using the 3Doodler and have been spoiled. I tried several other types since but none can really match it when all things are considered.The ergonomically shaped pen itself makes handling it while making your 3d creations a joy. I have a small hand and often have difficulty with larger styled tools, I've never had such an issue with the 3Doodler. I can't recommend this 3D pen enough.Buy it! You won't disappointed if you do.
