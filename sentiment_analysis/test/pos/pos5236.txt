I have purchased new gloves in the past. My friend told me about Grip Boost. He stated that it was a lot cheaper than buying new gloves even though I purchased the cheapest gloves that are available. I have noticed a difference in my old gloves since I have been using this product. It is worth the price and better than purchasing new gloves. I highly recommend this product.
