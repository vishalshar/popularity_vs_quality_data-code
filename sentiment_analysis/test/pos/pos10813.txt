Update:  I added a couple of pictures of my LEAF from tonight - so you can see if there's any discoloration of the light wood.  Been wearing it everyday since June, 2015.  Still looks great!I pre-ordered / purchased three LEAFs through the company website (when they were just rolling them out - last summer).  One for myself and one for each of my daughters.  Not only do I LOVE my LEAF, but my daughters are really happy with them as well!  I love the design and the fact that it can be worn so many ways.  I don't go a week without someone commenting on how pretty it is, and then they're super surprised when I tell them it's an activity / period tracker as well!  Bellabeat is continuously upgrading the app and their customer support is top notch.  Anytime I have a question, they get back to me (usually within 24-hours) and are even faster at working to resolve any issues.PROS:Beautiful - can be worn as a necklace, bracelet, broach!Accurate - measures activity as well as steps.  Activity is when you're actually walking at a good pace / working out.  Helps to sort out just slow (office type) steps vs. workout steps when your heartrate would be higherPeriod tracking - I love this!  Helps me to track my cycle and know ahead (based on my typical cycle lengths) when I'll be ovulating, etc.Breathing exercises - great way to take a step back and breathe, literally!  Great to make me take some time out each day for myself and my health.CONS:One of our necklaces broke after about 7-months.  Constant wearing, but was hoping it would have lasted longer.  Note, our other two necklaces are still perfectly fine!Not really a CON, but going to mention it so you're aware - my leaf started getting 'loose' (i.e. it would slip off my sports bra since the gap got too big).  This is where customer service came in - I emailed them my dilemma and they responded right away, it was a quick fix on my end (they even included pictures to help me do it!).  Back to 100% :)Not waterproof - but it's so easy to slip off the necklace I just wear the necklace in the shower and then put my leaf back on after I'm out!Hope this review is helpful!
