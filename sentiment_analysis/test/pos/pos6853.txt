Received it quickly and it works very nicely.Awesome ultralight stove, took it on my week-long section hike on the Appalachian Trail in late March and it worked very nicely.  I used it both for a wood fire and with Esbit tablets.  It made the Esbit tablets a cinch to use and also enabled a wood fire that I otherwise could not have made.
