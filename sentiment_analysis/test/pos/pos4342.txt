I ordered iHome Smart Plug because it's compatible with Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa. For power consumption information I decided to go for this version of the plug.SetupThe initial setup could be definitely made more foolproof. My phone was connected to 5G internet at home and I got a useless error message when initially setting up the plug. Since I had read other reviews I knew that I need to temporarily switch network of my iPhone to 2.4GHz. After doing that I was able to finish the setup and could switch my phone back to 5G network. Alexa setup was straightforward but I still needed to quickly skim the instructions to get it working.ProductI have only Apple iPhones and 4th generation Apple TV, which acts as a hub for HomeKit compatible products. iHome seems an Apple-friendly product and hence works well with Siri and Apple Home app. Furthermore, I was able to easily set up my Alexa to control the plug. What I'm missing is IFTTT integration. Unfortunately iHome Smart Plug does not have an IFTTT channel, so I couldn't create custom applets. iHome Control iPhone app is relatively simple but does what it's supposed to do. Additionally, I wish iHome would have a model which gives energy consumption information without needing to buy the remote. While the remote may be appealing to some it's quite a turnoff for me and I never intend to use it.ReliabilityI haven't had the plug for long enough to comment its reliability. For now the plug seems to be working just fine. I'll update the review if I should have hiccups down the line.ConclusionSo far so good. I can see frustration when the setup fails or when the product does not live up to expectations. I think it's fair to recommend the plug if you're mainly using Apple products at home.
