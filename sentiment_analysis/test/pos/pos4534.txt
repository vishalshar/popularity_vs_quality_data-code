This product lives up to its claims of a faster charge for mobile devices. I've only had it for a couple weeks now, but I expect to have this for a while. Built in battery monitor gives me an overall understanding of my car battery's condition.  I haven't had a need to use location features yet. Preliminary tests are ok.
