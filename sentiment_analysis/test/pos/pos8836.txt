So far so good. Fits on my keychain perfectly and doesn't feel bulky or awkward when I carry my keys in my front pocket. Charging the phone is easy and everything works as expected. I use it primarily at work since I carry two phones (one personal, one work phone) and this makes it easy to charge either phone while I'm at my desk using my laptop.
