I like Julep, my favorite colors are Dusty Orchid and Nectar Pink, I thought I'd give this color a chance for a change and it's nice. I like Julep because in some shades the color can last for a couple of hours without a touch up. The Blush Pout color is a bit more Glossy than other colors I have and didn't last as long, but it's still a color I'd buy again. It's not too bright, but one can see it., it's a nice Pink with red tones.
