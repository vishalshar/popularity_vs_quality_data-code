I was trying to decide between a stand-up desk and an under desk elliptical, and obviously decided to go with the latter.  I bought my Cubii about a month ago and am loving it so far.  It is quite easy to keep peddling while doing most types of work at my desk, and I really like how I can track progress, change goals, and alter the resistance all from the app, which is very user friendly.  It is nice and quiet--I have peddled on it while talking to coworkers in my office and they didn't even notice.  The highest resistance is not very difficult at all, but if you peddle for several hours a day you can still feel it.  I usually keep it at around a 5 out of 8, and my legs can be a bit sore at the end of the day.  According to the app, I have been burning about 300 calories a day and peddling about 4 miles, but it definitely varies based on how much time I spend at my desk and the type of work I am doing.  That being said, this is definitely not a substitute for working out, but it's perfect for supplementing workouts instead of just sitting at your desk all day.  The Cubii customer service has also been great.  The charger cable my Cubii came with did not work properly, and they were very quick to respond and to send me a replacement.
