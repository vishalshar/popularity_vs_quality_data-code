Easy to mold if you read the instructions or watch the video on their website. Unfortunately mine went through the wash and them ear mold melted to the pocket that they were in. However the headphones themselves still work. They are sturdy headphones that don't fall out of your ears during exercise or activities. There isn't much noise that comes from the wires if they rub on something like other headphones I've had.
