The Odorless Toilet Fan works exactly as advertised. When you sit down, the fan draws air from the bowl into its filter and makes it smell good. If your bathroom is inside the bedroom like ours, this will make you happy!The build quality is good, and it works flawlessly once installed. However, installation is a bit harder than it should be. I followed the directions and template exactly, but discovered that the fan stayed on if the toilet bowl lid was left up. By raising the sensor/battery unit higher on the wall, the sensor beam misses the toilet bowl lid and turns off quickly when user stands up. See the product photo below.My only other complaint is the replacement filters: They are not yet available on Amazon. Hoping to see them here soon.
