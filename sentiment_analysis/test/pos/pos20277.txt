This product really does deliver. It does what it says it will do and it is an interesting alternative to a pick/fingers. It will take time to learn all of the different techniques of using the Guitar Triller and sadly there's not too many video tutorials for how to use it in different contexts. Overall it is an interesting product and very affordable. This is a purchase you won't regret, so if you're not sure about this, just go ahead and get it!
