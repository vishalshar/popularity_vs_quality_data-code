I sit in front of my computer screen more than I should. After awhile, I begin to slouch, so I wanted something to help me with my posture. While looking at braces on Amazon, I saw the UPRIGHT Posture Trainer. Sounded like a great idea and it is. The device has helped me be much more aware of my posture while sitting in front of the screen. (Apparently it is not yet suggested for walking.) The company is a startup, so there were a couple of hiccups, such as I was looking for the device to show up in the my iPhone 5s' list of blue tooth connected devices, but it does not. The customer support has been very responsive.  The industrial design is elegant. And yes I have to recalibrate it periodically, but no big deal.
