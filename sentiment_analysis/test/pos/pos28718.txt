What an awesome compact portable speaker.  What amazed me was how much volume with clear tone you get from such a small speaker.  It jams!  The design is great; small and slim, but extremely durable... Feels totally solid in your hand, not like it would break if you accidentally dropped it.  It's sleek design fits in any bag or on your belt.  Great for on-the-go or listening at home.  It's simple controls make it easy to use and pairing up was a snap.  I used it all day without running out of battery life, gave it a normal charge, and it was ready to go all day again.  Can't wait to take it to the beach.  It's additional features includes an App, radio station capability, and duel speaker use.  It's a great device.  If you're looking for a small compact portable speaker with a big sound, this TOO is the One.Enjoy!
