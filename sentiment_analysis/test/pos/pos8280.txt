This phone got ran over by a Toyota Tacoma (screen down) and all it did was leave 7 barely noticeable blue dots, in the pattern of The Big Dipper (I'm from Alaska BTW). This is a very sturdy phone. Although there were problems with the home button for a short while; a small irritation, but it was no biggie because the back and recent buttons still worked, and i don't really use the fingerprint scanner. Software has never acted up on me once even when updating from lollipop to marshmallow, with the exception of the home button, which works now. I'd usually buy Google Nexus phones, but i wanted to see if this one was worth the hype (IT IS). it's got great hardware that rivals or surpasses industry flagships in this field.  5 Stars!!
