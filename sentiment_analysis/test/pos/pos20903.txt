Have been using Game Golf for about 6 months.  Very pleased with my purchase.  The GPS isn't always perfect, and will always require editing after a round.  However, I find that I can easily edit a round in under 5 minutes.  Typically 2-3 minutes, much shorter than the 20 minutes reported in some commercial reviews.  The biggest issue is remembering to tag a club.  Of course, I have tagged a shot then decided to change clubs after, so you would need to make a mental note to change the club later in review.  Note:  I have never had a round (out of about 30 rounds) that I properly tagged every shot.  The syncing is very easy, and the web interface and statistics has consistently improved over the last few months.  I strongly recommend this product if you are interesting in tracking your actual shot distance and finding out where your misses with each club are.  I am a very data-driven person, and this is a great tool if you are looking to analyze your game.
