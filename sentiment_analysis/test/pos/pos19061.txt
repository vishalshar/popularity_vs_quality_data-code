I bought this item to use it with my camera bags when I am in restaurants or out in the field. It allows me to hang the bags off the edge of a table in a restaurant or on a limb or ledge when I am out taking photographs. Especially handy when the ground is wet soas to protect my equipment from mud and moisture. Well thought-out design and Quality Construction. I love things that work!
