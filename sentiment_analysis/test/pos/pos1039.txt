I hate to admit that I was being outsmarted by a mouse, but this seemed to be the case. He ignored the baited trap, and when I placed a piece of the cookie he loved dangerously close to the trap, he moved it across the shelf to a safer place, and left me some remains.The very night I placed the Rodent Zapper in his spot, I got him!Breathing a grateful sigh of relief.
