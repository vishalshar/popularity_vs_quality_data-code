I can't love this enough.  Sure, it's cheaply made but it works and it's so much fun for my girls.  They are 6 and 4.  They LOVE checking it everyday.  They start sprouting fast, so it keeps their attention.  I hope the flowers actually bloom :) it's not really a fairy garden to play with.  It's pretty much just a garden to watch and learn how they grow.  I would buy again.  :)
