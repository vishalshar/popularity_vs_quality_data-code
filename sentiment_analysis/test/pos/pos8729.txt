I own it. Just bought it for my iMac 27" (late 2013).  I received this morning.  Moved 37GB of Hi Def in 5 minutes!  BlackMagic Speed Test is showing a 3x read speed (faster) than the iMac's 7200 RPM Hard Drive.  Small.  Definitely pocket size.  Recommend getting an extension USB3.0 cable to use with desktops.Very Happy with it.  Going to use it for reading my iTunes Media for ATV3 and others.
