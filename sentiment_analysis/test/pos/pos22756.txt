I really like the Trophy Skin LED system.  I tried the Baby Quasar and it was such a hassle.  I would have to sit in front of a mirror and hold the wand up against my face.  It literally took forever to get a treatment in.  Eventually, due to the discomfort in my hand, wrist, and elbows, and muscle cramping, I stopped using it all together and place the blue and red Baby Quasar in my nightstand, never to see the light of day again and I completely forgot about it.  Then one day, I was purging out 'stuff' from my house doing some 'spring cleaning' and I came across the Baby Quasars and threw them in the trash.  I'd rather have a nice clean empty drawer in my nightstand than a constant reminder of something that works, but is very inconvenient.Then, my twin brother mentioned this device and bought one and tried it and swore by the results.  Of course being twins, I could not let my twin brother use the device and prevent aging while I continue to look older.  That was just not going to happen.  So I upped my twin brother and instead of buying just one, I bought two (it was $199 each when I bought it and now it is $399/each...so I'm thankful to the Lord that I bought it on the dip...LOL).To make a long story short, I had this fine wrinkle on my forehead over my right eye.  My twin brother says that when I talk, that muscle is very expressive.  I try not to raise my right eyebrow, but it is hard to concentrate on not doing that.  As a result of using the Red MD, that fine line has either diminished significantly or disappeared.In addition, I do use Retin A, eat only organic foods, do not eat meat/dairy/sugar/wheat/processed foods/junk foods.  I don't smoke or drink alcohol and I wear sunscreen judiciously.  Also, exercising 3x/week helps to keep me in good health.  Even with all that being said, the most age reversing results that I have seen has been with the RED MD.  So I do strongly recommend it, although I do not know why the price went from $199 to $399.  I suspect that due to all of the 5 star reviews, the makers of the RED MD said, 'Hey, this product really works and because it REALLY works, we can charge more.'  That is pure speculation on my part; however, the product does effectively work.If you can afford to get two RED MD lamps, I do recommend purchasing two for more coverage.  However, if you can only afford one, just buy one.  What I really like about this product is that you do NOT have to continually get dressed, drive, park your car, enter the spa, wait for availability of the LED light, have your treatment, pay up at the front desk, schedule your appointment when you have time, walk out of the spa, get in your car, drive home with all those stop lights and people on the road cutting you off, park your car at home, get into your house, change out of your clothes...etc.  That is just so much hassle for busy people to do.  In addition, you have to go during regular business hours from 9-5 PM Monday through Fridays (maybe some salons are open on Saturday).  Regardless, having the device at home is so much more convenient.I lay down on the bed horizontally and place the two RED MD on a nightstand I purchased from Target.  The nightstand in placed close to the SIDE of the bed touching the bed.  Then, I put a pillow on the nightstand so that my head can rest on the nightstand/pillow combination.  I put the goggles on (I put some white electric tape over the holes so that there is a reduction of red light coming through the goggles).  Sometimes, I will put on my iTunes 'Pacific Ocean Sounds' in the background and just take a few deep breaths and relax.  My treatments are convenient and relaxing (very much like meditating).  I have been known to fall asleep and take long naps while under the lamp (greater than 20 minutes) with no major adverse side effects.However, I did notice that sometimes my skin and neck does get dry from using the RED MD light therapy but I suspect it is because I lay under the lamps for 2 sometimes even 3 hours (napping/sleeping).  Nevertheless, a good organic lotion (EveryDay Shea Butter in Vanilla from Whole Foods Market works splendid) and an exfoliating pad (Target Up Brand Exfoliating Pads) takes care of that nicely.I know this is a long review but my twin brother and I recommend this device wholeheartedly.  My twin brother ended up buying another RED MD lamp as well once he found out that I purchased two.  He also bought his for $199 so we joke that we both bought our lamps on the 'dip.'In conclusion, this RED MD light therapy lamp gets a GREEN light!!!That's all for now
