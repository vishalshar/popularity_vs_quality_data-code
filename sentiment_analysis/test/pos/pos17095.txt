All my cats like the flavor.  I think one of my cats has a carrageenan allergy, and this does not have carrageenan.  I switched to non-carrageenan about 3 months ago because my cats were vomiting a lot, and the one guy I mentioned before was having really bad diarrhea. I had taken him to the vet, and taken a stool sample to rule out paracites, even though he is indoors only. The vet suggested food allergies and an elimination diet. They were already getting good quality foods, but I cut out various types of proteins, carbs, I tried halo, blue limited ingredient, evo, innova, dick van patten, etc. Finally I went to Instinct Limited Ingredient Turkey (which is my kitties favorite) and the diarrhea stopped right away, and the vomiting was greatly reduced (you know, to normal kitty amounts). I saw it did not have carrageenan, and also found Solid Gold to be carrageenan free, so I added those to the mix. Solid Gold Mackerel & Tuna, SG Sardine & Tuna, SG Sea Bream & Tuna, etc were all fine. However, I stupidly ordered the Solid Gold July Morning without reading the ingredients, because all the other Solid Gold I had read were fine, and he got really sick and had vomiting and diarrhea right away (at the same time) poor guy! Well, obviously that recipe did have carrageenan, so, keep that in mind when picking out flavors if your kitty is also sensitive to carrageenan.The seller was good and shipping was fast.
