I bought this for my husband for Christmas (he's not really keen on wearing things on his wrists, so a standard FitBit type of thing wasn't of interest for him). The sensors work really well and seem very accurate!Since he loved his so much he bought a second "pill" to put on my pillow and we are able to connect them both to the same Sense, but can each see our information on our own phones. Very useful and very cool! I love that it tracks your info and can give you an average for a week or so. It's great to see a history of my sleep habits.Since the Pill just snaps onto your pillow (it says now to use on a temper pedic pillow, which we both have, but I honestly haven't found any issues with it and it seems to feel our movements just fine) it doesn't get in the way at all (I don't even notice it!).I would definitely recommend this product to anyone wanting more information about their bodies and sleep habits!
