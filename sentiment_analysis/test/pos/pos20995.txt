I was initially considering the iHome Smart Plug but decided against it because I didn't think it was necessary to spend $50 for each one and couldn't have multiple users. So, I already have other GE+Quirky items in my home and this product naturally fits in with my other products. Works flawlessly and will get another one soon.
