UPDATE BELOWOriginal post: Searched long and hard for something that would hold my 6s Plus without shaking and didn't have to be attached to the window. I didn't mind paying double the price of a typical mobile phone holder for the features I was looking for. It was a little bigger than I expected. The directions weren't that great. To install it, I had to "score" it with an Exacto knife (dangerous on such a small, wobbly item) on the outside of the L-shaped part that sticks to the dash. It turned the edge white when I wiggled the extra piece off.  Not the end of the world but I do notice it.  Unfortunately it came apart within I few short weeks--just after the return date. I will gladly update my 2 star rating if Gravity X will replace the part that broke--I love the product! It would be great if the company would include two mounts--a flat one and the L-shaped one in the package. Every car and mounting location is different so just don't know which you will need until you go to install it. I didn't happen to lose a finger in the scoring process but I think it would be best for all if no blade was necessary to mount the product.  Especially since it has to be under $1 to add a flat mount option for the user.***I will update my review if I hear back from Gravity X***UPDATE: even though I bought directly from Amazon and GravityX didn't have proof that I bought their product, they still replaced the item for free (and gave me an additional item--a "Goog Lite" key finder--for my trouble). Thank you GravityX! I love the product and am excited to have it in my car. It's so much better looking than most of what's on the market and I love that it doesn't have to be attached to the window. 5 stars for customer service.  Buyers: if you have a flat area to mount to, skip cutting the L-shaped mount altogether and just stick the holder directly to the dash. It seems the packaging has been updated to now suggest that--if the surface is completely flat. Highly recommend that option!
