I've bought several USB chargers in the past year, as I rely more and more on devices that need charging. This is the first one that works reliably. I am very happy with it. As I write this it's charging a smartphone, a backup battery, and an iPad, and it just got done with a tablet and an iPhone. I no longer run out of ports, I don't have to look carefully to make sure I'm using one with proper current capability, and everything I plug into it gets charged quickly and reliably. What's not to like?
