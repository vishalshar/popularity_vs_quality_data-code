Update : June 2016 :  I wanted to update the review as I have good and bad.  My mom unfortunately had to use her device after a fall.  A friend used it to alert 5 STAR who gave good instruction and also sent first responders quickly.  The bad is this.  I did not get a a call from 5 STAR telling me that it had been activated.  I only found out upon reading a text that it had been used.  And the time stamp on the alert was almost 5 hours off the actual time of the alert.  I have called Great CAll to figure out the issue and they assured me they would call me back within 5 business days.  That was 3 weeks ago.  No call, nothing.  There is a also a known issue with the Splash Device and GPS that shows the device moving locations when it has not moved.  Fo example, it alerted me that my mom one day was 'out and about' (code for she left her house).  and showed a location she NEVER WENT TO!  Great call told me it's a 'known issue'.  No communications from them to owners of this at all.  So now I'm not sure if it's accurate when it tells me where mom is traveling.  A real issue in my eyes. If they cannot get this fixed, I will cancel and find another service.  I am torn b/c when she used it for a true emergency it worked.  Can I count on it 100%to be right?  no.I bought this device for my aging mother who is 77 and lives on her own.  She is overall healthy, however I am worried if she falls ill, or falls she may not be able to get help.  The set up was very easy.  I did it all on-line and then did a test call to ensure it was working.  I bought the full package which is 34.99/ month to include all the services including fall detection.  To use that you have to use the special lanyard that is mailed to you later.  I have not tested that.  The device is about the size of  a pager or a small cell phone.  So not discrete when mom has to wear it around her neck.  And I encourage he to do that, it does no good to have in a purse.  I am disappointed in the duration is holds a charge.  I saw mixed reviews on this and it ends up being 1 day.  So diligence to charge it is important.  I set myself and 2 sisters up on the app to track the GPS and get alerts.  Which I really like, so I can quickly know if mom contacts 5 STAR.  And if she is out and about.  She jokes that I am now watching her, and I reinforce that it's for her protection and support.  I would recommend, it's very easy with ONE button.  It's just bigger than I would like and I would like to see a much smaller device that someone would not notice is on them.
