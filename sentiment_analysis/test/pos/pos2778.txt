I saw a negative review that talked about these filters, saying that the color made them unusable and unable to color grade. That review almost made me not purchase these. But I figured, for the low cost, it was worth a shot. I am SO Glad I did not listen to the negative review and bought these filters! I used the ND16 (4-Stop Filter) on the Typhoon H for a scene we shot for a movie project. I can't upload the clip just yet, however, the scene will be in the trailer for the movie. Once the trailer has cleared for public releases, I will upload the clip that was shot with the filter. I am VERY pleased with the overall look that can be accomplished with these filters and yes, the clip that I will upload was in fact color graded.
