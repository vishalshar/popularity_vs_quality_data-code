What an amazing electric vehicle!!!  It's lightweight, portable and gets me quickly to wherever I want to go in the City without the hassles of traffic, gas or parking.  It folds and unfolds in literally one second.  You sit down, turn the throttle and off you go!  The ride is super-comfortable.  The battery lasts me many days of use (something like 20 miles).  When it needs a charge, I just plug the battery into a regular socket and in less than four hours it's fully charged.  My hat is off to URB-E for coming up with such an innovative product.I can't get over the quality of this thing.  I think consumers have gotten very cynical about low-quality products manufactured overseas.  What drew me to URB-E is that it is made in Pasadena, California.  That fact alone told me these guys care deeply about quality and not about finding the lowest-cost producer in some far-away country who cares not one bit about consumer experience or frustration.  I am the type willing to pay more for a product that will last a lifetime.  Frankly, if you are even thinking about purchasing an electric vehicle made overseas, my advice is to stop your search and just purchase an URB-E.  I've searched high and low, and there is nothing in the market that is this good.This vehicle exudes quality the moment you take it out of the box.  It's a stunning work of art.  Aircraft aluminum, carbon fiber, sport-tuned throttle, rear-disc brakes, seat shock absorption system, etc., etc.  The lines are all clean and the assembly is immaculate.  It feels incredibly strong and durable.  Not only is this beautifully designed, but there is some serious engineering talent that went into this product.The proof, of course, is in the riding.  I've ridden my URB-E practically everywhere for many months.  NOT A SINGLE PROBLEM.  I've ridden over curbs, through puddles, maybe pushed it farther than a normal rider should.  AND STILL NOT A SINGLE PROBLEM.  The acceleration is super quick from a standing start, the ride is as smooth as butter, and the vehicle can stop on a dime.  Quiet and effortless.  What more could I ask for from a personal electric vehicle?Maybe the biggest problem is that wherever I go with my URB-E, folks gather.  They can't help themselves.  It just draws a crowd.  When I let them test-ride it, their eyes grow big and they can't believe this thing exists.  The next question from them, of course, is where to get one.  It's been fun being one of the first people to own one, but I think the secret is getting out very quickly.  One of my nephews texted me the other day that he saw one zipping by in Penn Station in Manhattan.  I guess they soon will be everywhere.In any event, these guys have totally won me over with the innovation, quality and attention to detail that shines throughout the URB-E.  I'm now a lifelong fan of this company and anything they produce.  This is the way products should be made.  Thank you, URB-E!!!
