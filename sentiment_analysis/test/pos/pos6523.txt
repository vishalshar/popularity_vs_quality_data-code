I own one of these for the Macbook Air I just replaced with a new Macbook 12in. I bought an Acme Made sleeve for the new laptop for two reasons:1. I have had the Macbook Air case for roughly 6 years and it has held up amazingly well. The material is easy to clean and wipes off smooth if you spill on it, so mine has no real blemishes or stains even after all this time. The elastic also does not stretch out over time. In addition, the only visible wear on the old case is one of the edges started to develop a small tear over time. But the tear stayed localized and did not make the case any less effective (you can see it in the attached photo).2. The design is, in my opinion, pretty much perfect. Cases with a flap that folds over are kind of annoying. That this has just the elastic strip means that I have the option to leave the strip off to make the laptop accessible from inside my bag. I can pull it out without taking the case out with it. That's a small thing in a way, but it has come in handy many, many times. I should note that the laptop fits very snugly in the case, so unless you're getting wild out there, the laptop will stay in the case even if you don't pull the elastic strip over the top.This is a simple product, but well-designed and constructed of good materials. And for those who (like me) hate the feel of neoprene, this case offers the same sort of sleek coverage as neoprene but is smooth to the touch. If I could change anything, it would be the style options. I wish this case came in a leather or vegan leather option for those that prefer a more "professional" look. I don't love paying $40 for a laptop case, and there are a lot of cheaper options out there. But this is one instance where you really do get what you pay for.I attached a photo of my old case, which hasn't been wiped clean in a long time, to show how well it held up.
