Pretty impressive combination of technology. Purchased as gift for my 5 year old and he LOVES it.Very easy to assemble and very user friendly in that area.So far has been glitch free though only a few days of steady use.Impressive speed and performance considering it is a slotless trackWill update if satisfaction falters but so far it is well worth 5 stars!!
