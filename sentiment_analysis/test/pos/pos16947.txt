I am not a tech savvy person but it was easy to set it up. I think the font on the manual is small but we did follow the app instructions. I bought this because my son has allergy to our dog so hopefully it helps with that. So far I am happy with it. I do not use so many of the features like speakers but they are pretty descent. I was able to add 5 family members to see the data on the app and that is very good. It also does not have any extra fee for storage or things like that.
