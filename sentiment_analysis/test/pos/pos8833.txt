I rarely do this,  but I am an Amazon junkie, and sometimes some products and/or companies deserve a good review. This is one of them. They even sent a follow up email asking if I had any questions/concerns! No, really though, awesome invention. Clearly, they must have had an issue with the keychain part of it coming off, but that was resolved. The thing is robust/sturdy/tiny. Exactly what you would want. People say to me "well where's the cord?" And to that I said - a usb outlet is more common than a recriprocal these days! Shoot I was playing poker not long ago, phone died, and the poker table had a usb outlet! At the end of the day, it's more an emergency situation type charger, not your everyday charger. But the device is perfectly capable of being your all the time everyday charger as well. It kicks butt man!
