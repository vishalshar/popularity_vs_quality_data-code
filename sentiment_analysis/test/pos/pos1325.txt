I think this is a great toy for kids.I bought this with high expectations for coding experiments and It's really cute and fun for the first couple of minutes and then in get repetitive.Also they have been doing a great MKT campaign and although is a fun toy, it is doesn't really have the level of autonomy and AI presented on the commercials.
