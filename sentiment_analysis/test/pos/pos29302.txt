I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 7 year old grandson. He opened it at my house Christmas morning and his Dad set up the app on his iPhone. He took off with it like he had never seen anything like it in his life. Now I have not seen him since Christmas but will see him this coming Monday. I am sure it will have a prominent place in his room. It really is an adorable little toy. Not inexpensive, but I like to get him something I know he will like every year. I would highly recommend this toy for any youngsters you have who are into robots. He has cute little squeaks and sounds that are not irritating or loud. My grandson was quite adept at directing him with the phone.
