Love it, but price prevents me from buying more.  $7.00 for a molded plastic lid is steep.  I use it for dry catfood (small pellets) and for oatmeal I add to yogurt.  I have not tried liquids in it.  It has a rubber seal inside it which looks decent enough -- not sure why it doesn't seal for some people.  It is nice, and I would buy more if they were about half the price.
