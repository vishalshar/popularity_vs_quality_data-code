Frankly exceeded my expectations - when I first saw this, I wondered how real it would be vs just a gadget who's luster would wear off after a short time.  Well, they did a great job blending good tech with solid quality and functionality.  This is well-made and solid.  Having the power option is very convenient and the self-weighing and GPS locator features work great.  My only minor glitch was at first it told me I was leaving it behind while it sat next to me, but a restart of the app cured that problem.  This is probably still a little gadgety for the average traveler, but if you travel a lot and use a lot of tech when you travel, you'll be delighted with this case.
