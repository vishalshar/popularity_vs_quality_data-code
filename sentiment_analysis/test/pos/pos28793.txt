Observation:Upper reservoir takes close to 300ml.The dripping part is a white plastic bit separate from the top reservoir. I thought it is a one piece design. That's kind of a plus, since if the dripping part is clogged or drip too fast, they can have a replacement part for that.The coffee ground basket can hold a lot of ground, but that's not really needed since the top reservoir is just about 300 ml. When the top reservoir is completely emptied into the bottom coffee cup, the water line in the bottom will almost touch the bottom of the coffee basket, so you can't really add more water to the top reservoir to make more coffee. It has markings for 20g, 30g and 40g of coffee but I doubt it's usefulness. The 40g line is at half the height of the basket, so there is a lot of empty space above the ground.The fineness of the filter looks similar to Able Brewing Disk (non-fine version), which might mean there will be a lot of fine grounds in the coffee, so I applied the paper filter on top of the stainless steel filter and then screwed the filter onto the basket.Usage:I prewetted the grounds completely with cold water from watercooler, then placed another piece of filter paper on top, added water to the top reservoir and let it start dripping. During the process, the drip stopped once. I shook the reservoir a bit as it seems to be a little air bubble on the dripper bit causing it, and unscrewed the cap and reservoir even looser, and it started dripping normally.As it is a slow process, the coffee didn't mix and came out with a nice looking gradient in color. I shook the cup and the coffee mixed into a dark color. It tastes good, and after diluting it a bit(probably 1.5:1 coffee:water) it tastes even sweeter.Comments:It is pretty difficult to clean up the grounds. For Aeropress, one can just push the plunger to get everything out; for pourover, one can take out the filter with the used ground, but for this one coffee ground sticks onto the basket. You have to dig out all the coffee ground and take it to a sink to clean it up. A basket-shaped filter may make it easier but I'm not sure which size will fit.The filter is really expensive. You can get two packs of 350 Aeropress filters at $9.51, while one pack of 50 dripo filters is $4.95. The Aeropress one is just a little bit larger than the dripo one, about 3mm larger radius.Also, the round paper filter doesn't cover the top of the coffee ground completely, and water mainly pass through the center of the round filter, so probably some of the coffee ground isn't fully extracted. It might be better to have a narrower basket(smaller radius)  so all the ground is fully spent.As others have said, the cap tends to accumulate liquid. Not sure if the lid is watertight, as when I shook the reservoir to get it dripping, water seems to have leaked from the small venting hole. But the rubber pad seems to cover the venting hole too.
