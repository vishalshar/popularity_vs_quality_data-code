I eat minimal meat, lots of plants and vegetables. When I do eat eggs or meat I only do humanely handled or nothing. I recommend this product. I was on the lookout for this rare product.... Jerky that is conscious. I live in New Hampshire. I hike and snow shoe and like to store for emergencies... That's an over share but I really like and will buy again and again. It tastes great. It's juicy, not dry....I'm very picky, most jerky is gross. Thank you for this. You need to be top sellers because this is everything I've been looking for...have the jerky & eat it to.
