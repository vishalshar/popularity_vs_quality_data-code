I cannot say enough about this product or its inventor/owners. We adopted a cat from the pound who was diagnosed with IBD. Part of our journey in making her well was finding a way to feed her five small meals a day. I needed something cat-proof, dependable, and technologically current. This was the answer. I was so excited when it arrived, but in the way nice relationships often happen, my unit didn't work and I had to call for help. Alex (the CEO) quickly realized the problem was not on my end and they fedexed me a new unit. He could not have been nicer, more helpful, more honest.( his wife is exactly the same way!)This unit quickly changed our cat's life and our lives as well (since you might imagine feeding five times on a 24 hour schedule would be challenging) and after the first night our Audrey recognized the sound of the unit turning and would jump off the bed for her wee hour feedings. We have also (I know, pathetic) checked on her with our iPhones through the camera function when we were out and about and needed to set up daytime feeds. Besides some minor meds, this unit has contributed to the well being of our pet. She has now gone a year with no issues.I think that products are often invented by folks who have a true love and passion for something so they feel that "lack" greater than the rest of us. One of the nicest parts for me is knowing that not only do I have technical people behind the Feed and Go, I also have folks with a real love for animals. I see the results of that in my beloved pet every day.thanks Alex and Marissa!
