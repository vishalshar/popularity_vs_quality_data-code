The bulb itself works great.  The software to control it needs some work.  I was replacing a similar spec. led bulb with this one and their wasn't any difference in brightness.  Without sacrificing performance this bulb offers the ability to change colors to virtually any color that you can think of.  You can also dim the bulb from the software or by using Amazon Echo.  Its compatibility with the Echo is the main reason I wanted this bulb.  I like a bulb in the 5000-6000k color range which gives off a pure white light.  My wife likes the it to be in the 2500-3000k color range.  She thinks that it gives off a more homey look.  This bulb has the ability to adjust that range to whatever suits your needs.  It can be changed easily with the software but it's even easier with the Echos voice control.  We both get our way as long as we are not in the room at the same time.  I took a star off because the software makes this bulb harder than it should be to set up.  The app has a place to click to create your account.  The only problem is this doesn't work.  I had to go to the website to create my account and then log in to the app.  Once that was done the main problem I had was that the bulb sees my 5ghz wifi network.  I tried to choose it and it goes through the process and acts like it connects but it never would let me set up the bulb.  When I decided to try the 2.4ghz network it connected and almost everything else went smoothly.  If you want to connect to the bulb from outside your home or use it with 3rd party software to control it like the Echo you have to connect the bulb to LIFX cloud server.  Sounds easy right?  Well there is a button to push to do this but it kept timing out on me.  With enough persistence it will finally connect.  It took me about an hour to get it connected to the cloud.  I didn't do anything different other than keep trying.  All and all with the wifi issues early on and the initial setup and then the problems connecting it to the cloud it took about 2 hours to get this bulb up and going like I wanted it.  With that said I would buy this again.  I don't think it would be near the headache on my second time around.
