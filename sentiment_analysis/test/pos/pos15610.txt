First, you need to determine (trial and error) what nutrients your body best functions during your workout.  I'm a cyclist, my daughter is a swimmer.  We have discovered that we both better during our workouts with nutritional drinks higher in potassium (+ 200 mg), and less with the sodium (salts). I have friends/cyclists who prefer higher salt concentrations.  We go through a lot of fluids, and Glukos has been the the most economical and meets our needs.  My only recommendation is to test how concentration you want to mix into your drink.  Glukos provides a large dispenser that encourages you to use a large amount of powder, and I found it "too much." I have nearly cut it in half from it's recommended mixture.  For me, I found it more effective to drink more fluids at less concentration, than to use higher concentrations.
