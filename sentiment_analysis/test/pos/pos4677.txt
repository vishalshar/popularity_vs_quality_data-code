Love this drone its super easy to fly. I was able to install the app on my fire Tablet and it work fine.  Just downloand ehang apk file and install.I have not tried the avatar mode on the fire tablet.  I am not sure if it would work if the tablet doesnt have internet.  I think i read so ewhere the gps will not work. I dont know yet. ...Although i already knew thwre was no live feed unless you buy the goggles, i am kind upset, because i feel like there has to be anotber way to get live feed. I just want a cheaper alternative .This drone has to be the best bang for the money.
