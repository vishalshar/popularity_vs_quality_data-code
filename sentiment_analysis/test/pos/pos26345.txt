This is an amazing little gadget. The developers really took their time designing this thing because it's just the right size to be portable but also feels sturdy enough to know that it will last for a long time. I'm really pleased with he purchase as it works very well with my Android device.The unit comes also with all the wires you will ever need to use like Micro USB, HDMI, etc. and also a mini remote to operate the Cube.I recommend this unit highly to anyone looking for a compact projector that you can use on the go or for trips.
