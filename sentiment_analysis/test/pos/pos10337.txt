I am traveling the world for 11 months and researched towels extensively - this one is excellent.  The material is much nicer than another other travel towel I have used, it doesn't absorb much odor at all, it drys me off quickly and it drys quickly - in an hour I am ready to put it in my pack.  I got the XL and it takes up a little room.  My husband got the traditional pack towel that folds up nice and small but it smells and the material is not as nice.
