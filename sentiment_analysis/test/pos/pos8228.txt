Bottom line...the 3DR Solo needs to be a bit more off the ground and these do the trick.  They provide more protection for the camera when landing on ground with rock or other items that might protrude up toward the camera. Cost is a little high for four small pieces of plastic but these work and seemed to be the best option.
