IÂ’m so excited to find Saltnets on Amazon! I bought one last winter on the grommet and I was surprised to find that it worked. The mat melted the snow underneath it and melted fresh snow that landed on it. It kept my entryway cleaner and my doorstep clear of snow!I bought a second one to put on my back porch to reduce the amount of snow tracked in by my dog. He would sit by the back door in the snow and tracked it in. Now I no longer have to worry about a huge mess!
