Yes it can be choppy even on 4G full bars. There's a delay anywhere from 5-25 seconds. What I love is being able to talk to dierks. He's figured out where my voice is coming from, I love the way he cocks his head in anticipation for his treat. Pretty sweet to be at work and tell him to sit and then reward him with a treat :)  The room lighting plays a significant role in the  crispness of the image. Set up is easy. Simply download the app and follow the instructions. The power cord is maybe 4 feet. I have it placed on a dresser in the room Dierks hangs out in all day so he can watch the street for my car.The milk bones are mini, as in the size of tip of your index finger from the knuckle to the tip. Since dierks is a prize snob, I found cutting his petite greenies into slices the same size, I get about 6 nibbles and they dispense just fine.
