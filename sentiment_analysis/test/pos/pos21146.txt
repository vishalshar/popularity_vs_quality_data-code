ive been on Soylent since October 2015.  I love the stuffOkay, so what is Soylent?  For one It's not a weight loss drink.  It is a meal replacer drink.  Each drink is 400 calories and contains 20% of all your required nutrients for a day.It taste like almond milk.One in the morning and one around 1pm holds me off until I get home around 5:30pm.  That's 800 caloriesIt's so incredibly convenient, I don't have to think about breakfast or lunch 80% of the time.  I just grab a cold one from the fridge and drink.Plus, ever get those random cravings and no matter what you eat you're still hungry?  When ever I feel that I drink a Soylent and what ever nutrient my body was craving Soylent has and the craving goes away.I use to eat like crap before Soylent. Frozen TV dinners, fast food all the time.  Now usually dinner is my only non Soylent meal.Again I want to stress Soylent isn't a miracle, drinking it isn't going to have you shed pounds.  However you will most likely feel more alert and better (I pegged myself at about 15% better)You can use it to monitor your calorie intake easier and through calorie management lose weight,but that isn't Soylent causing you to lose weight it's strictly the fact you're counting calories.
