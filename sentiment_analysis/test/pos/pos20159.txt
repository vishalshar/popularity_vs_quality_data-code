First off, I love the design. Anytime I bring this out, people comment on how cool the design is. The sound quality is perfect for a small (relatively inexpensive) portable speaker. It's as loud as you'd ever want it to be, and has a decent amount of bass for a small speaker. I like how you can skip songs by holding the 'arrow' buttons, or change the volume by tapping them. The battery has never run out on me after long stretches of use. I also like how it comes with a small aux cable if you want to plug in, instead of using bluetooth. It's also pretty tough and waterproof (or resistant?), though I haven't really tested this feature. Highly recommended for anyone looking to buy a portable speaker.
