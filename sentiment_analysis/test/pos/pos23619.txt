I love that these butter just contain the basic ingredients, nuts and salt, though the cashew butter has some sunflower oil It is pricey but a quality product. Each flavor is a little different but good in its own way.  The cashew is mild and creamy, the almond butter is a little nutty and has more bits, and the combo butter is a little of both.  Its a thinner consistency than normal peanut butter, but that makes them easier to spread and dip. The 3-pack is a good way to test and see which ones you prefer too.On a side note my 2.5 year old twins liked it and they do not like much.
