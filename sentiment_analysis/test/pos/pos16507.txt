System works as advertised.  It puts a great creamy head on your beer and increases aroma.  It's very close to a nitro beer but not quite.  It works great on the more complex, sweeter and darker beers.  It's a waste on your everyday grocery store beer.  I will buy the smaller version when it comes out.  Only gave it 4 stars because the tap handle is extremely cheap and falls of continually, I've just stopped using it.
