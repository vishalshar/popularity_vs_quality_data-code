I have been looking at Android Tv sticks for a few months....I have read reviews of this item and decided to take a chance since the cost was not much different than a comparable Android TV Stick.Very pleased with this item. It is by no means a high powered mini computer but to surf the web, stream music, and do light office work it is perfect. My biggest recommendation to anyone looking at this item is to fully understand what it is and what it is not. If you expectations are set correctly I think you will be very pleased with this product.
