This thing is awesome, it was easy to pair to my Wi-Fi and the app is easy to use on my phone. I can unplug it from the wall and move it to another outlet and it hooks back up to Wi-FI in a short time. The best part is when it detects motion it notifies me within a few seconds on my Android phone. I tested it with wifi turned off on the phone and it notified me just as fast. I havent tried this but it can trigger other Dlink devices to do things as well using the Dlink home app. I have several Dlink cameras and am planning to have it trigger recording on one of them that covers the building where the motion sensor is inside. Since that camera is in another building looking out a window its internal motion detection wont work but with this device it will. I also might try the wifi siren that they have, it can also be triggered by this device. I have only had it one day but I am very impressed so far.
