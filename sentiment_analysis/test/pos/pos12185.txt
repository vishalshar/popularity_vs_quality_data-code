I purchased the black mesh fine tooth version of this comb.  I wouldn't mind the teeth being a little more fine but its worked great thus far as is. I use this for my beard which is about 2 inches long.  It works great.  I have no issues with it snagging or pulling my hair.  It fits great in my wallet and its so light and thin I don't notice its there.  Despite being so thin its quite sturdy and strong.  If you are looking for a small light weight beard comb I would recommend giving this a try.
