I saw some reviews on this and decided to get this for my 11 year old son.  He likes race tracks, but traditional slot racers kept breaking or dying after a few months.  The Anki Overdrive is a different approach to race sets, but connecting the race experience to a mobile device.  First thing I noticed is the packaging is very good, reminded me of Apple in its design and execution.  Putting the track together couldn't be easier.  The track pieces fit right together and stay connected through magnet.  Gone are the days of broken plastic connectors that are typical of slot tracks.  We first setup our track in the standard oval and circle style.  It took us just a few mins to have the track together and ready to go.  We downloaded the application onto our Apple mobile devices, setup a race, and raced the two cars against each other.  The mobile app is mostly intuitive if you are familiar with mobile gaming and setting up a connection between devices.To start the race the cars go around the track to learn the track shape, and after 2 times around the track the cars stop right at the starting line with no user intervention, pretty cool.  It takes a little while to understand how the race works.  The cars pretty much go around on their own, although you can change lanes by tilting your mobile device.  The key to the race is the weapons piece, which allows you to stop or slow down your opponent.  The race is less about going full speed as it is about using your weapons to disable or slow down your opponent.  The track and cars work very well, only once or twice did a car come off the track.  The cars charge very quickly and the battery last long enough not to be a distraction to the game.The starter kit is just that, it comes with limited track pieces that are enough to make the oval and circle track and several other combinations.  For the price, compared to cheap slot tracks, the Anki is a good value.  Where the price struggles, in my opinion, is in additional track pieces, and cars.  An additional car is fifty dollars, and the track piece sets start at twenty.  These type of things can add up quickly and can reduce the value of the product.  Outside of the high price for additional track pieces and cars, the Anki Overdrive is a nice innovative product that my son enjoys.
