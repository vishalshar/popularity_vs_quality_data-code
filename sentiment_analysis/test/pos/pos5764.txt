Works AS STATED.  Takes my iphone 6 up to about 45-50% in about 30 minutes.  It's only supposed to throw enough of a charge on the phone to get to a charger without getting in the way.  Small portable & effective. You want a full charge, get a bigger external battery & drag around a brick.  Fits nicely in the phone wallet I use.  Nice not having to mess around trying to find ways to haul around cables.  I have other bigger external batteries, like Mophie, that I use when carrying a case or bag when I know I will be away from a charger for extended period.  This is truly an emergency life saver. Got one for my girl friend & she loves it. They go everywhere with us.
