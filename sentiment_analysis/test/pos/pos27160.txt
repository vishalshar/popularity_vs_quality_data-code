I love these lids!  There's a size and shape for every type of microwave-safe container.Instead of using paper towels or wax paper to cover my food when heating (or reheating) in my microwave, I just plop one of these covers over the top of the container. The food heats up very quickly. In fact, the container and food get VERY hot - watch when removing the lid for escaping steam.Another benefit - there is way much less spillage or splattering in the microwave to clean up.AND, the lids are very easy to clean either by hand or in my dishwasher (they are well-made).Finally, they make great gifts for friends or relatives (think bridal showers, birthdays, hostess gifts, etc.). I highly recommend.
