For the newly-launched product, it's great and very cost-effective. I have three separate solar arrays (2 on Enphase and 1 non-standard and not monitored), so it was really important for me to see entire renewable production vs. my house's consumption in real time. This has been accomplished though not with revenue-grade accuracy.The electricians had fun installing it though CURB's weekend telephone support was needed but it turned out to be helpful and, most importantly, available.The app is OK, the site a bit better but lots of data analysis (like daily totals?) should be added. The projected weekly cost of electricity for each circuit should really be changed to current consumption reflected in Watts.EDIT 9/18/2016: The Watts have been added (though not set as default) and the weekly email summaries (showing, production breakdown vs. total production) have been coming to my inbox lately. These are great improvements!I know the company is working on development of a useful API which would be great to integrate with other services, specifically PV Output in my case.Again, it's a great affordable product that's highly useful now but I can't wait for it to get even better.
