Monitoring BP is a very important task for a lot of people but the best that was available prior to this was a device that would store the information internally or required some connection to a computer.Not sure why it took so long for someone to develop a wifi based device that can be used anywhere in the house (or even on another network or stored when not connected to a network).  Once connected it uploads the information to an app that you can share with your health care providers to provide a much more useful record of this vital information.Very well done and very easy to use.
