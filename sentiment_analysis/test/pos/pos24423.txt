My dogs got out of our fenced yard a while back and since then I have been looking at ways to prevent the panic of a lost dog situation from ever happening again! I found the Whistle GPS product being advertised but when I was looking to purchase, it wasnt ready for purchase yet so I waited for a while and then ended up forgetting all about it. Silly me!My dogs ended up getting out yet AGAIN about 10 days ago when the latch on our gate was not properly engaged. I immediately (after searching around for almost 2 hours to find them first) went back online to buy the device. I will admit that the reviews were less than stellar, but I also know that 99% of the time happy customers dont tend to review products and I am more guilty of this than most. I have only written 3 reviews (on Yelp) and those were all negative! I figured based on the amount of customers they must have out there that it cant be as bad as these reviews seem to state.I purchased a Whistle GPS and another pet tracker called a "POD". Before I do a small comparison between the 2 lets get some details out of the way for the Whistle since that is what this review is for. I come from an engineering background and I use GPS type products almost daily. What Whistle has done around their geofence and gps is actually pretty smart! While the dog is within the "Whistle zone" the device communicates through your LAN and to the base station. Why is that important? Battery life! As soon as you start using GPS it eats battery life so my concern about the battery life that other people have had was unwarranted, and quite frankly the products battery life is better than any other GPS device I have.The only strangeness I have seen was an erroneous alert stating that the battery was charged when in fact I had just put it on the charging station - weird! The other issue I have is that I get a lot of notifications that I simply dont need - it over communicates IMO.The other complaint I have heard which I think is important to address is that you arent getting alerted fast enough when the dog leaves the home zone. From what I can tell the system "checks in" on a timed basis. I'm not sure exactly how often it checks in but I believe that when it does, its checking in with the base station first and if that doesnt make a connection there it goes to GPS and you are alerted. I may not be 100% correct on this but I think I am close. If it communicated with GPS all the time - the battery would be dead in hours as I had mentioned before.I have taken my dog on 7 walks since using the device and tested it each time throughout the walk, each time I leave with him I get alerts that he has left the home zone, the alerts have come in anywhere from about 2min to 5min of leaving home. I hit the track function (which I believe should be easier to get to btw, its not as intuitive as I would like but once you know where it is you are good to go) and the system tracks on my phone just as I would expect. Its worked fine every single time.Here is a quick comparison between my experience of the POD and Whistle:At first glance, the POD device is nice. It's small and I like the exchangeable batteries. It was hard to get the battery on and off to charge. It was hard to get the device on the collar. It was not easy to get the rubber zip tie tightened around the collar & device.- Left home at 8:37am- Received Whistle notification that we had left his zone ~5 minutes later.- Started a tracking session, received SMS and app notifications of location with the address every 3 minutes for the next 30 minutes.- 20 minutes into the walk I hadn't received a notification from POD that we were out of his safe zone.- I tried to use the "locate" button in the app but received a notification that we could not be found.- I turned the POD off and on and tried to locate several more times. It failed every time.- on the last attempt, it did successfully locate us on the map. I did not however receive an SMS or app push notification of his location.So - I feel like this is a pretty good detail of my first positive review EVER! :) I decided to write this because I have been in a situation where my company was being hammered with some bad reviews but 9/10 people actually really liked our product. I get the sense that this is true for Whistle. Is it "PERFECT"? No, its not. Its a LOT better than people here are saying it is though. Granted, I didnt get it when it was first released so I cant speak to the initial problems they may have been having. What I can say is that it worked exactly how I would expect it work. The social aspects and activity tracking are cool features but the run-away dog problem was why I really got it. I would need to play with those features/functions more before I could really give an honest opinion.I have ordered another device for my other pooch now that I have had some time to play with the Whistle and test it. If your expectations are realistic and you have some basic understanding of how these types of devices work I cant see why you would be disappointed. I went with 4 stars over 5 because of the alerts issue I have had, first the charging one and then just the fact that I am getting more alerts than I want for things that arent important to me. If anyone from Whistle reads this PLEASE allow us to customize which alerts we want to receive!
