My grandkids, husband and I just love these.  Just the right size for lunches and snacks.  I have grandbabies from a year & 1/2 to 7 years old so I get concerned about nut allergies so these were the perfect buy.  Great crunchy little squirrel shaped cinnamon graham crackers.  Great value and although others say they don't have a great shelf life,  I disagree.  They were fresh, crunchy and flavorful when we opened each bag, expiration date not until 2017 and even after 3 months in our cabinet, I took a bag out this morning and still delicious.  Again.  Great value, great taste and in my home, grand baby, MEma and papa approved.  Will be buying more.
