These are the best tweezers I have ever used.  I originally bought these at a military supply store before I lost them.  The tip is so sharp it can pull an ingrown hair out that hasn't yet come to the service.  I highly recommend these tweezers for anything from ingrown hairs to splinters or pulling glass out.  Whatever the issue may be these seriously are the best tweezers I have ever owned.
