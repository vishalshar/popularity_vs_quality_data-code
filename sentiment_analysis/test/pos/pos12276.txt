UPDATE - I love these so much I simply had to have more of them. Tossed out some of my older socks which had thinned out, these are like walking on clouds for your feet. Shown and recommended them to several friends who were impressed by the fabric softness and knit density. No more generic store-bought socks! How long had I been missing out on these, such a nice experience!I decided, while buying new work shoes, to treat my feet to a better grade of socks than what you normally find at most places. I was having a lot of cushion issues with thin socks, as well as needing new shoes, causing hard impact during walking. I am on my feet 9-10 hours every day, so this was rather important to my comfort. These socks were the perfect choice. Soft, quality cotton knit, very nice cushion on the foot. Wore them all day at work yesterday, very comfortable, breathable, do not sweat. Simple, functional with a touch of elegance. Great for work, play or formal wear.
