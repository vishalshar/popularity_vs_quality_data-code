Amazing product. If you are into being outdoors and are rough on electronic devices then this is for you. The Fugoo is way better than the Bose mini sound link. The Bose might be louder in one direction but the Fugoo has speakers on all sides and sounds great all the way around and is still very loud. Plus it has a great interface with Siri. Not to mention that it's water proof and perfect for use on  a boat when fishing and the battery life is enough to easily last all day.
