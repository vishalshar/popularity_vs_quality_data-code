I bought this cream because I have psoriasis and although I use UVB narrow band light therapy and steroid creams, I am always in search of a good moisturizer ( a must as anyone with psoriasis knows) I have not used this product for the full 12 weeks as suggested on the bottle, but I can already tell it is both very moisturizing and gentle. I can't say that is it getting rid of my psoriasis yet, but I can say it is extremely soothing and my skin feels so much softer after using this cream,,,more so than any other moisturizer I have used....and I have tried pretty much everything out there. Plus, the moisturizing effects seem to last all day without feeling at all sticky or tacky....it soaks in nicely and I am just left with soft skin.....I will keep using it in hopes that it will also cause my psoriasis to fade ....I will write an update in a few weeks. Definitely recommend.UPDATE as of Jan 5th 2014OK, it's official....I love this product !!! I have been using the cream twice a day for almost the suggested 12 weeks and it really does help....my psoriasis is much improved... the psoriasis areas are flatter and smoother.....I still have psoriasis that is visible, but now it is really more like hyperpigmentation rather than scaly skin, if that makes sense. If you use this product, you really do have to use it twice a day and be religious about it...and above all, be patient! I don't know if the pigmented areas will disappear with even longer use, but I am hopeful that they will....either way I am really pleased with the results so far. As a side note...this cream can be a little difficult to rub in if you have a lot of hair on your arms, but really, that is not a major concern for me, just thought I would mention it.
