I was skeptical about this working (as I'm seriously overweight). And while I know how to do kegel exercises, like any other exercise, I find I don't have time/motivation to get it done. After taking care of my ailing father, I recently became more concerned about my children having to care for me. I didn't want incontinence to be something they had to tend to (especially at my size).The app is a wonderful reminder (sometimes annoyingly so).The device, when inserted, needs to be within signal range of your phone...which can be inconsistent (due to phone? weight?).At my size, keeping the phone within range can sometimes feel like acrobats (same for getting the device in position to start).I will say, it keeps me on track. I'm still actually doing the exercises.The price is a bit high...especially for exercises I "could" do without a device.Keeping me doing them (think personal trainer) so my kids won't have to clean up after me makes this worth every penny.
