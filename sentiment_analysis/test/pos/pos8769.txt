I had tried chickpea pasta previously but the place I bought it from stopped stocking it, so I was exited to find this online.  I am a not able to eat wheat but I love pasta.  I also try and limit carbs, and this is a good way to do it.  Chickpea pasta DOES NOT taste like regular pasta, if anything it is more like wholewheat pasta but it has a different consistency.  But it cooks quickly and doesn't fall apart and I liked it.
