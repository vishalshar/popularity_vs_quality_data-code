The setup for cell phone access is not very good. After several attempts, it works. I am not interested in having to log in with email id every time i want check the status. The only real good aspect of FOBO, I can check the tire's air pressure without getting down on my knees and contorting to find the valve stem. Guess I can put up with the other problems, for now.David
