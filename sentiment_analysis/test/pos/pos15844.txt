We've had great fun and great results.  On a Weber Genesis, we got the temperature above 750.  That was actually too high, and burnt the pizza in under 4 minutes, so we dialed it down a bit, turned down the middle burner (to reduce the floor temperature), and the results were outstanding.  It is clearly hotter in the back, so rotating the pizza (we used a simple pizza turner bought on amazon), periodically helped.  We did close the Weber lid completely to speed up the process, but then used two bricks (one on each side of the oven) to prop the lid open so we could access the opening.  An early mistake - pushing the pizza too far in and having it fall through the opening at the back - taught us not to do that again.We've learned to use the warm-up time to roast vegetables in shallow pans (broccolini, carrots, asparagus), which also helps to make the meal a bit healthier.  Also, the oven retains heat for a long time after we're done making pizzas, so we continue to use the heat to bake/roast other items.My only wish is that the opening were taller - it is just under 4 inches - so that it would accommodate higher pans for roasting, and also to make accessing the pizza slightly easier.But, for a siimple substitute for a real pizza oven, we couldn't be more pleased.
