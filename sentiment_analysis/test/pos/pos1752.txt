This was actually better than expected. We've had this for two weeks, and I love it. I finally decided to order one of these after a neighbor complained about our dog barking all day when we are gone to work. Since we use an anti-barking device and it seems to work, I wanted to be able to check things out during the day to see what's going on. That being said, two-way sound would be a great feature to add. I can tell if my dog is barking or not just by looking at what she's doing, but adding that feature would make this product much better. My dog is a bit skiddish, so I have to turn the sound off that the camera makes when it turns on. The sound it makes when it spits the treats out also freaks her out a bit, but once she sees a treat on the ground she runs right over. I was very impressed with the quality of the night mode. The picture is clear and bright, so I can still see very well even when our apartment is dark. Overall, I've discovered it's not our dog barking during the day and she just sleeps in the chair waiting for us to get home.A couple of things I really am missing with this: I would LOVE to have a web application so I can log in and view the camera stream on a computer, rather than just using the mobile application. I imagine this is something others would find this a useful feature as well. It would also be great if you could grant temporary access to other users (like if I have a friend watching my dog while I am out of town, I could give them a pin to use to access the feed for a set period of time). Offering an option to use a memory card to record footage, so you don't have to have the app open and be looking at the screen constantly, would be really great. It would add a bit of security camera capabilities, rather than just a toy for your pets.I was pleasantly surprised with how great this worked out. Definitely room for improvement, but it was a purchase that was worth the money for sure.
