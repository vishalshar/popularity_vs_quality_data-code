I read most of the reviews before buying so I knew what I was getting and was not disappointed in any way.  In fact, a few if the reviews that were negative were actually incorrect.The sound is awesome.  If you want to make your walks shake this might not be for you ... But I listen to my music loud, and I have yet cranked this all the way up when playing.I read that the speakers aren't the same in pictures ... Yes they are (minus blue light) if you pop the cover off.I also read that you can not stack the turn table because of size - I almost didn't buy the system because if that - that was also wrong.  It stacks perfectly.Neither are weighty like the systems I used to have (yes I'm old) but it doesn't sound any different.Yes the meters are for show ... I never knew what they were for any way.The turn table takes a minute to unrestrained and get used to.  Just take a minute, GO SLOW so you don't force things that shouldn't be forced until you know how it works.One last thing.  It's very easy to hook up, and that's coming from someone who had her high school bfs hook up her stereo and was completely clueless when it got here ... But less then 20 minutes later I had the entire system hooked up.
