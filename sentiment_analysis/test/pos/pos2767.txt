Everything met my exceptions pretty much, except the equalizer button being on the right;whereas all the other buttons are to the left. It's not a big deal a little confusing as to why all but one button which is the equalizer is on one side. It would of course make sense if all buttons were comviemy placed on the right side. Installation was extremely easy with a manual that was was straight forward. There's three equalizer settings ranging from 1 being your standard sound mode. Tapping it again increases the bass frequency, and one more time it reaches the headsets full bass which is quite bassy. It has a boom mike that can easily be taken on and off, so you could technically  consider the headset  a 2 in 1 gaming headset and for music if you really wanted.
