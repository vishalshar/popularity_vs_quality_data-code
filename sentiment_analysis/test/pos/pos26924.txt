I have a mixed review.  I bought a set for each of my sons.  They work perfectly for my ten year old, but they do not work at all for my 7 year old.  They seem to fit just fine, but they pop apart every day.  As such, he ends up walking around for half the day with his shoes flapping.  Its harder to put these back together every day than it is to just tie shoe laces.  When they work they're great, but they won't work for everyone.
