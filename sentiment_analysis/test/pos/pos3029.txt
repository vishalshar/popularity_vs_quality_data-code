HILLLAARRIOUS!  My husband and I both have a pretty dark (well established if you will) sense of humor.  Ever since we started dating a decade ago, we would look at Cynanide&Happiness comics and just laugh.  Sure these can be dark, so if you cannot handle incest, molestation, suicide, cancer, murder, and other dark topics, portrayed in a joking manner...this game is not for you.  It certainly isn't a game for kids...unless you are trying to teach your kids some messed up stuff.  I do cringe at some of the topics...but it is for a game-sake, a joke, and certainly meant to offend people.Please do not bring this to your church get-together. or a kids party. or grandmas house for game night.  Be aware of your audience.If you like the comics, buy the game.  If you don't...well...don't buy the game.I enjoyed it and will have many laughs because of this game.
