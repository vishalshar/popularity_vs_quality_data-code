I LOVE my LIFX lights, they make our home warm and inviting and easily change to suit what we are doing - they integrate easily with our home automation and have changed the way we think about lighting altogether - worth every cent. I had some connectivity issues initially with my Color 1000 bulbs but these were resolved with firmware updates and LIFX support staff were great to deal with. The new LIFX bulbs just worked perfectly out of the box, it has been connected for the last 60 hours straight without a hiccup. I also have the new LIFX + and have reviewed it tooÂ LIFX + (A19) Wi-Fi Smart LED Light Bulb with Infrared for Night Vision, Adjustable, Multicolor, Dimmable, No Hub Required, Works with Alexa, Pack of 4
