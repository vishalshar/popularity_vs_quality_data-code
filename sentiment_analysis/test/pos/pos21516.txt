I got sick of using regular deodorant because they felt like they clogged my pores.  I am not usually an earthy, organic type but after reading about all the chemicals in regular deodorant, I decided to take the plunge and try this.  I admit, I was worried since I don't eat clean that I would reek.  I have to say I am pleasantly surprised that this smells nice and even after being out in the summer heat, so do I!
