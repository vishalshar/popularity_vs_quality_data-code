It's not every day that you come across a new toothpaste for kids. I was pretty interested in the hello kids brand when I saw it online. I have a picky four year old son and thought maybe a fun flavor would inspire him to want to brush his teeth more on his own.The packaging is pretty cool. I love that the ingredients are naturally friendly and there aren't any dyes added to the toothpaste. It's actually plain white in color and they use Stevia as a sweetener. I actually tried the toothpaste before giving it to my son to make sure it wasn't gross tasting.. I never would have heard the end of it if it was honestly not good. I'm a big fan of Blue Raspberry flavored stuff so, I figured that he would like it, too. He was pretty fussy when I gave it to him and insisted that he didn't like the taste of it. But, I tried it. I know it's not gross. He's just being rebellious because he doesn't want to brush. He also says he doesn't like the mint toothpaste, so I know it's not anything specifically against the company.I gave it 5 stars because I approve of the ingredients that are used in it. I can't vouch for other kids, but I'm sure the majority will love the Blue Raspberry flavor. My one year old son loved the watermelon. I just wasn't able to give him this one to try out because of the fluoride in it.*I have received this product without charge to write an honest review, I have received no instruction and the opinions expressed are my own.Â”
