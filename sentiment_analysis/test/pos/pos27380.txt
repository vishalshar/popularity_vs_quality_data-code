Two words -- just two words: "....these-are-freakin'-awesome....!"  Ok, more than two.  The reason for the excitement, I needed "something" to keep my earbuds from falling off EVERY time I put on, or took off my motorcycle helmet.  My search is over!  Can't tell you happy these little rubber-thingy's have made me.  (Only wish I'd thought of marketing them!).Awesome - if you ride a motorcycle (and especially with a full-faced helmet); don't hesitate - get these....'nuff said.
