Loving the big bass on this little speaker! The treble is clear and the mid-range is nice too. What's really cool about this speaker is that you can set it on a table in the middle of the room and it will project sound all around (vs just from the front like a floorstanding or bookshelf speaker).To give you an idea of how powerful this speaker can be, I took it to work and played it softly in the conference room. When a few of my colleagues wanted to see how loud it would play, we cranked it up about half way but then stopped as it was so loud. We played it at that level for about 30 seconds before the conference room door flew open and we were told to turn it down. Red faced, we did. But it was a great testament to the power of this little speaker.If you like your sound loud, you should connect via Wifi versus Bluetooth as I found the former provides more intense acoustics.Since the speaker has a handle and a good battery life (12 hours - although I have not tested that yet), I've been carting it around from room to room and am planning on taking it along to staycations so I don't have to rely on lame hotel iPhone docks.Overall, this is a modern, clean looking speaker with really great bass and treble.
