Excellent piece of kit. Well made quality item. Puts your smart phone within easy reach, although not quite in line of sight if you're using it as a sat nav, but that really depends on the location of your cd slot. My only criticism is why is there only 4 magnets installed when there is space for six? I've added an extra two into the spare holes and now feel that my iPad mini is more secure.
