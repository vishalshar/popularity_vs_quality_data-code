I bought a box of these cheese storage bags at a local store on a whim thinking they were a gimmick. I was totally wrong - they really do work to keep the cheese fresh longer. Not sure how it works but it does. Doesn't matter what kind of cheese it is - Just slip in the bag and close with a binder clip or clothes pin and store in the cheese compartment of your fridge
