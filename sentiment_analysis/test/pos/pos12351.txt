Aware of all the negative reviews about it popping out; I contacted customer service, and Nadine was excellent with Follow-up, and making sure I had the new action clip, shipped 2 days from California.  With the new clip, it applies pressure evenly around the circumference of the Shine, and it doesn't pop out.Now that that issue is resolved, and their good customer service is on record; I will note a brief review/I have been wearing a complex Polar wrist computer for almost 2 years.  While the Shine 2 is not meant to replicate that device; for the parameters it is supposed to measure it is accurate.Sleep, Calories, activities and steps are accurate between a 3-5% variation which seems normal, as each tracker and wearing position varies.  Over all the Shine 2, with the magnetometer, appears to be accurate as any for the given parameters.Nice to look at, thin, durable, easy connectivity with an iPhone 6, lightweight, many wearing options.  If you want a tracker that gives you basic activity and sleep tracking, is discreet easy to wear, and only requires a battery change a few times a year; this is a solid choice.
