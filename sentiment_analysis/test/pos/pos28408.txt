My 9 year old son received this for Christmas yesterday and has not stopped playing with it. Everyone at our family get together was so impressed with it.My younger son put 2 of his action figures on the tray and MIP was able to carry them just fine.In addition,  it is suitable for all different types of terrain. He was able to move swiftly and smoothly tile, wood, and carpeted floors without issue.The only complaints that I have is that he takes batteries and even though the battery life is decent(ours lasted about 6 hours), I could see us going through many. We will just get rechargeable but given the price of the toy, it would be nice I he could be plugged in to recharge. The only other annoying factor was that he doesn't have a remote which would be ok but he requires an iPod or iPhone 4 or newer. My son has an iPod touch 3g and it doesn't work with it.Other than those 2 somewhat easily fixed annoyances, this is a great toy and is highly recommended.
