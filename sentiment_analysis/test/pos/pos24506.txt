I got this as a Christmas gift from my kids. And it came with the extra skewers. I have used it three times since then. First on my Weber kettle and then on my smaller gas grill I bought from Costco. This device fits perfectly, that is, you don't have skewers sticking out from under the lid. It takes about 2 minutes to get it together and you're ready to go. I have cooked chicken, beef and shrimp on it and the process has been much easier with this device. Wood skewers can get tricky especially if they get too hot and start to break down. You don't that problem with these. Moreover cleanup is a snap. I'll use this for many years to come. If you're on the fence about this or a cheaper metal skewer system get this you'll be much happier you did, there isn't a better one on the market.
