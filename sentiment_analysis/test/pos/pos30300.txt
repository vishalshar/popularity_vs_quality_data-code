Simply the best smartwatch in the market right now.Design is stunning,software is fluid and battery life is good.Does all the things expected of a smartwatch extremely well right from handling notifications to tracking your steps and workouts.Only drawback is limited no of apps available right now.Mobvoi has promised android wear support in the future and unless this feature is implemented soon I don't see a lot of developers developing apps specifically for the ticwatch.My only gripe right now is the inability to use popular watch faces app like facer,watchmaster and others.But for an entry level product ticwatch performs remarkably well and is very affordable!!!
