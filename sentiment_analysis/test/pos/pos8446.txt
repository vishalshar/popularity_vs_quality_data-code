These are not shoes as the review categories seem to indicate.  These are a very good, easy to use, "lacing" system for women's' or kids' shoes.  I wouldn't recommend them for shoes with lacing holes that are much wider than a woman's running shoes as I don't think they would fit.I have only been using them for about a week but I really enjoy the easiness of just slipping on my sneakers and running out the door in the morning.  No more laces slowing me down.Installation: Not hard but it did require some pulling a multiple tries on the holes near the toes of the sneaker as there is less room to maneuver the elastic laces.  Only issue I found is that they don't look as nice on sneakers with lace-loops (not a hole in the shoe but a loop the lace runs through) but that is an issue with the shoe design, not the elastic laces.Fit: A little snugger fit around my instep than I expected but I do have a higher instep than normal.  They are snug enough for running.Overall: Very happy with them.  Will definitely get these again.
