Just received the dash today and it went straight to the 2.0 upgrade. The initial connection to my iPhone via bluetooth was pain in the ass. Main reason was because my Left Dash could not stay connected with my Right Dash. The Left Dash will only work properly if it is placed near the Right Dash. When I place them back onto my ears, the Left Dash disconnects instantly. On the other hand, the Right Dash works perfectly fine. It seems that the BLE signal is very weak for the Left Dash to stay connected with the Right Dash.I gave 4 starts because I love the fact that it is a truely wireless earphone and the sound quality is enough for an average consumer. I am waiting for Bragi's response on my enquiry about the BLE issue before my Amazon Prime free return expires. In the meantime, I'll be keeping these bad boys.Edit: So I finally received an email from Bragi support. I didn't think they read all the way through my email and was basically advising me to do the same things I had did before to resolve the weak BLE connection of the left dash. So the email was basically useless. I originally wanted to get a relplacment through amazon. But after continous pain in the connections to my phone every morning. I decided that I'd cancel the replacement order and get something that is plug and play be 100% functional for my daily use. It is a real let down for the enormous expectation I have given it, but at least for now, I will not be using Bragi earphones untill they fix their crappy product and customer service.
