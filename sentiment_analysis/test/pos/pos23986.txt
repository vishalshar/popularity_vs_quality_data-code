This is the first organic deoderant I have ever tried and I've been wanting to for a while. Accidentally ordered the lavender, meant to order no scent. BUT I actually rly like the lavender to my surprise. Haven't had any reaction to it. And I've sweated more than usual since I got it bc weather has warmed up so I get to see how it works. I absolutely LOVE it. My old deoderant which was Dove didn't seem to do anything. Now with this I don't smell the least bit of odor! I will def be a return customer. Takes a little time to get used to putting it on differently but I live in LA aka Lower Alabama so it gets HOT here. I highly recommend this! ??
