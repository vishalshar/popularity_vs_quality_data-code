We are pleased with our Whistle, we have two.  Our male wandered off (this was the first test).  I was amazed at the information about his location.  It followed him to three different locations in a neighboring community and gave us the street and house number where he was.  He was probably gone less than twenty minutes before we headed him off and picked him up.  Thanks to his Whistle!
