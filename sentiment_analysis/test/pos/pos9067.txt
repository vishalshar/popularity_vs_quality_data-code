I've been looking for the ultimate banana bread mix since who knows when, and I purchased this out of curiosity as i do the ones before. To my surprise, this bread mix is probably the absolute best i've ever purchased! Delicious, flavourful, easy to make, and the price is so reasonable. I highly recommend this product to all banana bread afficionados out there. I love it and i'm definitely purchasing this again! Thank you.
