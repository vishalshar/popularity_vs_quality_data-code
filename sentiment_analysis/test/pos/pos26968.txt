I have suffered from a variety of odd small rashes or hot spots, probably due to stress... I can use this lotion for just a few days and most itchy spots clear up! It is very nice and I can even use it on my face (I have very sensitive skin) and it will ease any itchiness or discomfort in just a few days.  Slight smell, not bad, but definitely has a scent to it - otherwise it would get 5 stars.
