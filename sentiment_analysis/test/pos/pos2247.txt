**update**. I accidentally wore it swimming and was shocked to find its still working perfectly! Maybe I just got lucky but I thought everyone should know if it gets wet, as in completely submerged in water, don't automatically give up on it!**update on sleep tracking**After entering the time I slept in manually the first day it picked it up the second day.I received mine today. First impression.. Beautiful.. Seriously beautiful! I'm wearing mine as a bracelet which was a bit hard to put on by myself but eventually I got it in place. I love the look so much I found it worth the challenge. Connecting to the app was fairly straightforward on my LGG2. First look at the app, I find the app a bit lacking. I'd like to see an explanation of what everything means like active calories Vs inactive calories. Obviously I get the basic concept but it would be nice for full and complete break downs and explanations of well everything. Im a little unsure of the sleep tracking. I work 3rd shift every other week and it did not pick up my sleeping today so I entered it in manually. I'm hoping it just has to learn my general sleep pattern and then it will track it. Step counting, I feel like it's giving me credit for walking more then I am. I have nothing to compare it to as this is my only fitness tracker but I do plan to keep an eye on it. I really want to love this device as I love its design but currently its too new to give a complete review. I do plan to update this review as I wear it and learn more.
