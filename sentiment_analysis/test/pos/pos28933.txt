This is the perfect cover for my iphone.  The magnet on the back is extremely strong.  I can stick the phone to the refrigerator when cooking and the additional magnet to mount it on the car dashboard is great.  It is strong enough to hold the phone even when going over bumps, train tracks, etc.Great alternative to the bulky phone holders that take up space over a vent or need to be suctioned to the windshield.Additionally, the phone can be turned horizontally when I'm using GPS and there are no issue with it staying in whichever configuration I place it.
