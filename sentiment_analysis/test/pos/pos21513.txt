This deodorant works very well!  I'm 62 and within the past 5 years, my armpits have gone from no stink to very stinky, no matter which deodorant I tried.  My daughter suggested natural varieties, and I ordered this one and another by another company in stick form, also a lavender scent.  I started using the stick one first, not wanting to get my fingers goopy by dipping into this jar.  The stick worked very well with killing the stink, however my skin was slightly reactive to it-----itchy red spots.  Sooo, reluctantly, I dipped my fingers into this jar and found that it's not goopy and that I don't have to necessarily wash my hands after applying to my armpits, that it disapates right into my finger skin and seems to disappear.  Thankfully, this brand works very well at removing the stink, and I have no reaction to it!  I'll be reordering this one!
