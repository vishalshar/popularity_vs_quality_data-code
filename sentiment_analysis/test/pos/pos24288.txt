Just received them yesterday and my initial impression is that they are a quality made product. They have been extremely comfortable for the couple of hours that I have had to use them. They connected to my x-box one with no issues. I have used Turtle beach in the past and not having wires run across my living room is great! The sound was great while playing COD. I have not tried to use the microphone to chat to this point.
