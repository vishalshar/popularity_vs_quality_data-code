Love this fitness tracker. What I like about it the most is the various ways that you can wear it. That has always been my biggest hang up about other trackers. It is pretty accurate when it comes to sleep and steps. They are constantly updating the app so that it tracks new things and tracks the current items better. One of the biggest downfalls is that when ordering this off of amazon, and not directly from the retailer, your log in information for the app won't work on the website. I'm unsure of why this is but I feel like I'm missing out on a small part of the tracker because of it. Additionally, the retailer is sending out freebies to those that ordered through them, such as new necklace and battery changing kit, that you don't get through amazon.
