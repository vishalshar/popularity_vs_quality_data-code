I have been cycling through high-end smartphones over the last few weeks trying to find 'the one for me'. And here it is, from left field, the beautiful Nextbit Robin! A stunning phone with great internals and a unique selling point - smart cloud connectivity. I recently got a Blackberry PRIV which is also a beautiful phone with a wonderful hardware keyboard BUT its buggy and inconsistent, runs very hot and is just well, meh! I also tried a Nexus 6P but for me its just too big and lacks any soul, although having the latest Android goodness is always good. The Sony Z5 is a really great phone too but expensive and in some ways, like the screen, just overkill. Well the Robin gives you the best of all worlds; a reasonably stock Android 6 with fast updates, great speakers, a super fast fingerprint reader in just the right place, a beautiful and unusual industrial design and that cloud smart storage. A great concept that smartly manages your storage between the built in 32GB and 100GB of free cloud storage, greying out archived apps but restoring them quickly from the cloud and automatically uploading your photos to the cloud. Hopefully Nextbit will add even more functionality to their cloud implementation moving forward as it has a lot of potential and is just so simple and 'just works' in implementation. I just love the Nextbit launcher, the gorgeous and consistent design of both hardware and software and the thoughtful implementation of Android features. The little cloud logo on the back and the 4 flashing LEDs when it is archiving to the cloud are a nice touch too. All things considered for me its the one! The best smartphone of 2016 so far by far. Keep up the great work Nextbit and all power to your cloud elbow!
