This scale is freaking awesome. It arrived faster than expected. Mine is black, it is a little heavy. The screen is nice and easy to read. Setup is super simple. You can transfer data to your phone with Bluetooth or Wifi. It tells you weight, fat and water percentage, weather, and heart rate. When you stand on it, the screen shows you where you are placing most of your weight. So if you are leaning too much on your toes or heels, the scale will indicate that with a set of arrows. Until you adjust, your weight won't be calculated. There is an interesting feature called Pulse Wave Velocity. You have to weigh yourself 5 times in a row to get your wave number. In a graph it show the health of your heart compared to others in your age group. When you lose weight it show that as well. I'm satisfied.
