My 6 year old daughter love this! I love how the maker bag has magnets so it can stay on the drawing pad. I also love the fact that the marker bag is also the eraser. This game is pretty cool that I even enjoy playing with it with my daughter. If you have this game system I would definitely recommend it for your child.
