I've been using these going on 3 years now.  I have one cat, and we're both happy with this stuff.  I actually don't use the whole bag in one shot - I split it up into two uses, and change out the crystals about once a week.  Then I will supplement with crystals from the bag that I buy separately, and make a single tray last about a month.  No issues so far with this method.No real dust issues with the crystals, maybe once in a while if I pour it out too fast it will cloud up, but that's my fault.  Every so often the cat will sneeze from the dust, but we're talking maybe once a month.Not the prettiest thing in the world but it does the job to contain odors, and finding little blue or white crystals on your floor to me is better than gritty litter sand.
