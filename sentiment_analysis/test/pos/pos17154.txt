I bought these on the recommendation of Cook's Illustrated.  They do work just fine.  Perhaps they are best for keeping a big block of Parmesan, cheddar or similar in good shape for several months.  However, for assorted small pieces of gourmet cheese, I want to see the cheese through plastic wrap rather than read what I wrote on a buncha bags.  Nice idea, limited application.
