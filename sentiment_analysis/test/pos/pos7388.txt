This is the first cam that reach the minimum expectation.  It gets 4 stars as it still freeze up or kicked me out sometimes.  However, it is not as often and terrible as the other 2 brand/type cams that I tried.  There is something must mentioned is that the image is very nice and clear.  I can actually watching my TV clearly via iFamCare Helmet.  All my colleagues at work are amazed that the images from this cam is so good.  I highly recommend this cam to people that want a super clear image home security camera.
