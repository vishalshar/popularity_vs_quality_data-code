Bought this the other week.  It has been running well thus far and seems to be spot-on as doubling my usable time.  The only mild nuisance issue with it is that the covering for the power slot is very finicky to pop open and it looks like it could fall off pretty easily.  Also, the case is just thick enough that my magnetic mount attached to the back of the phone no longer holds which is not the fault of the case but something to note for anyone who is using a similar dashboard mount.  All in all thumbs-up.
