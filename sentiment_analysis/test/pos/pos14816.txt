This is an amazing imager for the price, period.  I bought it for troubleshooting shorts in electronics for the most part.  I have used a mega bucks flir camera in the past, so have something to compare this to.  True, this imager won't come close to a then 20 grand camera, but it's more than good enough for the job.  For $200?  It's a no brainer.  BTW, it works just fine with an iPad mini, not just the phone.
