I was first introduced to Munk Pack at a food show I attended for my job.  I enjoyed sampling these so much, I ended up placing an order for them as soon as I got home!  They have a good flavor and they are great for "on the go" snacks.  I usually like to eat a little something before my morning work outs, and these are PERFECT!  They are just enough fuel without weighing me down or making me feel sick.  They would also be great to bring along on road trips or hikes.The Blueberry Acai is my favorite flavor.  I also enjoy the Raspberry, but like other reviews mention, this can taste a little bit tart.
