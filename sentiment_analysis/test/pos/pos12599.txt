The set up truely was very easy. I downloaded the app, stuck the sensors on the doors, and I was set.We have a small vacation cabin on a lake so installed this there for peace of mind. Now I get email alerting me to any doors opening while I am away. The community caretaker sometimes lets in maintenance people, now I know exactly when this happens. The notifications alert me if the power goes out( the stick loses contact with the service) and when it comes back on.I also like the option to have it beep when doors are opened. I have young kids and the cottage is near a lake so I like to know if a child is going outside.Inexpensive and simple peace of mind.
