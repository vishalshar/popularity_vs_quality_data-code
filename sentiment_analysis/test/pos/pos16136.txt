This is a really neat device. the instructions are easy to follow, though not entirely intuitive.  wish it would use built in bluetooth instead of hogging a port on the computer, but works perfectly with my Nexus 6.  Now it just needs better integration, more apps etc.Pros: looks neat, very few false positives after calibration, fits snug (maybe a bit too snug - see cons), seems to charge pretty quickly and lasts quite a while.  the instructional videos are quite helpful, and feedback appears to be accessible on their site.Cons:  leaves a Myo temporary tattoo when removed, goes away after about an hour or two.  only a handful (get it?) of gestures and apps are supported. I'd expect if some good developers pick this up we'll see many more.  unintentional gestures fire a lot of false positives if you don't calibrate (e.g.stretching your hand after using the mouse, tapping your hand on the desk, etc.)Amazon! why is this an amazon exclusive and not integrated into Amazon Music?  Forcing me to go back to google music to play around with the gestures.
