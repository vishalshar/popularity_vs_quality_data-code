So far this little guy is so cool. We played with him for about 2 hours after his initial charge. Its amazing how he recognizes you and says your name. This guy has so many facial expressions and he learns new things the more you play with him. So easy to set up and play. The app seems to be working very well so far. We have a Samsung Galaxy SIII and it connected just fine and haven not had any problems so far, Knock on wood. lol  There is so much I could say about Cozmo, however to sum it all up. Definitely worth the buy. We Love it.
