I used this product for the first time just a few minutes ago. It was very gentle but was definitely doing some exfoliating, as I scrubbed gently. After rinsing, my face felt soft. Oh, the smell is lovely. With the scrub, I received two sample packs of the night time serum and used that after I dried my face. I used the entire packet and should have used a much smaller amount, so I was able to spread to my neck and arms. You will notice your face turning red and perhaps a little warm, which is a normal reaction from Niacin, but it is short lived and doesn't hurt or harm you. I am looking forward to seeing results after a few weeks use.
