I've been needing this for years.  I had two clear plastic shower curtain liners, one inside the tub, one outside (and no actual curtain) on the same rings.  This helped reduce the draft some, but not enough.  It was still especially bad when using the "jet" spray on the showerhead.  I marvelled at how both shower curtains would blow away from each other (and the bathtub) so that a seemingly gale force wind could blow under the outside one, up and over the tub, then under the inner curtain while wrapping it around me (saying "oh this bleeping bleep!").So, preparing to install this new product, I discarded the old yellowed inner liner and put the fresh outer one inside, so I can use just the single one with these weights.  It worked pretty well the first time, but wasn't 100%.  The end weights were about halfway between the edges of the (6' wide) curtain and the center weight.  They ended up next to a bit of the curve leading into the corner of the (standard 5') tub.  In that position, the weights couldn't quite keep the curtain from forming just a little slack between weights while using the jet spray.  It was still impressive though, seeing the effects of the vortex trying to lift the curtain, and this product holding it down, only allowing a thin curtain of air to blow in.Later, moving the end weights inward an inch or two got them away from the tub curve.  Now I simply close the curtain so that the only slack (and fold between rings) is at both ends of the rod.  The curtain stays flat along the tub even when using the jet spray.  I continue the habit of spraying hot water from the handheld onto the sides of the bathtub just before getting in.  This helps to get the curtain stuck down flat against the tub (as well as making the tub comfortably warm).  I also moved all three weights a bit lower so they are just below the bump/ridge shape of the outer tub wall.  Having them rest against the lower slope of the ridge helps to anchor them a bit.  The weights hold the curtain out over about half of the tub wall's thickness (along the flat/straight part).Thanks goes to the inventor and people making and developing this sorely needed product!
