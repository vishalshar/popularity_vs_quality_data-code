Pros: Portable and functional.Cons: The only issue with small connectors like these is the location and orientation of your female USB end. It is perfect for a laptop that lies flat and has a horizontally-oriented female USB end. This is not so for a female USB end on a desktop unless you can find an object to rest your phone on. Even then, the female USB end would need to be oriented horizontally. My NomadKey has slightly split along the edge because of the stress applied by my phone due to the orientation of my female USB end.Otherwise, awesome product.
