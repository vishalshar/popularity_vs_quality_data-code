The Sunsprite does exactly what it says it does - measure your full spectrum light exposure and sync UV Index with Apple HealthKit.  The device is simple to clip on, and other than manual syncing, which is still just the launch of an app and tap of a button on the hardware, couldn't be easier to use.On days I garden, it helps me avoid overexposure, and on days when I don't get enough time outside, it's an excellent indicator of when I need to get in front of a full spectrum lamp before I disrupt my sleep.That it is solar powered and syncs wirelessly are excellent features, and their customer service is responsive and polite.
