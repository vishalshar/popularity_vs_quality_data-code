Like some others who have commented, I connected it to the button on the wall instead of going right to the opener head.  Installation took no more than 5 minutes, start to finish.  Installing and configuring the app was maybe another 5 minutes.The gesture thing doesn't seem to work for me.  [UPDATE: After playing with it some, it works, but not consistently]. The ad doesn't mention this, but the gesture thing is a beta feature; if that's really important to you, factor that into your decision.Also, there seems to be some way that I could hook to a sensor of some sort; it sounds like maybe it's supposed to tell whether the door is up or down.  I can live without that, but if the creators of the product happen to read this more details on the website would be helpful. [UPDATE: upon re-reading the info on the website, it seems there is a sensor, and possibly a "gLink Pro" that comes with the sensor -- and yes, in order to tell whether the door is open.  I sent an email to the company asking if there was an upgrade kit; they responded that the intend to have a sensor that can be added soon, and would let me know when it was available.][UPDATE: I mentioned above that I sent them an email.  I sent it after midnight, took the dogs out for their pre-bedtime roam about the yard, and when I came back in 20 minutes later, I had a response.  Not a robo-response, a real one.  Very impressive.]The main things though: easy to install, easy to use.  No more dead batteries in the clicker, or re-synching it after replacing batteries.  No worrying forgetting and leaving the car with the opener in the driveway.  Easy to give access to the kids, the pet-sitter, etc. And for less than the cost of the replacement clicker we would otherwise have needed.
