I purchased this Circulator on 12/23 and have used it for Dinner nearly every night since.  The unit is very simple to use (plug it in, fill water container, set temp with the dial, and immerse food) and after a month of almost daily use has stood up to that volume.  Small Pots full of water (enough to cook for 2-4) get up to temp in 10-20 minutes, a large sink for a crowd got to temp in around 1.5 hours.  This unit is very accurate and consistent, as i've verified water temp using a thermapen multiple times throughout cooks and found it to be dead-on.  It is also portable for when we travel to visit with family, and takes up about as much space on the counter as a small bottle of wine (note it is a little taller).  Food quality will come down to the skill of the user, but the ease of perfectly cooked meats made possible with sous vide is remarkable.
