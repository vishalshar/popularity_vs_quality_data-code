I bought this to make a ketchup pump for in my kitchen. I had bought a large container of ketchup in bulk and didn't think through that I didn't have a pump for it. I saw lots of cute ideas on Pinterest to make your own pumps, but they involved different types of glue, which I was concerned would not be food safe. After looking at a couple of different options on Amazon, I chose this one. The product itself if excellant!! But for my needs I definitely needed a bigger pump top, it takes a ton of pumps to get enough ketchup out. I would definitely buy again, just not for ketchup.
