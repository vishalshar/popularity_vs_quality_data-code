I love love LOVE my Leaf! This is such an amazing product for every woman on the go! It looks really cute too :) It was incredibly easy to set up with my iPhone (I have an iPhone 6) and I have been using it every day - tracking my sleep, my flow days, doing breathing exercise through it, using is as a "gentle" alarm clock etc. :) I get a lot of compliments on it and it is not only a great tech device, but also a pretty piece of jewelry to wear. I have been mostly wearing with my beige Leaf bracelet, but have also worn it with the necklace a few times as well...All in all, I would definitely recommend this product and I can't wait to tell the rest of my friends about it :)
