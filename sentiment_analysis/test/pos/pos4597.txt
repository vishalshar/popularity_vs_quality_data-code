I got the drone earlier this week, and have been playing with it over the break.  The drone is well built and the flight is very stable.  It's a great way to learn programming and to learn about Adruino.  All the tutorials are online for free, which is really cool.  I'd definitely recommend it if you're into tinkering with toys.
