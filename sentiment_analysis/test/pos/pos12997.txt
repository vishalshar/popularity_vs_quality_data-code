I own a iWatch, three Pebble watch and let me express to you that this watch far exceeds each one of them. This is an high end product that even it's packaging comes top notch.  It's easy to setup and has the ease to slide between apps.  I love that I can measure my heart rate so easily.  If you are searching for a smart watch, this watch definitely needs your consideration.
