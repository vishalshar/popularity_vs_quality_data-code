I am one of those people who needs to have my bottles clean as I use them so much. I was frustrated with "gunk" forming in the bottom of them or not being able to fit a Nalgene in my bike cage. This bottle solves both problems and has spill proof spout. I screw both ends off and throw it on the top rack of the dishwasher. Problem solved.
