I am happily surprised at how well these sheets work. I find they work better in an enclosed space, like a refrigerator drawer, than in an open fruit basket. I cut them in half and place a half in each of the two bins in our wire fruit basket. I don't think they work as well on the bananas as they do on apples, because those still go bad if they're not eaten quickly enough. But I have some Macintosh apples that I bought nearly two weeks ago...they were soft on the outside and my son wanted to throw one out. I told him to try it. It was perfectly edible and tasty, despite being a little soft.In my fridge, veggies often get forgotten and go bad. The drawer that I currently have a full sheet in has lettuce, a cucumber and tomatoes I bought two weeks ago and totally forgot about. Only a few tips of the romaine hearts needed to be tossed. The shredded lettuce I buy for tacos lasted for two weeks when it normally turns brown after 2-3 days once opened.I just put the last sheet into a drawer (I change them monthly) and am ordering more. I've easily saved more money than these cost, by using these instead of tossing out inedible produce. I need to give them to my uncle, who is disabled and tends to leave bananas in his fridge so long that they become petrified! Highly recommend.
