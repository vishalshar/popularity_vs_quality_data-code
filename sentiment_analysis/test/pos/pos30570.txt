By far MY favorite Camera accessory. The look and feel on this hand grip is absolutely awesome! It definitely is premium product. I can tell alt of thought and engineering went into the design of this grip. So many features packed into one compact hand grip. The GoPro adapter and Phone mount that comes with this are a huge bonus! I've never seen a phone mount like the one included with this one, It even collapses and folds flat so that its is compact and easy to store away! Amazing. Everything about this device screams COMPACT. The hand Grip easily fits into my pocket and can be store seamlessly into my backpack. I love the way the handle splits into three pieces and turns into a quick mini tripod. I find it to be extremely convenient and very stable. The mono-pod feature is pure genius. Very easy to transform back and forth as needed. Perfect build quality. I would definitely recommend this to ANY daily vlogger or proffesional selfie taker LOL. This will probably take the place of all of my other many accessories because this thing REALLY DOES IT ALL. Now that I have the PolarPro Trippler, I don't think I will ever have to invest in another tripod or mono-pod ever again.
