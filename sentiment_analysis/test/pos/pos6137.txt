I love this phone.  I have been wanting it since I saw the Kickstart a while ago.  It was 400 plus dollars. When I saw that Amazon for 169.00 I had to buy it.  Even with the mixed reviews. This phone has a great signal and it gets TMobile's and AT & T LTE and Volte.  I saw wifi calling in the settings. But I haven't tried it yet (I never use WiFi calling). Since I have had this phone it's been updated to Android N.  I have a Samsung S7edge, Moto Z,  LG stylo plus,  Moto G plus 64G 4 g of ram version.  Sony z 4,  and a few others.  This is the  first phone to get Android N. I don't have issues with the phone getting hot. The build quality is excellent.  The sounds perfect for me. It's loud and clear.  I usually use headphones.  I do use speaker phone sometimes for calls.  It works good.  Call quality on and off speaker are great. The only thing with this  phone is.  If you use a case use one of the Nextbit cases.  The third-party cases fit but it's hard to get to the buttons that are fairly flat. With the nextbit cases this is not a problem.The cases are a bit pricey, but they are awsome for the phone and worth it.I don't like the Nextbit launcher, I don't like my icons all diffrent colors, sizes and just plopped on all the screens.  Not a big deal.  I always use Nova prime on all my phones. It lets me customize my phone how I like.  Nice and neat.  I have the midnight version of the phone. The mint color is all over the the UI.  I wish I could change this  to dark.All in all its a great phone for the price.
