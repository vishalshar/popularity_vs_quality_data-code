Rachio Delivers. Installation was a blaze, I was done within minutes of starting. The new version 2.0 has many improvements one of which was additional space for routing cables -- I was able to get 12 zones plus sensor wires in despite the old style thick cables for the zones. Well done Rachio for listening to customers.Once everything is connected, the rest of the setup is quick. Rachio App which is easy to use walks you through basic setup of all the zones and then you're ready to go.I highly, and I mean highly recommend bringing up the Rachio account on your laptop or computer and further customizing the settings. For example  every zone is sized to 1000 sq feet by default. My lot has lots of irregularly shaped small beds and the sprinkler person broke these off into individual zones. You can easily measure / guesstimate the sq footage of the zones by using free websites that use google maps to measure area based on the dots you put on the map.Also pay attention to the type of sprinkler heads you selected and make sure they're the correct ones --- this is how Rachio decides how much water is being used.I find that the water budgeting estimates are somewhat inaccurate -- as in it says it is spending more water than it is for us (this is documented by Rachio folks -- the unit has no way of exactly metering the water throughput -- it is estimating it based on area, sprinkler head type, and time the zone ran during the watering cycle). The estimates for water usage became closer to accurate after I fixed square footage, and nozzle types.The app on iOS seems to have a small glitch where it will not save area of sprinkler zones, and defaults back to 1000 sq foot. Use the browser version. (This was several weeks ago, this may already be addressed) I used the website, it was just as easy if not easier actually. Just use the website if you can the first time but if you need to use your phone app, it does everything the website does -- it's all there.I even took pictures of the zones and uploaded them -- which is a really nice touch.The weather station setup is a snap -- automatic I should say.The wiring for the rain sensor was tricky because the included manual had confusing color codes in the diagrams and the wiring between gen 1 and gen 2 are different. Please Rachio post a help article for this like you did for gen 1 models. I had an Irritrol Wireless Rain sensor from the old sprinkler installation. It works just fine with Rachio now that I got the wiring right -- this btw may have been entirely my fault, maybe I was not following the directions carefully. It took a couple of tries. If you get it wrong, nothing catastrophic happens btw.Otherwise the unit is easy to use. Manual Override for controlling sprinkler zones is VERY easy to use and a god send for when the sprinkler service people come or when I need to turn on a zone while doing yard work and I do not have to wash hands and go grab my phone.(Revised March 30 2016 -- the next day after original review for better clarity -- I was too excited when I wrote the original review)
