I had a smaller version of it that I have used for a number of years and wanted to upgrade it so I purchased this one. I've had no issues with it, loads data quickly and has sufficient storage space for what I do.  I Installed a number of Pen Drive Linux Operating systems on it and use it as a live CD.
