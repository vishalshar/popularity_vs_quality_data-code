OMG! Thanking God for this investment for my Sister who is a paraplegic with MS. She developed Stage 1 & 2 bedsores and the insurance company would not help with replacing her insurance placed air mattress unless she had developed Stage 3 or above! I am happy to report she is healing wonderfully! Will order the wheelchair seat soon! Again, this is worth the investment for yourself or a loved one!
