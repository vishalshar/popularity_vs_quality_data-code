I would have happily given five stars in the first few months, as these things seemed to do just what they said and make for comfortable shoe on/off exercises.  purchased in the front part of July, the first one broke at the front of October.  Bad juju!  At the price of these things, one could quickly get to the cost of another pair of shoes in a year!They worked well until one broke.  That required a replacement of the one that broke, not at the connecting "button", but in the middle of its length.  This was after about three months' once-a-day on/off.  Use your judgement.
