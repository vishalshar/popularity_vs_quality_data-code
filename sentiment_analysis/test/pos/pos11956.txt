Very small and sleek. I have a clear case on my macbook and it keeps this unit from going in 100% but it still goes in 90% and it works. I can also confirm it works with a Yubico Yubikey (i'm using the Nano) for both OTP and U2F. I can confirm it works with a USB3 external HD.I also tested it with iPhone and it works. i tested reversing the plug both directions and that seemed fine.In case it's not clear - this unit has a small light on itÂ—very tiny and sleek. I like it - it reminds me of the magsafe light that I miss even though it doesn't change colors.
