Got the Whistle after my Tagg died.  At first it wasnt working very well so I called customer support and she discovered my tracker was trying to find the old base station. She also discovered that in the process of setting up the new Whistle that I set up another account. So she fixed the base station issue and the duplicate account and had a credit issued in one phone call all the while being very curtious and helpful. Best customer service I've ever experienced!  Tracker is working great!!
