I started to drink a lot of tea while I was in law school- I wanted the caffeine boost, but coffee left a weird taste in my mouth. I decided to drink loose-leaf tea, because I figured the process of making the tea would give me a nice mental break from studying. I became addicted, and also became a bit of a tea snob. Unfortunately, that made it a little difficult to get tea that I genuinely liked while I was at work; with a crowded office space, I didn't have anywhere to keep loose-leaf tea brewing equipment.This product is the perfect solution to my problem. I was a little skeptical at first, because I never dreamed powdered tea would have the kind of flavor that loose-leaf tea does, but I decided to give it a shot. I am SO glad I tried it! The flavor is delicious, the product is very small (which is perfect for my office), and it produces a high-quality mug of tea in seconds. I cannot recommend this product enough. I intend to keep it stocked at my desk at all times from now on.
