Have had it for about a week now. The camera does not pan/tilt (which I knew), it has night vision, and you can send audio messages to it which is nice. The camera is pretty clear overall.There is about a 2-4 second delay from the camera to your phone while watching "live", which is alright but just letting people know.When you send a message to it, it is very muffled and hollowish sounding. It isn't clear by any means, a person can hear what the other is saying through it but it isn't clear audio.I haven't had any connection issues so far. Have a 4 bedroom, 2 story house, with router upstairs, camera downstairs and no issues. 40mbps internet only as well.
