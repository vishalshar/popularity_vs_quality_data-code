I was initially pretty hesitate about the Petcube given it's price. There are other internet camera's out there you can use for much less money, and ones of comparable price that have higher quality images and night-vision. But the convenience of the app and most especially the laser pointer really set the Petcube apart and make it worth it. Initially, I was really disappointed since the app worked very poorly with my Samsung S6 android phone. To the credit of petcube, they were aware of the issue and released a fix very quickly. They also responded to my negative review in the google play store and noted they were aware of the issue and working on a fix which I really appreciated. The app was initially developed on iOS and works great on my girlfriend's iPhone.I have a ton of fun with this thing. I like checking in on my cat and she goes nuts for the laser pointer. I think it keeps her active while I am at work and helps me to still feel connected with her. My only gripe would be the lack of night vision. For the price, it feels like it should be included, especially given how it is marketed towards pet owners and cats are so active at night. Not a deal-breaker for me though.You should also be aware that the camera is in a fixed position (you cannot pan) and points slightly downward. For this reason it works really well up higher on a shelf to get a wide angle view, but doesn't have nearly the same wide angle closer to the ground. They are likely still ironing out issues with the app but I am really happy to have one and look forward to more improvements in the future.
