I have struggled with finding the perfect earbuds for running. They all want to jiggle around so that I waste energy pushing them back in. Not these. They are amazing little buds that hook right onto my iPhone headphones (so I can use the volume control, too). Ran a half marathon this month - in the rain - and they did not budge. No impact on sound quality either.
