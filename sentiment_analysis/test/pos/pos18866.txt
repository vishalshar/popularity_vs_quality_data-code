I purchased the Dash recently and this is my intial review for it :1 - I received the Dash with one pair updated to OS 2.1 and the other not updated which made my experience at 1st very frustrating and i had to read the support pages on the Bragi website to know whats going on and i used the rapid update method to update the right ear piece to the OS 2.1 in order for the earphone to function correctly .After that everything went fine , The earphone worked correctly at every aspect , However Bragi should spend sometime in finding a more simpler method to update the Dash .Regarding the sound i found the XS size very good for my ears and the sound was good although without much base , The other larger sleeves have a very big weak point is that they are connected to the ear tip which makes the ear tip leak sound and loose the base  , I think Bragi should put several size ear tips like the XS size .I will try using my iphone 6 equalizer to enhance the base a little bit although the sound is very clear , it just needs some enhancements .The latest OS also cleared the problem of bluetooth cut offs , its working fine with me with the phone at the end of the room .I will update this review with any other comments later but for any new buyer , please read the troubleshoot pages on the Bragi website if youare facing any problem with the update , they are very helpfull and to the point .
