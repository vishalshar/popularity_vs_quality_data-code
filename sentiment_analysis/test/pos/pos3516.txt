Christmas gift. Although I have not eaten these mushrooms this is my second purchase as a gift. I first bought these for my brother in law two years ago and he still raves about them. So this year I purchased him another box. I also love the fact that if you take a picture of your crop and send it in via social media they will donate a box to a school.
