I bought this for my second Ragnar relay and just used it again during my third. It is perfect! It does not bounce and is comfortable while running. When running in the heat of the day with no shade id say this holds enough water for up to nine miles if you are well hydrated. This is just what I needed because I do not like to hold water bottles in my hands while running and I can't imagine that I would like water bottles bouncing around my waist during a run like I would think a running hydration belt would do. The only thing I need to figure out better is how to attach the hose and end during a run, the hose is quite long and definitely needs to be tucked somewhere.
