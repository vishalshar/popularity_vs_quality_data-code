I love this sleep tracker! It is the best! Sense is seamless and extremely accurate. Beautiful design.Â The longer I use the device, the more data I get.I used to set an alarm on my phone to wake me up which was loud and obnoxious. The smart alarm is brilliant. You choose the time you want to be awake at and it goes off at the most ideal time in your sleep cycle within half an hour before the time. The alarm feature is so much better than my phone alarm. To be honest, I have been sleeping so well that I no longer need to set an alarm. I wake up naturally at around the same time every morning. This has never happened to me before.
