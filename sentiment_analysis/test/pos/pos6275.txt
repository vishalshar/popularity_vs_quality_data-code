Just used it on my trip to Japan. We did lots of walking. Carried water bottle and random stuff as I shopped for gifts. The switching the Man-PACK from back-to-front came in very handy when I was riding on the train (for sitting down or when it's crowded). The front pocket is too small for most smart phones. I used it for carrying my glasses. The Man-PACK does hug you around the back. feel comfortable, but my shoulder and back was getting too warm (sweating).
