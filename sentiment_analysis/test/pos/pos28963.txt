I decided two years ago to never again pay more than $100 for a phone, as I believe it is better to put my money into a good tablet or laptop.  I don't use my phone for games, and only put on it the most essential apps, since these "free" games and apps have access to all your contacts, phone logs, email, and location.  I have plenty of other tablets and laptops to play games on whenever I want.  I use my phone for calls, texts, and occasionally email.I love the Windows phones, but they appear to be dying, so I looked for my next replacement.  I couldn't decide on this or the Blu Amazon phone, so I got both.  My plan was to use the Posh for my audio books (which I listen to constantly), and the other one as my phone.  I bought this more as a joke than a serious phone, and at $30, why not?  The small size seemed ideal for me, as I spend a lot of time walking my two Golden Lab pups through the woods, and I have too much gear packed into my Scottevest already.I opened up both phones, set up the Blu, which is bigger than any other phone I have been using, and seemed very limited.  I was not at all impressed.Then I set up the Posh, and fell in LOVE with it.  It doesn't have a ton of memory, but has plenty for what I need it for.  It even fits perfectly in the license ID holder in my vest, and weighs next to nothing.  I decided to use this as my phone instead.The only hard part was the one time log in to my essential accounts, the keyboard is tiny.  I can't imagine typing text messages on it, but it works just fine using the microphone.  For most things you can use the microphone instead of the keyboard. Which I'm sure is why they call it a "Micro" phone.Just as I got it all set up, I dropped it on concrete.  Yup, shattered the screen.  It is still usable, but I decided to replace it because I like it that much.I logged in to buy another one, only to find the price had gone up to $50.  It seems other people also liked this phone, and demand had driven the price up.If it ever comes back to $30, I'm buying a case of them.  They would make great gifts.  And I'm sure I will drop it again, as I am a klutz.But even at $50, it is a great deal.
