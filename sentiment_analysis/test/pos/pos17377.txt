This review if for the ChargeTech - 24,000mAh BLACK Portable Battery Pack by ChargeTech.I liked the fact that it included an AC outlet in addition to the 2 USB ports. I have had no problems charging my Mackbook 12 using the AC outlet. I have also been able to charge an iPad Air, iPad Air ll, iPhone 6 and iPhone 5c using the USB ports.The reason that I give this device "only" 4 stars is because of a problem with the USB ports. I seem to be able to charge 2 iPhones simultaneously but I can not charge an iPhone and iPad at the same time. The charger will not function using this combination. It shuts off repeatedly. The workaround that I have been able to discover is to use the USB port for the iPhone and use the AC outlet for the iPad. This combination allows me to charge both at the same time.
