I absolutely loved by Beam. Really clear picture, lots of applications, really fun to use. But it stopped working about 2 weeks ago and the company has been pretty slow with support. They informed me I would have to send my Beam in for inspection so I completed the online form for a shipping label, but have not heard anything back. Hoping the issues get resolved because it was a great product when it worked.UPDATE: Beam Labs shipped me a new projector after inspecting the old one and it's working great!
