TRAKK MAMBA 30W Wireless Waterproof Rugged Shockproof Bluetooth Speaker with Built in Subwoofer and MicThis is a product review of TRAKK MAMBA New Model 30W of Power Portable Wireless Waterproof Rugged Shockproof Bluetooth Speaker with Built in Subwoofer and Mic  by TRAKKI love portable Bluetooth speakers. This is possibly the best one I have ever seen. I may have said this before but this one is in a league of its own. It is waterproof with all the connections you would want. The speaker is great looking. It is a bit heavy but this is most likely due to large magnets on the speakers. That spells quality. The bluetooth connects easily and has a huge range. The battery life is great and it charges fast. Now lets talk about the sound. They sound awesome. They are very loud and crystal clear sound.Checkout my video and see for yourself.This item was delivered very fast with Prime Membership and there were no shipping or delivery issues or hassles.Please feel free to ask any questions you might haveThank you for taking the time to read my review.
