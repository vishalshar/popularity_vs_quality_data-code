It's pricey and takes a little time set up on-line but it works.  Bought this to feed my cat while I was out of town for a couple days, rather than just leaving out a big bowl of food.  This allowed me to control her portions and set times for her to be fed.  Basics: You open up the feeder and fill the tray, which has 6 dividers, with food.  Then you set the times for feeding on-line (product website has videos guiding you step by step if you need help - I did), and the tray rotates on schedule. You get an email or text alert every time your pet gets fed. It also has a web-cam which enabled me to see my house while I was gone, which was nice.
