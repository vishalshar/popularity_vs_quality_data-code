I bought this product to keep my cat safe.  We have a fenced in patio with a 6 foot wood fence.  On top of that we already had the cat "fence in" system which we bought years before to keep our other cat safe.  The simple fence worked for our big cat, but when we got another smaller cat, she would constantly find ways to get around the cat fence netting.  We didn't want to to have to resort to an electric collar, but we had to if we wanted to allow the cats to still enjoy some outdoor space, which they love.  I think she is below the weight limit suggested here, (She is only about 7 pounds, full grown), so we kept the system on the lower voltage setting once she was trained.  At first, to train her, we did have to put it on a high setting.  And yes, initially she got very scared and would not go outside because she didn't know what was causing her to get zapped.  So then we turned it down a tiny bit.  Once she got "zapped" a few times, she started to pay attention to the warnings the system gives.  It starts to "click" when the animal is getting to close to it's boundaries.  Over time, she responded to the clicks and wouldn't get zapped anymore, so we knew we could turn the voltage down even further.  Eventually, she would stay within her boundaries and we did not have to worry of her jumping the fence.  I highly recommend you try it on yourself before you subject you pet to it.  It is a strong zap, you won't forget it.  But it also passes quickly.  You do have to replace the batteries often though.  Almost as soon as the battery would die, she would notice that the clicking stopped and would jump the fence.  So it was crucial to always have a spare battery on hand.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and did not but the manufacturers overpriced replacement batteries.  You can buy it from a hardware store for $5 near the watch batteries.  Just take the old one with you so you buy the right one.  We have now moved from that home and we don't have a need for the shock collar anymore.  I was glad to take it off of her but also glad she was safe for the time we needed it.
