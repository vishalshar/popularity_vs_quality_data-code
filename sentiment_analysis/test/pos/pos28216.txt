As someone who frequently travels for work, TrackRs separation alerts feature provides me so much peace of mind. I no longer have to worry if my luggage is going to get lost or mistaken for someone elses, and in the event that it does, I can easily locate it using my TrackRs. I use TrackRs on all of my luggage; carry-ons and suitcases. TrackRs are also useful as they allow me to know when my luggage is on the carousel for pickup, or if theyre stuck in an oversized luggage area.  I own 2 silver, 2 blue, 2 black, and with my most recent purchase, 2 rose gold ones to color code all of my luggage. I Highly recommend TrackRs for any  traveler.
