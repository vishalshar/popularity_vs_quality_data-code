I don't even have to get off the couch anymore. I just tell my Echo Dot what channel I want, and BOOM there it is! EVERY product in my home that needed a remote, works with this. You can also just work this off of your phone if you don't have the Echo Dot...but adding the Echo Dot will make your friends jealous when you turn things on/off, or change the channel on your TV with just speaking into the air.
