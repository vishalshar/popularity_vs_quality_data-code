Pros: My daughter loves the product. The directions are easy to follow and the pen doesn't get hot. Plastic is easily manipulated to correct mistakes. She likes that she can be her own 3D printer.Cons: super short charging cord, plastic can get stuck--doesn't always reverse, so you have to use the color that's in there. The starter pack only comes with 2 plastic packs. That's enough for the Eiffel Tower and 2-3 other small projects.
