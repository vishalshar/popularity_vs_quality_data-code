It is a lovely little watch, the perfect size for my five year old, and more stylish that I expected. We explained what it does but he is simply happy to have a watch like Daddy.We didnt have to install nor activate any sim card, we just charged the watch, turned it on and followed the instructions to pair it with the App that we had already downloaded. The activation process was easy, took less than two minutes and now it is working really well. We have also managed to Geo-fence the house and my sons school. I recommend it!
