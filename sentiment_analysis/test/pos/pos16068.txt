They work great.  I have a set of 3 in a chandler and with the current firmware updates they all turn on at the same time, keep the same color, when controlled by grouping which is more important than you'd think (Is that one blub slightly different colored than the other two?!).  The app is pretty good.  The newest version (late 2015) is a little too big in the icons in my opinion.I wish the non warm colors weren't quite so sterile.  Like something just between one of their warm temps and neutral white.  It's not bad by any means but with the level of granularity you get personally I wish you could control it a bit more like you could with the old app.  The current late 2015 gives you a "Wheel of Fortune" type color wheel to select from versus a knob.
