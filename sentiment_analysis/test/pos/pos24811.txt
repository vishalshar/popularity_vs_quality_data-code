I communicated my displeasure about the way my experience unfolded with the Shine 2, and to Misfit's credit they were very responsive and sent me another one with a different clip that is meant to be more secure. I used the new clip for a few days and saw that, while it is a bit more secure, it still cannot be depended upon to hold your Shine without falling out. On the bright side, the new clip has much more surface area that can be used to super glue the device into the band, which is what I have done. I am hoping that Misfit will release their accessory bands before I lose this one again.Shine 2 -- 5 starsShine 2 sports band -- 1 star-----------------------------------------------------Yes, I read all the reviews saying that the device would pop out of the wrist band, but I thought, "hey, what about super glue?". So I purchased it, nearly lost it three times before getting some super glue, and then Presto-Fixo, problem solved. But not really. For a couple of months I had no worries as I traversed the globe on business travel and nothing dislodged the Misfit from the wristband. And then today, an average day at home, I looked down and it was gone. Now all of you who posted reviews knowing this would happen can laugh knowing that even super glue will not make the MISFIT SHINE 2 FIT. It should be called the MISSED FIT, NO LONGER MINE 2.If Misfit would like for me to revisit this review and upgrade it (I loved the device before it bailed out on me!), just send me a new one and I will have it surgically implanted. Or, imagine this, you could FINALLY COME OUT WITH THE ACCESSORIES YOU HAVE ON YOUR WEBSITE. Or maybe they don't hold in the misbehaving Misfit Shine 2 either.....
