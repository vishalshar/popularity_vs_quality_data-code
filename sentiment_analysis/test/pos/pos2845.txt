The iOttie Easy One Touch Mini CD Slot Car Mount is my favorite car mount.For background, I have owned the One-Touch Windshield Dashboard Car Mount, Easy One Touch 2 Car Mount, Easy Flex 3 Car Mount Holder Desk Stand.  My needs for a reliable car mount shifted over time as my devices changed from the Samsung Galaxy S3, to the Amazon Fire Phone, to the OnePlus One, and now the Nexus 6.As many know, the Nexus 6 is a monster phone, and it would not fit in the Easy Flex 3.  With a case, the Easy One Touch 2 also had difficulties accommodating my Nexus 6 with a slim case.  The Easy One Touch Mini CD Slot Car Mount solved all of this.  It is not only wide enough to fit the Nexus 6 with a case with easy, it also allows for easy pivotal rotation that can be tightened or loosened depending on the user.  I had reservations whether or not the phone would slip or bounce in the side-grip-only design.  I am delighted to say that the this mount actually holds my phones the most snug of all the designs I have tried.The Easy One Touch 2 sat low in my car as I did not want it sitting high on my dashboard in plain view.  The Easy One Touch Mini CD Slot Car Mount sits at a very discrete level of your CD slot.  With that being said, if your car does not allow have a CD slot.  This mount is clearly not for you.  However, if you do, I would argue that this is the best phone car mount there is.  There is no blocking of AC vents, bouncing of a stand, or messing with suction cup damage/stains as other mounts do (I have to insert here that my iOttie mounts have never damaged or stained my car in any way).I hope you find this review helpful!
