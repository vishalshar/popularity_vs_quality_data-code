I am only giving 4 stars because there was evidence that the box had been opened and was possibly a returned item from someone else. It had been re taped and the there was no wire tie on the cable, even though you could tell by the shape of the cord (bent) that it had been wire tied at some point.It took about 6 times for me to finally get this device paired up with my Wink hub, but it has worked flawlessly since . So even if it had been a returned item I am OK with it.
