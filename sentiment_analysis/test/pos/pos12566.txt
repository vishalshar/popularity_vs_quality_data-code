I really like this product.  I have a cowlick in the top of my hair.  When my hair is short, which is all the time anymore, it looks like a little balb spot.  I am glad I purchased the travel size, because I don't need to use a dad or two.  If you have more that you need to cover you might want to buy the regular size-this is the travel size.  As I said I don't use much, but it didn't seem to come off on my pillowcase.
