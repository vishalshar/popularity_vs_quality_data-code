I had pretty low expectations for this product because of the mixed reviews.The brushes don't stay in your hair very well. I thought I'd be fine since I have very thick hair and a lot of it. It was ok with slightly damp hair but near impossible for my dry hair.But the results, even with my terrible blowout technique, were AMAZING. My hair is shiny, bouncy, and beautiful. I did order more of the brush heads and some clips because I loved the results so much.I ordered the small size and my hair is goes to about mid back. It gives some body and some nice curl at the ends.
