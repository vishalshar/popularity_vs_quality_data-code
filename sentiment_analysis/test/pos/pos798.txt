Works perfect for,me purposes, some said in the reviews that the computer's graphic were not so spectacular. I'm glad I didn't let that discourage me as I find this computer beyond satisfactory. Although,  I may just be not picky about that sort of thing. She works well for the RPG' s I play, I don't have the graphics on ultra or anything, I don't find that necessary but she might lag a bit with the graphic on high. Other than that it's a great computer, great for school and gaming. Great computer for the price! Merry Christmas ya'll!
