Great tool for your golf game, live upload is a great function.I agree taggging can be an issue but it can be worked into the preshot routine.  My problem is more of tagging too many times(for now).  It gives you a couple of short buzzes to let you know you tagged it.  For. The most part you don't have to look at the unit which clipped on to the belt, and it stays out of the way in all situations. I did move the location from toward the front to the side to avoid accidental tagging especially with longer clubs like driver or fairway woods.Love the way you can review your round and see how you did.  The gps seems accurate as it gives you, for example, the green data, front middle and back distance.  I'm using the range finder with slope function and the number given is quite accurate.  I've not had the issue with battery life yet but so far I've just used it one round at a time.The info are pretty usefulOff the tee-fairway hit and gir(par 3s) as well as distance and club usedApproach shots-green hitsScoring- how many birdies, pars, bogeys, etc.Scramble-if your shots land near the greens or in the bunkers how do you scramble to save the holes for pars or birdies;)Compare- it also compares your game with scratch golfer, 5 hdcp, 10hdcp, 15hdcp, etc. stroke gain would let you know how you are doing against the avg players in your scoring range and the area that you could improve to get to the next level.I've used the golf stats apps before, they are expensive(monthly subscription) but more importantly, annoying to use as you have to provide all of the info while you are playing. game golf live does that seamlessly just by tagging.  I play smarter shots because I know it goes to my shot data, by just doing that I dropped 2-3 strokes per round since I started using it.Small learning curve usually things that happens before the first shot of the round. You have toTurn on the unitPair the unit with your phone via BluetoothSelect the course and the tees you are playing then start the roundTag your first drive, I missed this twice.Kudos:Easy to useIt automatically keeps your score.Stay out of the way and let you focus on the roundLoads of data you can enjoy after the rounds as well as sharing your round with othersFix the shot tagging liveComes with 18 NFC pins plenty of extra for all of your active clubsRecords every shots so far, No miss.You check  out other players who plays the course and how they do, it gives you fresh look at how they do it.Apple Watch user: it launches the apps automatically, although it drains battery so fast, I started with 97% and by the time I'm done with my round I'm in red at 17%I wish theyAllow pin placement tagging- this would provide precise approch to the green accuracy as well as putting.Separate full shot and specialty shots and not included in the club distance average.  I use my 6i and 5hy to do a lot of "get out of trouble" from punching out or putt around the green and it gets recorded to the club average.  This can be done post round.My putter has a counter weight and I can't screw the pin in the butt end.  They should provide a clip or two that would allow attachment.
