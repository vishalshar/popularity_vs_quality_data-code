Received a week ago.  Better than expectations!  Excellent ever increasing library within the app or the web of still images and dynamic video.  Everything from vibrant classic art to dramatic abstract still and moving images (..even a whimsical moving image of Donald Trump's face morphing to a made-up woman!).  Great product - love it.  Now you don't have to commit to a piece of art.Recently they added functionality for a slideshow to cycle through your various playlists and favorites (minimum rotation time is 30 mins).A suggestion for improvement:  allow the minimum rotation time to be less than 30 mins, to say, 5 minutes.  They can be quite the conversation piece for guests and 30 minute rotation is too long.  Maybe there are technical reasons they cant do this.Additional product suggestion:  it would be great if this was also available in a larger size.Update: you can buy directly from their website now for $299.
