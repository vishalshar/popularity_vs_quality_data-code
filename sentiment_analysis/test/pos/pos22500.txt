Was looking forward to a new Xbox or NES Classic but we decided on this item as a special gift for our 6 year old.  It's more adult then child, but I can say it's really fun for the whole family.  Opening up this was a nicely package product, clearly the company cares.  No controllers...you need to use a mobile phone or tablet per car that you want to control, up too 4 vehicles per track layout. This was our Saturday before Christmas special gift and we've already ordered 2 more cars and additional track since opening last night.  Great pricing on add-ons through App at least this week.  Got stuck at one point and the company responded almost instantly on a Sunday.  I was shocked!  PS. Each car has a power on button on the bottom so if it gets stuck on connection to phone during vehicle selection just turn on/off. Happens occasionally.  You can race for 25+/- minutes before charging which takes less than 10 minutes.  Very happy with purchase!
