I make Quaker Oats old fashioned (the five min) kind.  Don't overcook, you don't want a bowl of mush, and then drain, so it has the consistency of cookie dough.  While it is warm, I stir in a couple tablespoons of this incredible powder, add walnut halves, Ceylon cinnamon and liquid stevia.O M G.  And if you use a vanilla or choc protein powder for smoothie, adding a tablespoon or two of this and blend.....well, chocolate and pnut butter??? HELLLLLO!  Low fat, extra protein, GRAND PRICE!  WHAT IS NOT TO LIKE ...if you like peanut butter!
