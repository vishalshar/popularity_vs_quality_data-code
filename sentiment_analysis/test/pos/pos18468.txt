The good:1) We can pinpoint wherever our dog is using the "Refresh GPS" feature on the map.  It typically will update our dogs location within 30 seconds of pressing the button as well as indicating our location relative to hers.  We are in a good Verizon network, so we don't have really have issues with connectivity.  If i take her out for a walk from our apartment building, it will usually indicate she has left her zone within 5 minutes.  We tested the app out by my wife taking the dog in to the woods, and not telling me where they went.  I was able to find them using the "Track" feature within 10 minutes when they started off approximately half a mile away from me.  I can see this being a life-saver, quite literally, if we ever do need it.  This app will at a minimum point you in the right direction, which is a pure gift if you are in a panic.2) Since we live in an apartment building, we are not worried about our dog leaving the home base ever.  I would have found it annoying if I got a notice  on my phone every time we took her for a walk, indicating she had left her home base.  You can turn this notification feature off.3) Power saving mode near the home base is a nice feature.  I haven't charged our unit in 5 days and its only down to 71%.  I think people who live in more rural areas away from Verizon signals will get less battery power.  It has been great for us though.4) I like the activity tracking feature, and have found it to be relatively close.  I think it counts activity as the dog physically moving. If the dog is sniffing in a spot for a minute, it will not count.  This is the only way I have found to justify 90 minutes of activity on a 2 hour long walk.  My dog really does like to sniff...Things that need work:1) The map doesn't seem to refresh the dogs location automatically once it has 'found' her.  I typically have to go to another screen and switch back to the map to get the physical location.  While this is annoying, it's not the end of the world.2) We have had a couple of occasions where the "refresh gps" wont update for 6 or 7 minutes.  While this has only happened a couple of times, I can see this being frustrating if you are in a panic looking for your dog.3) We found the unit to be a bit big, but it does not seem to bother our dog at all. We wish it were a bit smaller so it is less noticeable.
