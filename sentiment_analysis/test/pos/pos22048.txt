Purchased for my grandaughter's 5th B'Day and she, her 10 yr old brother - and everyone else in the family think it's "Awesome!"  Works beautifully, easy to understand.  They love all the different things it will do. Really, they're having a great time with it. Based on comments about batteries, I bought a set of rechargeable batteries, so they're all set.  Super happy with this purchase.
