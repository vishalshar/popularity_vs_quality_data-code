I was not sure when I ordered this if it would just be another wasted investment. I must say it was a great buy and I just love this product.So far it has not come flying off like other products I have tried that insert into the CD slot of your vehicle. No damage to my vehicles CD slot and it is easily adjustable to whatever phone you wish to use, with a thick or think case.I do think this will make a perfect gift for someone. I am planning on getting a few to give to my siblings.
