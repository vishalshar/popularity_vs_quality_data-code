I was worried about getting a sample for my vet.  I followed the instructions and put my kitty in my bathroom with a clean litter box and this sand.  She was not thrilled...walked into the box and right back out.  I left and later found she went on the bathrug.  I should have removed them.  I then covered another litter box with a plastic bag after putting some regular litter in the box.  This gave her two options.  When she could no longer wait to urinate again she chose to go in the Kit4Cat box.  I couldn't believe how simple it was to collect the sample...the urine just flowed off to the side.  My vet was a bit suspicious as he hadn't seen this product before and was afraid of contamination.  He researched it on his professional vet websites and returned to me glowing - it received great reviews from other vets and my kitty is on her way to urinary health.  Great product - just limit your cat's options as it's sand - which is different than most other cat litters.
