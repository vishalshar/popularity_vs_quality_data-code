I use this mostly for my son's football games, Feels like I am carrying around a selfie stick (could be used as one) when you have the Otterbox case accessories attached. I can also hook up my T3i to it as well for recording at my office desk. All around easy to use/setup. Durable materials, should last a great amount of time the way that I use it. Don't go thinking that this is a Pro Tripod or anything, but it certainly shines when needing it for videos in a pinch.
