If your looking for a device that prevents you from being late ever again because you can't find your keys again or any other essential item- this device might be for you! Some of the highlights of the device include:1) The ability to ring either your device or phone: This is actually one of the main reasons I decided to purchase TrackR bravo than all other competitive bluetooth devices. Located on the TrackR is a small button you can press to ring your phone, even if you put your phone on silent mode! Yes, iPhone you can always use Find my iPhone, however, the TrackR enables you to find your items in seconds vs. the trouble of logging in before you can ring your phone.2) There is no monthly service fees or subscriptions: For 30 dollars this is a definite steal. All you need to do is purchase a TrackR device and download TrackR's free TrackR app on Google Play or Apple's app store. So if your thinking of purchasing a GPS key finder, in terms of gains and losses, you might end up paying more in monthly fees than just getting a new set of keys in the long run.3) Easy to use map: Based on my IOS experience on my iPhone 6, the TrackR app super easy to use, has a map with a pinpoint of your item's location and below a button to ring your item. The app also includes the Crowd GPS feature that enables every TrackR app user to help find your item once it's out of range and Device alert and Phone alert. Device alert and Phone alert helps you from leave your device or phone behind. Once once its out of range, your phone or device will beat.4) Sleek and beautiful design: The device is about the size of a quarter and i've read it's also the slimmest in the world right now- slim enough that it can slip into my wallet perfectly! Additionally, it just looks great on your keys and an instant conversation starter.
