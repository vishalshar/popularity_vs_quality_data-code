So I didn't want to give a review on this until a couple uses. This is a good quality bike with a great vibrant color. My son LOVES this thing and it came basically fully assembled. Everything you'll need will come with it to do the rest. Mom's you can do it!!Only request I would be is once we get out of the 'baby' stage can we request less mentioning of the word 'baby' all over the bike? It's all over the tires and big kids aren't thrilled about being referenced as babies.
