Got these for my boyfriend, whose physical disability makes tying a strong knot a little bit of a challenge. This makes his life a little easier. They start out SUPER tight and ease up over time, so check out the different ways to set them, and switch it up as they loosen. Probably will only last about a year or two, but worth it for the cheap price and good usability.
