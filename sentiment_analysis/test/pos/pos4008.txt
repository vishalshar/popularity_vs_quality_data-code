Really nice set.  The knife actually can peel a kewi and the fork is sturdy.  The case is perfect for keeping all the utensils clean and in the same place.  I plan to order another set in addition to the one a keep at the office to keep in my car/purse when traveling on the road.  Would highly recommend.
