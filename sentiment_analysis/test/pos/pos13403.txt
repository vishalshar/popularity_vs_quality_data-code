I really like the mylifter.  My son set it up in the garage in about an hour and it has freed up a ton of space.  It is a really nice product and easy for me to use.  I am impressed with how much the hoist can lift.  I especially like the feature in the app that shows you how close you are to the limit so that you don't have to weigh everything to make sure you are not overloading it.  I love that I can keep things in our garage so that they are not getting ruined in the elements outside, but also that they arent taking up a ton of walking space.  I also really like how easy the app is to use.  You can name the lifter and then each time you open the app you just click on it and control it.I would recommend this product to anyone who could use more space in the garage (and who can't?).  I'm getting older and not having to reach and climb ladders to get to things is great.
