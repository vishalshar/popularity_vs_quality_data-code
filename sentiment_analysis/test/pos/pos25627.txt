Not going to lie, I was skeptical of the build quality of this board upon first receiving it. This was amplified by the fact that the existing product reviews looked a bit like they were fake. I was very pleasantly surprised. The ESP8266 is a fantastic piece of technology, and this dev board makes it a joy to develop for. Highly recommend for anyone building a small IoT project with no need for the power of a Pi.
