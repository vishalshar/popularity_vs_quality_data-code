It is a little bit tinny on some tunes, but otherwise performs well. The user interface is user friendly and very responsive. I bought this without hearing it first and after I heard Bose, UE Boom, Beats, JBL, Sony and Jambox blue tooth speakers.  This unit seems comparable for a bit better price.  The battery definitely is long lasting and the unit connects easily and quickly to my iPhone.  The device verbally tells you approximately how much battery is left.  Good idea.
