It does what I expect it to. However, I did not take into account that my Samsung Galaxy S5 Active, with the recharge trap door being in the way. I was lucky to have an LG 7 inch tablet and it worked. I scanned the house right away and found areas of the house I never expected to be cold and found that draft that's been bothering me.The unit comes with a nice hard plastic case, that should both protect the camera and make it a little easier to find in the future (although if it were bright orange it would be even easier).I have to give it a minus one star, because I very rarely give 5 stars. I wasn't impressed by the image quality (but I have no thermal comparison) and it didn't work out of the box with the S5 Active. I purchased the extension cable so it will work on the phone (when it arrives from amazon). If they make it for the S5 I missed it.Otherwise I'm happy with the unit.
