The camera is clear and the concept is great.  My only issue with this is the sensitivity seems to be a little off.  I'm getting very frequent alerts.  Tried to adjust the sensitivity but doesn't seem to help.  I had to turn off the alert but that defeats the purpose.  Hope they can fix this in their next software update.
