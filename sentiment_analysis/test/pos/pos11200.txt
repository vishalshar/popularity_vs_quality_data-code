I bought these as my "emergency utensil kit" for traveling and just keep them in my bag wherever I go. They've proven particularly useful for  opening beer bottles when no one has a bottle opener readily available. I have also taken these with me whenever I fly, and it goes through airport security for both domestic and international travel without any problems. My only complaint about this product is that it's just a little bulky.
