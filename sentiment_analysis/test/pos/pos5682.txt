In order to make its 2015 12-Inch Retina MacBook Computer so exceptionally thin, light, and sleek, Apple was only able to equip it with one USB Type-C port, located on the left side of the computer. This very useful Dash Micro G3 USB Type-C to MicroSD Card Adapter by Meenova, provides the capability of facilitating the connection of a MicroSD Memory Card to the lone USB Type-C port of the 2015 Apple Retina MacBook Computer. The adapter itself features a minimalist and understated design, it is sturdy and well-constructed, and it is compact, light, and unobtrusive. Its data and file transfer rate is very fast, and it always functions perfectly. I give this outstanding Dash Micro G3 USB Type-C to MicroSD Card Adapter by Meenova a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.
