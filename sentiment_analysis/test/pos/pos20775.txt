The nGroove Snap+ 5000 was too large a diameter to stabilize my Garmin nuvi 2798, 7 inch GPS. I called Mountek and they sent me the new 6000 series mount, which has a larger diameter. Now it holds my Garmin nuvi 2798, 7 inch GPS unit perfectly.Randy Mountek was very sympathetic as well as helpful to remedy my problem.All manufacturers should take a lesson from Randy Mountek.Thank you once again, Randy :)
