I absolutely love this thing! My coworkers are convinced that I am the crazy cat lady, but who cares! I can check on my boys from work and now have peace of mind when I go out of town for the weekend. The night vision feature makes it easy to see my cats in the morning when the kitchen is dark and the standard video is amazing in the daylight.  One of my cats comes running every time he hears the treats load in the tray.  My 10.5 year old cat knows his name and will stare at the camera when I talk to him.  I now have countless pictures of them eating treats because it makes me happy.  I love being able to share to social media and the Petwork makes it fun to see other animals enjoying their Petzi.  I have convinced a lot of people that they need one and hopefully I won't be the only one checking in on my fur babies from a far.
