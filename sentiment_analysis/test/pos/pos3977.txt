Since most of the reviews I've read of this product are from dog owners, I wanted to make sure to provide a perspective from a cat owner. My cat has kidney cancer and recently stopped using the litter box due to difficulty walking and getting in and out of the box. I thought the Pet Loo might work for her, and took a chance on it even though it's pretty expensive. When it arrived and I saw it in person, I wasn't sure she would actually use it. To my surprise, she used it the first night I had it out and has been using it ever since. It's so much easier for her, and much more convenient and clean for me to deal with than a litter box. I have it in the bedroom where she stays and there are no issues with odor or mess. She's not going to be with us much longer, but I'm very happy I bought it, since it's making her life better during her last days.
