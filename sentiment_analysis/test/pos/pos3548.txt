https://youtu.be/5V0m0n5aO7II love yard games... and rampshot is one of the best games out there. My kids love this game (aged 8 and 10) and we have some great matches. The game is made well and should last a very long time. We plan on taking this with us to the beach. I highly recommend this game to add to your collection of yard games. HAVE FUN:)
