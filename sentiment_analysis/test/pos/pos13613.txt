I got this after my old hunter system would regularly turn on by itself and run for hours on end with no warning. This was easy to install, it took less than 30 minutes to remove the old and install this one. One thing that was difficult. After installation, I needed to pull the cover off, and the entire unit pulled off the wall (because of the existing wire run, screwing into a stud wasn't an option. The front cover is all but impossible to remove once clipped in place ( I'm all ears if someone has a recommendation on how to easily remove it). The system has been very easy to use and I haven't regretted getting it at all. I'd definitely recommend it!
