My 8-year-old son loves this game!  It could take a lot of time with more players, because it gets easy to "bump" others back to start.  So younger kids may not have the patience to play.  I took away one star because I think this game is overpriced.  It's just another board game after all.  My kids got interested when it first arrived, then quickly lost interest in a few weeks.  It's not like other classics such as Apple to Apple, Connect 4, etc., that attract them for years.
