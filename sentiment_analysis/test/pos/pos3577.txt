I read a lot of reviews before I bought this, and I don't see how it can get anything other than 5 stars. I have had it for maybe two months and I have used it easily 2-5 times a week. It makes pizzas better than any pizza place in my area or that I've had traveling. I take the burner protectors off the grill and I close the lid to where it is almost touching the oven and keep it propped open with a small wrench. I let it head up at least about 40 minutes. The result has been the best pizza I've tasted that I can remember. If you had 20 of these you could out do every pizza parlor in the land. i give it 8 stars.
