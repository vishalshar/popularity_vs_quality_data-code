I love this product. I'm not a fan of all the fancy water bottles that are popular recently...the Nalgenes with the screw-top are annoying to get on and off to drink if you're just sipping at it during class or work; the metallic ones taste, well, metallic; and the bottles with the nozzle that folds up and down always seem to spray water everywhere when you open them. I was specifically looking for a classic, pop-top water bottle like this one. The fact that I can remove the bottom to make sure it stays extra clean and avoids that scuzzy, old water bottle curse is a bonus. Both the top and bottom screw on and off easily, and I've experienced no trouble with leaking when they are each secured properly. BPA free, environmentally friendly, clean, and simple. What else could I ask for?
