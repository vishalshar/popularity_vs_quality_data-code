Does it work, yes, I like the notification that the alarm has gone quiet too.  Two problems for me.  The battery is thicker than a 9V battery.  This might be an issue for some.  It will not let me latch the battery door on my alarm.  The bigger problem, my alarm KN-COSM-IB doesn't like it, no surprise. This alarm didn't like certain 9V batteries (they weren't alkaline).  I thought there would be a chance this wouldn't work but I could simply locate the battery nearby, worst case.  Since these are wired alarms there's a circuit box in the ceiling, that's where it went.  **UPDATE** just did another test while phone on cellular data only.  Response time 22 and 18 seconds for the two tests.  That's way good enough!I'd like a couple of things to be added to the product.  I'd like to be able to get an email and/or text.  I'd also like to see some rudimentary monitoring code that could run on a Windows server.  Why?  most of my lights are Z-wave controlled and it would be highly desirable to turn all lights on during an alert.
