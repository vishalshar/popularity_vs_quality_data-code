I bought the armband and thought this would be great for my bike.  I had bought a new phone and my old mount didn't work with it. I love that I can easily transfer my phone from my armband to the bike mount.  No extra parts needed.  It was easy to mount and easy to use.  My phone stays right in place and I can easily see what's on the screen.  I highly recommend this product.
