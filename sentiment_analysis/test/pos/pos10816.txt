So most of the reviews talk about the LEAF being cute and stylish, and obviously it is, not only that it is a well-made piece of jewelry, solid and flexible as well.  I am hoping to give another angle on the reviews to answer some of the questions I had prior to purchase.FunctionalitySome things are not going to be the same, especially if you have had a fit bit. Obviously there is no screen to see your number of steps, personally I like this as I have found myself concentrating on this too much in my walks, the point for me is to make healthy habits and one of these is to increase my activity level NOT to monitor how many steps I have, and the LEAF has this option.  Have mine set to monitor my activity level with a goal of being active at least 1 hour a day, in addition I have an inactivity monitor that will remind me I need to be more active, and personally I like this as well it reminds me that I am not always moving as much as I think I should.You have the option to entire different activities, which are entered in Times.One thing I do miss is the inner connection that fit bit has, I liked being connected with my friends and coworkers, especially on challenges.I also love the sleep monitor and the menstruation monitor; I am interested to see if my energy levels can be linked to one of these two trackers.Con: Right now I do not see food tracking options, not that I ever used it on the fit bit, still it is something to be mentioned.StructureThis might be a draw back for some, or a plus as it is in my case.  The LEAF is not only beautiful but has a solid construction.  One of my biggest issues with other devices are the silicone bands, I absolutely hate them on my skin.  The leaf is metal and wood, and the flexibly of where you can wear it is awesome. I have been partial to the necklace although I am sure I am losing a few steps in wearing it there- for me, it more important that I am wearing it every day which I did not in past devices, so that is a plus in my book.Battery, well I don't have to charge it, again for me, it's a plus as I remember to wear it.  With my past fit bit wristband, I would forget to put it back on after charging.  No such problem with the LEAF.The main drawback in this section is that the leaf is a bit chunky and heavy, personally I love this and it's a plus, but not everyone likes large devices.Customer ServiceIt is very rare that I ever have thought this, but Bellabeat has exceptional customer service in my opinion.  Now you have to be patient, they usually respond to an email the next day, but they truly have the customer as #1.  I asked for a larger wrist band, which they got in my shipment no problem even though I had requested after I ordered on Amazon.ConclusionSo Overall, well it's the first device I am wearing every day, that to me is well worth it.  I think the team at Bellabeat has done a good job at focusing on overall health and wellness, as much as they can in a device.  And I would encourage anyone that has tried the fit bit line to really think about giving the LEAF a try so far it is working for me.
