An extraordinary speaker.  Came promptly, was packaged securely.  I unboxed it, plugged it in and it immediately wanted to pair with one of my devices.  Pairing with my iPhone, then MacBook Pro, then Kindle Fire, was a breeze.  Terrific connection.  When I first put on some music I heard this table-rattling bass and thought, "Oh, no, I need to send this back."  Then, stupid me, I realized there was a bass volume + and - on the little remote that comes with it, and once I lowered the bass I realized:  this is an incredible speaker.  I was looking for something to replace my Bose Mini -- which is really more of a travel speaker -- b/c it doesn't fill a room like the Peachtree, and pairing is dodgy sometimes.  I disagree with some reviewers who say that this speaker isn't portable.  Yes, it's a little on the heavy side, but it feels like a speaker that's going to produce superlative sound, and it delivers.  But, you can easily unplug it and take it into another room.  Where I'm living I can't even get the volume past the 2 of 5 light bars without fear of being evicted.  The frequency range is terrific, to this non-audiophile.  It comes with three other hard-wire connections, so you can jack it into your TV or any other device (optical, A/V, 3.5mm), if that's your preference, but it's yet to lose its Bluetooth connection since I got it two days ago.  I'm hearing instruments and subtleties of sound I never heard before, except maybe with my dual driver Westone earbuds -- but I don't want to be wired up to earbuds all day.  Everything is easy with this speaker.  The remote is self-explanatory, the manual written by someone who is actually literate, and the equipment nonpareil.  I have never owned a better speaker.  Well worth the price.  I'd love to turn it all the way up and see if it distorts (I doubt it), but I like this new place I live in, so I'm fine where it is.  If I could give this purchase 10 stars I sincerely would.
