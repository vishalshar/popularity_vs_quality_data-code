I love these brush guards!! I plan on buying some more of these for other brushes I have. They hold the bristles in shape perfectly after washing the brushes and allows you to dry them upside down so the water runs off the bristles instead of sitting in the brush where the glue is and shortening the life of the brush. Even if it isn't a brush that you need to wash after every use, they are still a fantastic thing to hold the brushes in shape and keep dust off the brush because you can store them bristle side down. Again, I love this product and I will be buying more of the other packs!!
