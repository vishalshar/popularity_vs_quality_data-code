We've tried and been disappointed by several speakers on the market, some from companies that are recognized as providing high quality products. This is NOT the case with Libratone! It's cute, super portable, durable and the sound is great. The design is also clever and reminiscent of a dial on a traditional radio.  The color is playful and it's nice to hold or look at on my bathroom counter.  Can't wait to test drive it on my next trip.
