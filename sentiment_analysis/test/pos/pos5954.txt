This is such an amazing little speaker. Although its small the sound is amazing and you will definitely notice its built in subwoofer right away. The set up is extremely easy. The rubber sealed lid to gain access to all the possible inputs. As you can see from the picture, you can connect this speaker directly to your music device via 3.5 mm aux cord if you do not have bluetooth avaialble. You can also connect this speaker to a headphone, in case you need to enjoy your music privately and wants good sound quality. Also avaialbe, is a little TF card slot where you can stick your micro SD card in if that's how you store you music. Finally 3 hour brings the battery to full charge and I was able to use it for 6+ hours straight in an outdoor environment. I had it at our patio for a party , and it was raining a bit. I did not have to worry if the speaker would get a bit wet due to the weather, because this speaker is WATERPROOF. How awesome is that. Also, do not underestimate the weight of this little speaker. Because its a little power house, it's actually a bit heavy. I would say its about 7 lb. But you can tell that its solidly built and rugged. Perfectly suitable for the outdoors.What is also included in box are the charging cable, Aux cable , carrying case, and a user manual. The setup is extremely easy and user friendly. Once the speaker is turned no, it automatically starts the pairing mode so you could link it with your music device with ease. It automatically connects with known device, when you enter the room, which is awesome. I am really enjoying this little speaker, as it is small and doesn't take up much space, yet the sound quality is superb. I will be using this a lot so I think this is well worth for the money.I hope you find this review helpful for your purchase. I try my best to provide as much info about this product as possible.
