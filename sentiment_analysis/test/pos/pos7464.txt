This was bought as a christmas present for my girlfriends younger brother. He is 15 and needed a phone that could run facebook and access the internet while remaining unlocked so we could take advantage of any plan. It has yet to be used but will update this review when I have seen it used for a little while and he tells me what he thinks of it.
