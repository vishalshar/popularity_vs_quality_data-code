Exactly what I wanted. Solid, substantial and very well made. Holds both my iPhone five and my iPhone six on my end table with just a tiny footprint. Heavy weight plus extra sticking power on the base keep this on the table when I lift the devices off of it.  Especially convenient as I found it really annoying having to lift my old stands to keep them steady while I pulled the phones off.  If your device is Apple you need to supply your own cables. It comes with cables only for Android devices. My Apple cables fit perfectly through the cable control and phone mounting areas. Note: I'd give it 5 stars except it is very expensive. But it does the job and I couldn't find any comparable dual-device charging stand with a small footprint and adequate weight to keep it in place.
