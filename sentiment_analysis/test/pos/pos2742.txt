I love Sous Vide!!!!  I am a research fool, and I've been seeing this on Iron Chef a LOT.  The more I researched, the more intriguing it got.  I had a bit of a problem with the machine.  I went to use it (for the third time) and NOTHING.  Sur La Table had THE best customer service.  I told them (Lisa) what happened, and no questions asked, and the Fed Ex guy was at my door the next morning to pick it up for replacement.  Anyway, this thing is magic. I:E I had PERFECT success with a 2 1/2 lb. chuck roast.  I cooked it for 49-50 hours, on 133F.  It was medium rare, and THE most delicious, flavorful, tender piece of meat we have EVER tasted!  I made a little sauce from the drippings. I saut√©ed 2 tbls. of minced onions, 1 tsp. minced garlic in a little EVOO, then added  a the drippings, 2 tsp. Worchester sauce, 1/2 cup Chardonnay, a pinch (1/4 tsp.) of tarragon, and 1 tbls. of "better than bouillon" (this stuff rocks!).  I reduced it by 1/2, added a nob of butter to thicken, and ..........OMG!!!!!  We never made it to the table!  We just stood in the kitchen, taking alternate bites, with a little drizzle of sauce.  HEAVEN! :)I do suggest you acquire a copy of Modernist Cooking Made Easy: Sous Vide: The Authoritative Guide to Low Temperature Precision Cooking Paperback, because I crucified a sirloin tip roast by cooking it too long.  So much for research:)
