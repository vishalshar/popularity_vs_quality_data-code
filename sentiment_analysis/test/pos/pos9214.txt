AMAZING!!!!! Our dog Britney was diagnosed with kidney disease. Our vet gave us a prescription for Science Diet K/D. So we were feeding the wet and dry variety of the K/D----problem though is that Britney would pick at it and sometimes not want to eat it at all. (not good) She also seemed to be losing weight because of that and was looking frail. Being upset about this situation I looked on line to try and find something that could help her enjoy a good quality of life. I came across a woman who had a Chihuahua that the doctors said only had a couple more months to live due to kidney issues.The woman started feeding her dog different things which included Solid Gold Green Tripe--and she had good results--Her dog lived for another 3 years. As with anything you read online, you have to really do your research and also make sure that common sense prevails---I wasn't comfortable with some of the things she was feeding her dog, but as I read in her blog and elsewhere, the green tripe is a good source of protein for the dog without making the kidneys work as hard as with other proteins. I have been feeding Britney 1/4 can of the Green Tripe with 1/4 can of the K/D (having the two together makes the K/D palatable for her) plus a handful or two of the K/D dry food at each meal. She has gained some weight back, her coat looks great, and she has actually been running around and jumping up again! I am really happy with the results of Green Tripe and our 13 year old Britney is too! :0)
