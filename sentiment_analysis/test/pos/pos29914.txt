I have been using a Nexus 5x but couldn't resist the Robin when it went on sale.Initial observations: you will need a case as the phone itself is very slippery, also I do prefer the location of the fingerprint sensor on the back of the Nexus.Having said that I do prefer the Robin, it does not (so far) have the occasional lag that the Nexus does and the big one for me is that the sound is excellent, I always had to use the Nexus on full volume, earpiece or speakerphone but the Robin is much louder and the speakerphone is probably the best I have used.I have only had the phone a week so I will add more to this review in a few weeks.
