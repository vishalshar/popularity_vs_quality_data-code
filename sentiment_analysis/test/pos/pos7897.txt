I absolutely love this product. The first side grew very quickly, and I had very nice looking mushrooms in about 10 days as advertised. I didn't get to eat them because I was going out of town but gave them to my mother who said they were absolutely delicious. The second side only grew a small amount so it didn't turn out so well. We also had a cold front come in and I had them right next to the window so I don't know if that had anything to do with it. I would totally get this product again. So fun!
