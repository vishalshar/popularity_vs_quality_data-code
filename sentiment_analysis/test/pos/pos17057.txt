Just got the bike kit yesterday, so I don't have a take on long term durability, but it seems to have the right plastics in the right places. Mounting was easy, but with the short 70 mm stem on my new mountain bike (wide bars and short stems have become the style), there isn't room for the mounting bracket there, so I had to put it on the bars. But, angled back toward me and mounted horizontally, it seems pretty well protected in the event of a crash. The mounting system seems very solid.  Biggest complaint is the position of the charging hole, which doesn't quite match up with the charging port on my iPhone 5S. But, if you push hard you can deflect the top edge of the Quad lock hole and get the plug into place. It will not work with a iPhone 5 charger tip on a wide adapter (bought an adapter to use my old iPhone 4 cable). There is no charging hole in the poncho rain cover, so if you plan to run with an extra power source for long rides, you'll have to either go without the poncho or drill a hole in it. It's a lot to pay for a few pieces of plastic, but the design seems solid.
