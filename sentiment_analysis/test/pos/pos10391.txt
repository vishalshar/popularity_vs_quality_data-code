I LOVE this duvet cover. I was concerned that 300 count would not be soft. Boy was I wrong!! I was also disappointed that I could only get it in white. Now I'm so glad that I have white. By adding some colorful pillows and a throw at the foot of the bed I can change the look without a lot of expense. The thing that is best of all is being able to unzip the sheet and wash it without taking the comforter out and struggling to get it back in the duvet cover.  I have ordered another one for my queen bed and also one as a wedding presentThank you simplified bedding!!!!!
