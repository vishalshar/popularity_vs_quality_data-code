After finding the Waka Waka Power+ product on a CNet review, I decided to buy this solar charger because I do go camping at least once a year in my local mountains with family and friends. After placing the order, I received the solar charger in two business days (even during the Christmas rush) ! The light was already on when the deliveryman delivered it to my doorstep. Maybe there should be a foam covering on the activate button during shipment, but so far, the delivery did not weaken or damage the charger. I took it on a cruise to Latin America, and it charged my smart phone up in about two hours, with some power left (two LEDs out of four). Charging the charger after I got back home was easy with a standard mini-USB cable versus the sun, which some people complained about not fully charging the unit with only the sun for power. I think I'll take a camping trip in the summertime to see how much the Power+ can handle with a sun charging session. There's also the automobile battery for emergency purposes, if the sun doesn't provide adequate charging capacity. Also, I hope the Waka Waka website permits more countries for donating a Power+ solar charger instead of three countries in their current causes.  -Brian
