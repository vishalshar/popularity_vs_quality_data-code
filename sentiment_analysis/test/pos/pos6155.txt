Actually took me a few hours to replace but only because I was probably being a little too careful each step of the way and not applying enough pressure to disconnect and reconnect everything. There was a minor display issue but the company was quick to recommend a solution and provide a replacement when the solution did not work.The demonstration video was very thorough and was able to get me through the process, however, I had a few issues with it. Because I am rating the product, and not the video, I am giving 5/5, but I would have to give the video a 3-4/5. There were quite a few steps where I was not able to tell what he was unscrewing or disconnecting because it wasn't zoomed in and his hand was in the way. He would just say "Ok now unscrew the (whatever)" and he would unscrew one screw about half way then it would cut to the next step. I was ultimately able to follow along but it added a lot of time to my process.
