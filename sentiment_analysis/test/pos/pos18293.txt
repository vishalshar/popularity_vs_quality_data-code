Like most new products this one is still improving. The most improvement is needed at CS level. They seem not to be able to communicate efficiently. After updating iphone to ios 10the new Home app is not working with the lock so in asking CS about the remote  functionality they kept saying the lock is compatible with the homekit framework (whihc is used through the Home app, and that Home app is not working yet...took me 3 wk to get to the right answer ...by myself... so here it is what:While Home app is not working with August lock the remote functionality is available through the widget. The widget is an API to the homekit framework. To use the remote functionality you'll have to add the widget to the quick access list of your iphone. To check the functionality, after pairing August smartlock with apple tv gen 4 disable bluetooth and wi-fi and lock/unlock the door using the widget. Please note that Home app will not recognize your lock until we release the new firmware which at this time is still under development.
