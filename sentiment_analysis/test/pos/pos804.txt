The glasses are very thin as the name suggests and are very light.  To make them compact, they have no earpieces, the glasses are of the pince nez style which means they clip on to the bridge of the nose.  It takes some trial and error to find the best place to fit them and they are not as stable as the usual glasses when worn.  I like that my glasses and cellphone are together since I need the glasses to read the screen and I always know where the glasses are.
