I bought this speaker while we were living in Hawaii and it was perfect!  We could bring it to the beach, the pool, on bike rides and much more!  I also love the fact that I am not afraid of my 2 year old dropping it.  We have had no issues with it in the sand or near water, and have dropped it multiple times.  The sound is amazing and I prefer it over any other portable speakers I have heard.  Great purchase!
