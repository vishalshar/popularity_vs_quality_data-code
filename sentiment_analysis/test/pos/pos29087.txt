I ordered this mount (a bundle with an iottie air vent mount) after my old CD player phone mount was no longer sufficient for my phone and case combo and after realizing that magnet mounts with just suction cups would not work for my phone or car. I thought the inclusion of a sticky pad would solve the issue I had with securing mounts that used only suction cups to my dash board. Unfortunately, I experienced the same problem with the iOttie mount. Unfortunately, the sticky gel pad would not stick to the best spot on my dash board, which is in the center (I do not want something permanently stuck on my window). My dash board has a speaker right in the center of it (pic 1 of 2). Unfortunately, after trying a few times to adhere the sticky pad to the speaker, it was obvious it would not stick. As a result, the only location I could affix the sticky pad to is off center and in the way (pic 2 of 2).
