With all of the horror stories I've read about the first gen version of this lock, I was pretty hesitant about spending this much on what appeared to be a faulty product.  However, I'm happy to say that I'm pretty satisfied with it overall once I accepted it's limitations and worked my way around the pretty unintuitive and uninspired iPhone app.I went "all in" with August and bought the lock, keypad, connect, and doorbell.  So I'll be talking about all four here and how they interoperate.Here are the biggest flaws of the lock:1.  Bluetooth LE radius from iPhone is pretty poor and kinda spotty if you get more than 15 feet from the device.  In a way, its always a bit spotty.  This may be a limitation of Bluetooth LE, and I've decided to accept it as a way for the lock to save battery life. I don't hold this particular issue against the lock as its one of those few connected devices in the house that runs on batteries all the time, so I really feel like we need to cut it some slack here.  I've never had a situation where it wouldn't connect within ten seconds and I'm okay with that.2.  The Wifi radio on both the doorbell and the connect is absolutely horrible.  I don't know if they used substandard parts or what... Luckily my home has wired ethernet throughout the house, so I had the ability to place another WIFI hotspot within 15 feet of the doorbell and another WIFI hotspot 15 feet from the Connect.  Before doing that, getting either to have a "good" signal was NOT going to happen.  All of my other wifi gadgets were absolutely happy with my current wifi signal, but oh no, not the August Doorbell or the Connect.  Those wanted EXTRA special super strong signals.  I swear the August engineers (engineer?) just used his small testing lab room to test out these signals and said, "eh, that'll do."  The doorbell video would go in and out and the Connect would infrequently connect to the doorbell remotely.  Once I added the new hotspots it all works just fine.  So I'd say that unless you have the ability to either put your router near your doorbell and the Connect... well then you are going to be pretty unhappy with performance and the whole experience here.  If you DO have the ability to add more hotspots in your house, then you better learn how to do so before buying either the Doorbell or the Connect to remotely unlock this lock.  Oh and I should mention that the Connect must be within a few FEET of your lock, otherwise the Bluetooth LE connection to the lock will not be good either.  So I hope you have an outlet near your lock.  I hope you are taking note of all the crazy requirements I'm laying out here...3.  You can't set any kind of temporary or recurring access for the keypad.  This means that the guest either always has a code or they don't.  For some people, mainly the oldest generation, pulling out their phone to open the door is a pretty difficult concept to grasp.  Therefore, I don't have much choice but to give them access via the keypad and that means they have access all of the time.  I'm not fond of that at all.  I hope they change this someday.  Sure, I can change the code pretty fast and make them request a new code every time they want to come in... but for certain people in your lives, this seems a bit wrong.  I don't know... maybe many reading this review wouldn't care... but coming from the Qwikset Smartcode, it was something I was trying to solve for with this lock.4.  The iPhone app -  Here's where the whole experience really suffers.  It's pretty clear to me that August is in serious need of true software engineering and development talent.  The app takes a lot of getting used to.  "Intuitive" is never a word I would use for this app, especially in setting up the lock, Connect, doorbell, and keypad.  it feels very home grown by one software engineer who could use some help.  Once you have it all set up, its fairly easy to use, but even then its pretty rough around the edges.  Things just aren't where you would expect them to be.  For example, the settings on the doorbell are in a different place than the settings for the lock.  Setting up the keypad isn't on the main page where you set up the lock and doorbell.  Its buried within the locks settings.  If, for some reason, it needs to be buried in the lock settings, at least direct the user on where they'd find that setting from the home screen.  When you invite someone as a guest to use your lock, you can NEVER get that invite to leave the invitations list, even if you remove them as a guest or they accept the invitation.  I could go on and on... and on.  All that being said though, once you set it up, its certainly usable enough.  Just don't even think about giving this to someone who doesn't love figuring out new technology.  It will be a very frustrating experience for them.  The app is FAR from polished and this alone would keep me from recommending to all but the gadget lover like myself.Here's are the things I really liked about the lock:1.  The keypad always works flawlessly to unlock the lock.  Having come form the Kwikset smart code, I was pretty used to using a keypad to unlock my door.  To me, it is an absolute requirement that I have a phone-free ability to unlock this lock from outside.  I don't have my phone attached to my hip 24/7 after all and the last thing I want to do is get locked out or not have another quick option when the lock doesn't auto-unlock via the phone.  I can promise you that my wife would have never gone for this lock if it didn't have a keypad option.  Honestly, just do yourself a favor and make the keypad a requirement for purchase on your most use entry point.  You'll thank me.2.  When you have the Connect, the auto-unlock actually works and definitely feels like magic.  It's actually so cool and seamless that I worry that the lock had never locked when I had left the house, but then if you check the activity, you'll see that indeed it did lock and then unlocked moments before you grabbed the handle.  That's so cool!3.  I really appreciate the activity tracker to know who has come and gone from the house.4.  I like that the exterior lock face is a normal face.  Certainly makes the exterior of the house look better than it did with the Kwikset Smartcode pad.5.  I love the ability to give someone guest access to the house on a temporary basis.  The keypad is nice for this as I don't have to get anyone set up with the app in order to give them keys.  Say you are going away on vacation for a week.  You can assign a code for a neighbor and then when you get back you can just revoke it.  Thats easier than setting up the app on their phone any day.  Plus the activity tracker will show when they used the code.  For a housekeeper, this isn't such a great option... but I expect those who service the house to deal with the app, so that works out alright.So overall, am I happy with my purchase?  Yes.Do I feel more secure than I did with the kwikset smart code?  Yes.  Why?  Because that had no activity tracking and giving out a code to the cleaning lady was a huge hassle, especially when you wanted to change it.  Also, if I gave out a code, I was giving them something they could use anytime on any day.  So you certainly felt insecure in that regard being that they could accidentally give it out and someone else would have access to your house without you ever knowing.  This solves that problem and is a big step forward to me.Would I recommend this to friends or family?  Only if they meet the requirements I've set out above.  They would need to love sometimes frustrating gadgets.  They would need a SUPER STRONG wifi signal throughout the house, especially where the lock is located.  They would need to buy the full set of the lock, keypad, and connect or the doorbell if the lock is to be used on the same door as the doorbell.  Otherwise, move along, this is not the lock for you.If you DO meet all these crazy requirements, then go right ahead and buy this (and the keypad, and connect... I don't recommend it otherwise).  This is the only lock in the business that meets all of my needs and it's got some pretty great features that integrate nicely, such as the doorbell cam.Update:  I bought a August lock to go with my August doorbell that I had previously installed.  Add this on to the list of things I don't like about the iPhone app.  Turns out that you have to set up the lock first, and then the doorbell afterwards.  Otherwise, the two don't work together even if they are named the same thing.  I had to factory reset the doorbell and set it up again to get it to work with the lock.  Poor, sloppy programming.
