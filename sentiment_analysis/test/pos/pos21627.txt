I just ran a Spartan race and was concerned about my Camelbak absorbing too much water and holding lots of mud while I ran. So I ordered this Dolfin Pack to use instead. Definitely the best decision I could have made. This pack is super comfortable and light. It fits securely and thanks to the neoprene, it did not chafe me in the least even when I was soaking wet. Since the straps are fitted using velcro instead of buckles, adjustments were easy and fast. Plus the pack did not shift as I drank the water.No mud stayed inside due to the drain holes in the bottom so I had zero added weight from mud and muck.The water storage capacity is perfect. I did not fill mine completely full so I had a bit of space to include a waterproof bag with a tracker inside for my husband to follow my progress with. There is no additional storage space otherwise. I'm a bit torn on whether I would want that or not as it could compromise how the pack fits and drains but for a longer race, I will need to have fuel like GU or NUUN tabs with me so I may need to find another way to do that.I did have to use a bit more pressure on this bite valve to get water out but it wasn't anything that affected my thoughts on the pack.This thing was completely coated with mud after the race but washed clean in only a couple minutes with cool water and a cleaning brush. This will now be the pack I use for every race I run. I have a beast in August and a half marathon in Sept. and I plan to use this pack for all my OCRs.Thank you Dolfin Pack!! I was not paid to write this or given anything for a good review so this is what I truly think of the product.Since this worked so well, I am also looking at the hydration armband for short runs. Once you find something this good, you stick with ti!
