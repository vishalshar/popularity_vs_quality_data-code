My husband bought this because he felt he was slouching at his work computer. Setup was very easy.  Pros: has a reminder buzz when you slouch and it's easy to use. Cons: When you set the alignment, there isn't enough variance between moving forward and backwards... it seems like there's a 1/2" variance before it buzzes to tell you that you are slouching. It would be nice to have a larger range. Your coworkers can hear it buzz/vibrates, if you're sharing it in close proximity.  Also, if you leaning quickly forward, and your shirt goes away from your skin, you can't feel it buzz. Overall, it's a great idea, a great tool to let you know when you are slouchy. The features/use of the product really would be better at about $50.00 IMHO.
