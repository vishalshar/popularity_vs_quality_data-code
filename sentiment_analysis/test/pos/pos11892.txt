I have experienced a few VR headset demo's now, and have found that Merge is the best choice. The headset is extremely durable, easy to use, comfortable, and light. I have not experienced any overheating (as was the case with some other VR headsets) as long as I remember to take my cell phone case off. The kiddo's are loving it! It's not too complicated for them, and I'm not afraid of it getting broken or ruined. The strap adjusts to fit little heads and stays on quite nicely. I also love that you can fit any smart phone in it! My husband has the new google nexus and I've had friends use their iphone 6 with no problems. Will be ordering another soon!
