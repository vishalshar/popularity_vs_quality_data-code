I bought this for my husband as I'm trying to get him to take better care of his skin and I love this company's other products (LOVE their shaving oil). Initially, he refused to use a "face cream" but I insisted and now he is hooked! He loves using it! I can tell that his skin looks healthier and with less irritation around his neck. I also love the looks of the packaging. It's sleek and compact, which I think is one of the reasons he doesn't mind using it in the locker room at the gym. We'll be definitely purchasing again
