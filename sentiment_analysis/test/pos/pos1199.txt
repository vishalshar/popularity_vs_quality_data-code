I'd give this product 10 stars if I could!I use mason jars *a lot*, for all sorts of things. The two-piece metal lids are great for home canning, but not very practical for other uses. You can buy plastic one-piece lids, but they're not airtight or watertight. That's still okay for some things, but for food and drink you need something better. That's when you need the reCAP.It absolutely, positively does NOT leak! Ever! (In my experience, anyway.) After a week of constant use I was so impressed I went and ordered 3 more reCAPs. Still no leaks, even when shaken vigorously! And the pour-spout doesn't drip or dribble.The only thing I would change is to alter the flip-cap slightly so that it can "lock" open. The flip-cap sometimes falls closed when you tilt your jar for pouring. To minimize this you can either temporarily remove that part of the cap (it clicks back in place when you're done, no problem), or you can turn the jar so that the flip-cap will point sideways when you tilt the jar, rather than straight up. It's really not a big deal.P.S. The manufacturer says the reCAP is dishwasher safe, but recommends hand-washing to extend the life of the cap. Replacements rubber gaskets are available.
