I had to order a replacement.  My first one is DOA.  It has been charging for 12 hours with the supplied charger and the device is warm.  So, I know it is getting power from the base; however, it will not turn on and the app says it needs to be recharged.  New device should be here in a couple of days.  Hopefully I'll get a working device and will be able to do a proper review.[UPDATE]Received the new device.  It has worked great.  My dog has gotten out of the backyard a couple of times and the tracker has worked beautifully for notifying us when he's out and where he's gone to.  It does take two minutes to notify us when he's left the area and by that time he is way down the road; however, once tracking is initiated it has allowed us to successfully locate him and bring him back home.  If there were problems with the device they appear to have been fixed.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that likes to run off on adventures!
