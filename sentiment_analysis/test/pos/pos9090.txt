I rarely post reviews, but I feel as a longtime Android user my feedback on this product would be helpful.  I've had this lock for a little less than a week, here are my impressions:1. Packaging - As others have noted here, the packaging is outstanding...however, I was a bit confused by the lack of a detailed installation guide.  Fortunately, the online guide is very well put together, but definitely go there first!2. Lock Installation - It really is pretty easy to install, with a few caveats. First, my original door lock was of the double cylinder type (key on both sides of the deadbolt.  These are better than the thumb latch type of locks you usually see; however THIS TYPE OF LOCK WILL NOT WORK with August.  You have to have the thumb latch type of lock (key on only one side).  Fortunately I had to replace my old lock anyway, and the KwikSet thumb latch locks are only $12 at Home Depot.  Once I got that straightened out, installation was really pretty simple...just attach the provided mounting plate with the thumb latch lock long screws, then detach the "wings" on either side of the August smartlock, fit it around the mounting plate, and you're ready to install the app.3. App Installation - This is also simple but a little tricky.  You download the app from the App Store as usual, but the first thing mine did was try to apply a firmware update.  This took about 15 min, and eventually timed out.  When I called customer support, they said it was already up to date.  Normally, a well designed app will tell you it has all relevant updates applied before it starts to download a new one, but ok...I have the most recent update.  You may want to check your version before you start...as of 5/25/16, the newest app version is  4.4.50, and the firmware version (available under Lock Settings) is 7147e875-2.1..103-2.1.103.4. Calibration and Use - I found that before you use the lock, you have to calibrate it...basically let the lock know what the open and closed position is relative to its own gearing.  You do this from the Lock Settings menu, and it worked fine the first time.Remote lock and unlock can be spotty.  I find I generally get pretty wide Bluetooth coverage in the house, but occasionally I find I have to reconnect it.  The auto unlock functionality in particular is hard to get right.  It works on a geofencing principle...when you get outside a certain radius from the lock, it sets a flag.  When you return inside that perimeter, it resets that flag and prepares to let the lock know you're coming in.  When you approach the door, the lock will then unlock...pretty cool when it works.  I spent a little time with August customer service and was advised to set the geofence area to Large (800 meters) for Android...that seems to make it work (not sure what the best setting is for Apple).  One other tip if you're having trouble:  set the auto unlock notifications on, that way you'll get a notification in the notification shade that you've left (and re-entered) the geofence area.5. August Connect - I bought one of these ($80 on Amazon, a bit overpriced I thought) to enable me to open and close the lock remotely via the Internet.  Basically it's just a simple dongle that you plug into an outlet near the lock...you then connect it to your wireless via the August setup app.  It basically emulates the Bluetooth functionality, except you'll see a little wireless icon on the main screen...hit that to fetch the lock status and lock/unlock.  I've found it works pretty well...occasionally you'll get an "unable to fetch status" message, but I'm getting a pretty good hit rate.Finally, a word about their customer service:  I found it outstanding.  One thing I love that is rare in this day and age:  when you call, you get connected to a live person immediately (no voicemail menus), and it's obviously onshore support.  They are also pretty knowledgeable about their product (no Tier 1 and Tier 2...the person you talk to first can solve your problem).  Hope they can keep that up...it's probably a pricier structure than your average shop.Overall:  Outstanding, novel product, a bit overpriced but it does what it says.  I love walking up to my door with an armful of groceries and having the door unlock for me...that's what automation is supposed to be about!One other note:  I'm not being paid to do this review, and I paid full price (and then some) for this product!
