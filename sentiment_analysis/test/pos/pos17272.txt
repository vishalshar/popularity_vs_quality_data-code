I have to say that this is definitively one of the best training devices money can buy, I had a great experience since the first time I use my Recon jets, the way to see all the information without turning my head out of the road its amazing, you can customize all the data fields and choose what you want to see, I can also use my Garmin Virb Camera from the Recon Jets and pair my cadence and speed sensors, HRM etc. without a problem. Also the RECONJET APP for my iPhone its phenomenal, all the information you can retrieve and analyze after workout its a great feature not many devices provide so much information as Recon jet. Battery life its ok about 4.0Hrs with energy saving and no videos or photos just GPS enough for a nice 100 miles ride. I have to say that the safety features on the Glasses are great, I had an accident on my triathlon Bike at 28mph my head impact the asphalt with my helmet and the glasses to, I did scratch the lenses and the battery pack however the Recon Jet never broke or cause any major injure on my face, I am sure that I was very lucky to wear the glasses that day. It was very easy to replace the lenses and the battery pack from the RECON INSTRUMENTS Website, I am also very pleased and grateful with RECON INSTRUMENS because after what happened they were very kind to offer me to take a look to my unit and if necessary replace it for a new one. Customer Support its one of the best I ever had to deal with, they always keep posted about the status of my case until the final delivery and it was a great outcome for me.If you have the money do not hesitate, buy it you wont regret promise.
