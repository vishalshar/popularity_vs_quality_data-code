Suitcases were carried with brute force for several decades until someone had the great idea to put wheels on them. A simple change that revolutionized travel comfort. Bluesmart takes it to the next level.TARGET AUDIENCE:If you are a traveling professional, no need to look any further, this is the best carry-on luggage you could own. But if you only travel occasionally with your family, this might not be the best fit for you. I fall into the business traveler category with frequent flights between Miami and Chicago.FEATURESPORTABLE CHARGER: Every busy traveler will attest that sometime, somewhere, they forgot their cell phone charger and had to walk to the front desk and ask to borrow one. Furthermore, we all know that the seats around the cell phone charging stations are usually jam packed. That problem is finally solved once and for all. No need to lug that power bank around anymore; its another needless travel accessory. Hats off to Bluesmart.SPACE: These days carry-on luggage is designed to maximize the amount of things you can pack in them; this suitcase is no different. I can pack my laptop, charger, two hefty notebooks, a change of clothes, and two boxes of Cuban pastries, and the luggage easily handles it all.LOCK FEATURE: Pretty neat feature! If you walk away from the suitcase, e.g., from one room to another, you receive a gentle alert on your cell phone that you have left your case behind, and it automatically locks itself. Every year hundreds of carry-ons are misplaced by tired passengers. Most of the bags are eventually reunited with their owners, but this feature could avoid that panic moment when you realize your bag is no longer with you. The suitcase can also be locked and unlocked with a neat cell phone app, and if you don't have a cell phone, dont worry, because the lock can be operated manually with keys.LOCATE FEATURE: Another carefully thought-out feature. Even if the suitcase is turned off, you can still use this feature to locate it anywhere in the world. Even better news is that the global coverage is provided free of charge by Bluesmart. As a side note, if you habitually lose things, Tile (Gen 2) - Phone Finder. Key Finder. Item Finder  - 1 Pack is a similar product that helps you locate your lost items like keys, cell phones, glasses, etc.LOOK AND FEEL: Extremely well-made product and with a sleek finish and contrasting blue, its right out of a Steve Jobs playbook. The quality of the zipper, which is typically the first point of failure, appear to be of very good quality. Likewise, the quality padding and smooth flowing handles all add to the sharp look.CONSI fully charged the suitcase before my business trip to Chicago, and everything worked like a charm. The following evening I was due to fly back to Miami, and being so busy, I forgot to charge the suitcase while in Chicago. At the airport, I found that I needed to charge my cell phone, so I turned on the suitcase and plugged in my cell phone charger. Within half an hour, the suitcases battery was drained, the red light was blinking, and it stopped charging my cell phone.I emailed Bluesmart about this issue, and this was their reply:Thanks for reaching out, that's a great question. By design once the internal battery in your carry-on has been depleted, your suitcase will no longer charge peripheral devices. This is intentional on our part, as we want to make sure that your luggage still has a small amount of battery reserved for the location tracking feature should you ever lose your luggage when traveling. Please let us know if you have any additional questions and thank you for your time!Now this creates a dilemma. Do I now need to carry a portable power bank for my cell phone as a precaution? I, and possibly many others, would rather go without the carry-ons location tracking feature than end up with a dead cell phone.SUMMARY: Samsonite-type giants missed the first round of this innovation. But mark my words, they are going to catch-up. However, until we see competition, this is the king of carry-ons. Maybe the future versions will be lightweight, hard-sided cases that are capable of longer range you left me behind signals, and perhaps they will incorporate an option for the user to override the battery reserve when needed. I would not drop everything and run out and buy this suitcase, but if you need to buy a new carry-on, this is the go-to product. No doubt about it. Definitely a great innovation!Some other products that you might like are:Businessmen And Backpain go hand in hand.
