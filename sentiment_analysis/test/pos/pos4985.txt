I'll update this regarding Onyx's performance  as a 2-way communicator when I've had a bit more experience...Getting going was a real struggle, but Tech Support (via email) got back to me in a few days, and now both Onyx units work.The available documentation (paper, and web) was ambiguous enough to keep me frustrated. With my new understanding, I recommend that you "pair" with your phone BEFORE charging either unit!  Also turn the volume up by pressing the volume rocker up 5 or 6 times, Otherwise you may be confused by misunderstood LED patterns and lack of audible signals .
