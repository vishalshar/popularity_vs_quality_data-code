Great product and reliable, starts fires every time also always carry if you go camping and need to start an easy fire in the rain. I just lit the package and piled sticks on. Since it has a great burn time it would dry out the small to medium sticks. Of anyone has tried starting a fire in the rain from scratch you know how nice this will be. Doesn't even have to rain
