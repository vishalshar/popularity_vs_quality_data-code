Quality tool.  Very reasonable price !  Purchased 2 tools.  Tried it out on seatbelt material, cut like butter.  I placed one in my truck and one in my wife's Honda.  Fits the visor. Low profile, instant access.  As a prepper, I find this tool to be well worth the money.  Other units I looked at were too large.  This visor mounted tool is perfect.  Hey, you never know......
