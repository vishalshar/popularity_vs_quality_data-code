To install, you just stick the lens over your phone lens.  Don't think I got it aligned perfectly but it still gave a clear image.  To remove it you just peal it off.  You need good strong light to have image bright enough to see clearly and you'll have to rest your phone on the lens case to hold it steady enough to focus.  I use a thin blade pocket knife to remove the lens.  A small, thin plastic spatula would be a nice addition so removal could be done without getting fingerprints on it or damaging it with a knife.
