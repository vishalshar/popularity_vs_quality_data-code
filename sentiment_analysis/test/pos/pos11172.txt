This is an excellent phablet. Apparently, there aren't many 7" phablets out there that have dual sims, SD card and 4G LTE. The screen res is OK. This was a gift for my son, he was thrilled to have pokemon running and able to use data.Fair warning though, do not purchase this as a refurb. Get it new. It's about a $10 difference. It's worth spending. My first purchase had to be returned. It came with missing accessories, and a lock code. I simple wipe wasn't enough, google had to get involved to get it to work. I just returned it in the end. There was even a lockscreen pic and dead pixel. Just buy it new.
