I have great hopes that this will be an awesome device when  I can get the firmware update  - but at present I still am working with support to get firmware updated and their instructions did not work (there is no 'upload' new firmware!)  the unit that I purchased from Amazon (and that arrived a few days ago) was on firmware 1.2-ish.!  I bought this unit because of the qualcomm all-play compatibility (which came in  at firmware versions 3ish.) I suspect that my firmware may do spotify, but as I do not, I haven't bothered testing that.At present, there isn't a place on the support site to find recent firmware - it is supposed to be automatic and ask you  - but that is if you have more recent firmware loaded. There is no obvious way to upload manually (easily) on my older firmware version. So contacted support and they did got back promptly to me with a copy of the most recent firmware, and instructions. But ... either the 1.2ish firmware is sooooooo old that their instructions will not work on it and without added steps they've forgotten are needed,  or something else is wrong. I got back to them but after the first quick turnaround, there has been no additional answers or acknowledgements.I will edit this when I get it working, or if I send it back because I cannot get it updated.2016-April 16I increased by a star - it is now awesome, but the process to get it there was a bit more work than I would have liked. I would get more -  (because it is awesome) but don't want to because I dread doing the week or two to get things up. Please remember, however, if I were doing spotify, it likely would have worked from the beginning, but I was interested in the qualcomm allplay capability. I also was desperate to get to the version of firmware that would allow me to turn off gramofons own wireless extender network as it seemed to mess a bit with computers/tablets who were trying to connect to my preferred extenders - everyone has the same ssid name)After going back and forth a bit, the firmware is updated the 3.1.9, which means that now the allplay works. Yea. It really is quite cool. I have it connected to the aux input of a small shelf-size stereo and I can access it with apps to play music.  With respect to getting the firmware - in the end, it needed several updates that had to be performed by gramofon remotely. I am not sure why when I followed the instructions (connecting from my computer to the gramofon in failsafe mode via an ethernet cable) never worked despite all the variations that I tried. That part was very frustrating and has me not buying several more to 'connect' more areas in my house). Hopefully, if it works for you to upgrade firmware directly from the directions, it would make the experiments much easier. They were very quick to initially get the firmware emailed to me.Gramofon support was very professional in their emails and near the end, were a bit better about sending back acknowledgements that I was in  their queue of activity.  (It was clear from the website, of course, that they and I are on very different time-zones, so I was OK with expecting a day turnaround for each email exchange. But  It was a bit worrisome for the first few days of the process when I would try something they suggested, it would fail, I'd add it to the online support form and then hear nothing for 2 or 3 cycles (days) of waiting.  I'd try not to get too obsessive about emailing  'are you guys still there for me?".)I am running the Quallcomm Allplay radio app (basically as way to do tunein) and the Qualcomm Allplay Jukebox app (can access your own home network music) and they both find the gramofon.  I tried to do rhapsody, but while it says it will work, it doesn't. I am no expert, and the internet information is a bit confusing to me, but it seems that it used to work (I found a youtube announcement of them showing rhapsody working with allplay), then Rhapsody took it out of their system.  If anyone else knows more details, I would be interested in whether I am just confused or what.
