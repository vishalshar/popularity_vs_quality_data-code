I'm partially addicted to trying out new stylus for my Apple Pro, Aamazon Fire, iPhone, and variou other touch screen devices. I usually end up returning them because (1) most of them tend to not be as good as the Apple Pencil (which is my main stylus for note taking on my iPad Pro), (2) some of them are less than good---they're terrible---and lastly (2) I don't need plethora of styluses (or the better sound styli), so I give them a test run, turn the bad ones (the majority) and keep the good ones (a very small minority), It takes up a lot of my time, but I consider it a hobby.Then I ran across the Fifty Three Digital Stylus. I've been wanting to try it for a while but the cost was a little too much for me, but I got lucky and it was about 40% (or 50%?) off, so it was a perfect opportunity to check out this stylus that I've heard so many good things about. Do you know how when someone says so many good things about a move your hopes sky rocket, and then the movie doesn't end up meeting your expectations, which in turn makes the movie unenjoyable for you. This was not the case here. In fact this stylus exceeded my expectations (I should note: I wasn't paid to write this nice review; the company didn't send me a free stylus for an "honest"  review; I don't have any friends that work for the company; everything I'm saying is genuine, and it isn't being predigeisted by all the things I said). This stylus is hand's down amazing, and I'm so impressed by it.For those who gave it a bad review because the stylus' isn't optimal for writing very thin notes with  it, you're completely missing the purpose of the stylus. The stylus is not designed to be something like an Apple Pencil. That is, it's not designed for very fine and precisely written notes. In fact, it was originally designed for a specific app called "53 Paper." It's a wonderful app, specially for those who love to sketch. There is a small pencil icon in the tool bar of the app, and if you hold the tip of the stylus to this icon for about three seconds, the stylus will connect to the app via blue-tooth. This is very handy because then the app can pick up the sensitivity of the stylus. If you press hard, it'll express that in your writing. If you press gently or softer, it'll express that in your writing too. My favorite part is that the small rubber on the back of the Fifty Three digital Stylus can be used as an eraser. I think not having an eraser (in like Surface Pro's standard stylus, which does have one) is one the HUGEST flaws with the Apply Pencile. It should have an eraser, so you don't have to waste your time searching for the eraser button every time you need to erase something (iand in my case that's often A LOT).One caveat: I'm not sure if the sensitivity and eraser feature work with apps other than the 53 Paper app. I haven't checked or tested it to find out (that's next on my to-do list). But my suspicion is that those two special features (the sensitivity and eraser) don't work with other apps because I haven't yet found a way to pair the stylus with our (e.g.) iPad Pro via Bluetooth without going through the 53 Paper app. The same could be said about other apps. It seems like the two great features of the Pencil by Fifty (sensitivity and the eraser) only work with the 53 Paper app unfortunately. Again I haven't tested it yet so don't take my word as gospel, but if this is correct---that the two features (sensitivity and the eraser)---then I do think that that's something that future versions of the stylus should improve on. But honestly, other this one thing (which doesn't both me to be honest, but it might bother others so I thought I'd mention it), this stylus is FANTASTIC. I can't praise it enough. (Oh I forgot to mention this earlier, you can take notes with it, they just won't be fine and thin, but so wait).The upshot of the story: all you'll ever need are the Pencil by Fifty Three stylus and the Apply Pencil, and you'll be set for everything to you need to do something like the iPad Pro.
