I LOVE these!!  So nice to be able to slip my sneakers off and on!  HOWEVER, they need to be made stronger.  In the 7 weeks since I bought them (fortunately I bought an extra package), they break at the rate of about one a week.  The manufacturer had a great idea - just needs to make them to last longer!
