The Darkside Sphero is a great toy. It has a fairly steep learning curve to be able to drive it well, but it only takes minutes to learn how to drive it around the room. I have run it into walls and cabinets and it still keeps going. Trick mode will make it do wild spins and if you just ignore it by not moving it after a short time it gets angry and spins around on its own. Gave it 4 stars because of learning curve to drive it well.
