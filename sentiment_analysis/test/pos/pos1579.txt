I had used another brand, Kinnekinick, for some time but wasn't able to find it again.  So bought this and am beyond happy with it.  It has a bit of corn starch in it but other than that, I see nothing wrong with the ingredients.  I used this in a 'turkey' meatloaf and it came out fabulously.  (I don't fry anything)  I will try it on oven-baked chicken soon.I am looking forward to the day when the world becomes more educated about the ills of gluten.  I'm not celiac but terribly gluten-sensitive.  With gluten, I have joint pain, skin issues, colon issues, gastric issues and thyroid issues.  Without gluten?  None of that!  If people would do some research, they'd find that many of their problems are based on toxins in their bodies and gluten is a truly evil toxin.
