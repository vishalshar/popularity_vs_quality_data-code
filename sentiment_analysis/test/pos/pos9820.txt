My daughter like all the flavors of this toothpaste but my 6 year old swears that this one is the best. My wife is a freak when it could to chemicals and things in products, to be honest I probably should be too but I'm not. It boils down to this, my picky 6 year old will brush her teeth without me yelling at her so who cares that this product is "safe" if she will use it then the removal of garbage is only a bonus.
