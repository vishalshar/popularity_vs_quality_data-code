Got this for my daughter and we all love it.  (Now I get to hear what usually only plays through her ear buds!). This little snail is cute, feels good to the touch, holds a charge for a long time, and sound quality is great for the price.  My daughter has been using him on a daily for over a month and he's holding up great.
