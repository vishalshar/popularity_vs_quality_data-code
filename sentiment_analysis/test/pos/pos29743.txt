I had wanted a vanity mirror for ages but felt guilty spending the money on a splurge when it is obvious it could be made for less cost.  BUT, it would look homemade if we did it ourselves...and this one truly looks professional.  I am so delighted to have it.I have a small area in the Master Closet devoted to "vanity" such as make-up and hair...it is works perfectly over a small table/drawers...and it is pretty too.When I went online to view videos of women who bought one or had one made, all the women were obviously quite young.  However, I am not young...and the ability to adjust the light and plug in my curling iron/hot roller is perfect.  In fact, I'd say it should be on the Wish List of any mature woman who likes to sit while applying make-up.If you are on the fence, buy it...you won't regret it!
