Great mouse, but may have build quality issues. The shape of the mouse is excellent, really fits your hand well. Great for claw-grip for almost all hand sizes. Great for palm grip users with small hands. This mouse is relatively small and if you have average to large hands and are a palm grip player, your fingers will hand over the end of the mouse buttons. The mouse is made with a really nice material that is exceptionally easy to grip, much better than any mouse i've used, and I've pretty much tried them all. The left side has a nice textured rubber grip for added ease of use. The sensor on the mouse is great. If you're an FPS player, this sensor is one of the best and feels very consistent.I would five start this mouse, if it didn't have a slight build issue, it would be without question the best mouse I've ever used. Unfortunately, a day or two after I started using the mouse, the right mouse button switch started having issues. After two months it's still functional, but the right mouse button switch feels much stiffer than the left, and it isn't consistent. Sometimes it almost sticks for a second and the switch is very loud, other times its more or less normal. It's not a major issue and I still use the mouse over the EC2 and FK I have sitting around, but it is unfortunate because without this issue I would have been completely sold on mionix products.
