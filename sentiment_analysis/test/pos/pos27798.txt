Losing your keys is never fun, especially when you're in a rush. The TrackR Bravo is the answer as long as you're in the same room. The app is easy to use and the TrackR only takes a few seconds to find once you're in range (roughly 30 feet). These are great for everyday items like phones, wallets, and keys. One change I would like to see is the volume on the device's alarm, it's a bit quiet.
