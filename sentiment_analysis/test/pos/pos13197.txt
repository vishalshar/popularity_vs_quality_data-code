We've been using a weekly subscription sod service for some time. With our dog getting displeased with the sod after just a few days and the $110 per month price tag I wanted to try other options.After a lot of research I settled on the Pet Loo. It had mostly positive reviews and was the right price point for me to try with the risk that my dog wouldn't accept the change.We're now ~6 weeks in and the Pet Loo has already paid for itself. I'm cleaning it semi-weekly and my dog is still happy to use it. Eventually I figure I'll have to replace the grass but an infrequent $20 fee is still way better than $100+ per month.The Pet Loo is more lightweight than I expected and durability or pet willingness may be a problem with larger dogs. For my 8 pound dog, this product is perfect!
