I bought this product to see if it could help me fall asleep.  I will pretty much stay asleep once I'm there, but falling asleep has always been difficult for me.  I received this product promptly, in time to test it out over the Fourth of July weekend..Opening the bottle--Moderately difficult, as it comes with sturdy plastic shrink wrapping that is not easy to tear with your fingers.  I had to use scissors.  But a tiny snip is all it takes to make a tear and pull the plastic off.  No big deal.Flavor--I tried a case of the NighTEA Night tea flavor, and I regret to say that it has all the fine flavor of colonoscopy prep.  I had mine recently, so the memory is very vivid.  NighTEA Night tastes somewhat better than that.  I don't want to gag as I swallow the stuff, but I do screw my face up a bit as it goes down.  It is possible that the other flavors taste better; I'll see about trying them later.I took my first dose--a full bottle--on Friday night at 11:00pm.  I did wake up a time or two during the night but promptly fell back asleep.  I woke up for good at 9:15am on Saturday.  That told me that, if I take an entire bottle, I should plan on allotting at least 10 hours for sleep.  I also took a couple of cat naps during the day and wanted to take a cat nap that evening.  I weigh 148 pounds, to give you an idea of body mass versus dose.I took half of a bottle on Saturday night, and that worked much better for me, with regard to being alert on Sunday.  I took the remainder of that bottle Sunday night.As a sleep aid, this product is effective.  I certainly do fall asleep and for the most part stay asleep.  I have noted some interesting side effects.  First, once this knocks me out, I tend to not move around much; I awaken in pretty much the same position I fell asleep in.  I'm not sure if that is a good thing.  I would not call this sleep paralysis; I simply don't feel like moving, and it is easy to drift back into sleep while in this state.  2.  My dreams have been more vivid, colorful, and memorable while taking this product.  I like that a lot.I plan to not take this during the work week unless I really have difficulty falling asleep.  I do not want to be drowsy during the day, and even at half a dose, there is that risk.  Also, as a previous reviewer noted, it's not a good idea to take this every night, no matter how non-addictive it is.  Still, for occasional use, as long as you allow enough time for sleeping before you must wake up, this product is likely to be helpful.Four stars instead of five only because of the taste.  :)
