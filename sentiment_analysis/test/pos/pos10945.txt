It's a plastic drinking horn... without the odor or care issues of a real horn.  looks great sitting on my desk as a conversation piece, and is lots of fun to take to neighborhood or company BBQs, to be drinking and have the strap around my neck while getting food is classic and larger than life to never loose my beer and have it hanging around my neck for hands free eating without loosing my drink or knocking it over.  Lots of fun.
