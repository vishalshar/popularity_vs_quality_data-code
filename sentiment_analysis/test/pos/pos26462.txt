I had trouble at first with the light flicking on and off. I wrote to customer service and received no response. The directions say that will happen if there is not enough water but mine was practically overflowing! Finally one day I pushed down on the light and it stopped flickering. The basil is growing beautifully now. So i am anxious to try something else.
