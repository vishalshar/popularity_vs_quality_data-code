I love this kit! I am new to mushroom culture, but plan to continue with it. This Back to the Roots Oyster Mushroom Kit  is a great way to get a feel for mushroom culture and to start quickly. The firsf crop came up in less than 2 weeks, and the 2nd crop is coming up now, about an additional 3 weeks after that. I am hoping to get a 3rd crop. I plan to give many of these as gifts in the near future.
