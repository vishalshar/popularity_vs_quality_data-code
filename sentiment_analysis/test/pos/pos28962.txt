My personal advise: If you- don't like the bulky feeling of today's smartphones in your pocket and wish for something extremely light and easy to carry around- are fed up with constantly checking, reading, writing 'stuff' on your smartphone- would like to bar your phone interfering with your interactions with your surrounding- don't mind not having a 5MP camera- or want to carry a tiny Bond-style phone for security reasonsthen it's a great buy.I used to have a 4'' LG and having replaced it with this one more than a month ago, I can tell you now that I feel much 'lighter' and happier. Not because the phone is the best in the market but because I'm one of the above type of customers. Since I bought it, I am much more engaged with my surrounding and have my hands & eyes free.PROS: Not just small but extremely lightweight and cute to carry around. The chances of losing/forgetting it somewhere is extremely low because you won't take it out of your pocked unless you have a notification or a call. Similarly, the chances of someone stealing it is rather low, in my opinion, 'cause at first sight, nobody thinks that this is an actual smartphone with all features! I guess it's also fair to say that the phone decreases your chances of being run over by car significantly because you'll watch the traffic more carefully. It has all the benefits of an android phone. Spotify, Soundcloud, FB messenger, Maps, front and read cameras etc. it has everything you'd need. I've never experienced memory shortage - Gdrive, Spotify, Soundcloud, PodcastRep, Calendar etc. are all installed without any memory problem. Since you don't use it much, the battery is also pretty sufficient. But I think the best feature is that IT HAS A RECORD FEATURE FOR FM RADIO!CONS: The touchscreen is slow, sometimes you've to touch things twice. The touchscreen is too small, sometimes you have to touch the screen couple of times until you hit the right thing (My advice is to go for Google voice keyboard or Swipe keyboard. It works pretty well and swiftly). I don't know whether this is a general problem but mine sometimes doesn't show the battery correctly. I mean, for almost an entire day it said the battery is %61 and I was already wondering what's going on.. Yeah, the next morning I found it laying dead on the floor. But as I said, the battery life is pretty sufficient. Mine just doesn't show it correctly sometimes and this might lead to miscalculations (just saying).
