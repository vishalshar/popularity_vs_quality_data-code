I buy these using subscribe and save which is very convenient.  These are great tasting, with a good apple flavor.  They make a great snack and the quality has always been good.  They also are packaged in a good quality bags and stay fresh for a very long time.  You can get them in other sizes as well. A great product.  Very tasty and satisfying and a good way to add some more fruit to your diet.
