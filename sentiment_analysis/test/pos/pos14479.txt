Works with Homekit and is the ONLY bridge that's Homekit compatible and works with 3rd party lights. Hue used to let you use Cree or GE Link bulbs, but they've taken that ability away. The Nanoleaf bridge/hub will allow you to add those bulbs and use them through the iOS "Home" app. If you plan on mixing and matching ZigBee bulbs from various companies, you probably are going to want the Nanoleaf. The company is going to be releasing their own color changing LED's soon, and the app even lets me change the color of my Hue bulbs. So, if you don't have a Hue bridge/hub yet -- I'd get this instead. If you already have a Hue 2.0 bridge/hub -- adding this will give you the ability to control 3rd party Zigbee bulbs.
