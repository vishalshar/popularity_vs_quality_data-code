I like this cap a lot and use it to shake up salad dressings, and lemonade.  I also use one to carry my morning coffee.  My only wish is that the lid would come off easier.  It seems that the seal vacuum seals so I'm concerned at how long it will hold up.  It also means I usually have to wait until my husband comes home to get the  lid off.
