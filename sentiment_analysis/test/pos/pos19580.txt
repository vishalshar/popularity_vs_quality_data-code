My cats, and every cat I've ever given this to, love this stuff. Yes, it's basically the little bits of freeze dried chicken you find in Cup-O-Soup. But to cats (and your wallet), this is Beluga caviar served on top of the finest Kobe beef with a glass of champagne.I had a feral kitty who was challenging to pill. But I'd put her pill on a small pile of this and she reminded me every day that it was "treat time!" A real life-saver--literally. Yeah, the price is insane. But the quality is good (after a bad period where they changed processing methods, it's back to the old version), and the 21 ounce bag will last you quite a while.
