This is a great idea, but the execution is still a little bit iffy.  Love this thing, but it is built very cheaply. Otherwise it's be 5 stars. I have little faith it will last more than a couple months. Granted - it IS getting a work out. My dog, a Wire Haired Fox Terrier, LOVES it.  She surprised me by learning how to drop the ball in by herself within an hour of opening the box. She will play all day if we'd let her.  Couple issues: the balls they supply (it comes with 3 ) are mini tennis balls, about the size of a ping pong ball. The problem is that the dogs destroy them pretty quickly. You can order more , but they are too expensive to buy from ifetch. You can find, on amazon, the same size balls by Kong and they work great and are just $2.99 for 3 balls.  I just ordered a bunch more. When being used, the balls get very slobbery....soaked after a few minutes...and I think that affects how far the machine will shoot the ball out.  For that reason, I rotate the balls about every 5 minutes.  Also - this first version is for smaller dogs due to the size of the balls....the company is working on a bigger model for bigger dogs, but it's not on the market yet.It is a blast, and the dog is crazy about it. But it's not a low cost item, I'm just hoping it lasts longer than I think it will.
