I was looking for a bluetooth speaker and then I came across with a post at CNET. I like the clean design, plus I got Philips Hue at home, thus I like to give it a try for this speaker with multiple functions. ItÂ’s easy to connect and streaming my iPhone music is simple. Setup on Philips Hue control is also simple, I can configure any of the three buttons on top of BEDDI to control the brightness and on/off.The app is quite user friendly (but you need to remember your configuration, because you can set different thing for short press/long press), anyway just tap and try a few times, then you will figure out how to control.
