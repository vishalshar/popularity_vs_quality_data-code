I prefer to treat things naturally as much as possible, and I don't often write reviews because most products either don't work or are mediocre at best. Not Bixbi Immunity Superfood. We adopted our male cat at 4 months old, he will soon be 6 years old. Shortly after bringing him home we found out that he has the Calicivirus, for which there is no cure. The most frequent symptoms he would get are the horrible rodent ulcers on his lip, which would get very raw. Steroid shots would help heal them somewhat. Last summer I took in two bonded 2 year old boy kitties. This really stressed my resident cat out and he got very sick. My new vet practices Chinese medicine along with traditional and we tried all kinds of things to boost his immune system. Most of the time it was a battle getting him to take the formulas, and thus stressing him out even more. As a last resort my vet mentioned a colleague having success with a 5 Mushroom tincture. I looked it up on Amazon and saw that it had alcohol as a preservative, not something I wanted for my cat, but I did see in the reviews a recommendation to check out Bixbi Immunity. AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID. I bought this product and started Ziggy on it right away... his mouth ulcers began healing immediately and now, after several months, only the scars are left. He has not had a flare up since using this product, which has been just over 2 months now. For the first time I have hope that I have found something that will help him.
