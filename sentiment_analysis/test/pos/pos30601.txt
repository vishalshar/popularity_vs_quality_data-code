I've been using Spire for the past 2 months and love it.For some background, I've been trying to cultivate mindfulness and concentration during formal meditation sessions. I've found that having Spire helps me develop mindfulness in day to day life, and this seems to have accelerated my meditation progress.Additionally, I work in a top Internet company as a executive, and it is paramount to keep mental equanimity when things go astray. I found that having Spire remind me of my breathing keeps me calm and composed and be able to handle difficult situations better.Here are a few more things going for the device- Good price- Good charger- Great design- Good app which got a bunch of new features in the two months- Fast customer service
