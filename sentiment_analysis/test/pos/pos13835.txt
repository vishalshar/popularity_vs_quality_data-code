This is a review for the Sencha Green Tea.I love tea and all sorts of tea related items. I thought I would try this "crystallized" tea product, especially since the ingredients is JUST tea (organic too). I'm not a fan of powders or instant things really since I'm weary of the "extra" items that are usually added. If it's tea, just give me tea. Don't add preservatives or sugar or whatever...GTFO!This is pretty good for instant tea. It tastes as if I made it from loose tea leaves, but in less than 30 seconds! I'm looking forward to trying out the Jasmine flavor next.I'm the type that drinks cups after cups of tea. :( I'm already halfway through the box. I have to stop being lazy and conserve these for "emergencies", otherwise I would have to order many of these boxes to satisfy my tea cravings. For days when I'm looking for a quick tea fix, on the go, or just plain lazy, this is perfect!Warning: If you like your tea very strong, this probably might not be your cup of tea...sorry for the pun. :P I couldn't help myself.
