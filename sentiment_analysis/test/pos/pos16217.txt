Works as advertised. You won't be disappointed. Only 4 stars because there is no volume control option on the device itself (all controlled on phone or tablet.) setup on the app was a breeze. Wish there was better options or explanations on the eq setup within the app. Music is loud and clear but could be louder. Bass is decent but expected more from the price. Having the top speaker detach as a magnet is a plus and it's very strong. I've found if you remove the top speaker from the unit and place it on say the fridge..if you walk through it and the base unit, it will disrupt the connection as it's trying to stay connected when mounted in close proximity.
