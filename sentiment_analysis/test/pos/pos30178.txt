I can't remember where I had seen this advertised, but I was naturally curious as I've had mixed reviews with the leading brand condoms. So I bought it and tried it out.First of all, like others have said here, it doesn't smell (which is always nice for discreetness) and it doesn't bunch or roll up, which is my biggest complaint of traditional condoms. It felt snug, but not suffocating.I would say that it felt pretty close to the real thing in my experience. Perhaps a little too much, as it caused me to climax before I normally would, probably due to increased sensation. But no worries, I put on another and was ready to go!She liked it too. Immediately she could tell something was different, but she couldn't put her finger on it. We tend to play rough and these simply refused to break. I was pretty impressed with that.The only downside I can think of is that I tend to be on the wider side and it didn't seem to want to give in that regard. The length was good, but girth was this only downfall.Can't wait to use these again!
