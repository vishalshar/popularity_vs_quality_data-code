I love this thing. I have always been interested in this technology and have been having a lot of fun with it so far. We will soon begin house hunting and I plan to use this to see how potential homes measure up in terms of insulation and cooling. I had hoped to be able to see studs in the wall but so far I haven't had success with that. Since I live in a very hot desert area my hope is that might change when it starts to cool off. Either way I have been able to take some pretty cool video and pictures of my family and discover some pretty interesting things about my surroundings.
