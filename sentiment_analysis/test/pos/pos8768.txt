Finally. I know it's expensive, but since I am on a diabetic diet I so missed the texture of pasta. This stuff is great. Cooking time is the same as regular pasta. You can make the whole box and use it for several meals. Very convenient. Not inexpensive by any stretch, but an excellent pasta substitute that is high in protein and low in carbs.
