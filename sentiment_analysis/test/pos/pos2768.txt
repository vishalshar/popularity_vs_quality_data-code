Had some issues with my first headset and the customer service was fantastic.  They even let me keep my first headset until the new one arrived so I could continue to use it with my PS4.  Quality, sound, and controls are all top notch.  I'm not an audiophile, but in my limited opinion they sound fantastic and have a good sound stage.  When playing video games you can hear people behind or to the side of you, and the sound helps to pinpoint where they're coming from.  Microphone also works well.  I've been told I'm a little quiet but perfectly clear.Oh, and their really easy to set up.  Followed the simple instructions and everything worked perfectly.
