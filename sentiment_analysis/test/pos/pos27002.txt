I love the phone case - I can stick my phone to the fridge and not wonder where in the house I set my phone. I am not pleased with the mounting magnet that came with the case though. The magnet's adhesive didn't bond at all to my car's interior even though I used the alcohol prep wipe. I tried again, using heat to try warm the adhesive up and then leaving it to adhere overnight... sure enough, while driving... "plop". I parked in the sun, and kneaded the magnet back and forth on my dash... it worked for a short while, then fell off again. I went so far as to use the 3M removable wall adhesive as a literal middle man; it worked for a short time, then fell off. If I could get the mount to do it's job I'd be super stoked.
