Was a crowd funding supporter, loved the first one, and have two more since.  One for each car.  Love how quickly they can charge 2 phones.  Love how sleek and sturdy they are.  Love that I can use whatever cable I want with it.  Love the little lights so I know when they are working right.  Other ones always seemed to have the indicators somewhere I didn't see clearly.  Very happy with these.  I don't travel much, so I don't have my car lost very often, but that piece is terrific too.
