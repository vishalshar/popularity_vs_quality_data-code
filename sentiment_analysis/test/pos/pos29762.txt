This is an amazing product.  I first saw it used by an NGO working in a remote location where it was used to purify brown, muddy swamp water with visible dirt and debris suspended in the water.  It purifies the water and removes the dirt and debris at the same time, and it is amazingly easy to use.  Chemical purifiers make the water potable, but they leave dirt and debris suspended in the water.  Filters do it all, but they clog if there is much dirt or debris in the water, requiring repeated cleaning.  I think this product is unique.I am an Air-SAR pilot.  I added this product to my survival kit - it's small, it's lightweight, and it works, perfect for a survival situation.  I also have some at home for "survival" in the event of a natural disaster.
