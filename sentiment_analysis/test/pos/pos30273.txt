Used to have confusion with my girlfriend if she had remembered to feed the dogs in the morning (yes I know, so bad). But now this helps as a friendly reminder and we don't accidentally over feed them. Comes with only 2 magnetic strips, which was odd as they don't give it enough grip to stay attacked to the fridge, but there were also 2 stick back strip. Threw those on their and no problem. Can't beat the price either.
