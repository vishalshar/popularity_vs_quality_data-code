I put 5 stars so that you can read my bad review.I read the instructions and applied it as stated.Then I let it air dry.When I tested the gloves,I realized that the slimy substance became to peel away.I washed off my gloves and dried it.The next day I repeated the steps and the same thing happened.And yes,I followed directions.I will soon be returning this product.
