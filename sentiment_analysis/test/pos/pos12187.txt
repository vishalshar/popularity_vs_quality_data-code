Very thin and lightweight, fits easily in wallet. I'm a woman with thick straight hair (I break plastic combs!) so I got this one for the fine teeth vs the mirrored women's one. The teeth are sturdy but not sharp-- the metal feels like it has resin or something over it. The comb fits comfortably in my hands.My one suggestion would be to make a mirrored one with fine teeth, as all the mirrored ones right now have much wider teeth. Thanks for a well-designed comb!!
