The TrackR does what it's supposed to do.  You'll never lose your keys (or whatever else you attach it to).First, the look.  I love the aluminum design, which I could have gotten in a number of colors.  I chose silver, but the black one had me thinking.  Also, it's slightly thicker than a quarter, with a slightly shorter diameter.  Point is, it's not adding bulk to my key ring.Now the function.  If I misplace my keys, I simply tap the button on the TrackR app, and they ring loud and clear within 30-40 feet.  If I'm further than that, the map on the app shows me where I was last in close proximity to them.  Or if someone has picked up my keys, the app will show me where they are now, thanks to the crowdsourcing nature of the app (other TrackR users alert the system whenever they come near my keys).If I misplace my phone, I press the button on the TrackR and my phone will start to ring, even if it's on silent.  Again, this works within 30-40 feet.Finally, I love that I can replace the battery quickly and easily.  If it wears down, an icon appears in the app, telling me it's time to replace the battery.  The TrackR takes a common watch battery, which I can get for pennies.
