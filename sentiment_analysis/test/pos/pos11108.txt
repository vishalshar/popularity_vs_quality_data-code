I like the calm quite a bit.  I have the energy in fact a little more than I need the calm slows me down and lowers my anxiety which I am under treatment for.  You do have to try it at different settings until you get it right for you.  I was surprised when I listened to the instructions to set it higher to slip past the painful tingling.  I did and now it is much better with only slight pressure under the electrodes which is not painful but more like a finger resting on your skin.
