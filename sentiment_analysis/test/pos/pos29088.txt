This is the car solution I have been waiting for!!! I have tried so many different phone-holders for my phone and none of them have worked! The dash mounts never stick well enough and I have a hard time positioning them to be able to accomodate my iphone 6 Plus. This case meets all of my needs. I tried to dash mount it but with the weight of my phone being in an incipio case (which is still pretty slim), the dash mount didn't work. BUT because of the pad they send with it, removing the holder did not damage my dash board in any way. I was easily able to mount it to my window and despite driving through construction zones everday, and being on bumpy roads in an SUV, the suction cup has never detached from my windsheild. The ball joint allows you to adjust for the perfect viewing angle and the telescope arm gives you a lot more flexibility in terms of where you mount the holder. The actual mechanism for holding your phone is incredibly simple. You push your phone on the button of the holder and the sides automatically click and tighten around the phone. For simple release you just gently squeeze the two little tabs on the side and the arms holding your phone release. It has vastly improved my driving experience by enabling me to use my GPS without having to look down. I would highly recommend this product to anyone, and I will be purchasing a second one for my mom's birthday!
