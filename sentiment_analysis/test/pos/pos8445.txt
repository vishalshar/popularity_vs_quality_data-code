I bought these for my son's shoes so he doesn't have to keep tying them.  He is eight years old. They work really well and he says the shoes are very comfortable with them.  Sometimes the top one comes undone when he tries to put his shoes on but I'm guessing that it will stretch over time. Using a shoe horn, we have no issue.  I bought one pair to see how they worked. We love them, so we will definitely get some more.
