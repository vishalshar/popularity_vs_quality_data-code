These are yummy and chewy, came quickly and even though it's hot the product transferred well (although the bars shifted slightly with the heat.. however, if you have a chance, eat one warm! Yum!).Box got finished last night and I went ahead and ordered a case of them as well as the pb choc chip too. We also ordered a box of the cookies from their website to try. I'm constantly trying to find things that can be tossed in the backpacks or into my purse for running errands. They taste like a granola bar that has 10+ grams of sugar but the 1.1oz bars only have 5!Ordering the case of 1.1oz bars, you get 8 boxes, each with 6 1.1oz individually wrapped bars. 48 bars for $30ish bucks. That's around .64 cents per bar. You might get better than that for Quaker but you'll also get a laundry list of ingredients including several types of sugar and sugar alcohol (huh?). So if that's what you like go for it. I'll stick with real items for the quick snack options. I'll be looking forward to more of this brand being available on Amazon.
