The Petzi treat cam works as advertised, the only problem we have is that I have a Verizon HTC M8 Windows phone that I carry at work, this phone does not support the petzi treat cam, you can not even get the app for the product on this phone, my personel Sprint M8 phone does support it and works fine, so just be aware of this before you buy this product
