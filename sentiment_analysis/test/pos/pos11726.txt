Larger than expected. Fun experience! It seemed to need more seeds than were included. Luckily, the tree hollow seemed to have more than necessary, so we used some from it. One con is that the top portion spins. In my opinion, this is a design flaw because once the plants grow it may damage them. Other than that it is perfect and was fun to do with my daughter who is 8.
