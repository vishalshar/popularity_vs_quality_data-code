I got this as a quilt for my camper but its just too comfy to leave in the camper most of the time. The quality is great, provides superb warmth and again is the most comfortable blanket ever. It reminds you of a good quality sleeping bag except you have airflow because of its open design.  I'm sure I will be taking this thing everywhere in the cooler months. I absolutely love it!!
