I bought this for my two sons who are avid football players. It has been extremely helpful with managing their grip. Their scores have improved and overall they feel better about their plays. The gloves stay looking new and durable. As a mom, I am glad that this is a legal product. I love that it is non toxic and does not hurt the environment. There is practically no residue and it dries quickly. I recommended this product to the other mom's on my sons team.
