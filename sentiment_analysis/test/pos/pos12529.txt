It rocks, it pairs, it is neither round nor rectangular. I'm listening to it now, and the sound is really decent, especially when you consider its size and portability. I'm bringing it on road trips, on hikes, to the garage when I'm doing some repairs on the car. At this price, I think I'm going to get a second.
