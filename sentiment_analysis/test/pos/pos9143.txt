The Avegant Glyph!I've spent a few weeks with this device and have an in depth review of the expirience inside the Glyph and utilizing it to its full potentialTo start it off let's review the Pros/Cons of the Glyph(Pros)- One of a kind gadget- portable 50" HMD / TV- sharp and bright display- resolution simulates FULL HD- connects to anything- turn your iPhone screen into a portable theater- very private- amazing sound quality- FPV HMD for drone flying ++++ huge(Cons) not many- price, it's in the range of all other similar products- weight, proper positioning and the head strap relives this- minor blur on the far corners- 4hr battery, not a killer who doesn't own a portable charger these days.- trying to pry it off your friends heads!!Now that we've covered some of the strengths and weaknessesThe Glyph is a very unique gadget, when someone sees you listening to music and suddenly switch it to HMD mode they will be blown away!The screen resolution is exceptional, gaming looks great, Youtube looks amazing, Netflix is the killer app. Good bye real world.If you travel this is a must have, if you don't want to watch the kardashians with your wife! Just strap on your Glyph!This is a golden gift of the gods for flying the DJI Mavic Pro, as of this writing the only way that I can figure out to utilize it for FPV is to use the Nvidia Shield tablet which supports HDMI. As FPV this device is amazing outside in the sunlight especially being able to maintain your peripheral vision and still being able to watch your drone, look at your controller etc.Review to be continued I'm in the Glyph as of this writing.......
