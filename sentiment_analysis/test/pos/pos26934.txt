I discovered this soap in the ladies room of a restaurant.  How often do you wash your hands in a public restroom and actually notice the quality and fragrance of the soap?  I did and was so intrigued I looked at the bottle for the name.  I ordered it the next day.  This is my new, favorite hand soap.  And I enjoyed the story of the family who makes the product.
