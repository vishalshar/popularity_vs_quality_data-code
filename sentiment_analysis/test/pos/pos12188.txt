When you need a comb, you need a comb. I try not to carry a ton of stuff around with me, and so having a comb that fits in my teensy wallet is just perfect. I dig it. I'd say the price was on the high side, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy another, so it's definitely worth it. I'd like one with longer tines, maybe. Also the cat thinks it's just boffo and she added the fifth star.
