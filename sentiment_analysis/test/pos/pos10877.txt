What a great addition to our family! My kids love it and me as well. The facial expressions and sounds sometimes make you forget its a robot. 15 minutes with Cozmo makes you forget the frustrations of the day. I was happy to see it was plug and play so within 10 minutes out of its box we could already play the first games.
