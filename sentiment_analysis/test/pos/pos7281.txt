My parents have a cat from h**l whom had chewed several THOUSANDS of dollars worth of cords up, when I was visiting them he got ahold of my charger cord so I had to go buy a new one, didn't even have the new cord for 12hr before he got ahold of that one (I had it hidden in the couch and the cat dug the thing out!) long story short I found this cord... Decided to try it... And boy was their cat mad that I finally found a cord he couldn't chew through! I let my parents keep the cord and I'm sure they'll be ordering again if need be!!
