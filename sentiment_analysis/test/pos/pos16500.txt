Can't give it a 5 star rating just yet. It does what it say for sure and I've no complaints however it would be really nice to know how much beer is left in the can/bottle in order to better estimate when to switch from beer to foam (head). And it definitely has a different affect on different beers. Your typical "light" domestic beers improve quite a bit while others like Shipyard Pumpkin only improve slightly. Funky Budha Blueberry actually tasted horrible through the Fizzics...like a spoiled sour patch kid lol.Anyway, I like it and am not upset that I purchased it, just can't give it 5 stars.
