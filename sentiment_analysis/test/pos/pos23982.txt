Good customer service. Fun app to track your pets activity level, medication reminders, and Gps alerts if your pet leaves yard. The notifications are NOT in real time and may take 24 hours to update. There is a 5 minute delay to warn you if your pet leaves the designated yard space. You have to pay monthly for service.
