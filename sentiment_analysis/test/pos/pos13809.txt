My wife and I love the Petcube.  The "fiberware updates have really helped increase the effectiveness".  The staff for Petcube was very helpful when I could not set up the cube after an update.  They found it was a "fiberware defect".  I love being able to check in on my dog.  I can take pictures, videos and play with other people's pets.  I have already highly recommended this to friends and family.  I highly recommend it to you.  I keep my camera private for me and my family.  I am so thankful for the peace of mind it brings me.  The picture is so much clearer since this last update also.  Thank you PetCube!!!!
