I love this oil. Very light taste, very healthy and extremely high smoke point.  I've tried other Avacado oils but many of them taste "burnt" because they aren't cold pressed like the CalPure.  If you are looking for a high quality oil that lets your food taste shine through and can withstand high temps for frying or wok cooking, this is the one.  Worth every penny.
