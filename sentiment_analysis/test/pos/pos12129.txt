Bought this over Phantom 4 just because the camera is fantastic and up-gradable. Turns out the service from Autel is amazing and the drone works like a charm just out of the box. Delighted to see the included case, memory card and spare propellers. The controller has a bunch of custom buttons and a small LCD which is very useful as well. Overall very very happy with the first couple of flights, no issues so far and the device seems to be very well tested and tuned.
