Oh how do I sing the praises and count the ways I love this little lid??? Do you have a 10" Pyrex glass bowl that you use all the time but end up covering it with saran wrap?  Use this lid.  It 'suctions' onto the bowl and seals PERFECTLY.  No odors in the 'fridge, no air getting to food, it's amazing. Heat foods in the microwave and get angry when food 'explodes' and makes a mess you hate to clean?  Use this lid.  No mess, no splatters, and it's a breeze to wipe off. Like to fry bacon in your frying pan but don't like cleaning a splatter cover?  Use this lid.  It covers and eliminates spatters and cleans up with the swish of a soap pad.This may not cure terminal illnesses or bring peace to the middle east, but I'm quite sure it can cure the common cold and halt the spread of contagious viral outbreaks.  It's THAT good.
