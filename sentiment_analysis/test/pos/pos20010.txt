Finally!  This is a very tough charging cable.  I don't think I will need to invest in a charging cable for years.  This cable is constantly utilized and twisted in many ways.  I found my grandson playing with it,  no harm done.  Worth the money.  I was so tired of adding charging cables to the graveyard.
