The posh works great! It has a great screen and clear sound.  The camera is actually pretty decent. It has a better camera for Android than I have found in a while as it takes almost clear pictures. My only issue is it's a little large for an everyday phone. This is not a phone that will fit in your pockets unless you have mega-pockets. There are also little to no cases sold for this model so you must be careful holding it so that you don't drop it. It is thin so it will likely break as soon as it is dropped. Overall I would recommend this phone. Just be aware of the size as it is the size of a tablet.
