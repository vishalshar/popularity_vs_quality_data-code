At first I was severely disappointed because I purchased this product specifically to run a 5 watt LED Medium Base Light Bulb. I turned it on and it worked, but after 10 seconds it would shut off. I was unhappy because I had brought it on a trip and it didn't work for my needs. However, when I got home I tried charging my laptop and it worked great. I also was able to run a 9 watt LED light bulb and it worked perfectly. GREAT product, wish it could work for powering extremely low watt LED light bulbs.
