I was on a fairly rigorous diet plan that eliminated almost all sweeteners (including fruit juices) and preservatives.  I knew it would be troublesome to stick to the plan if I couldn't come up with snacks to eat during the day, and these apple chips are just the ticket.  The ingredient list is simple - one ingredient:  organic apples.  You can't get much better and 'clean'er than that!  These chips are very good, although as some other reviewers have pointed out, they are a bit tart.  Some (a very small number) of the "chips" are mostly sections of apple skin, which is a bit more chewy and less enjoyable.  If you're looking for a healthy natural snack, this is a great choice.
