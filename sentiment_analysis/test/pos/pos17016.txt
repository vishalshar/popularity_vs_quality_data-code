I had emergency open heart surgery. The procedure (repairing a dissecting aorta) had a 10% survival rate. Though I was one of the lucky few to survive, I had several complications including breaking both of my feet. When I was finally recovered enough to get out and do things, I started having anxiety attacks. My therapists helped me address the psychological and physical symptoms, helping me learn to manage my breathing as a way of calming down and getting on with things.Finding the Spire was really helpful. I am learning to be more aware of my breathing. Spire notifies me when I am tense and when I am relaxed. I am able to intervene and have significantly decreased the symptoms of anxiety. Wearing it daily and frequently checking feedback on iPhone make it a good system! I highly recommend Spire for anyone who has anxiety issues!
