This is a great little charger. Works perfectly with 8 devices in our household - which includes 1 iPad, 1 GalaxyTab Note 12.2, 4 Android Phones and 2 Nooks. All of them charge flawlessly at the rated speed. I'm only deducting 1 star because i want to wait for 3 months to see how it holds up to daily use, and if it's still running - i'll bump up the review.
