Love this set! My friend got her's from ULTA and let me try it as well and I fell in love. I had previously been washing my brushes out with plain hand soap, but this is infinitely better. The scrubbing bowl has a rough bottom to gently scrub out the brushes better than you can with just your fingers. It also has a convenient super absorbent blotting cloth and a drying bowl. The brush shampoo works so much better than plain soap. I was amazed at how much gunk it got out of my brushes that I didn't think were that dirty.
