If you are looking for a great Bluetooth speaker just choose this one it is the most portable can be dropped from 7 feet and be completely fine amazing bass nothing wrong with it at all and is completely water proof just don't submerge it because it might get in the charger ports but rain stands no chance but you might want to wipe off the speaker once in a while in the rain because some times the water will cover the little holes and muffle the noise
