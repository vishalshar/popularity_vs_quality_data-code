My son got these for Christmas.  4 days later, he is still playing with them, so I would say they are a hit!  We were able to download the app no problems, and he had them going in under a minute.  He's played both vs the CPU and vs a friend, and enjoyed both.  Great purchase.  Much more affordable than Anki, and they are not limited to a track.  Work great on a hard surface floor, but they do work on carpet too, just don't go as fast.
