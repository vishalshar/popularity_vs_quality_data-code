I LOVE these sheets!  I've been using them in my son's standard-sized crib for 8 months now without any problems.  It is so nice to not have to untie the bumper and take out the mattress every time the sheet needs changing.  Zipping/unzipping the top sheet is surprisingly easy, and with very little "sticking" around the corners.  I noticed some other reviewers complained about shrinkage, but I've only had a very small amount... the sheet still fits okay after several months of washes.I'd recommend buying a couple flat mattress pads (as opposed to fitted, which would require taking out the mattress to change) to put underneath, and also a second QuickZip sheet to change out.  Of all the baby products I've had to buy, this has been the absolute SMARTEST buy in my opinion.
