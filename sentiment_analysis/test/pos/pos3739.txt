After receiving an order of 8g Co2 cartriges I was able to try this piece of awesomeness out.  After an initial cleaning with PBW, I filled it with water and set it to 10 psi.  It held this pressure for over a day before the water had absorbed all the gas (as would be expected).  Functionally the ukeg is working great!  Cosmetiically it is nearly perfect.  There are a few abnormalities in the sight tube but nothing that cause any issues.  The handle is very sturdy and the regulator lid is easy to use and screws right into the bottle.  I plan to get more of these when they are more available.
