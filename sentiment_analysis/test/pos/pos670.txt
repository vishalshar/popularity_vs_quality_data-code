I've only had this a few days.i. Also have and eatsmart scale which I compared it to. The numbers are almost identical even except for the body fat %.but even that is only different by a few percent. The setup is very easy on an iPhone and it ties right into your WIFI if you wish.The data transfers automatically as soon as you open the app. The app is very easy to use and it's free in the App Store under health mate. As I said the data appears to be very accurate. Your fat % will vary depending on how much water you drink a day. So will your weight. Use this to detect trends over a period of time and it will work beautifully and help your workouts or weight loss a lot.
