I purchased Spire on a whim, from I believe a Facebook ad, a day after a voice coach session for a public speaking event where the emphasis was on breathing.My first day with Spire I forgot I had it on, and a colleague said remember to breathe, before a potentially tense meeting. I made a point of checking spire - and being aware I had it on, and I would be getting a report card on my breathing throughout the day.  Now it is like a game.I check spire throughout the day, do the exercises, and remember to focus on my breathing.  It has made a positive impact.It is easy to get caught up in the moment.  No matter how much executive coaching, or even voice coaching (public speaking) one does, it is so easy to forget one of the most important and powerful tools we have to help us - the power of breathing.Whether or not you believe this little device can truly tell your state of mind - it does make you focus on breathing, and that is important.If you don't believe breathing is important, try not breathing for a while, and see how that works for you!
