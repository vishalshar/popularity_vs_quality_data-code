INTRO:Soylent is great. I have only been using it for 15 days now on a 95% Soylent-only diet. I'm consuming it at a calorie-deficit 1,500-1,600 kcal/day between this, the bottled 2.0 version, and the powdered version which I subscribe to on their official site (because any listing for it on Amazon at this time is NOT official and way overpriced; Soylent is only sold officially on Amazon in the 2.0 bottled form).I am a male in my mid-30's. I work a desk job so I sit for some 50+ hours/week, though I ride my bike a few times each week and ride anywhere from 20-100 miles each ride. My more common rides are closer to 20-25 but I've already done several century (100 mile) rides this season since February. I have not ridden a century yet since starting Soylent but I have ridden a couple of 80-82 milers and on those rides yes I do consume some Gu energy gels and Clif Shot Bloks to make up for my low 1,500 kcal base.USES:It should be noted that Soylent does not have to be a 100% meal replacement for extended periods of time, such as weeks or months. It is not a 'diet' in and of itself but, like any other food, it can be used as a diet and many have done just that. It is specifically made to be everything your body needs both micro and macro-nutrient-wise and nothing more. It is made to be a convenient, all-encompassing meal replacement and nothing more than that. Some people use it just for 1-2 meals/day when it's not convenient to go out or prepare something. Others use it for all meals each day, and even for extended periods without problems.TASTE:It tastes bland and 'neutral' as they call it. It does not taste bad to me, but it certainly doesn't taste 'great' or 'delicious', though again, it's not supposed to. Myself and most others have no problem with the taste at all and find it easy to drink. Some find it too difficult to drink so they either chug it or flavor it. Myself, I have tasted much worse and actually repulsive drinks in my time and Soylent doesn't even come close to tasting bad or disgusting. Since it is a neutral taste, it does lend itself well to flavorings. You can find loads of different 'recipes' to flavor your Soylent in a simple Google search.TEXTURE:The 2.0 bottled form, which is this Amazon listing, is very smooth with almost no particles or resemblance of texture. The powdered form has quite a bit. It is fairly thick for a drink, similar to the consistency of milk I would say in the 2.0 form and more like a malt or shake in the powdered form.COST:First let me say that if you subscribe to a case of Soylent here on Amazon at least 5x then you get 15% off each case, which is cheaper than on the official Soylent website! Now with that out of the way, it may seem expensive but when you add up how much you spend on your average restaurant meal or on weekly groceries it really isn't that bad. Your average 'meal' of Soylent is far less than your average meal at a restaurant, and a good amount less than what you'd spend on groceries to make a healthy meal.FINAL THOUGHTS:I can't recommend Soylent enough. I still love food and always have, and I don't think that will ever go away. I am not committed to living on 100% Soylent the rest of my life and I don't think anyone should be. Food is enjoyable and very social. Soylent is much less so in both departments. Where it does shine, however, is in it's convenience factor. At work I take two bottles for 800 kcal. I am able to 'eat' (really, drinking) my lunch at my desk while able to get more work done. I'm also able to monitor my caloric intake with ease and between that and my exercise I've lost 10 pounds in the two weeks I've been using it.Give Soylent a try-- If it interests you at all after reading what I've had to say, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the slightest!
