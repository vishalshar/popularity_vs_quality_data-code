I've been upgrading my house with web and mobile enabled products, and this is one of the key items I wanted to add.  To say I hated my old basic unit would be an understatement.  One of my key requirements was that it had to handle 9 zones, which not a lot do without an add-on module (a lot of the units are 8-zone).  I also wanted a clean, easy to use interface, so I reviewed as many screenshots of each unit as I could.  After extensive review of the other products on the market and reading all of the positives and negatives, I decided on the netAQAU WIFI.  I was a little skeptical given how new it was and the lack of extensive reviews, but it fit my needs and had quality reviews.The product seems to be very well made.  The install would have been super easy, but the wifi didn't seem to have a very long range.  I got it set up easily in my living room connected directly to my router, but once in the garage, the wifi would not pickup my router.  I ended up having to run an Ethernet cable directly to the unit.  Not a big deal, but I did pay extra for the wifi.  If the wifi had worked, I would have easily given the product 5 stars.  Or if I had purchased the non wifi version and run Ethernet to start, I would have given the product 5 stars.The setup was a breeze, and I really like the clean and very easy to navigate GUI.  I also like that I can name the zones (I had to tape a handwritten note above my last unit to remember which zone did what).  While I didn't purchase it for this or even know about it, I really like that it has a slope/clay setting to minimize runoff, which is very important where I live, given that I have both a large slope and clay.Since I live in San Diego, where it rarely rains anyway, I don't care that much about rain gauges and weather forecasts.  I'll just set it up so that I can control it from anywhere and adjust it via the web if I need to.Other than the lack of range on the wifi, my only other complaints are that (1) the cover is a pain to install and remove (they need a hinge on one side with a latch of some sort on the other (there are six small screws currently, and I've already lost one of them); and (2) there is no mobile app.  I spoke to the company, and they are working on it, which I new when I purchased the unit, but it would be nice to get out sooner than later.My last comment is that the company is extremely responsive and helpful.  Five of my zones went out the week I installed this unit, and I was sure it had to be their product.  They were able to determine that it wasn't their product's fault, but instead of just leaving it there, they helped troubleshoot where the problem actually was.  Very coincidentally, the common wires that connected the 5 zones broke.  Once rewired, it worked perfectly again.
