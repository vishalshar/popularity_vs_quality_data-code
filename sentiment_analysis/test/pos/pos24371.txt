I was intrigued by the idea of multi-color LED lighting and was planning on buying Philips Hue. I'm glad I watched some comparison videos - LIFX appears to have equal or better quality lights, but with no need for a hub. I bought one bulb to start, just to try it out, and I'm already in love with it. The colors are bright and vivid, and the ability to control the lights from my phone is super convenient. I've ordered a 4-pack to finish replacing all the old bulbs in my bedroom and bathroom.
