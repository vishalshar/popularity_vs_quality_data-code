I bought this phone originally to use as a small media player but ended up getting phone service for it.  Pros and cons based on personal experiences are listed below. Overall I absolutely love this device and couldn't be happier with it.Pros:-- the price! The phone was priced at $30 when I bought it. It's very hard to get a decent no-contract unlocked Android phone at that price.-- great size if you're looking for something small. I only know of one other type of Android phone that has a similar size but didn't like the appearance, and the OS version was older.-- clean, minimal, slick appearance-- although the resolution is low, the small screen size makes the resolution look decent. This isn't an ideal phone, however, for someone with very poor vision since the text is small. It can be increased, but since the phone size is small increasing the text size means fewer words on the screen.-- great sound quality via headphones, and the sound output via the speakers was very loud given the size of the phone. A possible "con" is that the lowest volume setting above mute is still a bit loud, but some people might like that.-- runs Android 4.4.2, which for my needs was just fine. I do not know if any version updates are planned, but there was a small OS patch available to download. The OS version after the patch was still 4.4.2. Phone service was not needed to get that patch.-- zippy response time given the slower processor speed-- runs streaming apps without any problems, including Spotify (had to use a version from a year ago to be able to sign in), Jango, and Pandora. I haven't tried any others.  Spotify music can be downloaded to the external SD card.-- streaming videos work ok (only tried Netflix and YouTube) although it seems the frames per second is lower on this phone than with higher-end phones. If you only plan on using this for listening to videos you should be fine, but given the size and the noticeably slower FPS it's not the best phone for actively watching videos.  I did not try download any videos so I can only assume that works.-- games work surprisingly well, although I only tried Angry Birds and Ball-Hop. I don't know if anything like Grand Theft Auto would work on this phone, nor do I know why you'd try.-- apps CAN be installed to the SD card-- works with 64gb cards (at least my card works fine, I'd think other 64gb cards would as well)-- battery life. No it's not the greatest, but how much battery life can you expect in a phone of this size? The battery is small physically since the phone itself is small. I can go a day with light usage (web surfing, checking email, a little music streaming, etc.) and not run out of power.-- very lightweight. I've had the phone for several days and still can't believe how light the thing is.-- worked beautifully with a bluetooth keyboard (tried one made by Newtrent). I have not yet tried audio over BT.-- FM radio, and I mean real FM, not an app that plays FM stations over an Internet connection. You'll need headphones however.Neutral:-- keyboard usage is difficult, at least on the stock keyboard and the third party keyboard I installed, due to the small size of this phone, but this is understandable given how small the device is. I have relatively small fingers, so if you have big/fat fingers you might have a lot of problems entering the correct keys even with auto-correct. If you want a really small phone, you're going to get a really small keyboard.  Voice recognition works fine, so you can speak words instead of typing them out whenever the voice option is available.- limited storage unless you use an SD card, although given the phone's price I think this is an understandable limitationCons:-- IMPORTANT: the phone uses a micro USB cable *BUT* it requires a cable with an extended tip. I tried many standard micro USB cables and in all but one the metallic tip wasn't long enough to charge the battery. In the one that did have a tip that was long enough, the connection was loose and I had to keep adjusting it to get it to charge. The cable that comes with the phone works great, including for transferring files, but if you lose that cable you might be out of luck. DO NOT LOSE THE CABLE THAT COMES WITH THE PHONE!!-- outgoing phone sound can be slightly muffled (I only tried over AT&T and a wi-fi voip call), but spoken words are still understandable. Incoming audio was fine. If you want a phone for hours of talking, this probably isn't your best option-- camera photos are low quality. They'll probably do fine in an emergency, such as an auto accident or something else where you have to take photos immediately, but otherwise you probably won't be using the camera. And there's no flash.
