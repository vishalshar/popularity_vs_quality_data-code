This stuff is amazing. I'm in my early 20s and have been having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep during the night. I tried straight up Melatonin alone, and that did not help at all. It gave me the jitters and made me wake up more. After doing a lot of research, I found this stuff. The reviews were pretty good, so I decided to try it for myself. It says to take one packet per night, but I found this to be a little too much for me. I take 1/4 of the packet per night (one packet lasts me 4 nights). I usually just take it under the tongue and then wash it down with a little bit of water. I don't mind the taste. It's not super flavorsome but it doesn't taste like medicine. I usually fall asleep within 30 - 45 minutes of taking it AND stay asleep for a good 8 hours or more, depending on when I need to wake up. I feel refreshed when I wake up. This stuff is my saving grace for sleep.
