In my practice we work on a lot of small scale public installations, and it is very important for us to promote our work through videos that show process of the design, the fabrication and the installation. I purchased Mevo for the possibility of making this process simpler, less expensive and more immediately available to the public through social media.What I love about it is that you can live edit Mevo using your iPhone or iPad (ie. control where Mevo is looking and zooming) which is a really innovative feature that can make a simple shoot look like it was shot by more than one camera (the camera does not move, its all digital). This basically means you can have a production that feels much more expensive from a little cheap camera.It has very cool design and very compact size. Mevos battery lasts an hour when not plugged in, which is about standard for a camera of this size, but since mostly I use it inside the lab I can plug it in so this is not an issue. Its a great product with a lot of possibilities and applications and I am looking forward to making a lot of good videos!
