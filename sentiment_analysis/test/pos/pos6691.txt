We had a 60 pound foster dog with OCD joint disease. When we brought him in he had to get a full head of steam for a single flight of stairs. After two weeks on the Joints supplement he was jumping to and from the 2nd to last stairs between the 1st and 2nd floors of our house. Now we have a pit/mastiff mix puppy that will probably reach 80 pounds. We are adding JOINTS to his diet already to prevent a likely onset of hip dysplasia. Since we're on the dirty streets of NYC, we are trying the IMMUNITY line as well.
