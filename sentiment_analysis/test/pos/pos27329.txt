A five pound bag of Victor was supplied to me from the Breeder of my Border Collie puppy when I picked her up back in January, it is what the Breeder feeds all her BC's.  I chose to switch to another brand as Victor was not available to me locally.  My little girl had a rough start between an upper respiratory infection, allergic reaction to medications and then steroids being administered to help counteract the allergic reactions.  As a result, her stools were on the loose side.  I decided to switch back to Victor to see if that would help.  Unfortunately, it did not due to the protein content being too rich for Lucy's system. I order the wrong formula for her, no fault of the food at all.I am giving it four stars only because I cannot get it locally, and am not comfortable with buying this online as far as freshness is concerned.  Just my OCD showing.  I believe it is a good product and has been rated as a 4-star product by several organizations. This formula just isn't the right one for my girl.
