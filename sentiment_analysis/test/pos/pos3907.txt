I have had Apply earbuds with my first iPod in 2002, and each and every pair I have tossed because they would not stay in my ear holes. I always felt cheated because they never worked for me. These make the Earpods supplied with my iPhone 6+ useful and comfortable.Recommend if your Earpods don't stay in your ear or they are uncomfortably stuffed into you ear.
