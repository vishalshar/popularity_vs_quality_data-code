Update, Jun '16. Still buying it, still finding it unusually effective with my eczema. There are a lot of products that say Eczema but maybe two that actually work. Count me a big fan or Seaweed,Earlier: There are very few products I have found that help with excema, other than steroids.  This is one of only two I have found that is effective.
