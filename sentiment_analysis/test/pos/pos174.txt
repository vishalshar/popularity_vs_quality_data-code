The material is light but very strong. All the features described work extremely well. The shape of both utensils, in my opinion, is great. As if the design was actually made for human mouths rather than cheap, simplified imitations of cutlery. Overall a pleasure to use and exceeded my expectations for an on the go utensil set. I am buying a second pair for my partner at her request.
