I have never liked the look of the clunky fitness trackers that are so popular now and have missed wearing a "real" watch. This watch/activity tracker has come to my rescue. I actually wear this thing; I did not want to get alerts about messages and phone calls on my watch, and that the primary reason I do wear it. The fact that it is waterproof is a major plus as well. I purchased the Steel version to get the glass face and have had no problems with it scratching. Additionally, the vibrating alarm works well if you sleep with the watch on (I know it will track my sleep if I keep it on, but sometimes I just have to give my wrist a bit of breathing room). It is easy to sync via a Bluetooth connection to your smartphone or tablet. Two months into wearing it pretty much every day and most nights, I have not had any problems (and no signs of the battery wearing down -- the company says it will last 6-8 months). I would buy this again.
