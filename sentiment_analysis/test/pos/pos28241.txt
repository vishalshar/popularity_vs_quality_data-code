I must learn to eat with less grain in my diet; so, these Simple mixes make it possible to bake some things I can eat. I added fresh bananas and ground flax seed to the ingredient list. The recipe made 12 regular muffins. I sprinkled a small amount of nutmeg, cinnamon, and coconut sugar on the hot muffins when they were taken from the oven. These muffins were moist and dense in texture. Half of them were wrapped and frozen for later use. Next time I will add walnuts.
