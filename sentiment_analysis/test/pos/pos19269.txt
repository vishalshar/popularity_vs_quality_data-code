They are amazing! I've had this pair of head phones for a bit over a month now and they are nothing short of spectacular. The sound from them are just perfect and not overly bassy like other gaming head sets, it comfy as well with the padding that's super cushy and is pleasing to wear as well for the long game times and over night sessions. The build quality as well is a major plus, with extra bulk in places that you would think that would break it hold up extremely well. I'm super happy with them, I would recommend getting this pair of head phones over the other brands.
