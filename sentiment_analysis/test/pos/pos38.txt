I work in the maritime industry, as an engineer. This imager is an indispensable part of my tool kit now. With this device, I can walk around an engine room on a vessel in operation with my Galaxy S5, spot exhaust leaks, steam leaks, hot bearings, hot wiring, hot electrical motors, or any kind of hot spot which may signal inadequate lubrication, a leak, or impending failure of machinery. If something radiates sufficient heat, or is cold relative to its environment, it will definitely show.The Seek Thermal uses an uncooled microbolometer with a chalcogenide lens transparent to infrared, and while it operates, you can hear a mechanical shutter clicking. This is the device performing its regular self-calibration. The Seek Thermal requires a phone or tablet that is capable of providing power through its port; check Seek's compatibility list to ensure that your phone meets the standard. While it operates, it does drain a significant amount of power from your phone's battery. After some tens of minutes in operation, expect to see battery drain in the area of 10 to 20%. For best results, get an extended battery pack for your phone or keep a charger handy. Also, it helps to have an extension cord to allow you to aim the camera independently of the phone. Make no mistake, this is not a precision instrument. It is, however, more than sensitive and accurate enough for a casual thermal survey.Using their thermal imaging app, you can change the color filters for the imager, enable overlays that show the temperature in degrees in the center of the camera's field of view, slide back and forth from viewing the color image from your phone's back camera and the image from the thermal imager, take pictures and video, and more. If you enable an overlay, the information in it will be recorded as well.With the introduction of smartphone-attached thermal imagers like the Seek Thermal, we're one step closer to turning science fiction into science fact. In a hundred years, people will think nothing of thermal imagers, terahertz imagers and Geiger counters being built directly into their phones as cheap, widely-available components. But for now, this is pretty impressive. With this device, and others like it, any trade worker can afford to perform their own basic thermal surveys of their home and workplace environment, for any purpose.
