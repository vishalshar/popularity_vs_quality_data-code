Have had for approx 1 week.  1 for cat, 1 each for 2 sets of keys, 1 for my gun, 1 for my back pack.Satisfied so far.  They connect when I'm in range and the phone app shows me the last location they connected with me.I have not had any "hits" on the crowd location yet.  So far things work as advertised.
