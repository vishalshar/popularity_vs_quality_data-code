I spent a lot of time deciding which reusable sandwich/snack bags I wanted to order and the two things that kept me from deciding on BlueAvocado without question were reviews that said the zips were too hard to open and close and that they had a strong plastic smell. Neither of these things are true for me. I thought the zips were easy to open but not TOO easy to open, I don't have to worry about them spilling or opening on their own. (Keep in mind I have carpal tunnel, cubital tunnel, and tendonitis in my thumbs. I often can't open the lid to sealed bottles or chip bags without help.) And I definitely didn't have any problems with the smell. They had a slight plastic smell when I opened them, considering they are plastic and were wrapped in plastic, but after washing them I couldn't smell any sort of plastic smell. I've had them for several weeks now and I love them. They are very easy to clean and look very nice in a lunch box.
