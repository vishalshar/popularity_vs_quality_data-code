I love having kale and spinach for smoothies. Lately I've been purchasing large "tubs" from one of the large box stores. The problem was that it would go bad quickly, resulting in my having to dispose of a bunch of ruined kale/spinach.  Using the Fenugreen FreshPaper Saver Sheets, this is no longer the case. Somehow it enables my vegetables to remain fresh longer. Often, I've used up the vegetables and can use the sheet for a short time on something else. I absolutely LOVE these sheets! No more throwing salad greens, kale or spinach 'money' down the garbage disposal! Excellent product!
