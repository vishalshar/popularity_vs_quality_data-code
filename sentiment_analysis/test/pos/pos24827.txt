We have two 15 year old male cats, Taylor and Alex.  Someone had abandoned the two of them near our house.  They look to be Maine Coons, or a mix of that bread.  We took them in and have loved every day with them.  They are both indoor / outdoor cats and are feed a high protein dry food daily along with a snack.Earlier this year, in the spring, Taylor developed a limp that we started noticing and then beginning in June we began to notice that his left shoulder was protruding, a little at first, and then more noticeably.  Looked kinda like it was dislocated.  Initially, we thought the limp was simply due to old age and protruding shoulder was due to a physical injury from jumping down from a high place.  Prior to this he was still eating as usual, somewhat picky, but still as usual.  He was also drinking water, behaving and sleeping as he normally would.So we brought Taylor to the vet in late June (hadn't been since getting all his shots and neutered when he was a kitten).  I showed the vet a video of Taylor walking towards me while in the family room, so that he could see his gait in a more natural setting than in the vets office.  After he examined Taylor, the vet said he suspected it was a tumor that had wrapped itself around his shoulder.  He couldn't say with certainty until an xray was done.  When the xray results came back, he confirmed what we had hoped he wouldn't.  It was a tumor.  The vet said he was pretty certain it was cancerous, but would only be able to know more definitively if we did a biopsy, which of course would be an additional cost.  We went through a bunch of scenarios from, if it was cancerous, what are the options for a 15 year old cat?  Everything from amputation of the affected leg/shoulder to radiation and chemotherapy.  We decided against any of the invasive procedures due to his age and what he might gain (perhaps a few months?) from all of that and instead opted to try and give him as much pain relief as possible (keeping in mind that up to that point, he really hadn't changed his daily behavior).  So we went home with a prescription for gabapentin drops to help ease any nerve discomfort / pain.  We gave him 1 dose and it made him so drowsy he didn't want to eat, we discontinued it's use.Well, I'm the type that likes to look for potential alternative solutions.  So I started doing some research into any available cat supplements for cancer, knowing that there isn't a 'magic bullet' out there, but rather looking for something that would give our beloved Taylor a better quality of life in his twilight years.  Perhaps even slowing the progression of the disease.I found a number of products to try, and started giving them to Taylor, mixed with his usual daily treat of Temptations Classic dry treats.  We have been feeding him these supplements since late June of this year (about 4 months now), and the results are very encouraging.  The tumor around his should has shown no visible signs of getting larger and seems to be just a bit smaller, though that could be our wishful thinking (it's not, however getting noticably larger though).  He walks with far less limping (perhaps around a 60-70% reduction) and he maintains his daily routine of eating and drinking regularly, going outside to walk around and lay in the sun and climbing our stairs to sleep on our bed in our 2nd story house.  So lots of climbing and jumping.Here are the nutritional supplements we give Taylor once a day:1/4 Tsp - PureAll by Simien Pets:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SQORJSS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=11/4 Tsp - Omega-3 by Simien Pets:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0161JI55K/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=11/8 Tsp - Immunity by Bixbi:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048ZAR5G/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=110 Drops - CoQ10 by Stay Well Pets:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CSWID1Q/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=18 Drops - Life Gold by Pet Wellbeing:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BCQR10I/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1Now, I'm not a vet (nor a medical doctor) but I do have a degree in BioChemistry and some graduate work in Molecular Biology / Immunology so I can appreciate what these supplements have the potential to do for animals cells (especially those stressed by a disease like cancer).  The number one key thing to remember (in addition to there being no 'magic bullets' out there) is that these are supplements, and not replacements so it's important that some kind of balanced diet is maintained where possible.  And while we are hopeful Taylor's tumor is not actually cancerous (benign), we realize it is most likely cancerous (malignant) so we are trying to do everything we can using supplements to give him as many pain free/less pain, quality days as we can going forward - So far, with great results.
