I've had this for just under a week.  The setup was a bit of a challenge for me, but once done it seemed easy in hindsight.  It's a very clean app and a great solution to door openers without the built-in smart function.  Apparently you can use it with IFTTT, but they don't have their own channel there yet due to cost.
