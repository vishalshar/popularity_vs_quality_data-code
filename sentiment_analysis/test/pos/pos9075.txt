I purchased Quad Lock for my mountain bike..  I needed to get the phone out of my shirt pocket.  I received the Quad Lock and it worked just as advertised.  On Saturday, August 27, 2016 at 8:30 AM EDT while riding my bike on my normal street route, I crashed when my front tire popped while turning onto a side street.  I was going between 16-20 mph.  I took a beating, sprained fingers and elbow, road rash all over, bruised ribs.. I got up quickly and started to ride my bike home, not knowing I a flat, I crashed again about 20 yards later when I tried to turn onto the street towards my house. Luckily, I was going MUCH slower.  My bike?  bent handlebars, damaged to right hand gear shift and brake, plus the damage to the tire.  I never even thought about my phone..  When I fell the second time.. I decided it was time to call my wife to come and get me as well as the bike.  My phone was still connected to the quad lock, in the same position as when I connected it t and I could not believe it did not have any damage and that it did not become loose and fall off.  In fact, the tie-wraps and the quad lock base did not even budge.  I was lucky.. No broken bones and for this fall.. Quad Lock staying put on my bike also saved me the $600 for a replacement iPhone 6 Plus. For that one fall...  Quad Lock paid for itself!!!!  I highly recommend this product as it worked for me.  Hopefully.. I will be as lucky in the future... The only bad thing, unrelated to Quad Lock was the $500 deductible for the ER visit...
