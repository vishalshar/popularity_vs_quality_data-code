I really like these rokform cases. Ran one on my five and just received my second 6plus case. The first 6plus case lasted a year of heavy use. The rubber started getting loose so I purchased a replacement that should last until the 7 comes out next year. I like the way the case feels in my hand, the magnet is so cool I slap the phone to all types of metal places. I have had the motorcycle mount for over two years and it fits tight and is easy to use.
