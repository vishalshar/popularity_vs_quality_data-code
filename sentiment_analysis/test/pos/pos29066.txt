I bought a related product, the SlimPort Nanoconsole SlimPort NANO.CONSOLE: SlimPort to HDMI Adapter Dock & Bluetooth Touchpad Remote Control for LG V10, LG G4, LG G3, BlackBerry PRIV, Nexus 5, Nexus 7, Predator 8, more, about a month ago to use my LG V10 to play over-the-top TV phone apps in rooms and places where I dont have a cable connection but I can put a TV or monitor there.  Im pleased with the Nanoconsole; the touch remote control is very useful for controlling my phone when Im not close to my phone and it comes with all the necessary cables I need to set it up and connect it to a TV (HDMI cable, Micro-USB charging cable to charge the phone while its playing videos on my TV).I wanted to have this capability with me when Im on the road or in the office, which is why I got the SlimPort 4K HDMI adapter.  In terms of playing TV apps running on my phone on TVs and monitors, it works just like the Nanoconsole and the video quality is the same.  The picture quality of my phone apps on a TV is really good.  Note that the SlimPort 4K HDMI adapter does not come with the touch remote control, HDMI cable, and Micro-USB charging cable that come with the Nanoconsole.I have the SlimPort adapter, a spare HDMI cable, and the Nanoconsole remote control in my briefcase for when I want to play my phone apps on a TV or monitor when Im away from home.  Works great.  Im always thinking of new apps on my phone to show on a TV, beyond my usual streaming movie and sports apps.  Playing the videos Ive shot and pictures Ive taken with my phone look beautiful on a big 4K TV.SAME CAUTION APPLIES AS WITH THE NANOCONSOLE:  make sure you have a phone that supports SlimPort before buying this, because the SlimPort 4K HDMI adapter only works with phones that support SlimPort.  Ive been using it with a LG V10, Nexus 5, and Amazon Fire HD 6 without any problems.
