I love the game! it works like described from many reviewers. I was disappointed though with the packaging. There was no packaging. The game box was just shrink wrapped. The game came in a beautiful box but it was damaged. This item needs to be kept in the box for storage. Please look at the photos. It's not impressive at all. The 3rd photo is inside the box. They sent me a track with scrapes on it. Not good to try to impress my friends.
