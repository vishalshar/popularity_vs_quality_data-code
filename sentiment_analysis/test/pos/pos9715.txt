This mount works nicely for road bikes, but the diameter of the opening was too small to fit on my stem. I did get it to mount on my handlebars, but only with no rubber insert at all. Fortunately, my handle bars had some internal striations and the mount does not slip. So, the company may need another product with a wider opening for folks that want a stem mount.
