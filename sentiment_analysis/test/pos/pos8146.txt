A healthy cat like Ding-Ding, 8 years old with a small skin tumor on one ear responded very well to a daily dose of 1/8 teaspoon. The small pink and red patch which seemed resilent disappeared within one week of ingesting this food. But a senior cat Juno which also has skin cancer on one ear has shown no signs of improvement as it was more advanced and different than Ding-Ding's. Patty the other senior has large dandruff like flakes on the skin, especially on the back. Since Patty is quite obese, she cannot clean her back. Ingesting 1/8 teaspoon of this, makes Patty's flakes appear to be finer and smaller in size. Not sure if this is an improvement but will monitor her.  The difficulty of administering is that the cats sometimes refuse to eat the food I gave them so they did not take in the superfood that day.Update: 11/27/2015: I have been feeding 1/8 teaspoon of this powder to my cat Ding-Ding each day. I either mix with wet food or sprinkle on dry food, trying to get him to eat it up. The dark spots and sun spots on his white ears and sides have subsided. He goes out in the afternoon and seems to be doing fine. I also start giving some to my cat Jasmin which has a persistent red eye condition. The vet has run out of antibiotics to give her. I will monitor on how she is doing.
