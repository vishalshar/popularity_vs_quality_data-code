Great add on to any car. My car isn't just any car though.  I Uber part time and people in general are stinky. That's right, your driver doesn't smell it's the hundreds of people mixing their body odor with perfume, Cologne, sweat, and god knows what else that makes a stinky Uber. This solved my problems. I'm no longer reminded of last night as I head to work in the morning.
