WOW!! Love this stylus.It's brilliant with FiftyThree Paper on my iPad Air 2 but also works exceptionally well with other apps like Noteshelf and Art Studio. I ordered replacement tips in case they are as fragile as some suggest, but I love this stylus so much that I will willingly buy replacement parts as needed.I was lusting after a smaller iPad Pro with Apple's new stylus (the Pro is too big for my needs) but this stylus gives me much of the same functionality on my iPad Air 2. At this point I am also planning to sell my Wacom tablet. This stylus is that good.
