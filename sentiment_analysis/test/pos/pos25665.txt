Easy to install.  I as able to put it up myself by taking off a strip of the backing at the top and then placing it and removing the rest of the backing once it was on the wall.  Then I used a squeegee to flatten it and the card to remove the smaller bubbles.  It took less than 15 min.  It stays in place and is fairly invisible when clean, but edges are clear enough to avoid anyone writing on the wall instead of the board.  I love it!
