Upgraded to iPhone 6s after my trusty note 4 screen broke. I had used iPhone 4 as my last iPhone but I wanted to come back to apple as for there is better corporate supports for in house apps for Apple and good works for emails. I quickly realized iPhone 6s battery was limiting me and I was out of battery with moderate use in 6 hours. I hate carrying chargers around so I started looking for battery cases. The apple case makes the iPhone taller and just looks weird.I ordered Thia last week and couldn't be happier now I can go a whole day without coming close to a charger. The case itself is not much thicker than the spigen slim armor that was on my phone before. It does make the phone heavier I would say twice as much but it's not major issue I use my phone with one hand and now it after like couple of mins my finger hurts because of the weight.But again it's not a deal breaker and love the fact that my phone last all day. To turn on you power on using the volume up button for like 5 secs and it takes about 4 hrs for fully charge. You can use your phone while charging. The case for protection is so so but I am sure it's better than not having a case the quality is good and feels nice and smooth in your hand.Highly recommended !!!!
