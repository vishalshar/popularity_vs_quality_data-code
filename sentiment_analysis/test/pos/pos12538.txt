It's like a two-way remote for your phone and your keys. (The XY Find It rings your phone, the app beeps the XY Find It.) The app can also detect when the XY Find It goes out of range and let you know, and it can help you find an item hot-or-cold style. (The app uses "far" for cold, "near" for warm, and "immediate" for hot.) The battery can be replaced, it can take a beating, it has a gasket inside that helps keep water out... you get the idea. It's made to be used.It's not a GPS device, so you can't track things with it as if you were using Google Maps or something. The app detects its Bluetooth signal when it's nearby and if it goes out of range, it remembers the location where it last detected it.Unfortunately, the app doesn't work worth beans on my older phone. I didn't really think it would; Bluetooth is garbage on older Androids, so if you have like an Android 4.4 (KitKat) I'd upgrade my phone before attempting anything Bluetooth if I were you. (Seriously. Friends don't let friends KitKat and Bluetooth. Upgrade your phone.)It's not perfect, Bluetooth devices are subject to interference, but it's proven to be one of the most useful gadgets I've ever tried. Why wasn't this a thing when I was a teenager?
