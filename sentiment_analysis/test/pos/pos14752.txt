I called BestBuy and asked them to hold a DJI Phantom 4 for me. I ran across The Autrel X-Star Premium. Autel answered the phone when I called to ask questions. DJI didn't. Within three days of practice an familiarization I was capturing high quality sunsets a quarter of mile out over the Atlantic Ocean while smoothly approaching the shore with my brother and daughter waving hello.I choose orange because the Coast Guard Chopper's uses it to be easily spotted at a distance. This is a very high quality product with a light learning curve and lots of features. I purchased the Hoodman portable quick fold Orange 5'ft. Landing Pad to go with mine and an extra battery. I am very satisfied and I'm glad happy to announce that I'm not feeling frustrated in any way, shape or form. Video on YouTube Xstar Premium Atlantic City.
