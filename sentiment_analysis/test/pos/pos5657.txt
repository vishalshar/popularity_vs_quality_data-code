Had some minor troubles getting it to sync with my galaxy siii, but after pairing it with my ipad and applying the update to the ilumi, I haven't had a problem since. Works completely as advertised. The app works okay, but I'm sure it's a work in progress. A holiday light show with switching red/green might be a nice addition for the app.
