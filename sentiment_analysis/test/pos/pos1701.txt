I LOVE THE PHONE. I LOVE THE COLOR AND ITS BUILD PRETTY GOOD. THE ONLY THING THAT I DON'T LIKE IS THAT THE PHONE DOES GET PRETTY HOT WHEN YOU USE IT PRETTY HEAVY. LIKE WHEN PLAYING GAMES AND CHARGING AND USING IT AT THE SAME TIME. I WISH THE SCREEN BRIGHTNESS WAS BETTER. ESPECIALLY ON BRIGHT DAY. YOU CANT REALLY SEE THE SCREEN. OF COURSE THIS ISNT A SAMSUNG PHONE. 2 DIFFERENT PHONES AND BUILD QUALITY. ONE COST LIKE 600 PLUS AND THE OTHER ONE IS LIKE 300 BUCKS. OVERALL THE PHONE IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE. AND DOES A PRETTY GOOD JOB. CANT WAIT TO SEE A PART 2 OF IT. I THINK ITS A GREAT PHONE.
