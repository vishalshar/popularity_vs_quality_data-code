Now it's time for another 'Good Idea, Bad Idea.' Good Idea: the purification really works no matter how gross it looks while working, and it completely purifies a large amount of water. Bad Idea: Nearly impossible to clean completely as the brown stuff sticks to the bag like glue, it spills over a lot when closing the top, the spigot hose doesn't attach anywhere so it falls to the ground all the time, and the flow is very slow. Its worth the money no matter what other reviewers say (although if the price of the P&G packs are any indicator, you're really paying for those more than the bag), but probably more for base camp than survival prep. This has been another 'Good Idea, Bad Idea'.
