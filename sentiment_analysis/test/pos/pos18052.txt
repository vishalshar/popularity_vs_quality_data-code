So I have had to always use prescription deodorant to keep my smell manageable. Bad thing about that is that they put extra aluminum in it to make it prescription strength.I have a strong smell and was skeptical if this would work. First I started off with Tom's and that is the worst deodorant ever. You smell great for 1 hour and then start smelling like BO.Next I tried this product and I am glad that I did because it works. Now the application is different then your regular deodorant. They give you a stick but I always end up using my finger. You have to give it a couple of days because when you switch over your old deodorant is still clogging up your pores and needs to work its way out. There might be some slight irritation but it goes away in a couple of days. Then again I haven't seen my armpit in a while so it might have just been there all along.Another good thing is that your shirts will not have the deodorant cake under the armpits. Often I remember my shirts would get a hard and have a slight white crust under the armpit when you use prescription strength one. This one doesn't leave anything and is great.
