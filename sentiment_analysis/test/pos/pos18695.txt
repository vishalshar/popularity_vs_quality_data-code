Ordered one.  I've been seeing them advertised on Facebook and since I had some credit I had not used on Amazon, I came here to get one.  It arrived "lickity-splitly" and I soon figured out how to get it running.  Easy set up, really. I now have 4 different guitars programmed into it, one with nylon strings, another is a 12 stringer, the other two are "steel string" and all are acoustic-electric.I couldn't be happier nor more impressed.  I've not fooled around (yet) with alternate tuning settings but I'll get there soon enough as I've been using them more and more lately.Anyway, it's a great product and less than a week old with me, it's proved very useful so far.
