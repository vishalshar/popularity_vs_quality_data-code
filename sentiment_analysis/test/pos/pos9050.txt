I have purchased my Bellabeat Leaf Nature back in October and loved it so much that as soon as Bellabeat Leaf Urban came out I have purchased it as well.  I am a big fashionista and I was wearing a Fitbit before, which would always interfere with my outfits.  Bellabeat is a great looking piece of jewelry that I always get complemented on and most people are very surprised to find out it's a fitness tracker.The pros- I love the design!!! I also love the convenience of not having to charge it every few days.  I mostly wear it as a bracelet, and remove it only when I take a shower.  It's comfortable to sleep with and most of the time I don't even feel it on my arm.  I like the app, it took some getting used to after the Fitbit, but now I find it to be user friendly, although it's features could be more enriched compared to other fitness tracker apps.The cons - I wish the bracelets were elastic in design and were less hassle to put on.  I hope Bellabeat comes out with that design rather soon.  I also feel that their bracelet accessories are limited in design and more can be done there.  There are already multiple competitors selling bracelets for Bellabeat on Etsy and Amazon.  Their vibrating alarms have a ferocity of a dying mouse.  Unless you are a light sleeper, don't plan to be able to wake up to it.  That feature was a lot better in Fitbit.  In general the alarms are problematic - there are alarms that can be set up for pills, or a wake up call, or levels of activity.  All those alarms feel exactly the same - very gentle vibrations of the leaf, depending on how hectic your day is or where your Leaf is worn, one can easily miss an alarm,  and without a display of any kind on the Leaf it self or a phone notification, it's confusing why your Leaf is vibrating all of the sudden.  I love the meditation feature, but find it immensely lacking.  It's recommended to wear the leaf on the band of the pants while meditating.  I have tried that, but the feedback that I get on my breathing is exactly the same as I get it if I wear it as bracelet, or a necklace.  It means that the Leaf isn't really able to track your breathing or tell you if your are doing it correctly.  It's just gives you an encouragement to pause and meditate during your day.  I hope with time they improve that, I find this to be most misleading of all the features.Something I really would love to see:  since there is no display of any kind, I would love for Leaf to push notifications to the phone: this is your wake up alarm, this is your birth control alarm, you have walked 5000 steps today and have 5000 more steps to go, etc...
