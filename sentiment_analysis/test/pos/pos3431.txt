My female great dane picked up an infection after her first litter due to her immune system being compromised by the puppies. She was losing fur and was very skinny.  After the pups were weaned off her completely we took her to the Vet and got treatment started and got her back to a healthy weight. Unfortunately i was not able to get my male fixed before she went into heat again. So this time i decided to try a supplement  to help my girls immune system so the infection wouldn't come back. So i bought this product. It says on the label that is has never been tested on Pregnant or nursing dogs and i wasn't about to make my dog a lab rat. I didn't start giving her this product until the pups were 3 to 4 weeks old and were only nursing once or twice a day (these pups grew fast) i also only  gave Half the recommended dose for a dog her size (120lbs) and only once a day. The rash did come back but only one or two bumps at first and then when i ran out of the supplement it slowly got worse. Her weight never decreased and even though the rash came back her fur isn't falling out. I whole heartedly believe that had i given a full dose and continued to give it to her that the rash would have gone away with out the use of medication from the vet.  On a side note all the pups were very healthy and strong i don't know if thats because they got a little of this from mom or if they just have good genetics, but i would say that in small doses this is safe for use on nursing dogs
