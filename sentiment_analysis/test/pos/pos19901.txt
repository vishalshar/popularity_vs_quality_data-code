I have purchased several wifi IP cameras and DLink are by far the most reliable consumer grade cameras. I have tried foscam and amcrest to name a few. I have my camera system running through BlueIris NVR software and the DLink cameras are compatible. The embedded web server in the camera is sufficient to manipulate all of your settings.  Overall I'm happy with the quality of the unit.
