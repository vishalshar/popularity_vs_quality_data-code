Where to begin. I'll start with ive owned literally every high end smartphone over the last 7 years. I get a new phone every month or two at most but my daily driver is this phone. I rotate and use others but I ALWAYS comes back to this. Performance is flawless. I get no hiccups EVER. This phone is easily on par performance wise with the s7 edge (which is my other device at the moment) but at a sliver of the price. Everywhere i go people ask and compliment about this phone. On looks. Performance anything. But that's not even the best part of the phone. The best part is the nextbit team itself. I have had a ton of dealings with them since kick-starter. They are the nicest group of people I have ever dealt with. I have convinced 8 people I know through work and friends to get this phone it's that amazing.
