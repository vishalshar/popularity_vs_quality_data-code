As an Asian woman who gets sun damage so easily, I have been using many different products and different brands for treating and whitening my skin; well-known and expensive products in department stores. Yes they work well at first; I could see my face looking brighter and radiant almost instantly when I started using those products. But that was it, just instant glow which has been fooling me to believe that my sun damaged skin is being taken care of!  Truth is that it looks like it is working but only the moment after I applied those products, with no lasting good results! My sun spots getting darker even with sun block lotions.  I wanted to go to Korea for so many different types of laser treatment that actually works deep in skin but I dont have 3 months to do that.Then I found this one (almost by accident in Amazon while searching something different, something new after getting tired of other expensive products; read all the ingredients, and decided to try it as I didnt care too much of what brand I use anymore since they did not deliver what they advertised.  Well this was different; it did not show the instant glow like many others Ive tried , and since I was so used to the products that have been fooling me with instant glow, I was naturally skeptical. And now Ive been using it for almost two months and I am noticing that my face been whitening evenly, the sun spot has been slowly diminishing!!  It also keeps my skin moisturized (I still use a skin toner, essence and sun block though as I have dry skin)  I am really enjoying what I am seeing every morning!  If you are tired of expensive products which give you instant glow really want to see results from sun damage; it will work slowly but it WORKS!  Any items that give you an instant whitening effect is not to trust. I bought this for my mom and my sister. They were like me, skeptical at first, but my sister has been telling me that shes noticing improvement on her face (she had big sun spots on both cheeks) and her friends are asking about this product as well.I wish I could show my pictures to show before and after but I am too shy for it. Instead, I will write more soon!
