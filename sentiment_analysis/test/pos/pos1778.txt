A treatment product that is also a very light, natural-looking make-up alternative. It's very subtle, doesn't look like make-up, but provides just a little darkening and definition, which is what I wanted. I like that I can use it on both my lashes and eyebrows. I was very impressed (and honestly kind of surprised) to see that after using it for about two weeks, my lashes are noticeably darker and appear longer -- so apparently the good-for-your-lashes ingredients seem to be working.
