So far after a couple months this thing has worked perfectly. It seems to hold a charge for a long time, I actually haven't seen it run out of power yet. It was great to have while travelling (you'll never run out of power on airplanes or buses)....it's also great for camping or at music festivals where power might not be available. I like the design and ruggedness. I would highly recommend it.
