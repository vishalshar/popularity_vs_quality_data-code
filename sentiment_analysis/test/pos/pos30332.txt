Another update: Since James and the engineers at Hello worked on my Sense, it definitely works better. The sleep sounds are wonderful, the batteries are full, and it generally seems to be doing what it should. I have changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars because the  pill\sense still collects and presents data with inaccuracy. For instance, it shows that I got out of bed well after I actually did. I think this product is constantly improving, and the staff at Hello seems great; however, Sense does not currently track my sleep habits as well as I hoped it would. With that said, I plan to continue using it will the hope that it will only get better.UPDATE: The CEO, James, personally e-mailed us and overnighted two new sleep pills. They work wonderfully and have restored our faith in the product.  It's a great and accurate product (based on one night of data) with a company that definitely stands behind what it sells -- great customer service!  The sleep sounds are very relaxing and the alarm options not harsh at all; a great way to wake up in the morning!  I do hope that Sense will add a battery soon so that the device does not have to be plugged in to work but other than that improvement, it is a great product and I would highly recommend it.Old review:We are feeling skeptical of your product so far.  1) we received our sense and pills yesterday. The batteries are already low.  2) sense is plugged in and connected to wifi without issue. After quite a few hours (about half a day and one whole night) the sleep sounds function is still not working. The most current version of the app is being used.  3) my sleep data for last night has changed since I woke up.  4) my partner's pill registers in the app and appears to be communicating with sense - however, it did not record data last night.  5) the temperature readings vary by approximately 10 degrees Fahrenheit from our thermometer, which is less than two feet away. At first we thought it was the thermometer. Now we figure the Sense is just doing something else wrong.  We are surprised and disappointed. Please help us remedy these issues and restore our faith in your product and service.
