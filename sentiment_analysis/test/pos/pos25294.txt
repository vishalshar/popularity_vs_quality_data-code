Love this new water filter! So much easier to use than the Britta I had before. The water filters in less time, and tastes lighter and cleaner, like good, bottled water (Figi, mountain spring). Even after I changed my Britta filter, it still tasted heavy, more like straight tap water. Worth the extra $10 for the SOMA + I appreciate thier charitable approach, even if it's just branding, I'll take it.
