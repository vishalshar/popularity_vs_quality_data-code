Bought this at Christmas time for my Shih Tzu. He loves running after the balls after launched but keeps looking for us to put the balls in the machine. When he catches the ball and comes back with it he goes out of his way to avoid walking by the machine, lol. It takes patience and practice to get him to do it himself, which he has done a few times. Think of it as another trick to teach your dog. I only gave this 4 stars because the balls are already starting to shed and fur up after he bites and chews on them.
