Update December 7, 2016 - Pebble has announced it is shutting down, immediately ceasing all watch sales.  But the worst part for Pebble owners is that they will not offer any further support whatsoever, and the warranty of all Pebble watches (regardless of when bought) is no longer honoured.  Bascially, it is now a dead end product.  The new owners of Pebble's software and IP is FitBit, but they are not extending any support to existing Pebble owners.  Both companies are now in my firm DO NOT BUY list.--This is a review for the Pebble Time Round (14 mm band) smartwatch, which I got for my wife as a present. This review will thus be from the perspective of a small-framed woman with very thin wrists. A quick note about the rose gold color before I move on -- the color is much closer to the typical rose gold colored jewelry, unlike the Apple "rose gold" products that are distinctly more pink. So if you're looking to match that rose gold iPad or MacBook, you may be disappointed. Anyway, moving on...For comparison, my wife has worn the original Pebble classic in the past, which was replaced by a Pebble Time (white, non-steel) last year. Even though the Pebble Time is far from the biggest smartwatch out there, it looks gigantic on her. Android Wear watches are basically out of the question. So when the Time Round came out, it was clearly positioned for someone like her. It is by far the thinnest smartwatch on the market (see my comparison photo with the Moto 360), and the 14mm strap is also the thinnest offered anywhere.As my wife was already using the Pebble Time, the Timeline OS is identical except text is arranged to fit better on a round screen. For example, text is centered instead of left-justified. Functionally though, you get the same features, which is in my opinion the most intuitive smartwatch OS. As I always say in my Pebble watch reviews, the hardware buttons interface is perfect for a watch, and much more usable is real life than a tiny touch screen.As with all other Pebble Time series watches, the Round has a colour e-ink display. It is great having an always on screen that can be glanced at, and is totally discrete because it doesn't light up. Outdoor viewing is perfect too. What you lose is the high resolution and bright colours compared to other smartwatches. This is a functional display -- if you're looking for imitation brandname watchfaces then this will most definitely disappoint. Compared to the Pebble Time, the Round's display is noticeably clearer. This may be due to the fact that the display on the Round is directly bonded to the glass, so there is no gap and no distortion.The biggest compromise on the Round is the battery life. This is a two-day charge watch, compared to 5 days or more on other Pebble models. Still, this is better than most Android Wear watches and the Apple watch, so it's definitely something you can live with. It charges very quickly -- a 15 inute top-up gives you another day of use. The suggestion to charge when you take a shower is a good one, this Pebble isn't waterproof anyway.Overall, the Pebble Time Round offers something that no other smartwatch on the market does. It is slim and as close to a normal watch as possible to wear. It looks elegant and classy, rather than screaming geek-tech. It is not perfect, but I see it as the best option for those with small wrists, or who simply prefer their smartwatch to be discrete and functional rather than flashy and in-your-face.
