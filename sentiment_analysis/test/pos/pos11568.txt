This is a great measuring tape which cannot be beaten for accuracy.I especially, like the feature that automatically calculates half of any measure that you have taken. The two memories  with recall are very useful for verification and easy repetition. Additionally, with this tape you can easily switch from imperial measure to metric or use both systems on a single project. The tape is easy to read and requires no specialized training  in units of measure to facilitate its use. I have two concerns, though. Firstly, I find that the belt clip is too small and may not support the weight of the tape especially during activities that involve a lot of bending where the tape may unhook from the belt. Next, I am concerned that a fall may affect the display mechanism, as tape falling is a customary occurrence during the completion of a project. Other than that I am very satisfied with my purchase and invite others to give it a try. By the way if the display blinks erratically, do not despair, just change the battery.
