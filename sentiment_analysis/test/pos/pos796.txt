Bought this beast of a machine a couple of days ago love the performance. It runs most game super fast. If you get this computer I recommend getting rust on it because it runs it like knife thru butter. It is fast cools very well, high performance, not slow, and just a sexy sleek design.If you buy this computer I would recommend buying the extra 8gb RAM form HyperX. You can easily buy this by scrolling down and looking at customers also bought and just click on it. 10/10
