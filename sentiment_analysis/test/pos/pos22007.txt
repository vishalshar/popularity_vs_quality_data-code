This router is amazing.  Since terminating Dish in April, we have only been able to watch "non buffered tv" on our main level (where our router is located).  We live in a townhouse where TVs are setup on 3 levels.  Our previous router (Netgear wrt1200 with two bands, 2.4 & 5 was great for browsing the internet, but as listed above, was not powerful enough for streaming through the entire house.Signal in basement went from 58-62 to 87 with the portal (on our PS3). Signal in master bedroom on third level went from fair to very good (on fire stick).We usually have anywhere from 8-14 devices connected to wifi at one time and the portal handles them all.I had consulted with local IT techs looking for answers to our buffered streaming issues, but no help.  I happened to find this bad boy thru a DigitalTrends article and figured I would give it a try and if it didn't work, we could return it.I cannot speak to playing video games with the portal, but for what we need, we will never consider going back to cable or satellite ever again.The upfront investment  you have to make to cut the cord pays for itself in a few months.Easy setup, (1 sheet of instructions in the box) and the shipping was amazing. Amazon said it would be delivered between 11-15 and 12-15. We got it in 6 days.Paying for a dish per month - $165Paying for a Comcast per month - $217.Having the luxury of whole house nonbuffered tv..............priceless
