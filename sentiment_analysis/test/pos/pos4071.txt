Works great. Two drawbacks- no protective case for the iPad Mini 4 body that works with the keyboard like they make for other models on their own website. Secondly, if you push the iPad all the way down into the hinges as directed you loose the bottom 1/4 of the screens functionality (Facebook for example). Otherwise a great keyboard. Love the backlit keys.
