Training to run a couple 5k events this Spring and wanted headphones that stayed in place while running.  Decibullz are those headphones.  Simple to custom fit and sound as good as any Sony pair I've ever owned.  Cable is long enough to route it under or through a shirt so it stays out of the way.  In line controls work fine also.  Since your earpieces are custom-molded to fit your ears, it keeps other people (teenagers) from trying to use them for their playstation games.  I recommend.
