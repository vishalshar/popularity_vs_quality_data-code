I know it's just a simple piece of plastic carpet -- so I didn't expect it to work as impressively as it did. But I must say it reduced the amount of tracking significantly -- which is all one could hope for.Other than the expensive cartridge problem (which we've solved with a Forever litter tray) the tracking was the only minor issue with the Scoop Free system -- which this item solved.  Highly recommended.
