I love this feeder. We got it in the mail much quicker than expected and it was really easy to set up because our wireless router has WPS. (It works if yours does not but its not as quick to set up). This morning at 6AM while I was snoozing I heard it call our kitty over for breakfast and I got to sleep in! It has been months since I have actually been able to sleep without my cat waking me up for food in the morning. An awesome bonus, I can watch her eat her lunch! Not really a necessity  but it brightened my day nonetheless. My mother loves logging on and watching her too. It was a bit bigger than I thought (maybe they need a picture of it next to a cat also) but it is sleek in design and fits right in. It needs to be next to an outlet.
