I have always had a problem wearing shoes that have shoelaces. The laces caused me so much pain. Had to wear shoes without laces. Read about these in a magazine then found them on Amazon. Put them on my new sneakers (which are only new because I couldn't wear them) and they make my sneakers feel like slippers. I will buy them from now on for every new pair of sneakers
