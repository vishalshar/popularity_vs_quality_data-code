Short version - I love this thing.When I opened the box, I was a bit concerned, since the instruction book and video didn't quite match what I had - there was no microSD -> USB adapter, for example, but I didn't need it.  The printer was basically ready to go as soon as I plugged it in, and so far, I haven't had to mess with any settings other than the quality level for the current print.I've been using this printer almost non-stop since getting it set up.  The noise level is about what a vent over a stove is, quieter than a vacuum cleaner, but still not something I'd want in the room with me for long hours.  I didn't realize that it would come with a spool stand and a small spool of blue PLA to get me started, which was great.  I'm still on that first spool, even after a number of prints of various quality levels.Using the included glue stick on the print bed definitely makes sure the print stays in place as it works, but it also takes a lot of force to remove the item, so be careful with delicate prints!I haven't tried the print from SD card option - since you have to have the printer connected to start the print, it's easier for me to just leave it connected all the time.  It might make more sense if I was running it from a laptop that I could carry away, but it's running on a dedicated computer here.All in all, a great printer.  As with any 3D printer, you have to be careful about the orientation of your print to make sure your support structures are easy to remove, and the software won't let you slice a model, but there are free tools out there like netfabb which work great for that.
