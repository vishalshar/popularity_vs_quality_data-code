I am new to flying and have always been an on the ground or in the water kind of guy when it comes to remote control vehicles.  I have been saving for a bit to get this Drone and it was worth every penny.When it arrived I was excited and in awe when I opened the sweet and very well designed case to see my new Camera Drone.There's nothing I wanted more than to just take it out and fly it. But I knew this was more than just a toy so I took out the manual and gave it a good once over and then pluged the battery and remote in to charge. Later I put the propellers on and left it on my kitchen table until the next day since it was night time.The next day came and i couldnt wait to get her up and filming. So I followed the directions and calibrated the Drone and took it out for its maiden voyage.It was fantastic! The video was crystal clear and the camera was easy to operate from my cell phone attached to the remote. ( im getting a tablet tomorrow so i can have a bigger view).It was a bit chili and I cut the flight short because I wanted to see how the video came out, so I hit the come home button and the Drone just landed itself with very little difficulty and did I mention it was a pretty windy day.The video cam out excellent and I was very impressed.I plan on much more trips to the skys in the future and the Autel Drone is just a dream to fly, I recommend this Drone to anyone looking for an easy to fly and very well made camera drone.If I could give it more stars I would, great job Autel, you have a customer for life!
