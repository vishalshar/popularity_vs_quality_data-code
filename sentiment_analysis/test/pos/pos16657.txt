I have ordered other 3D Printers in the past, every single time they were Dead On Arrival. THIS is the first one to have shown up and basically be working right out of the box. I love this machine. I've already printed a few things and I'm on a 11 hour print right now. Can't wait to get to work on the next one after that. 10/10 would buy again.
