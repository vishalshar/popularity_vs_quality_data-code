I have been looking for a solution to store my kayak, and was always worried about traditional pulley systems with ropes, as I have small kids.  this has been the best solutions and has worked flawlessly. If youre looking for something to lift your kayak or canoe and store it out of reach I would recommend miLifter.  It works great and is very sturdy!
