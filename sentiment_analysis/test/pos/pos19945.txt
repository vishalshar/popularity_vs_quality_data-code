Got this for my two-year old granddaughter.  She really does like it.  It's a simple design.  Just put the magnetic pieces on the scene where you please.  My granddaughter is a bit redundant at this age about where she places them (that will change as she grows) - always in the same place.  She wants to use all the pieces at this age, and not all of them really fit the scene.  That's a plus in my opinion - more room for playing around with placement....not so much for her right now!  It's a simple design - but I think she will actually use it for a couple more years and enjoy it.  Only drawback is that once you punch out the pieces you need something to store them in if you remove them from the board.  Baggies work fine.
