The first time I tried the reCap on my Mason jar containing my daily nutritional shake, I made a huge mess of my kitchen and my face. Be sure to place the Mason jar firmly on the counter when you are trying to get the cap on the jar. Getting the cap on is not always easy 혰 the threads don't catch readily, but they do with some work and a few attempts. That's why you want to place the jar on a firm surface 혰 until you get used to how the reCap goes onto your jar, you may do a lot of spilling.Be sure the threads and the top lip of the jar are very clean (no protein powder, food particles, etc.) when you are putting the cap on in order to get a good seal. I've done this from the start and haven't had any leakage issues. Regardless, I don't dare just throw this in my bag to go about my business 혰 the flip cap part seems like it could pop open fairly easily and spill the contents everywhere. I've been placing my jar in a large freezer bag with a zip top so that I can take my shake to work and not have to worry about ruining my work bag.When you drink from your jar/reCap, you have to keep your index finger on the flip cap to hold it open. Otherwise, it will flip down and hit you in the nose. You can't trust it to stay in the open position without your finger there. Also, if there is residue of your drink (a thick smoothie, in my case), it can collect in the flip cap part and drip out onto your face. That happened to me today at work. Luckily, no one saw.These are definitely overpriced at $28 for four caps. Maybe the price will come down as they gain in popularity. Now that I'm used to the little problems with the reCap mentioned above, I can live with them, for the coolness factor and for the advantages of drinking out of a clean glass Mason jar (I use the Ball Jar Wide Mouth Pint and Half Jars 혰 PERFECT size for drinks). I also plan to use these caps to store dry goods like rice in Mason jars, though I haven't tried that yet.
