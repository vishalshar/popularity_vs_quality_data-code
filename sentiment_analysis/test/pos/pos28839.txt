I think this thing is awesome and the images of illumibowl are exactly what you will see. The only drawback is the battery life. I hooked it up around xmas and it's already on its way out 5 days later. But, that's likely due to the voltage required to power these lights and the time I spent cycling through the colors to find the one I like. I noticed that the bright blue color takes more power to use than other colors such as red and green so if you use blue and the color dims, you can put it on red and get more use bc red requires less power to use. It takes 4 AAA batteries so buy rechargeable batteries if you want to keep this thing hooked up. Also, the cord doesn't detract as much as I liked but it had a clasp that allows you to wrap it around to shorten the length -so you may have to turn it upside down to mount it at the proper height. I'd buy it again and recommend.
