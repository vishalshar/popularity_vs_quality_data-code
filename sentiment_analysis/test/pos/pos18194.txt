Bought it and received it recently.  Really a good concept and a good product !I installed it easily and quickly.The software has some bugs and I am not yet very confident with the smart watering since it stayed stuck on on the second group and never stops....  may be I did something wrong and I still need to learn more,  or not...The app sometime freezes and I need to quit it, restart it , going in the setup zones, try and stop in order to stop the water..... not too good.Can we hope the next version will fix it and give us a detailed  log of the watering duration, time, etc...Knowing the criteria used by Blossom to adjust duration would be very instructive too.
