What a great gadget! The FOBO Tire Plus tire pressure monitor has proven to be a wonderful asset to my carefree driving. It works like a charm and gives me peace of mind. I now know that my tires are all properly inflated. It's silly but it's true.Installing the device was quick and easy. I started by downloading the FOBO Tire Plus User Manual from the FOBO web site and reading it (How could doing this hurt me?) They also have a Frequently Asked Questions document that is worth reading.Next, I downloaded the FoboTire app, entered my email address and activated my account by replying to the email they sent me. This process is completely covered in the User Guide, it is necessary, and is spelled out in detail. This app is central to the setup process. It prompts you through every step of your install.I then went onto YouTube and watched two videos: "FOBO Tire - Video Tutorial for Apple iOS 7.1 and above" and "FOBO Tire - Install Lock Nut." There is also a video for the Android 4.3 and above.At this point I was ready to install the devices. The actual install probably took me all of 10 minutes. Much less time than my studying, downloading the app, and reviewing the videos. I should also mention that I had previously checked my tire's pressure. After all, it would be irritating to find out, after installing the sensors, that I needed to remove them and adjust the pressures.I started the installation by removing the valve caps and wiping off the valve stem threads. I then screwed the FOBO lock nuts all the way down to the base of the threads. PREP IS EVERYTHING.Now I opened my smart phone, started the FoboTire app, pressed the + button, and followed the prompts. Note that you don't have to take a picture of your car during the install. The picture taking can be done later. All my Bluetooth pairings went quickly and the process was over in a jiffy. The app was suddenly displaying all my tire pressures and temperature values along with indicating the charge level of each sensor's battery. Just absolutely lovely. I then went to each sensor and tightened the lock nuts: Security and job done.
