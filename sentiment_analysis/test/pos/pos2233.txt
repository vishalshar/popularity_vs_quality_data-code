We ordered this just this week for my son as he saved all summer long for a drone.  We read a ton of reviews and looked closely at the product reviews from actual consumers.  While this model does not have collision avoidance, something I hope comes in the future, it had everything else we needed at a price my son could save for and purchase himself (with a little help from holiday money!).  We will be updating this review periodically as we progress and get more familiar with the drone and it's features. We will post a box opening video tomorrow when it arrives followed by a video that walks step by step from opening to launching for the first time.  It is our hope that with this being our first semi-professional drone that we can help you learn as we learn.
