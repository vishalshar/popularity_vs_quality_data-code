XY3 is pretty much exactly what I wanted improved over the past model: louder sound, you can find your phone using the button on the device, and plus (same as with the previous model) REPLACEABLE batteries! That's what got me to buy this over the competitors. I don't want to replace my device every time the battery dies!
