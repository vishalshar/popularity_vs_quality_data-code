I'd been looking to switch to a natural deodorant and found awesome reviews for PPP online, and decided to give it a whirl. I've now tried the coconut lime (delish), the orange creamsicle (not very fragrant), the lemonade (similar smell to Pledge), and the thyme & lemongrass (a little Pledge-y too).  I am pleased with the results, however, they didn't come without a few hurdles for me.You might anticipate a few surprises when switching to natural deodorant, including 'pit detox' (check out the Primal Pit Paste website for more info on this). This can include irritation, redness, bumps, or temporary pit darkening. Unfortunately, after about a week or so, I was one of the unlucky ones who began to experience irritation, especially after shaving. I was red, itchy, and stinging. Plus, the detox can cause some soreness in the area.However, since I was committed to using something healthy for my body, I chose to stick it out - but not without a little bit of help. Primal Pit Paste offers another product called "Primal Pit Primer" which is essentially a blend of oils that soothe your skin, and act as a barrier against irritation. I haven't seen this item for sale on Amazon yet (bummer!) but ordered it with a quickness from the PPP site. You apply a drop or so of this oil prior to using the deodorant - and HOLY MACKEREL. The irritation was instantly 95% less. No kidding.I used the primer/deodorant combo for about a month or so, while my body adjusted to my new routine. Now, I only use it occasionally as I feel necessary (like when I feel my shaving irritated my underarms that day).Another transition for me, was getting used to actually sweating again! We are all so plugged up by the commercial deodorants on the market that it seems we have been convinced that sweating = being stinky. Not true! Yes, it's odd to feel a little damp under your arm occasionally.But again, I am choosing a healthier alternative than aluminum.While the regular strength Pit Paste works for me, some folks might need a little more charge. Please note that that PPP does come in "Strong" version (which again, I don't think I have seen on Amazon yet?). Their site recommends you start with regular strength and then bump it up if necessary.....due to the potential for irritation from the baking soda.I prefer the texture of the paste in the pot, but the convenience of the stick. While the pot is more creamy/smooth, the stick is quite a bit more grainy and has some 'drag' on the underarm. Of note: the PPP site sends you a small popsicle stick applicator when you purchase the pot style deodorant, Amazon does not. So, be prepared to use your fingers to apply - which can take some getting used to, especially with nails :)I will continue to use this product, because it works well for me. Might it irritate your skin initially? Yes - but try the primer. Seriously.Need a little more strength? Try the strong version.Dont give up right away!
