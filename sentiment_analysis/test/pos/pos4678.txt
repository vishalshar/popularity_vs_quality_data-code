This is the first drone that I have ever flown, being a newbie to flying and belonging to the 60+ club.  Without a doubt in the "waypoints" mode, you point and it goes.  It is very responsive and tolerates moderate wind extremely well. Want it to come back home?  Just hit return and there it is.  Hit land and it softly descends. It constantly reminds you of the battery time and warns you when to bring the drone back. I have not really learned how to use the camera yet, but in default mode it takes wonderful aerial videos (even impresses my artistic wife!).  I have not yet been bold enough to fly it in the avatar mode, but will update my review when I do.  I highly recommend this drone to those who have not been raised in past generations playing video games and want something to fly that is easy yet sophisticated! AND, of course, tons of fun!
