Only had this a week so far.  Loving the insight to use of my car.  Yes, cars have odometers but this real time data is amazing.  To quantify each trip into MPG and co$t is so informative.  Wish the app showed fuel remaining percentage and the live map is laggy at times, but over all one of my favorite things I've ever bought.
