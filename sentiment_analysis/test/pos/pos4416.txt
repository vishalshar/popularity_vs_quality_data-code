I have been wearing my Shine 2 for about 5 weeks.  I initially wore on my wrist using a 3rd party band by Allrun.  I chose to spend extra ~$5 given all the comments on the provided band, and also the Allrun has fun colors.  The Allrun band is very secure, but I have switched to wearing with the clip as I prefer to wear my "normal" watch on my wrist.  The Shine 2 does have cool watch function, but you have to tap device to see time, and I want to be able to check time with just a glance.  The clip is also great as can wear on my sock when riding bike.For the initial set up, I had a few moments of thinking I had a dud as no response from the device,  but once I figured out the right amount of force to tap the device to wake it up, set up was easy.  I have had no issues with syncing with my samsung galaxy 5.  I like that I don't have to charge the device.  I have found the step counting accurate to the internal tracker in my G5.  Sleep tracking is mostly accurate at least in terms of duration.  It will try to say that I'm asleep when working late at night and sitting for long periods infront of the compuyter.  It does not do that during the day when I am working.  The alarm generally is enough to wake me up in the morning unless I've had a late night.  So for important appointments or if a heavy sleeper, I would not rely on the shine alarm alone.
