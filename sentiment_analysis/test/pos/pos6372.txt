I was really looking forward to using this case for my iPhone as a navigation tool.  The case was nice and the magnet feature was cool. I put the mount on the handlebars and it was a problem getting the phone to line up with the rokform cross on the back.  I tried this repeatedly and the magnet would stick but could not get the parts to line up.  Very frustrating.  Even called rokform but this didn't fix the problem.  Disappointing and had to return.Update to previous review.  I asked Amazon to replace the mount with another one thinking this must be defective with the problems I was having.  When I received it I knew the first one had been returned by someone else.  This one had the screws tightened as Rokform indicates they should be when first opened.  The case also looked new on this one.  The first one you could tell had been used by someone.  This one works much better and goes on fairly easy.  Must have been something wrong with the first so Im changing my review from 1 star to 4 stars.
