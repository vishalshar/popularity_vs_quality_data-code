I just loved this product so much. Going to order again soon. It made my skin really glowing. My break outs reduced a lot too. It keeps my skin really hydrated whole day. I don't wear make up anymore.I use it every time I wash my face which I do only twice a day (morning and night) . I let my face air dry (because even if I use a clean towel or anything, there is still a chance of germs contacting my skin which cause breakouts) and then apply this cream.Just this in my morning routine and my skin has become really clear.I definitely recommend this product if you have dry or normal skin. I think it might make oily skin more oily but I am not sure. I have combination skin.It works wonders for me.
