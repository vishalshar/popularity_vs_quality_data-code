I have been eating Ostrim sticks for 5-6 years as a quick protein boost while I am on the go.  I have always found them pretty dry and salty but chalked it up to being a shelf stable high protein meat stick.I have been buying them on the go a few sticks at a time in grocery stores for 2-3 bucks a pop and felt I needed to get another bulk order through amazon.  During my search I stumbled on Vermont Smoke & Cure's sticks and Amazon had a coupon.  They were cheap enough that if they were not great I could figure out a way to get through them.I just tried my first one and I am hooked. They are moist and very subtle in flavor. Not as bold as I would like a pepperoni but also not salty.After tasting how much better this was I took another look at the company/ product and Ostrim.These sticks win and here is why:While the flavor is subtle it is more palatable than the salty bold flavor in Ostirm Pepper flavor.There is more fat in these which contributes to them being more moist. Fat is not the enemy I would rather more fat and less salt/ sugar.These sticks have less of both salt and sugar and the texture is far superior due to the company making the choice to have more fat present.These sticks are smaller 28 grams versus 42 in Ostrim but about 35% of the stick is protein versus about 33% for Ostrim.Cost is about even if you think about servings being different and per unit these sticks are cheaper.Then there is the matter of responsible farming practices, antibiotic free meats, ingredients that you don't need a chemistry degree to understand.  Vermont Smoke & Cure wins on all accounts.I will be buying some different flavors to try and a turkey stick with a little more flavor and will post reviews on those flavors.
