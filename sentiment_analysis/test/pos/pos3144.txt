Make sure you read the instructions carefully when using this product. The result will be great if you know how to use this.First off, the packaging is beautiful. It came in with microdermabrasion, a detachable cord, a bag of small filters and a manual on how to perform the procedure.It comes with two settings. A high and a low. Use whatever setting best suits you. I usually use high for my first day of the week and low on the second day of the week. Secondly, use the manual as a guidance on what direction to go. After completing the microdermabrasion procedure, remove filter and clean the tip of the microdermabrasion. Wash your face followed by a favorite moisturizer.
