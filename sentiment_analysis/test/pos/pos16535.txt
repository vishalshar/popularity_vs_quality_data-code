I heard of Nootrobox and Go Cubes on an NPR program and though the idea of chew-able caffeine cubes was a good idea.I'm an endurance cyclist and it's not uncommon for me to cycle for 24 hours straight. Like most endurance cyclists I sometimes need Red Bull or Monster to get to the end of the ride but they are bulky to carry and you don't always get sleepy at a convenience store. These Go Cubes come four to a pack (20 packs in the box). Each cube is supposed to be the equivalent of half a cup of coffee.I tried them for the first time a few days ago and I'm very impressed. They are quite pleasant to eat and a single pack of four cubes got me up and running again in about fifteen minutes. I would say they as good as a Red Bull but a lot more convenient to carry and slightly cheaper too.I have two caveats.1. Unlike Red Bull and Monster there is no water to offset the caffeine. Many experts (but not all) believe caffeine is a diuretic and recommend drinking water with caffeine. It might be worth making a point of drinking water with these.2. The taste is not disgusting. Keep them away from toddlers who might think they are candy. Caffeine and toddlers do not mix well. I would say the same thing of caffeinated drinks too.
