I've been using this sleep monitor for over 7 months now and it's really changed my mornings.The main feature I use the Sense for is the alarm that adjusts to my sleep cycle. You set the alarm with an absolute latest "wake me by" time and the device will do its best to wake you up at the ideal point within a half hour prior to your alarm. The idea behind this is that it wants you to wake up when you're not deep in your sleep cycle. It definitely works, as a person who used to just set an alarm for 5:45 and wake up regardless of when I fell asleep I can tell you this is like a godsend.The sense gently rouses you using a progressive alarm and the fact that it chooses the best point is amazing. I wake up feeling energized, not groggy.Though the auto-alarm set is my number 1 feature this device also has all sorts of cool sensors. In the winter primarily I use it to test humidity, it lets me know if I need to run the humidifier (I most always do need to in the winter) or reduce the heat. While it uses an app for specifics, the coolest part is that you just need to wave your hand over the device and it will tell you how good the conditions are. Red means bad, green means good and there are varying hues in between.Another neat feature is the sensor allowing you to  wave your hand over it for info AND to turn the alarm off. Welcome to the future where you turn your alarm off with a hand gesture. So cool!My primary phone is  windows phone, unfortunately Sense doesn't have a windows app. If it did I would use the sleep metrics page a lot more but I do have an android device I keep around just for the metrics. It's really interesting to see how well you sleep, this gives a detailed history of your night, how often you tossed around, when you fell asleep when you woke up, etc etc. It also gives suggestions for your next night of sleep.The tossing and turning is a very helpful feature and for the most part everything is very accurate though when I first started using the device I did have to correct the time I went to bed a couple times. I think it uses the lights turning off and/or a significant motion on the pillow sensor (like someone getting into bed) to determine the time a person went to bed. The fall asleep time it gives is usually pretty accurate (or at least I think it is, don't look at a clock right when I fall asleep) as for this they measure movement and noise levels in the room.In the end, I am so happy I have Sense. It's crucial I wake up when I do and I no longer feel terrible doing it. For the money this was perfect, you don't have to wear anything or remember to set anything, set it up once and you're good to go. Absolutely love it!
