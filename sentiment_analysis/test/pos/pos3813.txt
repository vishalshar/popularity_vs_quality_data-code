I ordered this on a whim since I had a nighttime college class and I thought it could come in handy in a variety of situations. I really like it. It's cute and simple looking, nothing that stands out as an alarm. It's very easy to use - just pull the larger piece away from the base and it sounds until you reattach to the base. Great design.
