My dogs love Easy Additions but the only problem I have is, my older dog Cricket licks the Easy Additions off the dry food and leaves the food. The purpose of using Easy Additions is to get her to eat the food. She would eat all of her food and the Easy Additions at first, then she started licking the EA off the food and leaving the food. I even put water on her food to soften it up in case it's to hard for her to chew since she' almost 13 yrs old. I finally changed food and I now use Orijen and she loved the dry without water or Easy Additions. Then I made a big mistake, I fed them freeze dried raw food from Orijen. Now Cricket does the same with the dry food from Orijen. She does eventually eat her food if we can keep Katydid out of it. But both of my dogs LOVE the freeze dried raw food from Orijen. But Katydid will eat anything even worms, bugs and whatever she finds in the yard. She's like a grazing cow.
