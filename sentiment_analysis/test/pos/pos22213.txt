Easy to install.  Took about half an hour per door  including getting the ladder out and setting the wires up.App has been upgraded once since I purchased and its grea.Notifies me when ever the door is open for more than 5? minutes.Can shut it from app or I think now the iwatch.Only down side, and I would have given it a five star rating , is that the little plastic tabs that it comes with to hold the wires lose their stickiness after about 6 months and fall off the walls/ceiling. This caused my sensor to get stuck in the door one day and as the door closed it ripped the entire system off the ceiling.Suggest either using staples to hold the wires or something else...anything besides the tabs it comes with.Finally, it works with Alexa.  That's cool cause you can ask Alexa if the doors are open'Alexa, ask Garagio if Jenny's door is open'.  And you can ask her to shut them too!Works great for knowing when kids come home....teenagers...opening the door for workmen without giving them the code..or for those day when you drive off and don't remember if you closed the garage door.
