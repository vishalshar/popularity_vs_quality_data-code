I absolutely love this product. After a tough foot surgery, I was looking for an easy way to get around campus (I'm a professor at a Graduate School). I constantly have meetings and walking across a large campus wasn't an option. URB-E saved me! Little did I know when I purchased URB-E, for what I thought was a temporary solution, that it would it turn into my main mode of transportation. Instead of hassling with driving my car, dealing with finding parking, getting parking tickets from campus police, and wasting a lot of time, I simply jump on URB-E (grab a coffee at Peet's) and ride straight to my office. Now when I have meetings on/off campus, I jump on my URB-E which saves me tremendous time/money/hassles. Plus, I get a ton of compliments on how cool I am! I designed some custom inserts myself - yes you can customize URB-E! I really can't say enough about how well designed it is, how well built it is, how smooth it rides, and how much impact this product has had in my life. I feel like I'm doing something good for this planet and at the same time gaining so much by using URB-E. For me, personally, it's been a game changer! My guess is you'll see a ton of URB-Es on campuses everywhere! From the time I opened the beautiful box to now - this product has exceeded my expectations ten fold!
