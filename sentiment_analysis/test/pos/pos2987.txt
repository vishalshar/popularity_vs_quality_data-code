I bought this as a regular use personal laptop. I did not buy this for gaming as I am not a gamer (not even casually). I wanted a reasonably powerful up to date laptop which I could use for at least next 3 years. So I wanted a reasonably fast processor, SSD storage of at least 300 GB and at least 8 GB RAM (though I would have liked 16). This one fitted the bill perfectly and was an unbeatable price / value combination for what I wanted.Physically the laptop is less sleek that it appears in the picture, but is quite light weight. I find carrying it in one hand quite easy for the screen size (My wife's 15" macbook pro is definitely heavier, even if it is sleeker, probably due to the metal body). This is my first experience with an SSD drive and definitely boot times are lightning fast compared to a hard drive and it is very silent. Copying files to an external drive over usb 3.0 is also amazingly fast. Performance is very good, applications launch very fast and the laptop feels fast and responsive. Keyboard is backlit (which was important to me) and the keyboard and trackpad performance is OK for me (some reviewers had complained about the keyboard and track pad and this was one of my concerns, but I found it perfectly fine.Now for the small criticisms for which I reduced one star. There is no caps lock or number lock indicator which is quite stupid in my opinion especially when you have to enter passwords. The screen is sharp, but sometimes I feel the colors are not vibrant (could be some settings, I have not spent any time investigating it). The mouse click on the track pad feels too firm compared to my HP elitebook which this one replaced. I feel the full size keyboard with the number keys is wasted as I am not using it at all mostly, especially with the issue of no indicator on the numlock. It would have been preferable to have a conventional laptop keyboard with larger keys, more comfortable placed. I also initially had an issue with Wifi connectivity, but that seems to have been resolved after I reinstalled Windows 10. Lastly, it seems that the Wifi range is less than my elitebook, but not by a significant amount. But these are minor niggles and I would buy this again if given the choice.Update : The Wifi range improved drastically after I updated my Wifi driver, so that is no longer an issue
