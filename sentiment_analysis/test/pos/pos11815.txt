My kids (5&7) love this!  It is very easy for them to figure out and they have learned so much playing with the game.  It starts out simple, and the teaches the user more advanced "coding" as it goes along.  There are cute rewards and you get bonus for the more complex your solution (number of steps before you hit "go").  I have tried other kids coding apps and games in the past and this by far is the best.
