This is an excellent screen replacement kit. The accompanying YouTube video is a must. Note: heed the guys advice when he says use caution, especially with replacing the screws in the same holes they originated in and when prying the two pieces off the board after heating with a dryer (a must.)It took me 45 minutes and my phone is good as new! Take your time........it's not a race.Highly recommended.
