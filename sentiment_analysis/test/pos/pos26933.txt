My family and I went to a Mario Battali restaurant in Boston and this was the hand soap in the restrooms. We all loved the fragrance and when we got home we had to order it. The fragrance is floral but I would say it is gender neutral.  We were happy to find it on Amazon. A bit expensive, but a half squirt will give you a nice lather. I am so fixated on the fragrance I wish they made a fragrance one could wear. Until then, I will constantly wash my hands.
