I absolutely love this set! I bought them for both camping and daily use at work and they are exactly what I was looking for! You can tell this is quality and will last a long time. The knife is perfectly capable of cutting through thick pieces of meat and even the fork is great at splitting pieces of food! The toothpick is great and the pop-top on the knife works flawlessly. All of the utensils are the perfect size and very comfortable to use. Everything is very compact and efficient~ I highly recommend this set after shopping around forever for the perfect travel utensils!
