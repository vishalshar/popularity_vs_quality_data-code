The iOttie Mount is great. It stays in it's place firmly and is quick to adjust to my phone. This mount is designed so you can keep your phone clamped in the mount, but with one quick button take the whole clamp plus phone off while leaving the base screwed on to your handle bars. I love love love this feature because I bike to and from the grocery store so being able to pop off my phone easily is really nice.I don't bike on any hard or rugged terrain, maybe the occasional curb or rocky patch; the mount does great on those. It holds the phone tight and I'm not worried at all my iPhone will come out.When I first got the iOttie Mount, it didn't quite fit my bike's handle bars correctly... But Brittany from iOttie called about a week after I got it and asked me how it was working. I told her my issue and she promptly sent me a new one! She seemed genuinely concerned that I was not really satisfied with her product and set to make it right. She even followed up to make sure I got my new iOttie Mount and that it was working for me.
