I already buy Simple Mills crackers and pancake mix which are both great! I've never reviewed a product before but had to write one for Simple Mills. My entire family loved the artisan bread. I made the loaf recipe and it was fabulous! The taste, texture and density was spot on. My picky 14 year old son ate three pieces! I just purchased 2 more boxes because our local stores don't carry it. Thank you Simple Mills for a wonderful product! Keep up the good work!
