This is amazing product! I bought it for the top of my Mason jar that i use for my homemade coffee cream. I do a lot of shaking when I make it and then also shake it up each morning before I pour it in my coffee. It didn't leak at all!The spout hasn't dripped when I'm pouring it into my coffee cup.This is well worth the money!
