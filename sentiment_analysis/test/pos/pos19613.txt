Got the Feed and Go for my kitty who wakes me up yowling every morning at 3 a.m. because his blood sugar is low. Besides losing sleep, I've learned the hard way that if kitty doesn't get fed early in the morning, he barfs. Something had to be done! Set-up was easy & there are YouTube videos for extra support. The unit seems extremely well made and durable. It has 6 compartments for kitty's wet food all tucked into a sleek & good looking design. Product has been dependable so far and I've talked with Alex (inventor of the Feed and Go) several times to work out a glitch I was experiencing on my end (customer service is EXCELLENT!)  We're super glad we invested in this product. Sure beats that yowling at 3 a.m. every morning! Thanks to Alex & Feed and Go for helping mom get much needed rest!! I would recommend this product in a heartbeat. Kitty is delighted!
