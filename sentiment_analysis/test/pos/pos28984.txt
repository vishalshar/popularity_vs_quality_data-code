Just be clarify the XR is a zoomed in model made for outdoors. While it can be used indoors you have to put at least 8 feet of distance to be able to make out a object. Now I don't have or have used the original model but from the XR it's view angle is blown up. Assuming this to help see distance objects in the backdrop which the purpose of this unit is for more outdoor use.I live in the country surrounded by crops and I have wild black hogs running loose from around and including coyotes. I specifically got this model for use of tracking wild animals and security for around the parameter of my house. I just got this today havent had a chance to test it at night.I did however tinkered with it of detecting hot and cold environments such as Car's AC, Window AC, running hot water, ceiling fan light and ceiling light. I even used it to look at my cat and saw her foot prints as she walked. Used to track heat footprints left by my hand. So it will be up close range objects just the XR is a zoomed in. I like the focus lens it helps to clear objects and focus on them.The clicking audible is noticeable but it's to be expected. It's 90F+ outside so I'm waiting for it to cool down. It does work well with USB 3.0 and on my Tablet Samsung Note Pro and Note II just fine.Overall I'm satisfied and its what I expected you cannot pass up on a $300 Cam vs a 3K cam. I especially like the heat and cold differential tracker.I will update later of how my night experiment goes when using outside.Thank you Seek Thermal and Thank you Amazon.comI attached some pictures. Please note I'm still playing with the viewing angles. I will provide better images when I master this device better.I just thought I would right a small review. I'm not expert on Thermal Imaging I'm just fascinated by it and my review is not professional but intrigued enough to share my thoughts as I'm very satisfied with what I received.EDIT*  I used it for a few nights. Spotted Deer with it easily and surprisingly it can see clouds and take temperature. Not sure how accurate it is but you can make out objects the closer they are and if they are moving. The Focusing Lens help clears the image and for the price it's really good. The White over Black [black is hot] is good to see a clearer defined image and Black over White [White for hot] is great to.
