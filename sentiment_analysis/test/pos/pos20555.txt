Bought this after watching Mythbusters. It was a fairly easy install. It had to go off to the side because of the mirror. As far as I can tell it's very secure and won't budge unless I undo it.I have included a picture of it on my visor for size informationI paid for this full price. I never get the offers for reviews.
