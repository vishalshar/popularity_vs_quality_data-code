I have the full size titanium version and love it. I thought could save a little more weight. I weighed it on my scale and it weighed 3.6 oz without the case and additional alcohol stove insert. I did some research and found they have gone to a thicker gauge titanium and so the weight is more then they are advertising, even on they're website. I'm no computer wiz but think it would be easy to change the information to reflect the new weight.
