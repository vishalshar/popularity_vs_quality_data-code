These are absolutely delicious!  I've tried the Granny Smith and the Fuji Red and both are great although if I had to pick one it would be the Fuji.  The value in the large bags is tremendous since it would cost me nearly this much to make them myself.  The problem with the large bags, though, is I can eat half a bag in a day without blinking an eye. #firstworldproblems
