There is no real faults I could find with these bars other than the high price.I purchased these for the nauseating effects I get as a side effect of a medication I have to take nightly. These bars are great for me to take in the morning on the way to work and do greatly reduce the side effects. So much so that I usually feel fine by the time my day starts.The taste is great and I hope the variety of flavors offered grows. These are much better than a great deal of the options you would find at whole foods, and combined with the amount of protein and the anti nauseating effects make them hard to beat.My hope is , as the popularity of them grows , the price will drop and they will become more available.
