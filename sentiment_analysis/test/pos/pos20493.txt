Landing gear with no use in the real world. I am a part 107 drone pilot and use a drone in the .most extreme of places. A great idea but really has no practical use. What if you are flying from tall grass? Raising the quad 3/4's of an inch is a waste of money and time. Better off to buy those large neoprene mats that lock together from harbor freight for $9 for 4 of them and they give about an 8 sqft landing and rake off area that will cover and flatten tall grass, sand, loose dirt etc.
