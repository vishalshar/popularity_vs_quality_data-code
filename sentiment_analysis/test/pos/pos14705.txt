Chocmeister dark chocolate hazelnut spread is really delicious and makes a wonderful dessert using it as a fruit dip. The texture is thick enough so it's not runny, but thin enough to drizzle on fruit or spread on waffles, toast or whatever you want. It thickens if refrigerated, and I prefer the texture at room temperature and leave mine unrefrigerated in the pantry cupboard even after opening- the company informed me this product does not need refrigeration once opened. This tastes so good that I won't hesitate to serve this as a dip to guests along with fresh apple wedges and other fruit as a dessert. I bought the dark chocolate flavor after sampling the milk chocolate version and both are delicious, though I have a slight preference for the milk chocolate. The main difference is that the dark chocolate has more cocoa than hazelnuts and doesn't contain milk (except it may have trace amounts), so I think the dark chocolate has a stronger chocolate taste while the hazelnut taste comes through more with the milk chocolate version.Chocmeister tastes sweet and rich. Cane sugar is the main ingredient (15 grams a serving), and each serving has 11 grams of fat. So it's not exactly healthfood, but at least it has no cholesterol and has some nutritional value- 6 grams of fiber and 3 grams of protein. Plus, the ingredients are simple (cane sugar, cocoa powder, hazelnuts, palm oil, chicory root extract, lecithin from sunflowers and natural vanilla flavor), and it has no icky chemicals. I tried Nutella once and thought it was yummy, but it tasted a bit overly sweet to me and has more palm oil in it than hazelnuts, plus it contains soy lecithin and artificial flavor (which aren't found in Chocmeister). Chocmeister tastes better to me and just seems like a better quality product with more hazelnuts than palm oil, less sugar, more fiber and protein and no artificial flavor. I'll definitely buy it again.My one issue with Chocmeister is that the inner lid did not arrive sealed on the container I received (and this is the second time that's happened), and there's no outer seal. Apparently, the fact that the inner seal is broken isn't an issue in terms of the lack of refrigeration as no refrigeration is needed, but in my opinion the company should improve the seal or add some kind of outer seal to the rim of the container so I can feel assured there's been no tampering with the product.Note: I've been dipping my apples in Chocmeister and flax seeds. It's a really satisfying snack or dessert. I can be a little heavy handed with the Chocmeister because it tastes so good, but I feel less guilty by adding the flax seeds :)
