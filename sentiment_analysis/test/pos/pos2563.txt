Arrived yesterday.  Unboxed, attached to garage door opener wood rafter, plugged in everything, downloaded the app, installed and configured.  Took less than 9 minutes from unboxing to testing it out.24 hours later it still works fantastically.  I left the garage open by accident today and it reminded me it had been open for 20 minutes.  One click and it was closed (and I was ten miles from home).Fantastic device and the installation was incredibly easy.
