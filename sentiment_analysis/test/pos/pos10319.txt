I bought it for my girlfriend as an anniversary present. I wanted to go with jewelry, but thats something that I do every year so I decided to go for jewelry with a twist of technology and she seems satisfied so far! At least I havent heard any complaints.Upsides: I do hear compliments about the breathing part of the app as I have tried them too and seems they are onto something with the whole brain wellness part. thumbs up!Activity tracking seems accurate enough, at least compared to my fitbit.Sleep is basically no movement during assumed night hours while during sleep no movement is recognized as calm and moving around as disturbed.Period tracking I know nothing of.Downsides: I would love if the leaf worked with other fitness apps so we could track our activity together and if it could show data collected from the device elsewhere. Also tends to buzz at random times (inactivity when active).
