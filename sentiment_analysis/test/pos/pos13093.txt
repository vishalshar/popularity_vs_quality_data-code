Really does have a dummy mid- range speaker. I had to take a star because of the fake midrange.NO WIRES to Midrange speaker (I checked by removing those screws.) The speakers do sound nice.You can add a sub-woofer to ANY stereo if you get a sub that has Amplifier in Or Speaker inputs or High power inputsrather than line inputs. Although the bass is decent, a subwoofer will make any system sound better.The FM reception is better than my vintage 600 watt Pioneer sx-316.The back of the unit has only two outputs ortwo blacks and two reds for a total of two speakers and nothing else.That being said I bought this for the mini-marantz styling and low price.The balance knob dispays where the radio frequency displays for exact dialing in to center or yourpreference  or monitor the VU meters. I love the front input for my xm radio/ipod.Most new stereos don't have a 1/8 front input AUX. jack. Another reason I chose this model.I got the inexpensive extended 2 year warranty. I recommend you buy the warranty.The sound is crystal clear on fm with really decent bass from the speakers. There is no sub output.The reception is good. The wires are short..but wire is cheap to buy.Bluetooth works fine when paired with my computer.This would improve TV sound greatly but I use a 600 watt Pioneer home theater for TV.This is a good second stereo, not home theater quality.I love this style and sound. manual states power is 25 + 25 watts per channel output.This sounds great for music or xm/ipod radio.I used gold and silver sharpie on the remote to identify the volume buttons on the remoteas they take a little getting used to.. The remote has a power button and all others needed.Haven't found mute but power button works fine.The VU meters don't move much at my listening level about 12 out of 30 max.They start jumping good over 20 volume.The No name Speakers sound really good and have no ugly branding labels.They just are small plain black boxes that fade into a bookshelf or mantle nicely.lost a star for the fake mid-range.If you like this style then buy it!You will probably never see it again.Most of the old Marantz had no cd, no remote, no bluetooth and no digital tuning.
