Worked perfectly right out of the box, and it always flawlessly, automatically starts the software when I plug it into the phone (LG G3) or tablet (Asus Nexus 7).  I was taking thermal pictures with it within a minute of opening the box.I have taken many pictures and videos since then, in many locations, with no problems whatsoever -- electronic circuits, crowds of people, cars, cats, electronic units, heating vents, steam engines, diesel engines, airplanes.  The images look great, differentiating whatever temperature gradients that are present in the scene, and conversely, showing that a given surface is fairly uniform in temperature when that is expected.  The video mode works great is is very useful - a real bonus, and an independent way to pan over a large scene.  TheAmong the various color palettes and modes of operation, there is a mode that indicates the temperature at the center point of the image.  The temperature reading is repeatable and gives a great indication of differential temperatures.  I think it is probably a few degrees off in some cases, but I think that is to be expected, when the reading is based on a dynamic gain control that adapts to the optimal temperature average and gradient in the image.In the first week I had the Seek Thermal camera, I was showing it to other engineers in the lab and we were running around taking pictures of things.  Somewhere in the process I lost the rugged plastic case that the camera comes with.  I contacted the Seek website about buying a new case, and they quickly sent me a new case for free.  Excellent customer service.
