I don't usually write reviews, however I used this mask today and my face feels amazing. Seriously, very soft, hydrated but not oily. Supple!  I have had $100 facials that didn't leave my skin feeling this good!  Highly recommend this mask. I bought it because I am traveling a lot and my skin is super dry because of the altitude and cold weather!  Love it!
