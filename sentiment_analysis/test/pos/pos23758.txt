This is a day one review and includes my initial impressions and a potential fix if you're having charging issues.Appearance:Immediate impressions is that it is indeed thinner than any other battery case I've seen. However, it does give the appearance of being thicker than it is since the edges and back aren't really rounded except for the corners, sort of like the iPhone 5 shape.The attractiveness of the glossy finish of the white version is going to be a matter of personal taste. Personally, I think it looks a bit toyish and I am considering altering the appearance to make it matte. Again, you might love the way it looks.I really like how they integrated the charger controls into the volume button. It works very well and looks a lot better than having additional dedicated buttons and LEDs.Fit:Fit was perfect on an iPhone 6S. The top locked securely and was actually a pain to remove. This actually inspired confidence that it would not break or fly off like I've seen in other reviews here. They apparently have read those reviews and have started including an extra top piece for free in the packaging. The headphone hole is small. Basically it was made with Earpods and headsets with similarly sized 3.5 mm plugs. My guess is that there isn't anything important around the hole and I may make it a tiny bit wider to accommodate my aux cables and Bose headset.Weight:Seriously, it doesn't feel like a battery case. I'd describe it as having the weight of a heavy duty case like an Otterbox.Charging:Initially it would not charge but it was obviously doing something. My battery was 66% when I put on the case. Twenty minutes later it was still 66%. This is without using it. I then tried the pass-through charging for thirty minutes, some using and some idle, and it was still on 66%. It did this while showing the charging icon. So, it was apparently getting enough power to maintain but not enough to charge. The case states to go to a website and upgrade the firmware for the phone if you have charging issues. Don't do that. They actually state in their FAQ's that it is a misprint. What finally fixed it was taking the phone out and reseating it in addition to resetting my phone by holding the home and power buttons.After doing that, it charges with both the case and pass-through. Charging isn't super fast but it doesn't need to be. Your phone will not go dead and will get a full charge. One thing annoying about it is that it will not charge with my Apple certified 3 amp rapid charger. As in not at all. Neither the battery or phone will charge with the rapid charger while the phone is in this case.Protection:This is another area where they have seen the reviews and have made appropriate changes. On the unit I purchased there is a small lip around the screen that will help protect the glass. It also was able to accommodate my Peel glass screen protector. This is the tempered glass one that goes from edge to edge and curves at the edges. Meaning that if it fits over this screen protector, you're going to able to use almost any other one with the case. The plastic feels sturdy. I'm not going to drop my $60 case on some concrete or anything so I can write a better review, but I'm confident it will protect the phone. Again, it took some oomph to separate the top from the rest of the case when I wanted to. Either I got lucky with the fit or this is something else the company has received feedback on and addressed.SummaryFirst impressions after a little over 24 hours are good. There are faster charging cases out there. There are cases with more mAh to charge your phone more times on a single charge out there. What this gives you is a battery case that above all else will charge your phone while being lightweight, thin, and better looking than most batter cases.To me, this is a five star product that loses a star for not working out of the box and the fact that most aftermarket headsets will not fit it. Not being able to use my rapid charger wasn't factored into the star rating since that won't impact most people, but I thought it was worth mentioning.I'll update this as warranted.
