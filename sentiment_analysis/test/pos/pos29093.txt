Purchased this to use on the top dash of my Kia Soul, I was worried after reading some reviews about it messing up the dash but since my vehicle has a plastic surface in the middle that wouldn't be an issue for me. I can't comment about how it'd work on a leather-type surface, but if you have a plastic surface to stick it on, it works great. Doesn't move at all, has good extension and swivel features, and every device fits fine.
