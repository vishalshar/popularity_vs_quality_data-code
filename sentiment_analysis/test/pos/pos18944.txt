Conceptually a great idea.  I had this on my key ring about three month and the lightening end snapped off.  I work from home, drive rarely, IE, my keys get less "play"/wear than most peoples'.  This item is now useless to me.9/9/15 Upgrading rating to 3 stars as the vendor very graciously sent me a replacement when I notified them of the break.  It's been on my key ring a few months now, I use it often, and it hasn't broken again.
