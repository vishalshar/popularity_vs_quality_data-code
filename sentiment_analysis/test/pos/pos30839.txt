Other utensil sets have a hole at the ends for tying together with paracord or a carabiner and dangle loose which isn't a good way to keep them clean. This set keeps your utensils covered and clean and organized. These are full sized utensils that snap-in snugly and compact in their case. Sure you can pay less for an open set of loose utensils, but I prefer to pay more for a better design.
