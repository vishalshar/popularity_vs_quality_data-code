This is a great mushroom kit. I got it for my dorm room at culinary school as a fun little experiment to watch the mushroom growth process as a research project. I got two harvests. I left the block with a friend as I had to go on an internship. She sent me a Snapchat almost 3 weeks later and she was harvesting yet another group of mushrooms. Amazing product period.
