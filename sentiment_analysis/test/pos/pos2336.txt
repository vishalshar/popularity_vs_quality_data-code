I was skeptical about this when I bought but I just received it and can't put it down! I love it!!! It was super easy to use and light as a feather. It will be most helpful on my vacation. It was so easy to use i didn't need to read the directions, just switched it on, then on apple mode and it was ready to go! Don't forget to tun on bluetooth on your device.
