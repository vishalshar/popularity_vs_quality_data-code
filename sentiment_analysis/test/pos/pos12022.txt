I absolutely love the Pavlok!!!I have been struggling to stop drinking soda's  for years (terrible addiction) and in 5 days I stopped drinking soda's and 5 weeks later I am still soda free.  I started by opening a soda and shocking myself when I heard that great fizz sound that I love.  Then shocked myself with each sip (got through 3 sips before I tossed it).  The next day I put an unopened can of soda on my desk and every time I reached for it (out of habit) or thought that I wanted a soda (to go with popcorn or some other snack) I would shock myself.  Shocked myself A LOT the first few days!  Same routine day 3 (far fewer shocks).  Day 4, less shocks, Day 5, hardly any shocks.  I still shock myself if I think about having soda or if I hear someone crack one and I think "I want one", but that rare.  I haven't drank a soda in 5 weeks, and I don't even have a desire when I hear someone open one, or at a restaurant!!!I also used Pavlok in the same fashion to break my "fast food for lunch and breakfast" habit.  Gone are the days of drinking and eating all those extra calories.  It doesn't hurt that bad, but enough to make you not want do have to shock yourself more than 3-4 times in a row (and putting the shocker on the inside of the wrist hurts significantly MORE).Worth the money - I just have to come up with my next bad habit... think eating at my desk would be a good start.  GOOD LUCK EVERYONE!
