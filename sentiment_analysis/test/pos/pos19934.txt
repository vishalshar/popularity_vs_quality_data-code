Works well, probably a little pricey for the volume.  The speaker itself is really small.  You will get much better volume by plugging your device directly into the speaker instead of using the bluetooth connection, but this is true of almost every speaker.  I'm mostly satisfied, in retrospect, I may have been happier if I had spent an extra $100-150 and gotten a more powerful speaker, though.
