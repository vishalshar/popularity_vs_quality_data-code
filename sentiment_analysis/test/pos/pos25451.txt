yaaay so glad someone invented this. I love when ppl invent things that I wanted yesterday. I drink mulberry tea (from amazon) reduces blood sugar. this is perfect container for my tea and other food products. I drink with tss clear glass pyrex drink straws from amazon. this works better than pour spout cuz pour spout makes mason jar too tall for refrigerator shelf. too bad...otherwise id use the pour spout for my tea. thank you person who invented this product. I absolutely love it. mason jars are practical (can see whats in it) and safe (not plastic)  I couldn't be more pleased. also...comes with removable rubber seal.  :)....one week later....I just discovered helpful tip:  the rubber o ring is difficult to remove to wash.  I use dental instrument to remove rubber washer.  its on amazon: dental tartar plaque remover kit comes with scraper dental mirror other things and an instrument with a small paddle on the end to remove rubber o ring from mason jar lid.:)
