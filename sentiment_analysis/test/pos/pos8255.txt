*Updated 8.11.16* - I spoke with customer service and they explained that some sellers are still working through older inventory. They thought it was all sold through after test orders. They graciously offered to rush us a new bottle with the new formula that has Folate instead of Folic Acid. I am very happy with the service and my son loves the gummies! 4/5 stars. A little bit of a hassle but understandable and Smarty Pants made my order right. I will order more in the future.I was really happy I found these but was sadly disappointed that this really has Folic Acid instead of Folate (as advertised)Folate instead of Folic Acid was a big selling point for me since not everyone has the ability to metabolize Folic Acid.Ordered 7.27.16 Pics attached. Will be returning.
