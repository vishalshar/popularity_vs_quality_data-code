I was going through all kinds of special foods, clean food, wet, dry, home made, for my young boy whose system went totally out of whack after a vaccine. For five months I was adding betonite, grain free, enzymes, pro and prebiotics, no beef, only wild game, and just could not get him to have a normal poop. He would have powerful poops wherever he happened to be, cramps, and not able to get to the litter box.  Always mud puddles. Not watery diarrhea. I could hear his tummy grumble when he'd sit next to me. Then I saw this food again at a holistic vet's office. I had used this food a few kitties ago and forgotten about it. I didn't want to go dry being he is a boy but with the cranberries, I thought I would give it a try. The change is remarkable. No more accidents, he is a happier guy, poop is firm, he is much more active. Both he and our new little girl love it.
