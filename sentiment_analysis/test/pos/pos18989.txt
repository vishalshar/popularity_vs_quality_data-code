It is tough to choose this kind of a product due to the wide range in prices and similar functions available out there. I settled on this as my final choice after trying out couple of other types of Bluetooth receivers for my setup. I did cringe at the price tag, after all it is Bluetooth! but the proof was in the sound. The setup I have is a simple 2-channel music system. I have painstakingly crafted this setup for the holy grail of warm analog sound (in other words a wannabe audiophile). I have CD/Bluray, Vinyl and now Bluetooth as the sound source for my music. The reason I mention this is to give you a reference on where and how I made the distinction before settling on this model. My setup does reveal clear details in the source and therefore clarity as well as any weakness in it. For that reason, Bluetooth was a challenge for me so far as I found most receivers lacking in dimension, punch and just basic listening pleasure. I consider my setup low-end hifi and I have not spent huge amount of money behind it. How does this unit compare to others? The soundstage is immediately wider with this unit. The other units I tested came close in clarity/loudness of the music but the soundstage was still compressed and in the center. This unit opened up the soundstage and made it sound more like I was listening to a CD. I do have an APTx capable phone which I have paired with it and according to specs it is making a difference. I could not tell any difference when I paired with a non-APTx laptop. But in doing A/B listening tests between this unit and the other Bluetooth units, I heard a clear difference in soundstage which settled it for me. I have not noticed any drops or pairing issues with it so far in couple of weeks of use. The packaging and quality of the unit itself is outstanding but at the pricepoint one would expect that but it is nice that it is present. Looks are secondary to sound quality for me but this unit does blend in nicely in my setup. I recommend this unit for the right setup as I do feel that in a casual listening setup I doubt that any difference will be heard between this and other Bluetooth units. The best advice is still trust your ears and go with what sounds good to you.Hope this helps.
