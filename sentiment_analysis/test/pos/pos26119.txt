The camera works really well, except... there are issues with facial recognition.It does not log the new people that came into the house as "unidentified" (they are completely ignored) but records all the people on TV as "unidentified". Even the ones on my computer screen get noticed by the machine. And you can't disable facial recognition when annoyed by all that.I think it would be great if Welcome allows us to specify an area or areas within the view that facial recognition function should ignore.
