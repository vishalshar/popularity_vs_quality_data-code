These are the perfect earbud adapters. I've tried all of the in-ear plunger types without success and with lots of ear fatigue. The hook design is the only one that will work. They stay comfortable and in place during intense workouts or all day at my desk job. I almost want to buy more earpods just to have more Earhoox. I love them!
