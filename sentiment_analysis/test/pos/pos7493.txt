This is a fantastic jacket! I bought it for my 15 year old son, who bikes all over Washington DC and he loves it! Considering how hard it is to please a teen, this was a huge success!  He has shown this jacket to all his friends, and very proud of it! Now all 5 of us in the family want one! We love it!
