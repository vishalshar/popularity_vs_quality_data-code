I bought this for my daughter, who purchased HTC One M9. I have UAG for my M8. I am very happy with it.  It is why I got her one.  However, I was not happy that the M9 is the same design as the M8: the M9 has the power button on the side, not on the top like the M8.  There is an unnecessary space on the top of the M9.
