gLink turn your smart phone to garage door remoteI've got nothing but praise for this Smartphone Garage Door Opener. It's very inexpensive, incredibly simple to install* and just works. A very nice bonus is that it does NOT require batteries!* I had to add this in... had some complete jackass not wired my Chamberlain opener in the first place, this would have been exactly as described in the instructions. What I found was... hmmm... there were blue, white, and orange wires from both sensors and the wall mounted switch, all run together. Suffice to say, it was kind of a mess... I just pulled everything off, cut all the wires back, figured out what wires went to which component, and wired them up very simply as they're designed. Once I was sure it worked the way Chamberlain designed their equipment, I hooked up the two wires of the gLink, and it worked perfectly.
