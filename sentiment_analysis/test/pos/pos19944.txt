I bought this for my 18-month-old for Christmas and he LOVES it. He plays with it all the time. The magnet board/book is sturdy and the magnets are high quality. We haven't had any issue with the board bending or warping or with the prints peeling from the magnet backing, and it has seen some extensive use as well as travel. The variety of animals makes playing with the board extremely fun. It's great for on-the-go or for playing with at the house (just keep track of where the magnets get placed). We use it a lot as a quiet book in church and the other kids around my son always want to play with it, too.My one complaint is that at the top of the board, there's a punch out that goes through both the front and back covers (like the kind manufacturers use so a store can hang the product from a hook or rack). so, when the book is opened, there are two holes on each side, interrupting the scene. It is also another spot for the print and the magnet backing to potentially peel away from each other.  I would have not punched a hole in the product.
