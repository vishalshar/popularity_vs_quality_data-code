This product is great and works exactly as described with one possibly major flaw. There is nothing keeping ants (or other bugs) from discovering the treats. I found this out the hard way when I followed a trail of ants to it to discovers hundreds more inside. So sadly, no more Petzi in our house! It was great while it lasted though.
