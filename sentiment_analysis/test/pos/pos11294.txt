Just received my new BP monitor. The device works as advertised. No time for a long evealuation yet as only used an hour or so.The unit operates much as the site describes. The free account at BlipCare is the only method you can view the BP results except the short time the device keeps the current reading on the screen. Once it times out you must have a wireless connection to the web site to view the readings. The device can store up to 1,000 readings and then send to the web portal for viewing. I can find no other method to see the readings.I wish the device had its own APP for a PC so I could send the results directly to my home PC rather than rely on their server.Getting the WIFI AP device connect is not meant for amateurs if it does ot connect on the first tryI will try to post another review in a month or two when I have used the device more.The FAQ says you can download to another software but I do not read this any where in the user guides
