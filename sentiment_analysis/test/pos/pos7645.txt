The phone looks nice. I bought it for my son. It looks almost like an iphone. The reason i bought it because it has new LTE 700Mhz band for Tmobile. I tested out on the road and Youtube works really good without buffering. For $70.00 phone, I dont think you can ask for more. However, home botton doesnt light up. The battery power is about average. I had to return mine because ear phone jack wasn't working. Other than that this phone is good.
