Overall, the Misfit Shine 2 is far better than the original. The new band is a much better fit than the original and it only fell off a couple times when it got snagged on a bag or something which is to be expected. The text and call notifications are excellent and the larger design is great on the wrist. Very happy with the purchase. If you are wearing the band super tight on your wrist I could see the band easily popping off, but at a comfortable fit I really never had to worry about it. Great to run or swim in and the Misfit App is seamless on the iPhone.
