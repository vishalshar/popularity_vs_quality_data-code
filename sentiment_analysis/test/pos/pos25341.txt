Fantastic Kit. This includes two OPD-6WCL dimmers which can be used independently or together from what I understand to go between single pole and multi pole. The hub is tiny and cool looking and worked just fine. Paired everything up and install and pairing complete in 15 minutes. Used these with the FEIT BR30 4 pack bulbs from Costco (thank you cheap rebate) and now I am all LED dimmable. This replaced my prior Lutron Maestro remote dimmers which predated the LED bulbs. Highly recommended. I just ordered two more dimmers to convert my entire house to LED. I replaced around 40 recessed halogens so this should start saving me some money.
