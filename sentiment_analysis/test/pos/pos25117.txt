I really need to order more of these Pickle Pipes!  Three is most definitely not enough; once you see how well they work and how easy they are to use and clean, all of those other methods fall by the wayside!  I did some research into the types of airlocks that have lots of pieces to lose and wash, and even just a lid with the moat for water, and these Pickle Pipes are the greatest things since sliced bread!  Mine have been in use constantly since I purchased them a couple of months ago.
