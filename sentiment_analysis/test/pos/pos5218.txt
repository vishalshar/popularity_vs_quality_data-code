I like the phone a lot.  I don't like the regular sized phones because they are weighty and hang heavy in my pocket.  This little phone is very unobtrusive and fits in my pocket with room to spare.  I can hardly feel it and even forget it's there.  It's a full function smart phone.  Everything a big phone has this little phone has too.  The only thing I have an issue with is the size of the keyboard for typing.  Too small for even the smallest fingers.  You need one of those sticks (forget what you call them) that you can poke at your smart phone with to write.  I use the speech to text option, which works good enough most of the time, but sometimes you need to use the keyboard.  The number pad for phone calls is a very handy size and I have no issues at all with that.  Phone calls are clear and there's no static ever.  Very good there.  I give it a 4 star rating because I have to charge it every night or it's dead by morning.  I'm use to have an flip-phone that I could leave on for a week without charging, so the new smart phone could use some help in that area.  The main thing about this phone is the size, if you don't want a large heavy lump in your pocket get this phone.
