Used this on my recent trip to Portugal and Spain and it worked fantastically! We lost our luggage between Barcelona and Lisbon. We kind of expected this as we were flying a different airline for the last leg between Barcelona and Lisbon. It was nice being able to tell the Lost Luggage people what city our luggage was in. It was also nice being able to check if our bag made it onto the next flight into Lisbon or not, which it didn't. Our luggage got on first flight out the next morning and I could tell when it made it into Lisbon. Just know, though, that you either need international data or wifi in order to use the app in another country to check the location of your luggage. Overall, I'm glad I bought it! It came with one month of free traces. After that, you purchase traces by the month, 6 months, or a year. I travel infrequently and usually just carry-on, so I anticipate just purchasing a month of traces when I know I'll be traveling and checking luggage. $4.99 for 30 days, $19.99 for 6 months, and $29.99 for 1 year.
