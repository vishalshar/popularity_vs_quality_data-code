This is an excellent product. 3 quick points...1. As for taste, I was bracing for an almost offensive taste based on some reviews. Turns out this product tastes great. If you are a coffee drinker, enjoy black coffee, you'll dig these. 2. They work! And fast!! What a hoot. And I say this as a big coffee drinker. 3. The packaging does not make it clear which cube is which flavor. Not a big deal, but it would be cool if they could make it clear (each package contains 4 cubes, of which there are 3 flavors). Finally, if you want to have some fun, try this hack: I made an espresso and put a Go Cube in it. I let it soak for a few minutes and then drank the espresso and ate the Go Cube. If all goes well I should be visible in low earth orbit shortly....
