I work with children with autism and other developmental disabilities and am always looking for products that might engage a child's attention and stimulate spontaneous activity. The Robosapien is nicely constructed and low priced. The actions are predictable enough so as not to frighten most children but the occasional random activity will engage their curiosity. I find the Bluetooth app a much easier way for children to operate the robot as opposed to the remote.I've also used several other WowWee products including the RoboRaptor and a Panda with the kids. I might add that the Chip dog robot was a big hit the other day.
