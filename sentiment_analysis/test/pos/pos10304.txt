Got to use these for the first time last weekend in very chilly (48-51 degrees) water. Made putting on my wet, cold wetsuit on the second day of surfing MUCH easier. And removing my booties with my frozen hands was also much easier than it used to be. I didn't have any issues slipping around in my booties. I got the split-toe Wetsox, and I have split-toe booties as well, so that probably helped. I found the fit nice and snug. I have pretty normal (not wide or narrow) feet. I wear a size 10 shoe typically, and I got the medium size. I thought the fit was perfect.
