Wow. Love this speaker. Great addition to our art studio where we listen to a lot of music. A snap to setup. Nice simple controls on the unit itself. Great sound (full tones with good bass for such a small unit). We had a rugged rukus we were using but the sound on that doesn't compare. I like the pause right on the surface. Just starting to explore the libertone app too and it seems really nicely featured. I didn't even know when I bought this it had it's own radio features with tons of international channels to listen to. It's pretty too, subtle aesthetic. I also wasn't really clued into the fact that you can group a set of these speakers from within the app to create zones. Makes me think about getting a couple more for around the house.
