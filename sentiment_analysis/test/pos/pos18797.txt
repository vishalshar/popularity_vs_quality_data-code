My dog loves this device, although she prefers that we put the ball in for her.  She was scared of it the first week, but eventually her fear subsided and now she loves it and I love not throwing that ball!  The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because of the balls.  As the fabric on the balls start to fray it will hang up in the device.  It seems I have to constantly cut the fabric off around the ball for it to work right.  I bought some cat balls that are rubber and they work great unless there is a lot of slobber on them, then they will hang up too.  I wish they would come out with some balls for dogs that do not have the tennis ball fabric on them.
