Overall, I like the features this tape provides, however I've had it 5 days and 1 of the 2 rivets holding the end on the tape has already come off. Doesn't make me think this is going to have a lot of longevity.Update: I'm updating this to 5 stars due to the great customer support the company provides. I told them about the rivet, and they fed ex expressed me  a whole new replacement and I got it the very next day of my email. It is a very nice measuring tape with great features.
