I've purchased 5 of these in total now, I have had them for 3 months without a single problem. They work great as color changing lights. The colors are really bright. Sometimes the app would be a little slow to respond, but the firmware update today fixed any sluggishness that the app had and now they are super responsive. They also now have ifttt support. I'll be honest that I don't really see the point in using ifttt but maybe I'll think of something at some point. All in all I'm happy with my purchase.
