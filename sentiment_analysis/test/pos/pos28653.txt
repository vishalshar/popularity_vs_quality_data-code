So far, I am loving the results. I'm finding it hard to sit still and meditate as long as is needed to get the results I want, but my Rosacea is disappearing! I was on two medicines (expensive) and they were only mildly controlling the breakouts. I would still flush bright red. I balked at first at the high price, but I am glad now I got this! I'm not smearing my face with chemicals with limited results anymore! Thank you!
