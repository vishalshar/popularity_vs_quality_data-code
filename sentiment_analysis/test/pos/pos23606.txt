Met all my expectations, I really enjoy this 3-D printer as a hobby. The Quality is really good, and its really reliable but most of all i love how quiet it is for a desktop printer. the only thing i wish it included was a filter for the filament so the head doesn't need to be cleaned as often. other then that really enjoyed this printer.
