So far I have 3 of these, and I love/dislike them for various reasons. I've had these products for about 3 months.Color: Kind of don't care for the color (red), I would have preferred a vibrant red, but instead what came is a sickly tomato. Since I dislike tomato stains on a turquoise or white cover more, I'm still sticking with red. (hasn't happened yet, but just in case).6" round: love it. Not particularly floppy due to diameter. Use it to cover cereal bowls, small 1qt saucepans, mugs. Good for cooking on top of the stove (lid handle hasn't gotten hot in my experience), room temperature for food prep, or for covering small bowls in the refrigerator.10" round: Like it, would be better if not so floppy. Hard to find a good place to store in the kitchen. Best use found so far is to replace plastic wrap for cold storage of serving bowls.9x13" downright dangerous when hot or used in the oven. Smells like chemicals when used in the oven, even on the 2nd use. Very floppy, even when room temperature. Want my money back if I could.See video comparing lid sizes. Order of appearance: 9x13" monster, 10" round, 6" round
