Very cool drone.  It is the smallest drone I've ever seen, it fits right in the palm of my hand.  It does take a little practice to navigate, but it handled pretty well. We had some connectivity issues, but I think most of our problems may have stemmed from the fact the we both have Iphone 6 plus, and our phones are too big for the drone's controller.  We could still steer using just the phone, but we had to remain close to the controller otherwise the drone would lose the connection. I've included two photos, one of the drone on the left taken with my phone and the photo on the right of our dog taken with the drone's camera. The only other comment I have is that the drone doesn't run very long, it needs to charge after a few minutes of flying.  Other than that, it is pretty cool, we all enjoyed making videos from it and watched it hover around the room.
