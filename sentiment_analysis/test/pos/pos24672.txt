If you are a fan of Movie Theater popcorn (please spare me the preachy criticism) you'll love this stuff.  Those "Movie Theater Style" microwave popcorns never live up to their taste claims.  Pop up a bag of plain, put in a large bowl, ad three tablespoons of this liquid gold, and give your taste buds the true movie theater experience.
