LOVE these! Great to shove in the diaper bag for traveling since so many restaurants don't have kids cups or their covers come off easily. If the cover and cup/glass are dry, these stay on tight. They will leak a little if you shake it or drop it, but hold most liquid in. It came with 3 covers and only one straw but I just use regular straws and recycle when I'm done. Wish I'd known about these 3 years ago!!
