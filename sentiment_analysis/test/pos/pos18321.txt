This thing is worth its weight in gold. I've tried a myriad of things to stop my cat's constant itching. It got so bad he started ripping out patches of hair and was unable to sleep. Numerous visits to the vet, etc. nothing worked until this. And in addition to being allergic to almost everything he is also very  sensitive to medicines. This he can eat with no side effects and the results are fabulous. Highly recommended. I just bought the Immunity version so I can alternate between the two. He's not completely itch free but he's 100% better than before I used it.
