The new design with Black-Brown is not bad, I like it too. Logo Moon is digital displayed not regular writing, it appears when the unit turns on. After using, I think it is one of the best video headsets in the market with today technology level. It's cord to be located just under ear cup easy to fold when you lie down and easy broken for a while and it is very difficult to fix for the set cost like that. It's better if it is designed one USB-C port in a different location on ear cup to be able replace the connection cord easy.I recommend it for my friends.
