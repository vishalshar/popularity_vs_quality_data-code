This has worked great on my mountain bike.  Fast rough down hill, a couple crashes so far and it has been rock solid.  Stuck it to the back of my phone case and there's no way it's coming off.  Be sure you take your time lining up the mount as it is not adjustable once it touches the surface.  Mounting it to the bike is secure with the twist lock.  Seems a bit pricy, but when you're phone is probably more than 10 times the cost, why go cheap.
