I like coconut, and I LOVE chocolate.  This snack combines the best of both worlds.  The coconut is shaved into flakes, and these are packed well enough that there are very few crumbles in each bag.  When I first put one of these delectabl  e flakes on the tip of my tongue, it teased me with the rich and creamy chocolate flavor.  Just the right amount of sweet; not too much, not too little.  Then I bit into the flake.  Oh my gosh!  The perfect crunch.  I don't know how Bare made something crunch so perfectly, yet taste so rich and creamy.  Whether magic or pixie dust, they discovered the secret for making the perfect snack.  Oh, did I mention that this is healthy too?  Just three ingredients, and I know what they all are: Coconut, coconut nectar, unsweetened chocolate.  Each serving has 9 grams sugar (probably from the coconut nectar) and 4 grams fiber.  Each bag has 1.4 servings, and (if you can hold yourself to just one serving) the bag has a zip closure to keep that .4 serving fresh for your next snack.  Me?  I eat the extra 0.4 serving for the extra 2g fiber.  Yeah, that's my story, and I'm sticking to it until the day I die.  ;-)
