I received a sample of the indigo chicken one. I did some research and really wanted to try this one out as my cat is a little plump and I love her dearly so I want to make sure she can live a long happy life. It's been a week or two on this cat food and omg her coat is sooooo soft and shiny! I've been giving her the solid gold chicken and coconut milk wet food(which she loves!! And turns her nose up to the store brand wet food we had!) I can't say anything about her weight yet, but for now it's at a great start with this product!
