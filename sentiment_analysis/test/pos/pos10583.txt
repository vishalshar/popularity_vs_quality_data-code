When I ordered my RIF6 cube I thought it was going to be a great device for lazy days when I wanted to watch Netflix or movies in bed. I was right. I didn't however realize all of the other possibilities. This device has been great! I also ordered the additional speaker. The possibilities have been endless. As far as the main function and my reasoning for wanting the cube as a projector for tv shows and movies, it far exceeds my expectations! The sound is great and the picture quality is pristine! The tripod is awesome because I can hook it on my headboard and watch movies on the wall or ceiling in my room. Another fantastic benefit is that I've been able to use it at meetings for extracurricular activities when I want to shars spreadsheets or documents quickly from my computer to the whole group without ever worrying about needing to find a large, obnoxious projector or screen. The remote is great for using in meetings as well, or for pausing movies. The remote is sleek and lightweight which I really like. This device charges quickly and keeps a good charge, which is another benefit I really like. One of the best parts of this is that it is so user friendly and easy to set up. Also, I absolutely love the additional speaker I purchase with it! I always have music playing in my apartment so I set up the speaker to listen to music easily in the kitchen while I'm cooking. I really like that it is so portable so I can take it with me anywhere and hook it up to my phone. Also, the speaker provides even better sound it I use it with the cube projector as well when watching movies or tv. Overall, the cube and its accessories are well worth the money. Now that I have it and have been using it, it has proven to be an even better tool than I could have imagined! I can't remember what I did without it anymore.
