See my full review of the Rachio Gen 2 controller for more detail on the overall system.  The enclosure is a breeze to install, although there are additional parts needed if you want to have a pigtail power cord coming out of the enclosure.  The online instructions and reviews give those details.  The extra parts should cost less than $10, but are darn well worth it.I love this entire system, and you will too.
