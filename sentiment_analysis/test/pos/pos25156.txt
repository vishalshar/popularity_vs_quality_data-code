Absolutely amazing!  When used in conjunction with the GoPro remote it functions perfectly as a compact grip.  The only thing I would change about it would be to mill out a little more space in the grip to fit two batteries instead of one (the grip only fits one battery rather snugly inside the grip).  Otherwise, amazing grip.
