I purchased this supplement, the Immunity supplement by the same company and Dr. Harvey's Emune-Boost Herbal Supplement for Dogs and began to administer them to my husky that has a skin auto-immune disease requiring prednisone to control.  The prednisone was not working as well and I wanted to see if any of these supplements could help so I wouldn't have to increase the dose of steriods to keep his skin from crusting.  I give a dose of either the Skin-Coat or the Immunity with Dr. Harvey's every morning along with powdered zinc, and prednisone.  It has been about a month and I do believe I am seeing a difference, although it is hard to say if it is the supplements, a seasonal change or a biological change in my dogs.  Nevertheless, I am happy to see his skin healing and that I have been able to reduce his prednisone dose slightly.  As other reviewers have stated, my dog does not mind the taste.
