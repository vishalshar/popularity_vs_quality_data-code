Ordered the starter kit from Amazon. The kit was not eligible for two day shipping, even with Prime.It was my first time setting up a security system, so I can't compare the experience to others, but it went smoothly. Depending on the type of trim  around your door, it's possible you will have to improvise a bit to get the sensor and the magnet of the door contact sensor to be close enough (1" is the maximum separation). While the instructions on the app were adequate for setting it up, I found it useful to read through the support articles on available on Abode's website.I wish the icons on the remote key fob were more intuitive as to which button corresponds to which action.I will update my review after using this system for a longer time.
