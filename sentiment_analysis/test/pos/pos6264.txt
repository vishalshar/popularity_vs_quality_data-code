The technology behind this gadget is incredible. It hooked up without an issue and I was waving my finger at my TV in no time. It took a few days to learn how to navigate through all my devices. What fun. I did, however, return it; not because I didn't like, because the other half preferred the remote. He has our remote down so that he can navigate it without looking. I ended up being the only one to use the Single Cue. I loved it.
