This is a nice but small-ish wallet.  I really like it but had to trim my cards/etc a lot.  I do miss having a good place for bills.  I've ended up folding them in 1/2 and putting them in the left inner pocket with CCWs and drivers lic on the outside left and cards etc on the right inner and outer.  The instructions tell you to keep the cards in the outer pockets to 4 or less
