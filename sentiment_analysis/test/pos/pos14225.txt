This is a FANTASTIC little counter, for a number of reasons. The foremost, though, is that it has a professional-quality sensor. I've been monitoring radiation for a couple of decades now, the first 7-8 years as part of my job with industrial grade kit, but after that with lesser kit such as the Gamma Scout because the cost of professional-grade kit was just too high.I was a backer of the first Safecast product on Kickstarter - this has since become commercialized as the Medcom Onyx, and it's a fine instrument.The bGeigie, however, leaves the Onyx in the dust. It share the same sensor and basic circuitry, but the crucial difference in the bGeigie (the b stands for "bento", BTW) is the GPS. After the Fukushima disaster it became pretty much impossible to acquire decent meters, and so Safecast came up with the idea of adding a GPS to a Geiger and the bGeigie was born. The GPS allows sampling to be done dynamically by hanging it out your car window and driving around. The data files that result can be uploaded to Safecast where a mashup creates details and accurate radiation maps. This is citizen engagement at its best.Now to the kit - I've been designing and building analog electronic kit (mainly audio) for about four decades now, and so I class myself as a ninja-class wielder of a soldering iron for through-hole constructions. However, I have two of these, and I let my 14-year-old niece build the second one. It took her about 60 minutes of practice soldering on scrap kit and trivial pieces before I was happy to hand her the kit and let her build it. It took her around five hours from start to finish (mine took me just under three) and I was really proud that hers was almost as clean and neat as mine. Seriously, this can be built by a careful novice with less than an hour's experience behind the iron. Of course, using cheap tools does increase the risk of ruining it but I would personally feel happy building it successfully with a crappy iron.TL;DR - this is a GREAT kit for a beginner and gives you a GREAT instrument at the end.If you're wondering why I have two, it's because I modded one to have a beta window - the vanilla bGeigie is for measuring gamma, calibrated against a Cs-137 source.I've told you the good, but now for something that saddens me. It has zero to do with the device per se. It's simply that I got both my kits (in 2016, mind) for $450 each, and since then I've seen the price of the kit climb to $475 to $550 and now to $650 in a few months. Don't misunderstand me - this is definitely worth $650 relative to other counters (I believe the Onyx now retails for around $795 built) but this uses no custom parts except the PCB. I just don't understand how the price can have justifiably gone up almost 50% in a few months. I believe that $450 was a fair price based on part costs, and allowed the seller (KitHub) to make a fair profit on gathering the kit parts together. To me the price increase smacks of gouging based on the popularity and quality of the bGeigie combined with the continuing scarcity of affordable quality meters. I say this with some sadness since one of the KitHub founders was phenomenally helpful to me when my first kit had a couple of missing parts. Since this is open-source hardware I'm tempted to price up the kit and start selling kits myself.Anyway, if you're looking for a high-quality, versatile counter at less than a grand you just cannot beat the bGeigie.
