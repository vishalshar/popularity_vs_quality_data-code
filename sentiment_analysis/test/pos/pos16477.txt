A lot of fun and very functional.  I've gotten in the habit of putting my keys, wallet, glasses, etc., in my Man Pack and have eliminated the daily need for tracking things down.  It's quite large and carries a lot of stuff.  In cold weather I stick gloves and a stocking cap in it so always have them at the ready.  It's masculine enough to not be confused with a purse.  People just think you're carrying a backpack.
