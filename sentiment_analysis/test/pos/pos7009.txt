The VitaPerk coffee additive is just what I have been looking for.  There used to be a very good Keurig-type coffee pod called Rev Pulse which also had the B vitamins and other energy-enhancing additives but it was discontinued.  I looked around for an alternative but the only other energy coffee I have been able to find is Big Energy Coffee at 7/11 convenience stores.  It is a good product but, unfortunately not all of the local outlets brew this blend on a daily basis and it is not sold in bulk but rather by the cup only.  VitaPerk is a great product for coffee lovers who do not want to alter the basic taste of their coffee but also want a bit of added "pick up" in addition to the basic caffeine of the coffee.  I reckon it is not appropriate for those sensitive to caffeine or with certain medical conditions but if a consumer likes both coffee and energy drinks, this is an outstanding product. There is a disclaimer on the box which says that the product is not recommended for children, pregnant, and nursing women.  While I am very happy with VitaPerk, I just wish that similar products were also available.
