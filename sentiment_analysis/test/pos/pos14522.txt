My hard to shop for 13 year old LOVES these cars! We had no problems with the app as it works great with his iPod 5, my iPhone 6+, my husband's Galaxy 6, and our Galaxy Tab 2 tablet. The cars were a hit on Christmas with the entire family. I love how durable the cars are. My kids are rough on toys, especially electronic ones. We have had drones, other RC cars, and helicopters that have been damaged with only a few hours of being pulled from the box. These cars can withstand running into walls, each other, and all obsticals my kids have thrown in their way. I highly recommend this toy for all ages!!!!
