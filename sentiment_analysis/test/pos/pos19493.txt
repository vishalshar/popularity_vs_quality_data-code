I LOVE THIS THING!!  I have 5 dogs and 3 cats.  I love being able to check on them from wherever I am.  The Petzi is very easy to set up and the app is great.  It takes crunchy treats that are 1" or less.  I have been using the Milkbone Minis and also the Milkbone Trail Mix.  They both work fine.  It shoots out 2 to 3 treats each time. I also like that I can talk to my dogs/cats through the Petzi, even though they look terrified when I do it....they will get used to it.  It did take several days for them to stop running and hiding everytime I logged on to the Petzi.  It has a start up ding that is kinda loud.  Once they figured out that it was going to give them treats and not kill them all, they started coming to it.I did have trouble with the first one I ordered, but I contacted Petzi support and they got back to me within several hours.  I ended up have a camera problem and they shipped me a new unit.  The new unit is working fine.  I am still giving it 5 stars because Petzi is pretty new, I'm sure they are still working out some kinks and their customer service is wonderful. (Thank you Lenny for emailing, calling, and sending me the new unit!)  I highly recommend this product to anyone with animals at home.
