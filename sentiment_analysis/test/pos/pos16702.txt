Edited **again**Will not charge when plugged into the wall. It will charge just fine with the micro USB however that kind of defeats the purpose of this case. Contacted customer service and am sending this one back for yet another one. I want it to work. Will it??Edited. Ok so I returned my first one got a second working one and now I totally understand why people love this case. Works great. My kids now all want one. The one thing I think would be really neat is to have a variety of colored cases to use with the charger pack. I love to change my phone case often bMine doesn't charge my phone. And I can't figure out where to go to trouble shoot. It charges on the wall just fine but won't charge the phone.
