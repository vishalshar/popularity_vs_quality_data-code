This mug does exactly what I wanted: let me keep spill proof coffee on my desk with no lid. The coffee at work comes out really hot! If I use a traditional lidded coffee mug, it's forever before I can drink it. This 12oz size is precisely the "Large" setting on the coffee machine at work. I just like the clean/tech appearance of the mug vs those fat-bottomed frumpier low tech mugs. When I need it, I can also use the included lid and haven't had any sealing issues with it.
