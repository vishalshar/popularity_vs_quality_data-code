I have tried several top brand gaming headsets over the years; the LS30 is by far one of the best headsets I have ever owned. The mic quality is great, and finally a great headset with mic monitoring.The dial controls on each ear are an excellent design choice. The build quality is solid and the headsets sound and look excellent when listening to music. I have played The Division for several hours over the past few days and the headset comfort levels is good.
