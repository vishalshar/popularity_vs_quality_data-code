I researched smart lights for several weeks prior to finally deciding on Stack Lighting. True, Stack isn't the big kid on the block yet, and that could be a turn off (pardon the pun) for some. But what really makes these lights unique is that they've brought 21st century lighting out of the high tech novelty arena and squarely into the realm of everyday practicality. You won't find flashing purple and blue disco light options. But you will find a lighting system that gently eases you into the day, provides an appropriate amount of light when you're home, and then winds you down with a low intensity, warm light in the evening. These settings, of course, can be customized to your own preferences.Here's what I really like about this product:1. The lights are designed to function on their own. You don't have to pull out your smart phone every time you want to operate them. True, you will need access to your phone for initial setup or if you want to customize the settings, but there's a lot of smart built into these bulbs using Stack's room-to-room algorithms. And the system learns from your behavior over time, much like the Nest thermostat does. It knows when sunrise and sunset will happen, based on your zip code.2. The lights constantly adjust, both in color and in intensity. When in Sleep mode, they transform into motion-activated night lights until they "wake up" in the morning. I live in the far northwest corner of the U.S., and I'm looking forward to experiencing the effect of Stack's circadian lighting functionality on those very short, and frankly bleak, winter days.3. The bulbs turn on and off based on occupancy. When you're out, you can have the lights turn on and off periodically to simulate your being at home. Optionally, you can have the app notify you if it senses motion in your home while in Away mode. That's smart.4. Stack connects to Amazon's Echo, IFTTT, and the Nest thermostat. You can tell Alexa to dim the kitchen lights to 30%. You can create formulas in IFTTT that affect your lighting under specific conditions (such as weather). The lights also play well with Nest's thermostat, sharing occupancy information to help reduce gas and electric costs. Also in the works is Apple Home Kit compatibility, so Siri can become your lighting butler if you so desire.This is a great product.
