I like reusable bottles, but hated the fact they were impossible to really clean. This solves the problem easily. I've purchased 6 Clean Bottles now because I love them so much. My only minor complaint is that if the bottle "sweats" on the outside (from putting ice in the bottle) the water drips into the bottom crevice and then will drip out when you go to take a drink. Not a big deal, just a minor quibble.
