Our past experience with XM radio inside the house involved bringing the car unit into the house plugging it in and running an insanely long wire outside to try to point to the satellite and get a signal. Having a streaming account option via the computer is good, but what if you want to listen to SiriusXM in another room? This radio is the answer. It is a good looking unit and it sounds great. Entering the WiFi passkey and username/password for the account is rather a pain, but once you're through that all is good. Note that the radio is a brick if you don't have a paid SiriusXM subscription.
