I was interested in the SHIFT because it works with iOS, PC, MacOS, and Linux (I believe, in the latter case; haven't tested it yet but it should be compatible with USB 2.0 on Linux). Also, it handles a wide range of headphones, sampling rates, and DSD, and can act as a line out DAC for a main stereo system in addition to being a headphone amp/DAC. Frankly, that is a huge list of attributes. I have used it with in-ear monitors of varying quality, Sennheiser HD580s, much cheaper Sennheiser 238i, AH30 headphones and quite a few more. This is probably a better DAC than the PS Audio Digital Link in my main stereo, and certainly much more versatile, while tiny in comparison. That other DAC drives HD650s with a Vincent tube amp, so comparing the sound is apples and oranges until I put the SHIFT in place of the Digital Link, but anyway I am very happy with this purchase. Note that the price dropped even more after I purchased it, so don't pay full price for this model, but enjoy it. A note about this vendor- my purchase was not supposed to come with a case but did. Thanks!
