This is the best Card Phone I have owned (2 others are now on the shelf). It so far is a quality cell phone and processor is good enough for my use. I do not play games or surf web (only occasionally). As a  phone it is excellent, also for texting. The minute I turned it on it showed an available 4G network and calls are consistent and voice reception is great. It has worked since purchase. It does not have very many bells and whistles preloaded but good apps are available on Play Store. Resident storage space Is limited but it does accept SD cards. Screen brightness is adjustable and the music player is quite good. I find the pre-installed weather app is not very good as I could not get it to find anyplace closer than 20 miles away. Downloaded The Weather Station app and it works great. Cameras are minimal at best but show up well on screen. I have ordered a second one to be in the car in case I leave this one at home.
