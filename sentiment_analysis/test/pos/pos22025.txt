I received my Merge VR goggles on 23 Nov 2015.  The goggles work exactly as advertised.  I use my iphone 6 and the effect is striking, especially with earphones. The technology of the smart phones is clearly in place to provide compelling and entertaining content.  I have one small quibble.  The two buttons on top to move the lenses to optimize the view don't stay in place. You have to hold them or they drift  apart. I need some kind of spring device to hold the lenses in position. I can figure out a work-around. (work-around!  a tight rubber band holds them perfectly together!)  Aside from that, this is the perfect introduction until the 2016 VR tsunami sweeps in..!
