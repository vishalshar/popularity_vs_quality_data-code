Exactly what I was looking for!  I love my Quad Lock Bike Mount.  I mostly ride on paved trails and on the road, and I have minimal to zero movement with this mount.  It is quick and easy to install or remove (if you wanted to), and is simple to use.  The Quad Lock case itself is very nice, and I feel safe keeping it on even when I'm not on my bicycle.  I put use the waterproof cover whenever I cycle for a little added protection in case of a crash.  It is easy to put over the phone, but it is a little difficult to get off.  DO NOT expect to be able to talk on the phone with the waterproof cover on unless you turn the volume on full and are somewhere quiet.  You will also have to shout for the person on the other end to hear you.  Only other complaint is that the opening for the phone's camera sometimes creates a glare in my pictures if the light hits it at certain angles.
