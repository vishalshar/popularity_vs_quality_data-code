I was really excited for this little thing to replace all of the remotes in my living room - there's no way to pick the wrong one up now! There were very little instructions in the box, but customer support compensated more than enough. I'm finding the use of my phone as a touchscreen remote easier than I expected. Like going from an old Nokia phone to a smartphone.
