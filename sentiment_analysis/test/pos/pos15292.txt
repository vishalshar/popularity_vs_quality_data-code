Great product, very nicely made. I'm still trying to get my dog to pee on it but I think she isn't liking the step up to pee or something. I took the grass off to get her used to the grass and she's starting to pee on that. After doing a lot of research on these, I'm glad I got this one. Even though my dog isn't used to it yet, I like the idea of it being a little higher so they don't step in their pee.
