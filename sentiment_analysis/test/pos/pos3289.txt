This is an update - Aug 30, 2016I had to contact TarDisk because of some issues with my MacBook Air/TarDisk system.  The customer service support/representative I have worked with is Tony Ortiz.  He has been excellent - knowledgeable, responsive and very very helpful.  I ended up going to the Apple store and the guy at the Genius Bar said 'Oh, I'm looking at buy one of those TarDisks'.  After examining my system he said it was a software issue and reinstalled the OS - it was not a TarDisk issue.I cannot tell you how impressed I've been with Tony and TarDisk for his/their responsiveness and attention to detail.  (my background - 20 years in quality assurance for a Fortune 500 company and Tony is the best.  I've never met the guy but he does have customer issues as a top priority).Great product and OUTSTANDING service.  Thanks Tony!!======Recently Adam from TarDisk contacted me regarding the problems I had with my original TarDisk and my posted negative feedback.  I had received a refund from Amazon so in a sense issue had been addressed.  However, he/TarDisk wanted to be sure I knew that they had addressed the quality issues which were raised in my negative feedback. They offered to send me a new TarDisk at no charge if I would review it and update my posted comments.  My choice was to order one from Amazon, pay for it myself and then if the product quality had changed upgrade my review.The current product has top notch quality - see the attached photo of the TarDisk just received.  The installation directions are detailed and clear.  Product performance is as advertised.  In addition Pear now comes standard with all TarDisks.Adam, thanks for following up with me and I am pleased to be able to update my review.============I was disappointed with this product because (1) it was not clear that purchasing it through/from Amazon meant it would not have Pear and (2) the quality of the aluminum case was poor; it had sharp edges, see attached photo.  The attention to production detail was not present.
