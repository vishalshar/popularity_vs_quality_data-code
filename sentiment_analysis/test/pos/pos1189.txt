I teach a STEM / Maker's class for 3 - 7 year olds. In our unit on electricity, we used littleBits and Snap Circuits. littleBits are "cooler" than SC, easy to assemble, and you can do lots of fun stuff with them by combining them with household objects or buying more modules. The downsides to littleBits are that they're expensive, not very durable, and don't clearly illustrate the key concepts of electricity and circuits. That said, I still really like them!Snap Circuits are much more geeky - the manual is overly technical for young kids (under 10), but good for slightly older kids who really want to grasp the concepts of electrical circuits. And they're way cheaper. I have a full review of both on my blog Inventors of Tomorrow.
