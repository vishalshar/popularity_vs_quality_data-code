Not a bad bulb but the cost is really just heartbreaking and the reason I say that is because realistically the bulb is not going to last 20 years unless you only turn it on for three hours a day. Replacing it is just painful if you ask me and there is other bulbs out there that can do the same thing for half the price. The app is nice but glitchy and the features are very limited unless you add a third party wall switch like Goldee to jump start this bulb into full automation. If they can cut the price to 30 from 50 at most it would be more affordable to more people. There is a new technology arriving on the horizon called Emberlight and you only have to replace the bulb which is fiscally a fantastical idea to still retain the same smart bulb feature. The color in the light bulb is just novelty because after a while you will find it just not practical unless you have a big fancy house with a party room. If you want to play around with it I would suggest you wait until the price drops and the apps to be more stable.
