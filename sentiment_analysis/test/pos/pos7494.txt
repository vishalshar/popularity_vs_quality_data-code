This jacket was a gift and was perfect. The reflective material was as just as described and the size was perfect. My son is a bodybuilder and I was worried tha it might be too small but he is able to wear a sweater or sweat shirt underneath and be quite warm! I no longer worry that drivers will not see him when hes riding!
