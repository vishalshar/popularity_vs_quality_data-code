We were searching for a way to easily project content from all of our various devices (phone, tablet, laptop) to the display screens in our new conference room.  We designed the room to foster easy collaboration and quick meetings to share information and ideas so it was important that we had a way to quickly switch from one presenter to another.  AirTame arrived and made it all work.  The best thing about it was that we had it up and running before my IT guy showed up to help install it.  Anyone can quickly figure out the basics and join in the discussion seamlessly.  I absolutely recommend this product for anyone looking for an affordable solution to multimedia displays that doesn't require a PhD in technology to understand.
