This was the first time I had ever used a PolarPro filter and I was very pleased with the product.One thing I always look at is the build quality.  The outer rim is solid and feels like it would withstand my "bull in a china factory" self.  It fit perfectly on my Phantom 4 camera.  This particular filter is quite useful for bright open area shots on super sunny days.  You can get film quality footage by using the correct settings on your Phantom 4.  This filter helps by lowering the light to allow for opening up the camera and lowering your FPS so that your pictures are not washed out.The clarity is excellent and this product works exactly as it should.
