[Updated 9-2-2016]Boy - two days make a big difference. Big enough that I'm convinced that Automatic Pro deserves a five-star rating. First off - the Automatic Pro IFTTT channel has been updated, such that location based recipes work! This makes it possible to use geofencing based on my car's position to control just about anything that has an IFTTT channel (eg. Wink shortcuts).Second, I was initially unhappy because several things on Automatic Dashboard (dashboard.automatic.com) weren't working - or worked sporadically - like updating my trips, or showing my driving style (hard acceleration/braking). This is now fixed - and I commend Automatic Support for responding to my complaints with such alacrity.Third, several things on Automatic Labs either weren't available for Automatic Pro, or weren't working correctly through the dashboard. That seems to be largely fixed as well.Finally - Automatic Support - both email and online at community.automatic.com have been superbly responsive and helpful!I highly recommend this product.[Original review]I received the Automatic Pro adapter yesterday. This is the first device of its kind that I have used in my car (2016 Ford C-Max SEL Hybrid). I am the sole driver of my car, but there are several things that attracted me to the Automatic Pro adapter; sadly, two of my expectations arent currently met. Anyway, here are the things that I wanted:1) Trip logs that could be exported into a spreadsheet2) Car diagnostics3) Crash alert services4) IFTTT integration - so recipes could be triggered based on the cars location5) Real-time monitoring of the cars locationI downloaded the app and plugged in the adapter into the OBD-II port. It took a little while to be powered by the car - about 2 minutes before I heard a beep from the Automatic. After that, I ran into the first issue - my phone (Google Nexus 6P running Android Nougat) would not pair with the adapter via Bluetooth. Sadly, because Automatic has no realtime technical support (either Chat or phone), I was left twiddling my thumbs debating whether to persevere or call it quits and send it back to Amazon. My masochistic side won. I turned off/restarted Bluetooth on the phone, rebooted the phone - all to no avail. Driven more by frustration and less my logic, I decided to turn off Bluetooth on the car. That seemed to do the trick. My phone paired right away with the adapter. The adapter then updated its firmware and I thought we were on the way to better things. Except that the Automatic Pro app didnt indicate any trips after several short trips within my neighborhood. And, the app displayed no particulars about the Automatic Pro adapter such as its firmware version (picture 2). So I felt Id done all I could and decided to send it back.But an errand intervened that required me to drive about 5 miles to drop something off. During this trip, the adapter came to life because I received several text messages from an IFTTT recipe Id setup to text me each time the ignition was started. Upon arriving at my destination, I found the app had updated with all of my trips. And displayed information about the adapters firmware (picture 3). After coming home, I discovered it had also integrated with the Amazon Echo (Alexa, ask Automatic where my car is - works!). So Id say it mostly works now. I can get trip logs & maps logged to a Google spreadsheet via an IFTTT recipe (picture 1).What doesnt work? Automatic claims to support Real time vehicle tracking . At least with my phone, that doesnt work. I can only get information about the route taken during a trip a few minutes after I park. Second, currently the Automatic Pro cannot provide the car's location to IFTTT using the Automatic Pro channel as a recipe trigger; Automatic support (Derrick) told me they plan to add this feature to the IFTTT Automatic Pro channel soon.Hopefully both these will change in the near future, permitting me to up my rating from 4 to 5 stars.
