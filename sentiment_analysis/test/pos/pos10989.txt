After trying and failing with the non-absorbent litter provided by my vet, I tried Kit4Cat.  What an amazing product.  I bought more than one in case my kitty needed more of the sand, but one packet worked PERFECTLY!  I put the sand in a smallish, clean litter box.  My kitty peed right in it, unlike the non-absorbent litter which he didn't like.  The urine pooled in the corner of the litter box, and I was able to retrieve a full, clean sample.  It's such a relief to have this product when you're stressed out about your kitty not feeling well.  I bought two extra kits, and am so glad I did.  Now I have them on hand in case I ever need one quickly.
