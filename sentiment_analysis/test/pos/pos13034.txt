Wasn't too sure about the brand at first as I had not heard of them before (and not many review back then) but after trying the filament I would say it definitely works great. I have been using this in my Monoprice Maker Select and had not run into any clogs or issues over the past month or so I have used it. The filament seems to extrude very well and the quality of the prints are very nice.One of the biggest advantages to this I would say is that it is a 0.5 kg spool and priced similarly per kg to bigger spools. I did (at least on amazon) have a harder time finding other quality 0.5kg spools that matched the price per kg of the bigger spools. This means since I am more or less just a hobbyist on 3D printing I can buy a wider variety of colors and not have to spend too much.Also the resealable bag that it comes in is a very nice touch, I hope more 3D printer filaments would do this.Also included some pictures of the first prints I had with it though I hadn't fully dialed the printer in yet when I made them.
