Believe it or not, I didn't purchase this to use on football gloves. I purchased it for my boyfriend to use at work. He works on a loading dock, and he uses an extra large crowbars on the semi trailers. In the winter time, and when it's cold outside, he has a big problem keeping his gloves on while he is working. They are constantly slipping off the crowbar, or causing him problems. This glove grip worked great for him. It doesn't leave any residue or stickiness on the gloves, on his crowbar, or on the equipment he works with. It was a superb find, and I so grateful that I did. He has purchased and gone through so many pairs of gloves it's ridiculous. Hopefully this will help to save us some money in the long run, and save him from having to buy so many pairs of gloves.
