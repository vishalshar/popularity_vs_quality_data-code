I received it and had it installed and working on my phone and my wife's phone in less than 15 minutes. Great, simple tech. Just what we needed to simply have a garage door opener with us at all times (which wasn't happening). We have adult kids and live close enough to my wife's mother that cars are traded for various purposes all the time. It was a constant battle to remember the garage door opener out of the car - usually we would forget and have to hop out and get into the garage to use the door opener in there (the keypad outside has had water damage so it's non functional right now). Anyway, this was the perfect solution!! Love it!
