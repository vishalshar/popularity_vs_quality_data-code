I am an ugly man but with this camera I look almost human.  I love this camera but I am not a photographer.  I suck at taking photographs and having the ability to refocus and color balance the image after the fact is handy.  My battery was dead and I followed the instructions reset the camera and it came up and charged fine. Firmware update was painless and the software works great.  Lytro 4.3 is a bit confusing at first but messing around the settings anyone can figure it out (again im not a photographer).  Hopefully I can get this thing working with the oculus and check out the stereoscopic photos. This tech will not get adopted until they can cram it in an iphone but I like new stuff and its really cool. If your an elitist, douchy, scarf wearing lumbersexual then this may not be for you.  If your open minded and like trying out new technology this may be a cool gadget for you.  But if your afraid of being confused stay away, if you have problems getting your tv on the wrong input stay away from this camera. If you yearn for simpler days and watch more than 2 hours of Fox News this may not be the product for you.
