Love these (see my review for the Securifi 2015). They stick out a little bit, but do not take too much space in their circumference so you can still use surrounding plugs. They've been very reliable and stable using the Almond app, and there's a button on the side if you want to manually toggle power. My only upgrade request would be in the app itself for scheduled timer; instead of having to set up rules for when it will work, a click on calendar would be way more convenient (we have some of our lights go on and off at certain times am and then pm, and then different times for the weekends). I gave away the 5 cheap-seeming Chinese similar devices we were using.
