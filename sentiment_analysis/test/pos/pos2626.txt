This is a very nice looking, well thought out unit.  I did have some issues initially setting it up,  but the Manufacturer was very quick in replying directly to my questions to help me work through the setup process.  I have always wondered about my air quality,  and now I have some answers.  I currently have this unit in my living room,  but I could see myself eventually getting another unit specifically for my kids' bedroom.  Would definitely recommend if you are unsure about your indoor air quality.
