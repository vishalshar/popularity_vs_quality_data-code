This is our 4th or 5th dock in the last 6 or 7 years.  It's a bit pricey given there are no electronic components.  That said, it is by far the best quality and fit.  We are charging all of these easily:- iPod touch 5th Generation with a thick case- iPhone 6 with no case (yet)- iPad Air with no case- iPhone 5 with a thin case- iPod nano 7th Generation
