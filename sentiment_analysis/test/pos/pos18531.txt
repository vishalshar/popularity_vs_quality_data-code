Fascinating bulb. First, the software works ok, Only problem I have not been able to sync with the the nest fire alarm yet. This was the feature I bought it for, so my hall way would light in case of a fire. The color control feature is nice, I really like how I can bring different moods to the home.  It is still too expensive if your going outfit your home in my opinion, however it does work with some minor software glitches i am sure LIFX will solve.
