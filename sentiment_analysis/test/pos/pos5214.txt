Picked this little gem up in the spring when my previous Android phone of many years simply got too old to use without heavy modification. I'd been a huge fan of the small-sized HTC Aria phone and was disappointed with my phone plan's selection of gigantic and pricey "upgrades" for this year. A web search about the smallest smart-devices of 2016 turned up an article mentioning the Posh Micro phones, and after a bit more sleuthing around since the little guy almost seemed too good to be true I ordered one here. Have not regretted my purchase one bit and I recommend the Posh Mobile Micro phone to anybody looking for something tiny like me!Pros:- Exceptionally portable & handy. It fits in my skinny jean pockets, my small purses and my tiny hands!!- Sturdy plastic case and screen has held up exceptionally well to accidental encounters with the pavement & tile floor.- Easy to pick-up Android interface and file manager. It didn't take long to get everything set up on it like on my old phone. Has very reasonable text size settings within it so if you find the text in menus to be too small, it can be easily adjusted.- Added unexpected bonus: Plays some games pretty well! I was surprised because I wasn't expecting this at all. Anything with lots of menus like Ingress shows up too squished to read, but puzzle games like Marvel Puzzle Quest work fine.Cons:- The USB charging port requires a specialized micro USB cable (which comes with the phone). I'm not sure if it's the port itself being finicky, or the special cable (since I only have the one and cannot test it) but sometimes it takes a little experimentation to get the cable to sit the right way for the phone to charge. This can be a pain on the road when driving in a car as the phone can sometimes easily slip away from the USB charger.- The small phone size means the screen is WICKED small, so the digital keypad takes some getting used to, or may simply be impossible to use if your fingers are large. Since this sized screen is probably beyond even the general min-spec for mobile, you'll sometimes bump into cramped or hard to read layouts in apps and websites. For my needs, this hasn't been a problem but I wanted to note that this wouldn't be a great phone for folks with big hands or with troubles viewing small-sized text.
