I am going to make this some sort of a live review. I will update this review on a bi-weekly basis.First week:Product arrived early and looked exactly as advertised. Setup was easy. Now I have a small garden in my living room. Five stars for now.Edit 1 - Third week:All three of my basil plants have sprouted and look awesome. I removed the domes last week. Haven't added any water since the initial setup. The only downside I see to this product is that I'm getting ever so slightly obsessive about my plants :) and oh the price too - I bought this thing for 35 bucks which I guess is a fair price but the current price which as of this writing is 65, is way too much.Fifth Week:The plants are growing too fast :). Today  eveing I found some top level leaves had burned because they were touching the light. I'm pretty sure when I left them this morning, the plants were at least couple of inches off the led. Well growing too fast can't be a negative, can it? But I do have a complaint. The design of the lamp itself isn't all that great, especially the mechanism to alter it's height. So it's not really a 5 for me, more like 4.5.
