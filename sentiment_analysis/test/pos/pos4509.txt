Ive been waiting for this for a long time and couldnt be happier!! After unpacking the FitBark and attaching it to Moose a few days ago, I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this, but am I glad I did!! When it arrived, I thought it might be complicated to set up and then found out that I couldn't have been more wrong. To my surprise, the setup was effortless. I played tug of war with Moose with one hand and was able to set the FitBark up with my other. The rubber band they ship with the device snapped around Moose's collar nice and snug. Moose even went for a swim yesterday and I can vouch, it is waterproof. He always gets great exercise but now I'm actually going to be able to chart it and compare against other dogs. Hopefully this inspires me to take a run with Moose so I can boost his step count. Thanks FitBark!
