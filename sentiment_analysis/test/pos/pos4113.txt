After I purchased my first pack, I liked them so much that I bought two additional packs. The socks appear to be well made and are very comfortable to wear. The grey socks had a strong chemical smell, but after running them a few times through the laundry the smell disappeared. After about Àù dozen laundry cycles the socks shrank considerable. However they are still very comfortable to wear and other than the shrinkage I cannot see any wear on the socks. Based on wearing comfort I would rate them five stars but overall due to the reasons mentioned above I feel a four star rating is more appropriate. I did pay full price for the socks and I believe they are worth it.
