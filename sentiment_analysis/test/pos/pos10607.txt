Requires all 4 or more burners to get to temp.  I found that I needed to make smaller pizzas 8" seems the best.  I also found that I needed to use parchment paper under the pie even with the corn meal.  That way it would glide in and out better.  I am sure over time the oven floor will get slippery.Over all it is an interesting kitchen gadget for the BBQ and a lot cheaper than a $500+ pizza oven.I liked it over all.  It is if nothing else a new cooking challenge
