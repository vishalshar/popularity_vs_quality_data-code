This is a fantastic case! I love it. It's too bad that it doesn't fit on my motorcycle. I have a Honda CBR F4i (600cc) and the cases' loop doesn't fit on the handle bars (or anything else on the bike). Most sport style street bikes have wide handle bars so keep this in mind before purchasing. This case fir perfectly on my brothers cruiser style bike.
