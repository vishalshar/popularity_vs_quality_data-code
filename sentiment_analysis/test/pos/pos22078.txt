4/23 update - these still work well for me.  Two application remotely switched robot programmable outlets for $30 bucks.  Great deal.  I continue to have no stability issues, these work as well as your internet connection does.  Grab them at this price.I have two Pivot Power Genius (PPG) power strips.  As others have pointed out in older reviews, they didn't work very well when first brought to market.  That said, Quirky (Wink) is really working hard to improve their products in all ways and every way.  I have had perfect performance from my Pivot Powers for the last several months.  No sporadic power switching, no random loss of connectivity, just reliable function.I used the PPG for my Christmas tree using the timer function to turn the tree off and on.  Worked for the six weeks the tree was up.  I've linked the PPG to my Quirky Spotter, asking it to turn on an outlet/lamp whenever it sensed vibration, which has worked without intervention for literally three months.  I have my other PPG set up on my home entertainment system, which draws a lot of power even when it isn't being used.  Via the timer in the Wink app, I turn the PPG/entertainment system off at midnight each night (I'm not up that late!) and next time I need to use the system I use the Wink app to power on the PPG and system.  Works every time and all the time for me and saves me a lot of vampire electric usage and cost.These strips can often be had for around $40 dollars if you shop around, for all it does with the Wink app (Robots, timers) and IFTTT etc. you really can't even touch the value of two smart outlets anywhere else.I Highly recommend this product.
