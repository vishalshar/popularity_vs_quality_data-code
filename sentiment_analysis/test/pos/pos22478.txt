Birthday present for my 8 year old grandson. He and his cousins have spent hours playing with this robot. Goes through batteries quickly, wish it was easier to access the battery, have to remove/replace Philips screws. Minor. Works well on level surfaces, and will negotiate small rises and bumps in surfaces, most times. Not good in sand, grass, mud.
