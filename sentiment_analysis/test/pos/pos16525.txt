So delicious and light. I've never had good experiences trying to make grain free pancakes. These are so easy to prepare and delicious and even better with blueberries:) it's bad enough I have to eat chicken for breakfast it's sure nice to have a paleo food that feels and tastes like pancakes with minimal effort required.
