Great watch, fitness tracking and sleep monitor.  This was my first Withings purchase but after owning it for a few weeks I was inspired to buy the blood pressure monitor and cardio scale.It's simple and doesn't need to be recharged.  It isn't so huge that I want to take it off all the time.  It feels like a normal watch to me.  It easily syncs with their app which is on my iPhone.I like having a lot of data that is collected often to see patterns emerge.Great product.
