I use this for mostly hands free calling in my car. I dont have a car stereo with blue tooth but my Explorer has a 3.5mm AUX port in the console so I run a standard 2 bar stereo male to male 3.5mm cord from my console to the out put port on the MightyMic and I use a 3 bar male to female mic/stereo car from the MightyMic to my Note 5 and it works perfectly. I had a JVC stereo with blu tooth in my old Buick Rendezvous and people would complain about backround noise and echoes all the time with my current set up i dont get any more complaints
