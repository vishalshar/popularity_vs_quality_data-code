My favorite by far is the honey mustard! I can eat the whole bag in one sitting! These are great for on the go, the perfect desk snack and just what you need when looking for a crunchy and salty snack. I love that they are good for me, and I do not feel guilty after eating them- even after they satisfy my craving. My husband loves the kool ranch!
