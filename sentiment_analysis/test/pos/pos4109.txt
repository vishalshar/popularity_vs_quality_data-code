My 88 year old Dad asked me to buy him some lighter socks for summer and he's very hard to please.  I had the socks sent right to him and he was so happy with them.  His rating was "they are perfect".  Coming from him, that's the best there can be.  They are comfortable, stay up and your feet don't sweat in the summer heat.  He decided to get the gray and just thinks these socks are wonderful.  I'll be looking for these socks again when it's time for new ones.
