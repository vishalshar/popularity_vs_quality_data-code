I sell LuLaRoe and I do a lot of Facebook live videos. Unfortunately, that feature isn't available on my laptop, so I have to use my phone. It didn't occur to me until I was in a pinch that I had no way to hold my phone up, and also show the products as well, and I didn't even know something like this existed until I went on the hunt for a phone tripod. This is great because I can literally hook my phone up anywhere, and do the live video. It's not a big bulky tripod, or anything like that. It's pretty small. And I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, with a bulky case on it, and it still fits in this thing easily, which is surprising because there are a lot of mounts it won't fit in.I received a discount code on this product in exchange for my honest, factual review.
