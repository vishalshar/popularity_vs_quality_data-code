I havnt received my MiP yet but will be here friday cant wait lol I am sure it will be as much fun as everyone is saying...I do wonder though if it works on Tile .....I received the MiP today other then getting the battery panel off him I had no problem with him. For those that are wondering if he runs on Spanish Tile type floors he had no problem at all...Love it and sure he wont just be put up on a shelf... once I download the app tomorrow will see all that he can do......
