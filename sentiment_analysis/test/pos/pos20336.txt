I am very happy with this product except it did not work with my LG G3. I had to use an old Galaxy S3.This toy is very durable. I crashed it into buildings and trees and nothing happened except a few scratches. Though, I must say that the "expert" model provided in the box is easier to fly than the "beginner" model. Of course, after getting used to how to control the plane after 10-15 tries, you realize that you do not have to use the paper airplane models in the box (or on the website). Use your own models and make modifications.One more flaw... My rudder was wired backwards, so if I use the default settings on the app, it turns right when I turn my phone to left. Of course, there is a "reverse" button for this in the app. However, it did not reverse the image on the app for some reason.
