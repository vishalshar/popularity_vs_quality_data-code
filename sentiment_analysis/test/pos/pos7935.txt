I absolutely love my Bella Leaf and can't wait to get a the Urban version, as well. The fitness tracker is so much prettier than the "prison cuffs" out there right now. I have a small frame and wrists, so something big and clunky looks weird on me. I have gotten tons of compliments on my leaf, and I love the versatility of being able to wear it on my wrist, my clothes or on a chain. I've used it to track steps for a work challenge and track my sleep habits, as well.
