I just upgraded from the Whistle activity tracker to the Whistle GPS tracker and I am very pleased!  I have two dogs and I was able to set up the devices with ease.  I was worried the GPS tracker would be unwieldy for my dog's collars, but it is well-designed and not much bigger than the original device.  I love that I can keep track of both dogs within the same iOS app.  And surprisingly, the battery life of the new tracker is as long or longer than the original monitor.The activity monitor works essentially the same.  I'm not sure if it's more of a benefit for my dogs or for me...but I will often go out for an extra walk if they haven't met their daily goal!The GPS tracking is a great feature!  The negative reviews were concerning, but my experience has been entirely positive.  I get a text notification anytime one of my dogs crosses her established boundary. It's been great for knowing when the dog sitter comes to walk the dogs.  And, the peace of mind in knowing my dogs won't escape with my knowledge is priceless.This is an impressive first run at a combined GPS/activity tracking device and I look forward to future upgrades.
