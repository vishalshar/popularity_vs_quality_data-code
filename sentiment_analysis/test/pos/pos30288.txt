When my twin daughters started kindergarten I got them each a Thermos Funtainer, but they were unable to open it themselves and lost too much time of their 20 minute lunch getting an adult to open it for them, so for the last four years they've always only ever had cold food in their lunch box, and they choose to take very few school lunches because they are very picky.  I have a wide variety of sectioned lunch boxes and and bento boxes that I use.  I was quite excited when I was offered the chance to try one of these OmieBoxes for free.  I was intrigued by the opportunity to add back in hot foods and the look of the lid in this one made me think my kids cold open it on their own, so I went for it.It arrived yesterday and it was a lovely presentation coming in a very nice sturdy box.  I pre-washed it and read the instructions, they say top shelf dish ware safe but also say hand washing will extend it's life.I like that this has a handle and can be used as a lunch box on it's own though we have no beverage containers that fit it.  We used to use those Honest pouches that are pictured in the OmieBox promo photos but my kids don't like them and won't drink them, and those milks that don't need refrigeration fit in ether which is really cool (so do the Pacific single serve size soup broths!), but I can't afford those for my kids regularly and my Costco only sells chocolate and I don't want them having all that sugar.  So, we have little plastic bottles that I fill with unsweetened iced tea or with a natural stevia sweetened drink, and these bottles do not fit inside the box so the box has to go into another lunch bag with the drink bottle.  Maybe in the future the company will make a drink container that fits into it.  I saw a person ask another reviewer about a lunch bag that fits the Omiebox and one of the ones we bought at Target last year does, the Thermos Insulated Lunch Cube, I have attached photos.  Another reviewer said they got this lunch box for themselves and then said they wished it was larger, well this product was designed for kids and it is a perfect size for kids.  It is a bit heavier than I was expecting, it has a lot of heft to it, and the plastic is very thick and sturdy and seems like it will be very durable.It claims to be leakproof and there is a nice rubber seal that keeps stuff from going from compartment to compartment, I really like that this seal is removable to it can be thoroughly washed.  After it's first use today the juices from the mango pieces did not run from compartment to compartment, so thumbs up here.There is a small removable divider that can be used to cut either of the smaller two compartments into two yet smaller compartments, I wish this divider made a complete seal to prevent foods from leaking on each other but it isn't really that big of a deal.The part that has the hot/cold container is removable and that area can be used for a sandwich for example which is really nice.  The metal inside of the hot/cold part unscrews very easily for thorough cleaning.  And i was right, the handle for removing the lid on the hot/cold container is extremely easy to work and makes it so my kids can easily open it without needing an adult's help.  At 7 am I made Annie's Microwave mac and cheese to test it out with this morning and the whole thing fit into the hot/cold container which was awesome.  I preheated the container as per the instructions while the mac and cheese was in the microwave and my daughter said it was still warm enough for her tastes by the time she at at 11:20 am, so another big thumbs up there.So, over all, both me and my test-daughter are very impressed with this and extremely happy with this.  I (and she) want now to buy another one but I have to say at $39.99 it is high priced.  That being said, the old adage you get what you pay for, at least here, you really do.  Given the quality and actual functionality of this product I don't think $39.99 is out of line and I am looking forward to seeing what new products this company comes out with in the future.Update:  Other twin brought it to school, same lunch, mac and cheese, and it was plenty warm enough for her too and she was quite happy to be able to have hot food at lunch as well as mac and cheese from home that she likes.  However, she said she was not able to open it on her own, that her friend next to her was unable to open it for her, and when she found a teacher even the teacher had a tough time before finally getting it.  Not sure why this was, but I wanted to make sure to report that we had mixed results with the ease of opening.  I think what is happening is that when you put hot food in it and it starts to cool down it creates suction (like when canning) that can make opening it a little more difficult than people who have just tried opening and closing it without actually using hot food in it.  I am assuming then that if you are using this to keep food cold that it would not be an issue, and I want to point out that we have not yet tried keeping cold food cold in it, we have Lunch Blox for that with those cold packs that they snap into, so we really only wanted this for hot food.
