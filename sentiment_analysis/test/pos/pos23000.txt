I purchased 3 packs of these on a whim. I've been looking for a solution for my mom. She has lost the use of her right hand, so tying shoes is out of the question, and she hates asking for help. These are the perfect solution. I've laced up all her sneakers and she feels more independent because of it. Thanks for the great product!  I'm going to add some to a pair of my running shoes as well.
