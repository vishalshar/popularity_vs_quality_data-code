I've tried several hydration trackers and unfortunately tried this one last because I thought it looked cheesy and cheap, but after the others I tried ended up either being completely unreliable or just stopped working I decided to give this one a shot based on the good reviews. Well, it's definitely the best hydration tracker I've used. It's reliable, accurate, and despite looking cheesy and cheap in the pictures it's actually very well made and durable! But the thing I like most about it that I didn't know prior to the purchase is that the tracking part of it on the bottom can detach from the bottle and fit onto any other bottle of your choice with a 3" diameter bottom, so if you don't like the bottle it comes with or want one with a higher water capacity just find one with a 3" diameter and it'll fit. I went with the following Nalgene Tritan and it works great!!!https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NCDE6G/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1I definitely recommend this hydration tracker to anyone wanting to track your daily water intake. Don't make the same mistake I did by trying other hydration trackers on the market, this is the best out there and you won't be sorry. Make this your first hydration tracker and it will also be your last, don't waste your money on anything else!
