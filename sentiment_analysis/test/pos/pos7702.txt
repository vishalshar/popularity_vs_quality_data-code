The beauty of this product wasn't apparent to me until my daughter at 3 months started having diaper leaks at night.  When it's 5 am and you find poop stains you truly appreciate the ability to change the sheets in seconds so you can put your baby back to bed.  I have three sets of the extra top sheets and have washed them multiple times with no issues and they remain fairly soft.  They're not going to be Egyptian cotton high thread count sheets but honestly they work and they are one of the best purchases I've made as a new parent.
