My daughter bought a used Honda from a dealer, and I don't know what product dealers use when they detail cars for resale, but it smells terrible. She has had it for almost a year, and it still smells. Trying to avoid toxic artificial air fresheners, we saw your product on Amazon, and decided to give it a try. It is awesome! It's only been a few days and the odor is almost gone. We are so impressed, we are ordering another one!
