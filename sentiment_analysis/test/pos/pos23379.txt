I rolled my eyes at my wife when this thing showed up at our house. We already had a waffle maker, which rarely gets used.Then the weekend came around and the kids has Olaf waffles. Which of course taste better than boring square or round waffles. So they ate the heck out of them. Easy to make, easy to clean. No complaints in terms of usage.I think we've made a total of 6 Olaf waffles so far, so we are at a $4 CPW (cost per waffle) right now. I'll be happy when the wife and kids plow through a few more and lower our cost to a $1 CPW. After that, it's just, uh, gravy.
