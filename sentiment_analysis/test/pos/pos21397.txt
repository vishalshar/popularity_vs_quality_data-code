New owner so you never know and I WILL come back later for a second review. Still, it really seems to be working. I take my dog off leash into the desert areas around our development.  This is a second type of unit so I have something to compare.  It picks up the tracker pretty quickly and is very accurate.  I don't use the base unit secure area but it is a killer application. The attachment device works great on the collar.  I like this unit.
