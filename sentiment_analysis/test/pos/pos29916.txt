A nice gadget! I stuck one under the cabinet in my bathroom to illuminate the floor when I walk in at night.You can't see it at all in the daylight, but it can apparently see my feet in the dark.Note that this device only lights up in the dark (to save batteries). Leave the button out to cycle colors slowly, then press the button in to hold the current color permanently (or until you let the button out again).It has suction cups that seem to work well on the toilet, but I went with Command Strips to mount the box.
