Mounted the PolarPro StrapMount on my pack's shoulder strap. Secure, worked as described. Couple of things on the negative side: (1) On a backback shoulder strap the backside of the clamp rests against your shoulder area. You'll need to adjust it to get the best spot to minimize potential discomfort doing a multi-hour hike. The good news on this, however, is that the clamp is easy to put on and take off and easy to adjust (vertical position on shoulder strap). (2) The other frustrating thing I ran into is getting the camera mount to slide out from the StrapMount easily. It can get stuck it seems, not all the time, but frequently. Not sure what is going on here, but it happens. On the other hand, once you slide the mount/camera into position, it is very secure and stable.  Overall, it is a well-made product, works well, and is built to last.
