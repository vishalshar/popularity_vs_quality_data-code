At a recent trade show, I heard people talking aboutÂ Kaptivo. It's a camera-thingie that mounts over a whiteboard and is used to save and share whatever you write on the board. I use whiteboards a lot in my business so I figured I'd give it a try. I didn't realize they were sold on Amazon!I'm a bit short so I needed a stool to screw in the mounting bracket over my whiteboard. The device itself is very light so hanging it off the bracket and running the wires to the control pad were super easy. To set it up, you first need to connect your laptop to the Kaptivo wifi itself. What's cool in the setup is that you can see and set the corners of your whiteboard. After setup, you connect the Kaptivo back to your regular wifi network and you're all set. It took about 10 minutes including reading directions, mounting, etc.Once it was set up, I pointed my browser to kaptivo.live, entered the six-character Kaptivo ID, and voila, there was my whiteboard content! Some of my whiteboard pens are running low on ink but amazingly, it actually looked clearer through the Kaptivo than in real life. I was so excited that I emailed a colleague of mine to view the board. She also went to kaptivo.live, entered the ID, and after I gave permission to view, she saw the board as well. And what's really cool is the content is broadcast live. So she saw what I was writing as I was writing it. So COOL!Another killer feature is that Kaptivo lets you save your content. I can take a snapshot of the board or get a history of all its content. Now I don't have to use my phone to take pictures of my whiteboard.If you use whiteboards a lot, Kaptivo is a killer product. Highly recommend it.
