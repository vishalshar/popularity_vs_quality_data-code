Even better than I expected. I'm a light cigarette smoker and smoke in my car 1-2 times a day. Even though I always have the window down and my hand halfway out the window, there is no denying that my car almost always smelled like an ashtray. I'm in the process of quitting and have been struggling to break my association of smoke while driving so I figured that sprucing up the inside of my car would help. After trying a slew of really gross overly fragrant air "fresheners" I had all but given up on getting rid of the lingering smoke smell which had faded into an unpleasant musky scent.Enter PURGGO. Was a late night impulse purchase - but one I certainly don't regret. Install (if you can even call it that) was easy peasy, just take off the headrest of the seat and make sure the loop of the PURGGO is surrounding the headrest base before putting it back on. DONE! While I can't say this has eliminated the smell entirely (what I believe to be an unrealistic expectation) - it has made a noticeable difference. I thought it might just be my car airing out but I caved and smoked one cigarette in my car yesterday & this morning it was hardly noticeable.Definitely recommend, although might be mildly irritating to backseat passengers if the front seat is pushed far back. Certainly not enough to make a ride uncomfortable, but could get in the way if someone was trying to read or do any activity with their hands in front of them. A non-issue for me, but worth mentioning.
