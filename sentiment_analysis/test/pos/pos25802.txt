This was an item suggestion that came up while we were browsing for something else here on Amazon. It looked like a pretty clever idea, and our three-year-old constantly plays with die-cast cars, so we decided to try this Starter Set.So far, the results have been very good. We tried out a pretty simple combination of straight pieces and curves on his IKEA Stuva bench, and he immediately tried it out and asked for more. So we added it to his alarm clock/monitor shelf and the ledge between his dressers and bookcases. And what we have in these pictures is only about half of what came with the starter set.As to the product itself... It seems to be just a bit more tacky than blue painter's tape. It seems to be adhering to the laminate furniture quite well, but was easy enough to peel up and adjust as we were making these roads. The curved corners are nice for variety, but it's easy enough to make sharp corners and intersections with just the tape itself. We've put down a mix of both so far.The only thing we don't know yet is how long it will last. It's just too soon to know how durable it is or how well it will hold up under constant play. We'll let him try this out for awhile, and then maybe try out a few different colors (or the mud track) when wear and tear takes its toll on this starter set.
