The possibilities for making life more convenient are there, but the implementation/software is still unreliable.I've had the singlecue for about a week and noticed that its ability to pick up on your initial gesture to turn it on is spotty.  While the singlecue is marketed as a way to save time from looking for your remote, much of that - at least at this point - is negated by having to flail your finger around or pretend your trying to flag down a waiter.  I suspect things will improve with future updates to the software, but as of now be prepared to get a workout.  It's strange because it worked fine the first day at picking up gestures, but after the second day it only worked 30% of the time.I just recently upgraded to a Nexus 6P and tried installing the software, but failed.  It kept looping in the "reset" your singlecue cycle.  I probably turned the unit on/off 10 times.  Still no luck so I'll probably need to contact CS eventually.  Fortunately I had set it up with my older phone (Samsung Galaxy 5S), but I can imagine a first time user getting very frustrated if he/she were stuck in this loop.I have great hopes for this device.  I use it in conjunction with Amazon's Echo and Harmony's SmartControl Hub to turn on the TV (it's just easier to turn on the TV using voice than gestures at this point) and singlecue to control the TV.  Hopefully the kinks will get ironed out soon.
