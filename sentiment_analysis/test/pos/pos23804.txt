This set is expensive but worth the value for children with Autism or delayed speakers.  It includes several categories for learning.  The first is the object with a white background and then it builds to objects in a natural setting and then similar objects so your child can learn variety.  There is also a section for shapes and color as well as matching items.  My autistic son is 2 and is just learning to speak and these have been a wonderful tool to motivate his speech.  This product is crucial to implementing Applied Behavior Anyalysis.
