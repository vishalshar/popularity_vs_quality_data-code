Still working on this system. I must tell you the customer service is outstanding! Not sure what the problem is but we are working on it as we speak! I keep having glitches with random shots. Could be me with banging clubs together or it could be the defibrillator Installed in my chest that is causing interference. We are sorting all that out now. Again, the support has been tremendous and I am sure we will find the solution to the problems.
