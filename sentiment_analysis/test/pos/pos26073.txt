I was in search of a case that I could carry a couple of credit cards in but didn't increase the size of my phone.  This product fit my needs perfectly, and being made in the USA doesn't help either.  The higher price may be discouraging but I will say I've had it for a year now and have no problems with it at all.  The elastic is starting to deteriorate after a year, but I would think, and will absolutely be investing in another one when I upgrade to the IPhone 7
