A long awaited way to keep all kinds of good cheese, in tip top form. These bags delivered in their promise, as I was able to discover after storing some expensive cheese in the bags. Before, when I purchased in bulk, I had to freeze half of it, and try to use the cheese in the fridge as soon as possible, for it was obvious that each passing day it started to loose its quality. Some of the cheeses that went into the freezer, to name one: Blue Cheese, never was the same when removing from the freezer, letting it thaw again, and consuming again. Something about the quality of this favored cheese would loose most of its attributes.Formaticum Cheese Storage Bags, 15 Count, solved the problem of having to consume cheese at a faster pace before it started going down hill. These pre sliced cheeses that I buy from Costco, with up to 4 varieties of flavor, went each in its own bag, and as the days went by, I discovered, much to my delight, that the quality of the cheese remain consistently good. I also tried the Blue Cheese that I seem to be the only one in our household that definitely likes it, and was pleasantly surprised by the duration, avoiding completely the need to freeze it again. Maybe a little on the expensive side, but really how nice it is to have these bags to preserve them and for that reason I am sold. Would there ever be a time when they can make something similar for cold cuts? For now, very happy with these cheese storage bags because they do work well. 4.5 Stars.
