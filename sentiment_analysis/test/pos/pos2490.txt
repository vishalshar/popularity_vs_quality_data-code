Generally the Roadie works well.  I have one guitar it doesn't work with at all due to the size of the machine head keys.  Occasionally, it freaks out.  For example, it went wild on an acoustic guitar and broke a string by over-tightening so quickly I couldn't stop it in time.  Most of the time it works very well.
