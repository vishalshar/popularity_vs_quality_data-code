Amazing stuff.  I'd consider it just as important to field repairs and modifications as WD40, Ducktape, and Superglue.PRO:-amazing material with tons of uses.-works exactly as described, packaging is completely honest and true.-extremely easy to use. If you can work with polymer clay (sculpey) then you can use this.-nothing to mix, nothing to measure, basically idiot-proof.-Can be removed, but adhesion is quite strong.  I haven't had it come loose unintentionally yet.-Does not displace oil, so, you can lubricate a surface you don't want it to adhere to, and press it against there, leave it to cure. When you come back in a few hours, you can peel it right off without altering the impression.CON:-Expensive.  We're talking about a few teaspoons of material total.-Limited shelf-life.  Store it in the fridge like they recommend, seriously.  The package is small and you'll always know where it is.
