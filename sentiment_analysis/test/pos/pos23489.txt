This thing does work and is fast, no complaints about that aspect at all.... but.... I have a Surface Pro 3 I wanted to use this with, and much to my surprise I found out this drive uses more USB power than the Surface Pro 3 can provide. This drive just doesn't work reliably on the Surface Pro 3 unless you use a powered USB hub, or use a USB 3.0 Y power cable with it. Now I mostly blame Microsoft because they only give you one USB port on the Surface Pro 3, and then make it such a low power port that it won't power up most any USB devices, except for simple memory sticks (which is simply stupid). It is known that the Surface Pro 3 will not power most external hard disk from the built-in USB port due to it being limited to less than 500mA. Since this was a little solid state drive, I really didn't expect it to be drawing much more power than a standard SD memory stick, but apparently it does, so I deducted 1 star because of the higher than expected USB power consumption which means it may not work on some computers without using a powered hub or Y cable.
