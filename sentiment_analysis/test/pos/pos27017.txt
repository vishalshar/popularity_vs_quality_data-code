Comfort - 5 stars. It's a little heavy but the fit is comfortable so it doesn't bother you. Get more comfortable after prolonged use.Sound - 4.5 stars. Output to headphones is great. When connected to mobile, I'd like it to be louder. That's probably for my own good though, I've treated my ears poorly and don't have very good hearing.Mic - 4 stars. picks up sound pretty well and the voicemoniter is subtle and doesn't echo. No static unless you're yelling and the mic is too close. Occasionally mildly cuts out when wired with my PS4. Idk if it's a network connection strength of the PS4 or the headset.Ease of Setup and Use - 5 stars. Very easy and intuitive to figure out on any console. Note that you don't have to use the optical cable when using the USB, but if you don't the chat and game volume will both be controlled by one of the headset dials. This can be adjusted in the quick menu on the PS4, where there is a chat to game audio prioritizing scale in addition to individual adjustments. Dials and buttons make options very easy to feel for and and adjust.Noise cancellation - 2-3 stars. What noise cancellation? It's not a feature that matters to me, but might to other people. Some sound can be heard by others when I'm wearing my headphones, (not more than average headphones on full blast,) and my mic picks up the rustling of my son building legos on the floor, if the chat volume is turned up, And the game volume is minimal, which I think is kind of cool but that indicates how the mic pics up all kinds of sounds.Versatility- 5 stars. can be used wireless and wired on most devices even pc, mobile requires aux cord, PS3 has to be wireless. I also read that the headset works with the wiiu, though it is not optimized for it. You can choose to play all audio through headset or have the game music play through the tv, using the headset just for chat audio. There are only 2 other wireless headsets that I know of that are truely versatile.Battery life - 5 stars. I've not timed it but it lasts forever. charging doesn't seem to take long.Durability - I'll keep you posted. Reviews warn of the charge port coming out of place overtime. Maybe a bit of glue carefully placed could serve as a preventative if you notice it coming loose?A lot of the flaws mentioned in the reviews are found in troubleshooting section on the product websight and are easier to resolve than you might think. (I was baffled why only one dial controlled game + chat, so that's how I came across it.) very helpful. I'll have to find the link.I compared a lot of headphones that fit my needs for subtle appearance, versitility, battery life, and sound quality. Before choosing these, I was tied between these and the steel series Siberia 800 or 840s, but those are 300$+ headsets.Overall not flawless, but more than pleased with all the functions you get for this price. I'm sorry to the folks out there that got defects.
