My FIV positive cat has only been on this supplement for about 2 weeks, but the texture of his fur has changed dramatically in that short amount of time. He is as soft as a bunny now. He also seems to be feeling better, and has more energy. I also started feeding him the seaweed supplement for oral health, and I'm sure that is helping too!
