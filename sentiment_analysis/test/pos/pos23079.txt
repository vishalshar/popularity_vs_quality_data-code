went to macaroni grill once and they had this stuff there, i liked the scent so much i looked it up online later that night to buy it for myself. its pretty expensive, but i say worth it. made from leftover restaraunt oils i think, somehow its recycled, but it leaves hands feeling nice and clean, and the scent is awesome. my girlfriend even wanted some in a bubble bath once haha.
