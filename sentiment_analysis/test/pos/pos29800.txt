My dog has allergies so this is the best food for the Shih Tzu breed , my dog loves this food its packed full of great blueberries and the other nutrients to keep your dog happy. If you love your dog feed it Great Life Dog Chow. This food is fully recommended by Furbaby Rescue where we got our beautiful dog. He is our precious baby and gets the best!
