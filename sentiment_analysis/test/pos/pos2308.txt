Worth the wait. I felt relief within minutes. A bit clumsy but so worth it for long periods of sitting at the computer. If you have knee problems, you may experience difficulty with this device. Sometimes my legs fall asleep and I have to shift. Considering the short-comings, I remain 100% satisfied with my purchase.
