I have an iPhone 6s plus and I couldn't be happier with the purchase of this product. The price point is a little high, however, it is well worth it.The magnet is very strong. I have a cup holder on my dash, that swings out where I keep a bluetooth speaker for my phone and I put the magnet on the front of it. My Subaru is 16 years old, so can't plug my phone into the car speakers. But, this makes a really nice compact space where I have the phone mounted and the speaker together. This serves me well, when I am using my phone as a GPS. The magnet stays stuck even in the Arizona heat. Rokform makes a window mount for this purpose, but I don't need it.The cover gives excellent protection for my phone and I love the idea that the rose color of the phone shows through.
