Pros:Unique designSnappy performanceSuper cheap (at least for now)Fingerprint reader on the power buttonDecent size screen (5.2) I thought it would feel tiny after using my Nexus 6, but it's not too bad and easier to hold lolCon:Robins UI  - you need to use a third party launcher if you want an app drawer and change the look of your iconsThe battery could be better, but it does have quick charging so it's not too bad.
