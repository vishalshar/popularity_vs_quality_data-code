Progo need better quality control. Today is my first day to assemble the progo scooter, and found out that the plastic cover for the throttle is broken. An email was sent to sales@progoscooters.com to see whether I will get the replacement part or not.It is quite noise once start, but I can start it without much efforts. I need find other place to break in of my scooter without complaining from my neighbor. Once running, it is fun though.ok, here is update, Progo sent me replacement part quickly and it is on my scooter now. However, I need say that the quality of the replacement part is just ok.I am still breaking my engine, two things must be done until I can start my engine again: adjust the idle speed and the gap of the spark plug. Apparently progo scooter is not plug (fuel) and play.
