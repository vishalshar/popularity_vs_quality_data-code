This is such a neat little game, both of my kids love it! It has been a great incentive to get them to complete chores. They are 5 and 7 and they both enjoy playing it. The rules are easy to understand and easy to convey to kids. They both sit still the entire game because they are so enthralled with the adventure. I enjoy playing it, too! The animation on the cards and rule book are great, as well.
