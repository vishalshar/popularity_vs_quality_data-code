wonderful product!  very interactive app which provides useful feedback on childhood development beyond just word count.  Simple to use with a convenient interface for tracking and feedback on progress.The product itself is especially suitable for babies <2yrs old as this is the age in which brain development is at its most exponential phase, and where we tend to rely more on baby talk rather than complex language in our communication with them.  For my 2 year old daughter, it took a bit of getting used to for her to wear this since it was not a habit that we had started earlier.  The battery life is great - one charge can go for a week, which makes it easier for the child to get accustomed to since you don't have to take it off to charge.Few products like this exist out there - this is a great one for neurotic parents like myself to try!
