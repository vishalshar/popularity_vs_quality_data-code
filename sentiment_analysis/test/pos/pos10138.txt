I purchased this product to power a high-end digital piano. I use the piano in a location where running an extension cord is not desirable and found the ChargeTech - 27,000mAh portable power outlet to be the perfect solution. A few days after the initial charge was complete I used the keyboard for more than an hour, waited a week, and used it for another hour. At this point the power indicator showed 25% of power remaining. The piano has an internal amp and speaker system drawing 50-60 Hz and 140 W. Based on some other reviews I was skeptical about the ChargeTech handling this kind of application - but it has exceeded my expectations and I am very happy with the product as a portable AC outlet.
