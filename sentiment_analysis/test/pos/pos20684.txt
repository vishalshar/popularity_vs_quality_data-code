I absolutely love my iOttie MiGo Selfie Stick.  It seems to be a good ergonically designed, very portable, accommodates a good size smartphone and there was no problem connecting the Bluetooth with a smartphone.  Definitely a compact tool to take for quick and accurate selfie picture taking when traveling.
