Honestly this is the neatest thing ever. It prints great quality photos which can be a Polaroid photo or if you peel the back off you can use it as a sticker. You can select photos from your gallery or through the prynt app. One of the best parts is that if you want you can attach a video to the photo that will play when the photo is scanned, and I think that is great. Also, the print is so much cheaper than Polaroid film. Typically, for Polaroid film you'll pay $20 for 25 sheets of film, while with this you only pay $20 and you get 40 sheets of film. The case doesn't die fast either. You'd have to print at least 20 photos consistently for it to just die. It's a lovely product and I think it would be a great gift for anyone.
