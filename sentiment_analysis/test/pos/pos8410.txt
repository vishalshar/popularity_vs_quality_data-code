I love this speaker.  My girlfriend and I bought it to listen to music by the pool.  It sounds amazing!  Customer service is great too.  I was clumsy and dropped the speaker off of the top of my book shelf.  It still worked but it had problems holding a charge.  They exchanged it for a new one.  I'm excited to see the 30w speaker they are coming out with.
