These bags are a miracle!  I bought a couple boxes about 3 months ago, and they work great.  I had never seen these before.  You just put the cheese, unwrapped, in the bag, fold over the top, and refrigerate.  The cheese never molds or dries out.  They work great for blocks and slices.  I have kept cheese for several weeks with no problems.  There is a place to write the type of cheese and date on the exterior.  I will never use plastic wrap again!
