This has been the most helpful tool in helping me manage and overcome my anxiety and PTSD by proving a continuous feedback that has allowed me to take action immediately and switch gears faster than any other tool or technique I've ever used. Currently, I am seeing a therapist once a week, seeing a hypnotherapist once a week, taking a percribed anti depressant, taking 4 different types of all natura anti depressants, working out 6 days a week, eat healthy, meditate twice daily, pray, journal, use mandalas, tapping (EFT), read, and listen to subliminal programming. Other than medication, this resource has been the most effective because it has allowed me to immediately address my situation and deal with it all throughout the day, when conditions first arise rather than deal with it after it has festered or on a limited basis. This product has been a God send. Thank you!
