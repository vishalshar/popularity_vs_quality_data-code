I have tried a dozen baby monitors and this is superior to everything I've tried. It allows me to view from outside the home which was mandatory. The clarity is perfect even at night. Very clear picture. It allows me to take photos, video and communicate as well as play music from my phone. It doesn't come with a monitor which was fine by me because I use an audio only monitor over night since they are the most reliable. I highly recommend this cam.
