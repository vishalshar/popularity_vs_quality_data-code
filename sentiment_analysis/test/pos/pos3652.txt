I was delighted with my code&quill. It really does lay flat and the pages feel just right for notes, random thoughts, diagrams, and details. The soft cover protects  and is flexible. I know I can get by with the less expensive composition notebooks, yet, in this digital age, a well make notebook can lure me back to the reality of the world around me.  I will be buying there new three pack of pocket notes and another Traveler Notebook soon.
