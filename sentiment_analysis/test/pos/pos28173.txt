First off - read the instructions. I cooked the first batch by just dropping chunks of dough on the sheet and got a poor result. Flattening them as per the instructions made a huge difference.For prep, no surprises. I opted to go the melted butter route. Melt butter, whip in an egg and some vanilla, add package contents and mix until it turns into paste. It took all of 90 seconds including melting the butter in the microwave. The dinner fork that whipped the egg also mixed the dough. Super easy.The dough itself is OK but there's absolutely no danger of eating all the dough before baking the cookies. A few forkfuls is plenty.After eating some of the dough, I got 15 cookies. I make 'em big I guess.First sheet was just chunks of dough dropped on the sheet and cooked. That's how I'm used to baking cookies - just drop the chunks and they'll spread out on their own. The cookies did not spread out and I ended up with cookie-clumps that were not very good to eat. Way too crumbly, not crunchy. A quick read of the instructions revealed that you're supposed to spread out the dough chunks. My bad.Second sheet, instructions followed, made unexpectedly decent cookies. Crunchy and not crumbly. They taste fine, like light chocolate chip cookies. If you're looking for really rich flavorful cookies, these aren't them. These taste light which is its own little pleasure. I washed the whole batch down with milk and called it dinner.
