First, this is ***great value*** especially with delivery to my front door for "free".  Less expensive than buying from national pet food chain.We eat very cleanly (humane, non-GMO, pastured, fermented, raw).  UNFORTUNATELY, our two 11-year-old rescued gray tabbies do not like any of the organic or dehydrated foods.  And will only eat human food sometimes.  Solid Gold is one of the foods we rotate in and out of.What I like is that there's foods we humans eat for good health.  The addition of "dried" fermented supplements is something I always look for.My cats have been able to maintain healthy weight and lots of "kitten" energy by eating "real" cat food (that is, grain free, no fillers, etc.).Why I don't like potatoes or rice in my pet foods...it's pretty much SUGAR they way it digests.  I'd rather they get something with much more nutritional value, such as sweet potatoes or pumpkin. My cats get lethargic (just like humans do) when they eat cat foods with too many carbs/sugar (not to mention weight gain).Solid Gold Chicken & Egg INGREDIENTS:Chicken Meal, Potatoes, Canola Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols), Peas, Chicken, Ocean Fish Meal, Dried Eggs, Natural Flavors, Pea Protein, Choline Chloride, Potassium Chloride, Taurine, DL-Methionine, Salmon Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols), L-Carnitine, Dried Chicory Root, Carrots, Pumpkin, Apples, Cranberries, Blueberries, Broccoli, Parsley, Spearmint, Almond Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols), Sesame Oil (preserved with mixed Tocopherols), Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Kelp, Thyme, Lentils, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Zinc Sulfate, Niacin, Ferrous Sulfate, L-Ascorbyl-2-Polyphosphate (Source of Vitamin C), Calcium Pantothenate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Copper Sulfate, Riboflavin, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Manganese Sulfate, Zinc Proteinate, Folic Acid, Calcium Iodate, Manganese Proteinate, Copper Proteinate, Sodium Selenite, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Rosemary Extract, Dried Lactobacillus Acidophilus Fermentation Product, Dried Enterococcus Faecium Fermentation Product, Dried Lactobacillus Casei Fermentation Product.
