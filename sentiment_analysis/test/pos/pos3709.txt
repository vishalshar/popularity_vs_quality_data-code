Update: It's been a month now and they are still shining bright all night.  Going to buy a couple more.I've only had these for a week so far but they have worked great right out of the box.  They have lasted all night, I leave for work at 5:00am and they are still shining bright.  The only reason I've given 4 stars instead of 5 is the price.  Love them so far and will most likely get some more.
