Music has always been a passion of mine. As a guitar player (my favorite being my Gibson Les Paul Studio), sound quality is king when I'm listening to music. Whether I'm listening through  headphones, computer speakers, or most recently with the RIVA Turbo X Bluetooth speaker, I look for sound quality first. Apparently RIVA looks for sound quality first also, because this thing sounds incredible.The warmth and clarity of the sound is nothing short of incredible. And, it sounds great even when you turn the volume up- which is ridiculously loud at full volume. Plenty loud enough to use outside in the backyard or at the beach. I also can't believe the amount of bass that comes out of that little box. But again, it's not just loud muddy bass, it's warm and clear. My ears don't feel tired after listening to it for extended periods of time.I've shown the Turbo X to friends, and played songs for them that they had heard a million times before. Or at least they thought they had. One in particular said "I've never heard that song like that before", noting details they never noticed before hearing a song on the Turbo X.I love that it feels sturdy and high quality, I love that it sounds incredible, I love that I can take it with me on the go, I love that I can connect it to my iPad, Android phone, pc, and TV, and I love that it has a 26 hour battery life. I cannot express how much I absolutely recommend this speaker. If you're thinking about getting a Bluetooth speaker, get the RIVA Turbo X, you won't regret it, and you'll be amazed at how enjoyable it is, and how it brings vibrancy, life and fun back to music, movies and more.
