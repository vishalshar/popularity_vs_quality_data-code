Love Love LOVE these headphones. Had them for about two months so far an no problems at all! I'm an avid gym goer and part time runner. They have great bass for the price. I've gone for runs when its started to rain and had no problems with rain or sweat. The inside is like this soft plastic/rubber that does not absorb sweat (I was worried about them smelling). They look awesome, anytime I see someone wearing over the head headphones I assume they are beats, and people have stared hard trying to figure out what brand they are! I've had experience with other wireless/wired workout headphones, cant beat the quality for the price. If I sit on them and snap them I wont be that upset!Pros:-Awesome sound for the price-Microphone on the headphone actually works really well-Can be wireless OR wired if you forget to charge it-Easily linked to device-Forward/back and volume control on the right side of the headphonesCons:-Maybe its just the shape of my head but if you bend over too fast they can fall off (think back extensions, fast pushups)
