I've had the Petzi Treat Cam for a little over a week now. It has operated as promised. Showed the live video of my two dogs to everybody I work with or come into contact with. Video is real clear but freezes every once and a while. I,be always thought that my dogs sleep most of the day and now I know it is true. I have only tested the device within 20 miles from my house. Don't see any reason it won't perform the same no matter where I am located.
