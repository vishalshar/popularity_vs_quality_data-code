These treats, although made by the same manufacturers, in the exact same packaging,identical bags, are not what is being sold in the grocery store!  I confused my pup so badly with the choices of the "same" product, he will no longer entertain the idea of eating any of them.  Is there a reason for the drastic difference in product?
