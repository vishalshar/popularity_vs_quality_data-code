I wrote this review after I'd purchased a card from this page of a red pirate ship. Now the page only has a bird's nest card for sale. Sorry about that, because it certainly could be confusing to the reader.///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////original review:It is hard to describe how cool this card is without close up photos.The pirate ship itself is about 5" high and 6 ˝" long. The detail is amazing. There's a cut-out of the skull & crossbones on both the large flag in the back and the smaller flag flying from the mast. On the upper deck is the fearsome pirate captain brandishing his sword. He stands by his golden pirate chest, also branded with his skull & crossbones.In the crow's nest is a sailor peering through his spyglass, searching for the ship's next prey!The total card measures 6" x 8 3/8". It folds very flat  it is surprising how little bulk the pirate ship makes when it folds up.  The front of the card has a pirate cut-out that sets the tone.The envelope is of heavier cardstock than the usual card. Great for protecting your amazing card in the mail. Extra postage is needed.It was a pleasure to mail this off to my brother. You'll see that there isn't any kind of specific printed greeting on the card, so you can use it for any occasion you want.Happy Reader
