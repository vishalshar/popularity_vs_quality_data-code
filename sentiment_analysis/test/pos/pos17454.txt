I decided to purchase 4 of these to spread throughout different rooms. Initially, I had a little trouble connecting to my wifi, but once I got the phone position correct the rest worked on the first or second try. Three of the units worked for me, while one was failing entirely. Roost technical support was fantastic throughout the entire process. They shipped me a replacement battery and returned the failed one.The only real issue I had run into was that the units were not consistently detecting the test smoke alarm sound from my older smoke detectors. Here's where I learned something. I had seven 20+ year old smoke detectors in the house, and the recommended replacement age is 10 years. I know that's only recommended, but they were way past their time. After discussing the issue with tech support, I felt that replacing the units was definitely required. After upgrading to a combination of single and dual sensor First Alert and Kidde's, the Roost batteries now always detect the test alarms - which I test periodically just to feel a little better about the technology.The initial version of the phone app I used was a little less helpful. It only showed a green icon for the battery, but nothing to really tell you when it last connected, etc. That was fixed in the most recent release. Now I can clearly see when each unit checks in daily.Ideally I'll never have to rely on these to tell me my house is on fire, but I feel a lot better knowing that I can be alerted to smoke in my garage and some other rooms, even when I'm not home.Caveats:* Only supports 2.4Ghz wifi
