while searching for an accessory for my cycling needs, i ran into this phone and it immediately caught my attention. i have always been on the lookout for a mp3 player i can bring with me when cycling and this looked like it fit the bill and more so i ordered one and it was delivered the same dayThe good -perfect size for my need - fits in the coin pocket of my jeans without having to deal with the bulk of a regular phone. The screen is bright enough and while not as responsive as my Galaxy S7, it is responsive enough to use daily. Apps can be downloaded from the Play store and in one case where Play said my phone wasn't compatible (Mountain Bike Pro) i was able to sideload it and it works fine.  The sound was surprisingly good for something this size and works flawlessly with my bluetooth headset and speaker.Downloaded a driving game and it was a blast - smooth playback and responsiveThe bad - the keyboard for inputting is too small but downloading a big keyboard app help this. On some apps the text are too big and you can't read the whole thing due to the small screen. The bluetooth had no issues pairing with one device but if i try to pair with another device it seems to have a problem unless i unpair the first deviceNet Feedback4 stars for me - i like it so much i ended up buying 3 more to give out to my family. We now use it as our navigation + music player while cycling. Plus with it's phone capabilities, we are all within reach.Cool Tip 1We all loaded AmpMe - and now we can play the same playlist at the same time for a surround sound experience while cycling as a groupCool Tip 2installed GVS gesutre launcher, let's you draw on the screen to launch apps, shortcuts - works well in this small screen
