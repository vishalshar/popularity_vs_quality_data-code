Neat little adapter for my MacBook Air to allow for the addition of extra storage space. It slides easily into the SD Card slot, has some resistance when removing so that it doesnt easily fall out. I currently have a 200GB card in there and it mounts up just fine and can add and remove files to the card with ease.Removing the card can be a bit of a chore and it sometimes feels like your nail is going to break off, but eventually it comes out.*01/12/2016 UPDATE - The memory shows up as an SD card, I have not been able to find a way to tie this into my Hard Drive storage.
