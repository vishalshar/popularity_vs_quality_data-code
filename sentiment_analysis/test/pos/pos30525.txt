I am a smart home/devices geek. This one is little outside the norm of what I normally would get. Having said that, its a great product and does what is claimed. I also like the fact that I will receive notifications on my phone, for any event in the house...good for peace of mind.Now, a little more. When I 1st got the device, it took a while to try and connect and setup. It failed after several attempts, thats when I found out that the smart module had an issue. Customer support was terrific, super responsive, courteous and addressed the issue by sending me an updated smart module. The new module worked like a charm.Issues happen, thats when you know about the all aspects of the company. It was clear that Roost stand by their products, value their customers and work hard to make things right.I can't wait to see what other products the bring to market. I will be sure to try them out.
