We bought 4 URB-Es for our hotel, The Lenox Hotel, in Boston. We bought them because our staff travels to different locations throughout Boston, and buying URB-Es turned out to be far less expensive and much more eco-friendly than taking Ubers and Taxis everywhere, and far faster than walking (with Boston traffic, often faster than a car as well!). URB-E turned out to be the perfect cost and time saver to enable our team to travel throughout Boston in an eco-friendly fashion. They are extremely high quality, something our team literally depends on, and we're thankful such a smart product was developed here in America. Their Pasadena based team also provides excellent customer service. We are excited to partner with a maverick of the green lifestyle! Attached is a photo of Scot, our Director of Sustainability, folding our URB-E in front of the hotel. We recommend this product for other urban properties.
