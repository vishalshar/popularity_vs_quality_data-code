(Writing this review before having received the product to combat the 1 star review, will update with video, pictures, and full review once the product is received. Bellow are my reasons for purchasing)I have just bought two of these one for my self and one for my brother.Here are my main reasons for getting this watch:- A watch that could still act as a watch (Always on)- Connectivity to your phone etc and ability to do the "Smart side"- Battery life far greater than any other competitor- Durability, I will be swimming, sleeping, and running with the watch.- Tried and tested, what Pebble does it does well, this can be seen in their previous products- Affordable, I can happily drop the money on this watch compared to its competitors that are many times the price- Efficiency and reliability, the Pebble OS and apps are more tried and tested.Aesthetics of the watch:If you don't like the E-Ink display or the black and white screen then this is not the watch for you.I'm a fan of the E-Ink easier to read in the daylight and is also a core reason for the watches battery life far suppressing competitors out there.Feel:TBACompetitors:I bought this watch because I know what I'm getting. The reason I did not go for many of the other choices out there was just that they seemed too experimental and susceptible to changes. Look up any of the Pebbles competitors and you'll find huge problems that might have never been fixed.  The other competitors did not do well with the Bang for your buck when it comes to features they do and the price. Right now you have to be selective with smart watches, there is no perfect smart watch out there in the market that does everything and at a good price.For me the Pebble has the most amount of features I wanted at an affordable price, that's why I picked it.I just wanted a smart-watch that does what it says it's meant to do and does it well.
