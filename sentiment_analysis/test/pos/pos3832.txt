The GlocalMe is everything that I've been looking for. I do a lot of international travel.Throughout the years, I found it to be troublesome to keep buying random SIM cards, only for them to expire before my next visit to that country.I don't need to search for the nearest WiFi hotspot.It is best for sending & checking emails, messages, what's app. I also use it map my journeys on which ever country I'm in, using Google Maps.The packages are decently priced, and last a while if used only when you need it. I would not recommend streaming or downloading with it.GlocalMe takes out the hassle of worrying about using multiple SIM cards. It connects to many countries.
