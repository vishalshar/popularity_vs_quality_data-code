My dog loves this treat. I like it because I can actually see the salmon in the jerky.  It is not filled with binders and grains, no soy, corn or wheat. I finally found a replacement for the dreaded chicken jerky. This product is made in the USA. I've order thie jerky three times already.  May get the bigger bag the next order.
