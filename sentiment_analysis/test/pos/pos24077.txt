February 2016:  As you can see from the review below, I didn't start off well with Shine, in fact, lost it the first week (but later found it, slightly dinged up but still functional).  I wrote to Misfit, not in the best frame of mind, I might add, and they have been fantastic in their response.  Nadine contacted me right away, apologized, and promised to fix it. About a month later, I got a new Shine 2 with a better mounting, in fact, I haven't had a single problem with it popping out in a month.  So now I can enjoy the great features of this awesome device without worrying about losing it:1.  Nice design.  Elegant, simple, I get compliments about it.  People are surprised to learn it's a fitness tracker.2.  Simplicity.  I only need to know two things on my wrist:  1) How far have I progressed toward my fitness goals, and 2) what time is it?  The Shine 2 answers both with a simple double-tap.3.  Great app.  The iPhone app is completely intuitive, displays info in a helpful way, and just works.4.  Battery.  One little flat battery runs this thing for six months.  No recharging!  As a result, it is literally never off my wrist.5. Value.  $99.  Are you kidding me?I could go on and on, but the bottom line is that Misfit turned me from a raving manic to a raving fan, and I"m very happy to endorse the product and the company unequivocally.  If you want a great tracker at a reasonable price, this is it.This timeline tells you all you need to know:MONDAY:  Did the research, loved what I heard about Shine 2 and ignored the people who said the wrist band was iffy :(TUESDAY: Got it and loved it immediately. So easy to set up and use, the iPhone app is awesome. Really supercharged my fitness activities, I started taking the long way everywhere I walked.WEDNESDAY: Love the look, very sleek, very cool time feature. Getting into the sleep tracker, it does a great job analyzing your sleep patterns.THURSDAY: Learned how to maximize Shine 2 readings on the elliptical (you have to move your arms to make it work). Totally into this thing.FRIDAY: Walked to coffee, checked my fitness, walked back to office (2 blocks) and it's gone.  Lost.  A short walk and $99 down the drain.The wrist band is the problem. Just a thin strap of stretchable plastic, with a totally ineffective clip on the back that supposedly makes it less prone to loss. Laughably inadequate even for walking, let alone any vigorous activity. I pity the poor person who's planning to swim with this, keep your eyes on the bottom of the pool.BOTTOM LINE: If you want a week of the best fitness tracking ever, buy this.  Otherwise, look around for something that won't fall off your wrist for at least TWO weeks.I'm calling Misfit today so I'll update this review once I talk to them.December 28 (two weeks after original review):See my response to question below. In short, they are promising a new mounting free once they have it. I have to say that Misfit seems to be taking this to heart. I upgraded my review a star and will continue to update this review as events play out.  Meanwhile, using the hack I posted (the shooter's sleeve) has relieved much of my Shine anxiety.Just as a personal comment, I've been through this sort of thing with so many new products I've lost count.  I really don't judge a company by their first product releases, they are ALWAYS f----ed up.  What I care about is how they respond.  Misfit is on the verge of winning me over but to do so, they have to deliver.  It's all about the execution, baby...
