So far so good!  It has been working reliably for a few months now.I guess my only ruff is that the battery indications seem to work off of a timer, which is kinda lame.  So you get a notification that there "should be" 20% battery left.  Then you change the batteries and it doesn't know that there are new batteries so you have to tell it that you changed the batteries.Overall, I'd buy again.
