I have had this tracker about a month, I like it a lot.  When I first got it had a little trouble syncing, but once that was resolved it was fine. I wear it on my right wrist at night,it seems to record sleep better on the right.  Wish I could get the gold necklace but it is out of stock at this time.  The band fits me fine.
