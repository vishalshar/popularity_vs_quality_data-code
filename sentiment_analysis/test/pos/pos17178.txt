This speaker shines when placed in the middle of a room or group of people, taking advantage of its small size and 360 degree sound projection. We use it on a kitchen island,  or even on the dinner table. Battery life, sound, and durability are outstanding.If you plan to use the speaker in a fixed position, where you will always sit with the speaker facing you, I would select the soundlink mini or another high quality speaker that projects in one direction.None of these speakers have real bass. Those who own powered home theater subwoofers understand the power and size of speaker required to create true bass. The soundlink mini has a deeper sound, but buying any one of these portable speakers expecting bass will lead to disappointment.---------------------edit: adding comment 3/15/15.Our unit had a problem and would no longer charge. Contacted customer support and was able to receive a replacement unit. Customer support was excellent and fast. I would now rate this product even higher knowing the high quality of their support team.
