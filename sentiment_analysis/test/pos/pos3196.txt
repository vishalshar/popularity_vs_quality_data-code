I don't know what the reviewers are taking about when they review this case. This is one of the best iPhone cases I've ever used and I've used a lot of them. I found Rokform a few years ago when I decided to find the best iPhone case on the market, which at the time was their aluminum Fusion case that you could drive over with a car. I didn't do that but I certainly it that case through some tough beatings. I also got tons of comments on how cool it looked. When I got my iPhone 6, I bought their new plastic Crystal case, which I loved for its slimness and it still offered great protection. I wanted a change so I started looking at what Rokform has next. I found this case and it is the perfect blend of the toughness of their aluminum case but with the slender profile of their Crystal case. The plastic feels great and is super tough.  What surprised me what the superior fit on the phone. The fit of tight but all the buttons work perfectly and Rokform added raised icons on the buttons so you can feel what you are about to push (a shortcoming on the first generation Crystal case). Some have complained that the bezel of this case doesn't wrap around the screen enough. They don't realize that Rokform engineered this bezel slim because the corners are reinforced and raised so that when your phone is face down, the screen is always elevated, touching nothing. Then the case still has the amazing magnet or locking backplane. The case has the toughness of an Otterbox without all the bulk. Super slim and tough. Excellent work Rokform.
