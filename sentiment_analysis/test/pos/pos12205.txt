These are great! They are sturdy enough to put upside down and have enough ventilation to let the bristles dry faster. The only reason I held back from giving it 5 stars is because they seem to get dirty easily. Also, the bristles sometimes get smashed too much that they deform the brush and get stuck in a teardrop state. Other then that, I really love these!
