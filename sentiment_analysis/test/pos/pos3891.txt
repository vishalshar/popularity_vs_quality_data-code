I've been using thermal imagers professionally for about 30 years.  This Seek unit isn't anywhere close to a state-of-the-art military/tactical, laboratory or commercial unit today.  But, for a cheap, tiny plug-in for the bottom of my new Android phone, it's extremely impressive - I would have thought it had been delivered from an alien spaceship less than 10 years ago (By comparison, I've been expecting real smartphones since before the Apple Newton).  I haven't really used its new near-price competition, the new FLIR C2 or the 2nd gen FLIR One extensively yet, but I'm far more impressed with this unit than the first generation FLIR One (iPhone 5 caddy form factor).  Last year, I was impressed enough with the original FLIR One that I nearly bought an iPhone 5 just to get one (as much as I like and respect FLIR, I'm glad I decided to procrastinate).First, the image resolution: if you're used to multi-megapixel digital photo cameras, forget about it - that's not what you're getting with the Seek, or any other thermal in a price range less than a Tesla (or two or three, or twenty).  Thermal is about 20 years behind that, dollar for dollar  (image worse than the first Nikon digital I bought back in '93-'94). However, the resolution is about four times what you'd get with the 1st gen FLIR One's Lepton imager.  The Seek image is very, very pixelated, and the long time constant video averaging requires one to hold it it very steady or the image will smear (think 1/4 - 1/2 second hand-held still exposure steady on a conventional camera).  Unlike FLIR's visual/thermal overlay (patented MSX), Seek requires you to swipe back and forth between the thermal and the camera's visual camera images in the app. You can capture visual or thermal, or half and half, but not one on top of the other.  The result is a better thermal image and a better visual image on the Seek that may not look quite as good as the FLIR's MSX overlay as a captured snapshot.  Some of my colleagues think the FLIR MSX approach is better at this price point.  I disagree for now, but I can understand their argument.Having a pretty low general opinion of the current state of what passes for software engineering, and even lower of Android apps, I can say that the Seek app is better than most Android apps I've used, especially at this level of maturity and adoption (its adoption isn't even a rounding error compared to a Google app).  It installed cleanly on my new Moto G 2nd gen with Lollipop (the cheapest smartphone platform I could find that might support it, as my previous Nexus 4 would not).  It hasn't crashed or locked-up, and it cleanly sends captured images to G-mail or Bluetooth.  The visual/thermal swap feature is useful, as are the various color palates ("Iron" looks cool on ads, and in reports, but I've always used gray scale for serious work).  I don't like the inability to set gain or freeze the AGC (something the new FLIR's app can apparently do), but I can live with that at this price point (for the time being).  Thermal differential sensitivity in a low contrast scene seems to be pretty good - I'll take Seek's claim of about  0.1 degrees C as about right.  I don't expect this to be a calibrated radiometer, or to use it as a substitute for a high quality imager for point medical screening, so I'm not going to get wrapped-up with actual vs. reported temperature values in the app (and no one wants to read a discourse on emissivity variations).  I hope Seek (and FLIR) will have emissivity adjustments and calibration methods in the not-too-distant future (and some education, as I see a lot of misunderstanding and inflated expectation in some of the posts/reviews).As a usability note: I lucked out with the Moto G 2nd gen; it wasn't listed as "supported" when I bought it, although the 1st gen G was, as was the Moto X, 1st and 2nd gen.  I also lucked out that the USB is oriented in a way that the Moto's visual camera is pointed in the same direction as the Seek, so that a back-and-forth overlay or split is easy.  Not sure I'd be quite as happy if I found that I had to use one of the extension USB cables to orient it with one hand, while holding the phone with the other.Finally, the imager comes with a cute, really well-designed and constructed hard little carrying case.  I can thrown it in my briefcase, backpack or cargo pant pocket, and not even think about it.  Nice touch!Bottom line: for those with a realistic understanding of the current state-of-the-art, this is amazing.  If you want to get into the world of thermal imaging at a really reasonable price point, or you're just looking for a cool toy that's about the same price as a high-end 802.11 AC router, it's worth giving this a try.  If you wait six months or a year, there will probably be something better.  But, you'd probably still be using a typewriter and a Western Electric phone if that was the #1 consideration.
