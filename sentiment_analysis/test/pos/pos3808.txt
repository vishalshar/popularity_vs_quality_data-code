I am leasing land and did not want to put in a fence. I love the wireless fence. My 2 little dogs love having the space to roam. They even seem better behaved. They get excited when I put the collar on because they know they can go out. One of my dogs would constantly get out and chase bicycles and motorcycles. He now calmly watches them go by. People who come over even talk about the behavior change. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.
