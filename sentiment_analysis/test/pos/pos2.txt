I was *super* skeptical about this. I fully expected to have to return it. I've had chronic pain for as long as I can remember. I've tried everything imaginable but nothing helps. I thought the strap wouldn't help with stomach cramps since it was on my leg. After throwing up from pain the other day I decided I might as well try Quell. Even a little bit of relief would be more than worth it.When a surge of pain began, I strapped it on and set it up with a pretty high tolerance level. I decided not to take my pain med to get a real sense of what it could do.I went about my business, letting it run its cycle. After half an hour I realized I'd forgotten I needed a pain pill and the pain had subsided. Okay. I did NOT want to get excited. It could be a coincidence or fluke. I've seen pain specialists and tried all kinds of things and this is just a gizmo I saw on Amazon. Its got to be in my head.I've now used it for 2 days, every time I have a surge in pain. I was actually able to go grocery shopping...something I could never do after an "attack" started. I'm now convinced this thing actually works. (If anything changes, I'll update my review). Sometimes it works really well, other times it's minor. Either way though, I would have taken out a loan to get this. If you don't have chronic pain, you probably can't comprehend how any kind of relief is priceless.NOTE: It does not completely make all pain go away, but it dials it down a noticeable amount. For me, that's worth the world. I have it on a high tolerance, so at times I have to turn it down because it will slightly sting (kind of like a pricking feeling). But for the most part, it kind of feels like after your leg falls asleep and you wake it up and it has that tingly feeling - it's just a pinpointed area that has that feeling. It's not painful or anything, but you know it's there.If you have chronic pain, I would highly recommend trying this. It essentially tricks your brain and tells it to knock it off with the pain signals.
