Just finished my second bottle of Coffiest and usually have a bottle of Soylent 2.0 every work day for lunch.  They are great for a quick lunch, which as a teacher, I find as a definite necessity.  Coffiest for me provides a nice change in flavor from the bland taste of regular Soylent.  The flavor is definitely similar to mocha with a blend of dark cocoa powder/dark coffee taste.  Will you loose weight drinking this? Only if you are already tracking calories as it guarantees a 400 calorie meal that has a nutrient balance.  I'll be buying another case when this one runs out.
