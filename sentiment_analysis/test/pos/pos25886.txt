I've owned a Pebble since the first run came out, and I love it. This one follows in its footsteps of being great without being pathetically restrictive to one platform.Now, the bad news. As other reviews state, the company is defunct. Should anything happen to your new Pebble 2, you're totally dependent upon Amazon's return policy. For now the Pebble platform, with its faces/apps, is being kept alive but there is no promise of upkeep into the future.Here's the email I received as an "update" from the Kickstarter (I paid in $300 for a Time 2 and Core, which I'll never receive and likely won't receive a refund for, either), and you can see why backers and fans are absolutely livid over the kiss-off:(copied from Kickstarter update, only edited to preserve formatting, not content)The Time of Our LivesPosted by Pebble Technology (Creator)Anyone familiar with Team Pebble knows full well: keeping quiet isnt our style.We love sharing Pebbles story with youwhether its a new product, fresh feature, or simply staying in touch online and in person. Aside from announcing Pebbles 4.3 software updates, our silence over the past month was deafening and out-of-characterwere sorry for that.Today, were breaking that silence. Join us as we close one chapter and invite you along for whats next. We hope to answer as many questions as possible here, in our formal announcement, and on our Support site.Pebble is joining FitbitFitbit has agreed to acquire key Pebble assets. Due to various factors, Pebble can no longer operate as an independent entity, and we have made the tough decision to shut down the company. The deal finalized today preserves as much of Pebble as possible.Pebble is ceasing all hardware operations. We are no longer manufacturing, promoting, or selling any new products. Active Pebble models in the wild will continue to work.Pebbles expertise, philosophy, and culture will live on at Fitbit. Much of our team and resources will join Fitbit to deliver new moments of awesome in future Fitbit products, developer tools, and experiences. As our transition progresses, well have exciting new stories to tell and milestones to celebrate.Its a bittersweet time, no doubt. Well miss what were leaving behind, but are excited for what the future holds. It will be important for Pebblers to extend a warm welcome to Fitbitas fans and customerssharing what they love about Pebble and what theyd like to see next.Kickstarter BackersBackers will get refunds for any unfulfilled rewards. After a successful crowdfunding campaign, we were excited to bring Pebble 2, Time 2, and Core to the world. Weve since shipped every Pebble 2 possible, but cant say the same for the remaining rewards. Pebble Time 2, Pebble Core, and Pebble Time Round Kickstarter Editions will not go into final production.Kickstarter will refund eligible pledges by March 2017.  -No further action is needed. Eligible backers will automatically be refunded their pledges for any unfulfilled Pebble rewards (Time 2, Core, Time Round), plus any shipping, taxes, or duties paid.  -The small number of Pebble 2 backers who did not submit the information required to finalize their reward shipments will also be refunded.  - Successfully-received Pebble 2 rewards are the only item not eligible for a Kickstarter pledge refund.  -Backers who ordered add-on Pebble devices to their Pledge Portals after the campaign closed may have seen a temporary authorization charge, which reversed automatically a few days later.  -Refunds are automatically issued to the payment card the original Kickstarter pledge was placed with.  -If the original pledge payment method is no longer active, backers must contact the financial institution that issued the card to receive the returned funds.  -Backers outside of the United States will receive refunds equal to the $USD amount of their pledges at current exchange rates. There will be no adjustments to account for exchange rate fluctuations between the original pledge payment and the upcoming refund.  -Visit kickstarter.com/contact with any additional questions.Current Pebble UsersActive Pebble watches will work normally for now. Functionality or service quality may be reduced down the road. We dont expect to release regular software updates or new Pebble features. Our new mission will focus on bringing Pebbles unique wearables expertise to future Fitbit products. Were also working to reduce Pebble's reliance on cloud services, letting all Pebble models stay active long into the future.One-to-one Pebble support is no longer available.

Users looking to troubleshoot their Pebbles can still visit our Help Portal and community resources:  -help.pebble.com  -The Pebble Community Forum  -r/Pebble on Reddit  -If you have any other questions about Pebbles wind-down of operations, please visit this page.Those who ordered and received a Pebble from pebble.com are no longer eligible for return or exchange.
