I've owned it for a few months.  Very impressive stand alone, and much more impressive with the control offered by mobile devices.  Like anything that offers a multitude of controls, it can be a little intimidating if you fixate on all the adjustments available.  But, you don't have to.  Various presets and downloadable tones makes it pretty easy.  Or, fiddle with the settings yourself.  It seems easy.  I like the sound and power very much.  I've had zero trouble with iPhone or iPad bluetooth pairing.  It just works.  For those who have had any trouble I respectfully suggest they download the latest firmware.  But, mine worked just fine with older firmware too.
