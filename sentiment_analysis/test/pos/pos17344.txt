I love cheese.I mean I really love cheese... specifically your clothbound cheddars and your wensleydales.The worst thing is to go to Whole Foods, take your time picking out a $20+ cheese only to go home and have them harden, deteriorate in texture and taste the very next day because of the whole foods butcher paper.Cheese paper works. My Jasper Hill Cabot Clothbound Cheddar stays frim and craggly, just like it was meant to.My only minor complaint is that now that I label my cheese, I can see how much cheese I eat and how quickly...it aint pretty folks.
