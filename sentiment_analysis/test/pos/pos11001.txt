This is actually pretty amazing, just not *quite* as strong as I was hoping for. If the item broke because of rough use (i.e. my daughter's headphones, my daughter's charger cables, a few random electronic devices owned by my daughter) then it is only a temporary solution. Everything that I have fixed myself (broken plastic connector for laundry rack, several iphone cables, phone/gps holder for car) is holding strong. As long as you are not a teenager hell bent on breaking everything you own, this is a great solution and  very easy to use.
