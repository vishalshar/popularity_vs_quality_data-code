My big dogs enjoyed these bones.  I didn't care for them as they broke easily into small bone bits across the floor.  They are also greasy.  Be careful serving these to small dogs as the bones will splinter and potentially harm a small dog.  Let the dogs eat these outside in the grass or on a patio under full supervision. Unlike regular soup or rib bones, my dogs were able to crack the bones easily and get to the bone marrow, creating far less waste, but leaving sharp bone fragments on the floor.
