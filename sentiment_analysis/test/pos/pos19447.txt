This set is amazing!  I am a pediatric OT and absolutely love this set.  It is great for perceptual skills, discrimination when locating letters from a group, hand eye coordination, motor planning, spatial relations using tangagrams, and cooperative play.  What a great addition to ipad activities for kids!
