I've been using Arccos Driver for about seven months now, and have had a pretty good experience on my iPhone. I've been hovering around a 7 handicap, and have been wanting to get better, I decided to upgrade to a full set to get the whole view of my game. Looked at all the different options out there, and even tried my friend's system with those red tags and the belt clip. I decided overall, Arccos still offers the best experience out of the bunch, and bought a set.The upgrade has been totally worth it. It has a much lower profile than the old design, and feels lighter. The amount of data you collect using these sensors are priceless. I have played about 9 rounds with these, and am pleased to see all the distances on my clubs, and what my tendencies are on the course - I may have had a feel for it, but now I can see it with data... and it does not lie (unfortunately, sometimes). Side by side, the website to analyze your rounds is light years ahead of what my friend uses.I now know what I need to focus on during my practice sessions (my driving and sand game is good, chipping is pretty good, but my approach is horrendous, and I really shouldn't use my 60 deg as often as I do). All this data and breakdown of my game has got me pumped up to go golf again (and to beat my friends).
