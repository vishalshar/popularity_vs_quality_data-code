Taste is good, especially with coffee. Price is steep, but I assume it's super expensive to harvest the bodies of catepillers in the Himalayian Mts.  I tore a calf muscle a year ago skateboarding and muscle tightness has persisted for over a year in that area during exercise (#overthehill40yroldskaters)  When I drink the tea it goes away. Maybe it's the placebo effect? I'll admit I'm a sucker for superfoods. I coach HS wrestling too, I gave this tea to my son this season before the first competition, so far good. Update to follow
