After auditioning the top dogs in this category for months, I finally made a decision and these are the conclusions that I have come to. Please note that I am NOT a basshead but I like my music to sound as close to the actual recording as possible with no particular frequency left out or accentuated.Bose Soundlink MiniThis speaker is all about bass. Yes, the lower frequencies are truly amazing for a speaker of this size (my ears tell me that it is reaching to about 57 - 60hz) but the bass has bled into the midrange frequencies, giving the speaker an overly warm sound and affecting vocals of both male and female singers. There is a big bass hump between 60 to 90Hz so R&B, dance and similar music sound good but not natural on it. It does not sound very detailed and the sound is way too warm to be neutral. If you have not heard the Fugoo, the Bose sounds more than decent for a speaker this size and despite its shortcomings, if Fugoo had not existed, I would probably have settled for this by Christmas and then wished that it was more neutral and had more clarity throughout the time that I own this product.Beats PillFor the price they are asking for, give it a big miss. The Bose has better bass and the UE Boom is more transparent and neutral.UE BoomThe UE Boom is quite neutral sounding and probably has the best features of the 4 speakers mentioned here. It only goes down to 90Hz so to give it the illusion of having a bit more bass, I think there is a small bass hump in that region which has only slightly affected the midrange and is not a problem at all but the bottom line is, there is not enough extension in the lower frequencies to make you tap your feet to the beat. The problem with it is that genres like jazz will sound like it is missing one instrument - the bass. It reproduces the frequencies that it is capable of very cleanly and is a very decent speaker but IMO, it sounds too thin due to the lack of extension in the lower end. The end result is a lot of (nice) sound but slightly unsatisfactory.FugooIt took the speaker about 1 hour of play to loosen up and once it did, what I heard was good bass (about 80% of the bass that the Bose makes you think it is producing) with a very clear midrange (totally unadulterated by the lower frequencies) and the overall sound signature is just slightly on the bright side (but not so bad that it makes your ears bleed). The slight brightness gives it the illusion of having a lot of detail (its OK - not hi-fi grade but best in class) and makes it seem more transparent compared to its rivals. I mentioned 'illusion' because this is a very tiny speaker at the end of the day, so, it is never going to be audiophile grade. It gives the illusion that it is high fidelity when you are listening to it but not when listening to it 'critically'. Despite that, it is an extremely satisfying sound. It is one of the more neutral sounding offerings and an ABSOLUTE MARVEL FOR ITS SIZE. Taking its size and price into consideration, it is not found wanting in any area and is punching above its weight throughout the entire frequency range. If you have listened to the other speakers mentioned above but not the Fugoo, the best way to describe it is it has 80% of the bass of the Bose and 120% of the mid and upper range of the UE Boom. Now, that, my friend, is a very good thing. Go and buy this little gem already!
