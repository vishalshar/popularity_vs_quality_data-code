Update:  My then toddler is now 4 and still loves this cup.  We have replaced the glass 3 times.  Greasy hands and a bad attitude were to blame.  Both times the broken glass was completely contained within the silicone.  It was an easy cleanup.  The third time was my fault.  I knocked it off the counter and the lid was not on it.  Course, that made a huge mess!  I bought replacement glass from the company website.  This cup has truly been dropped about a hundred times and only broke 3 times.  It has NOT been dropped on ceramic/porcelain tiles or hardwood...just laminate and carpet...so that probably would make a difference.Original:  Trying to wean my toddler off of his plastic sippy cups.  I bought the 6 oz. Siliskin glass cups first.  He uses them but whined for his sippy cup still.  So I bought this one.  He took to it right away.  Now I just hope he doesn't throw it like he often does with his plastic cups!  And I will continue to use the 6 oz. ones too.
