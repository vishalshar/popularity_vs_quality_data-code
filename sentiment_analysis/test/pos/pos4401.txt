I'm 48 now and although I have very long lashes and plenty of them, the tips have become almost invisible over the years. Mascara is not something I like to use. This product is simply fabulous. One layer darkens all of my lashes so beautifully and I use it on my eye brows as well. Looks and feels completely natural. Love it. Thanks Lamas Beauty.
