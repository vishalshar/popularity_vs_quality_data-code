These are delicious...tiny bite sized shortbread that actually tastes like shortbread. I can't believe no one else bought the shortbread, according to the reviews. I suppose everyone likes chocolate chip better. Well, for your information, you are missing out on one tasty cookie. These are just as tasty as Walker's Shortbread 'biscuits' from England and half the price at least.
