I watched these on kickstarter with the intent to buy one when they hit the market. Package arrived ridiculously fast (Love Amazon Prime) and looked well constructed.  I had a few minutes free when the package arrived and that's all it took to install.InstallationFrom delivery to installed and operating took me a half hour by myself. Most of that time was spent climbing up and down the ladder because I didn't take the right tools/hardware with me up the ladder. I ended up using my own socket instead of the provided tool because It would stay on the lag screw easier. I'd recommend using your own socket for the installation. The Quick release pin configuration that connects the unit to the ceiling was brilliant and very easy to manage. I Installed the pulley system because I am storing my baby bike trailer. it was super simple setup, drill the pilot hole and add the lag eye bolt.OperationConnecting my android Droid Turbo was very simple. the app recognized the unit right away and I was able to control the lifting operation right from my phone. it was really fun and easy to watch the bike trailer go up and down. my wife is able to get the trailer down and go for a ride while I'm at work without any problem.I've installed other garage storage lifting tools before and it took multiple people and substantially more time, and it was still such a pain to raise and lower that it was a major deterrent to using the bikes that were stored up there. Switching to a mylifter is completely different. Easy to setup and and easy to use. I'm very happy with the total experience.
