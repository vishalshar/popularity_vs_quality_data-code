I absolutely had some concerns before buying this based on some reviews when the product first hit the market, but these guys obviously read customer feedback. Virtually every early critique has been addressed. I have built the "swipe" into my pre shot routine, so it really has not affected me at all. The unit fits right on my belt (I would recommend using a thicker/wider belt to hold it on securely).The system itself is very easy to learn. If you forget to swipe, they have built in a missed shot sensor that can be edited after download. I saw some reviews complaining about editing the round, but if you take some notes during your round, which I already did, editing and signing off on the round should take no more than 5-10 minutes after download. (I use the G Stats Golf Statistics System to track my round with notes).The main reason I purchased this was to lock in 3/4 vs full shots will all my clubs. I had a general idea, but was going long and/or short more often than not. After only a couple of rounds, I was able to dial in all of my clubs and am seeing results already. I cannot recommend this product highly enough for the golfer that thrives on analytics. I have also had some interaction with Game Golf customer service and without asking, they have gone above and beyond. It's a great product from a very solid company.***I also want to note some of the reviews critique the actual data you have access to. I am not sure if they did not filter through, but you have access to everything. For instance, you can filter your shots by fairway or rough (including seeing each individual shot while editing the round and all shots when looking at the compiled data), which is an unbelievably useful tool. If you are like me, you take notes on your card for when you are hitting full and 3/4 shots. You can easily see these numbers while editing the round and lock in your distances. Simply put, as long as you execute the shot, you have no more excuses with the information you get from using this device.
