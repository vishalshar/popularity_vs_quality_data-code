I haven't used the plates yet, but I am impressed with the quality. The plastic is heavy enough to carry food without bending.  The center spot for holding a drink seems like it is deep enough to keep a glass from tipping. There is an indentation on the underside of the plate that my fingers fit into which makes it easy to carry with one hand. My only complaint is that the space for the food is a little narrow, so larger items wouldn't fit very well. I think they would work well for chips and dip. I am anxious to take them to the lake and use them for picnics! They will be great for the grandchildren.
