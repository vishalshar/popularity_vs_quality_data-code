Love this pump cap. I put it on an antique blue mason jar to use for liquid soap. It pumps great so far and I don't think I'll have to worry about rust with this one. (The metal ones will rust.) Also has a nice silicone ring between top and pump to guard against messy leaks. I'll probably order a couple more to make dispensers for lotions and soaps around the house.
