I just bought this cap as I've been making smoothies and bringing them to the gym in mason jars.  I've had it with fiddling with the normal lids and was hoping for something not just easier to drink from but also something that can be closed and stay closed in my gym bag (hence, the Cuppow design I saw with just an opening would work as well as the openings-with-a-straw option I found online as well).  This has fit the bill!  I've used it for two days in a row and it fits tightly, hasn't leaked yet and has been very cleanable.  I want a bunch more in different colors!
