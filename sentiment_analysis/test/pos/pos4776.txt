I give these 4 stars only because they are so initially pricey.  I love the way the work and that we're not using disposable bags.  The real test will be how long they last and whether the price makes them worth it.  They are a bit bulky but I don't mind that.  The seal is great - easy to seal and very strong. Hoping they make more of a "snack" size in the future.
