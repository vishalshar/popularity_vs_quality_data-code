Very cool idea, and to my mind perfectly executed. People have complained of getting sharp teeth on theirs, but mine are as smooth as butter. And while it does bend a bit out of shape, it just as easily bends back. It looks neat, feels good in the hand, sets my hair perfectly, and feels great on my scalp. Plus it's pretty much the most portable grooming tool ever.I'm very pleased, and if I lose this one I'll definitely buy another.Update: For those like me who use a bit of sticky product on their hair, this is also super easy to clean. Just take dishwashing or hand soap, rub your hands together, and towel dry. Gunk rolls right off. I take it out of my pocket whenever I'm in front of a mirror,  so it's no hardship remembering to clean it.This comb is A+++!
