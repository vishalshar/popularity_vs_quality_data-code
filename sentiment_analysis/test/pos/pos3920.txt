My German Shepherd loves this food!, I bought this as a recommendation from my breeder, who raises them for police departments, and very loving families. She (Inga) love's the taste and ,I Love the solid waste cleanups, never runny feces! (Sorry had to go there :) ) I feed her 2 times a day, and it satisfying enough that she doesn't always finish it all. She is healthy, loving pup! I have met several GSD owners that live by this food! Now if Amazon prime can only keep it in stock! I love the well packaged 40lb bag being delivered right to my door! Poor mail lady,it is lil heavy for her to carry to door step! My plans are to get Inga training (and donate services )for helping the local police departments to find missing persons! That's the least I can do to give back to my community as a free gratitude to all they  do for us. GOD Bless our great police officers!
