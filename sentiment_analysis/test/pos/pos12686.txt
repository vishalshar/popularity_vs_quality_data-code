Good material.  Printed well on a Makerbot Replicator 2 at 230 degrees with unheated bed and blue painters tape.  A little hairspray on the bed improved adherence.  The filament is indeed stiff and a bit brittle, requiring some care when feeding it into the nozzle, but this was not serious problem.  Print resolution was great, and the final product very stiff, strong and no warping, with a nice carbon fiber sheen.  Definitely store unused filament in a desiccator box - it will pick up moisture and affect printing.
