When I received it, I found it was missing the coffee filter component, and decided to return it, even printing the return label.  Then I received an email from the manufacturer offering to send the filter basket, plus some extra ones, with lids for pre-packaging shots of espresso prior to use.  I accepted and received in a couple of days.  Thanks for the great customer support!  Wow!The espresso itself is great; its a nice size portion.  My only criticism is the temperature, as I am used to drinking espresso very hot.  I need to try what one reviewed suggested to prime the mechanism with hot water first.  Otherwise, glad I bought and currently am using at work when I want some espresso on the afternoon.
