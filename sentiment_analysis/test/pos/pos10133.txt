LOVE this battery pack!  A little expensive, but considering the built in 110w inverter (which is silent and without a fan somehow), this is the one for me to do concert videography.  I'll be buying several more of these.  You can plug a power strip into this pack, and power a camera, and a Shogun 4K recorder.  The Shogun recorder uses more energy, but then it is doing all the processing instead of the camera.  I tried using just a Sony A7Rii 2 nights ago in L.A. for a concert, and shot for more than 3 hours, and it only used 25% of the pack!!  I just LOVE these!  There seems to be nothing else like it.  I only would ask for a larger capacity version in addition to these already perfectly sized packs so you can run multiple devices from one pack, or simply have enormous battery life, which would be great if you are out in the boonies with limited power sources.Last time, I shot with both an Atomos Shogun Flame, and and A7Rii, and got about 2 hours, which seemed a little disappointing, but I realized the Atomos 4K recorder is using more than the camera.  Fair enough!  more than one pack then.  Now I use the 2 batteries that come with the Atomos in addition to starting out with a fully charged pack just for the Atomos, and another pack just for the camera, and then I know I won't run out of power.So, if you intend to use these for videography, it seems that one device (one 7 inch monitor or one camera, etc.) per pack is a safe bet for concerts and weddings, although for weddings or other important events, I would double up and have back-ups just in case.It does take a while to charge, and if that could be improved, it definitely would help when you are at a hotel trying to charge up in between shows in a hurry.I like that you can power devices you would otherwise use an adjustable voltage power pack to power using the 110w outlet, and the adapter that hopefully came with your dummy battery or monitor.  Using the adjustable voltage packs is asking for disaster, especially if you have a crew and not just yourself working.  Even by yourself, you will probably eventually destroy a camera or other voltage specific device with the wrong setting.Even though it IS dangerous, it might be nice if this power pack also had an adjustable voltage outlet if you did want to use it.  My Atomos uses a wide range of voltages, which is great to keep it safe from that, so it would be nice to not need a bulky power adapter just to plug into the 110w outlet, rather a skinny 12v plug instead.Hopefully, these will go down in price, but as there is nothing competing with it, I would still buy 10 of these if I needed them.
