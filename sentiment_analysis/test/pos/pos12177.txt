Great screen and having reliable instructions was very helpful. Giving it a 4 star rating because one of the flex connector cables would not sit into place where it should have. Eventually got it to work, but it added another 30 minutes to the repair. Other than that, great screen that I would buy again. I also suggest that you check out the iCracked youtube video as I found that very helpful as well
