I make my own almond milk and store it in mason jars. Whereas removing the lid from the jar to pour minor inconvenience, I had still been looking for a better solution when I came upon this product. The pour cap is perfect for storing any liquids in mason jars that would benefit from being able to be precisely poured. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the cap tends to flip down while pouring. You have to remember to hold the flip cap up with 2 fingers while pouring. This isn't a huge deal and wouldn't prevent me from ordering again
