This game has the potential to be in every gaming circle. The resistance + mysterium + maybe a bit of code names. I appreciate that being the bad guy isn't as draining as maybe in the resistance or similar hidden role games because you're not convincing people you are good, you are explaining why somebody else's items make sense. My first time putting it on the table in a group of six and we played 5 rounds before I put it up so we didn't burn out on it!The only negative is wish the evidence/clue cards were bigger. They can be hard to read. Also the price seems to be going up and down here on Amazon (I paid $33 and right now it's $38). Overall maybe my favorite hidden roles game!
