Blows the Philips Hue our of the water!  *MUCH* better greens with this (actual green, not spinach) and really, really bright!  Only knock is this is WiFi, not Zigbee so in my apartment with competing wifi signals, it occasionally doesn't respond, but then again, no hub!  And in most houses, wifi interference isn't a problem.  Either way, that's a knock on my environment, not the product.
