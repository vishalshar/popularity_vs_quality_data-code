The Epik looks great on my Apple Watch. It beefs up the watch and most people don't realize I'm wearing an Apple. The case installed easily and I had no problems with the button or crown. Just don't over-tighten the screws.  I wear the watch in the gym and while working outdoors. Very good product. I wish it was made of steel instead of aluminum.
