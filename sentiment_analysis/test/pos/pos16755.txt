I placed this order for my cousin . Personally yoga mats to me are a little gross, always seem a little slimy feeling because of how much and often you sweat onto it. This towel really eliminates that. My cousin had told me how she likes to put her towel down on top of her mat but that it tends to shift during her movements, when I found this it seems like a great solution. A large 100% microfiber towel, in a very nice macintosh green color and has little plastic flowers covering the underside of it. I was a little curious how it would feel with the flowers but my cousin stated that when placed onto her mat with the flowers underneath they press into her mat instead of her hands or feet and they really help with keeping the towel from shifting at all. It was able to absorb any sweat, and keep her yoga mat dry.
