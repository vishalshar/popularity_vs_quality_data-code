My biggest issue is I got this for my 5 year old and it barely fits in his lunch box. I would just let him carry it with no lunch box but you have to have the place for a drink and silverware. He does love the overall design and it washes easily. I think the company should make a carrier that the handle just slips through and has a place for a drink on the side.
