I have used this tarp multiple times since I got it as one of the first backers.It got a small tear near the middle almost immediately, I'm very careful with my stuff so I am not sure how it happened. Other than that the tarp itself has been fantastic. Very configurable, and I love all the tie-outs. It is also very large, biggest rain fly I have ever used. If you are setting this up for a hammock you need to make sure you have a lot of space around, I have found that in multiple situations it was just too big for the back county in Oregon to setup properly. If, however, you are not hemmed in with lots of trees, this rain fly is really quite amazing and diverse.The only other negative I have is all the "extras" are really low quality throw ins. The cordage is weak, the line tensioners are cheap plastic and the stakes are below par. All are easily replaceable and they may be just fine for the typical car camper, but backpackers are going to use what they have or get new stuff immediately.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and I am glad I backed such a great company.EDIT 7/25Jason reached out to me and replaced the tarp at no charge whatsoever which I think is amazing. The tear is really the only thing I have found wrong with the tarp and hasn't had any problems since. I often find it is hard to find companies who not only provide solid products, but are willing to stand behind those products. I'm very glad I backed Go Outfitters and look forward to seeing what future products they will release.
