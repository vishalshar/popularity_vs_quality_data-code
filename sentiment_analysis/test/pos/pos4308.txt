Great product! Finally something that gives me feedback on more than just how many steps I take in a day, and it does it well. I was skeptical that it wouldn't be comfortable to wear but pretty quickly forgot it was there until the app began giving me feedback and helping me be more aware of my mood and breathing. I like that I'm not announcing my wearable or biofeedback with a second watchband like the fit-bits or whatever. The wireless charger looks nice on my dresser and has a convenient additional usb port for my phone. The app interface is clean and in addition giving me realtime info, also has some good guided tutorials to get my mood, focus, and calm streaks back on track. Looking forward to a new lifestyle with this slick wearable. Would definitely recommend to my family and friends.
