Love my Rumpl.  I sleep with it every night, summer and winter.  Construction is tip notch and it is holding up well to daily use.  It is really lightweight and super comfortable.  I also take it on camping trips.  Packs really small and it just  plain works.  I have not had issues with it slipping off the bed, despite being made of a slick material.  It is the perfect blanket.
