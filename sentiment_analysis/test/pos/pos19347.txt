Ok first off let me tell you a little about myself. I have struggled since I was 12 with my periods being irregular and have PCOS  and I am now 26 years old. I have been on and off birth control now since 12 years old and tried to stay off of it most of the time because I knew that it wasnt good for me but what can I do when Im 12 years old and bleeding months at a time. Anyways, I have been struggling getting pregnant for 6 years now with my husband but i just started in December on fertility medicine because it was time for that step. So lets rewind a little the February before I started taking Fertility medicine I stopped taking birth control because I had been on it for about a year or so and they say that it takes a while to get out of your system. So going back to December when I started the fertility medicine, Of course in order to take the fertility medicine you have to be on your period so the drs. prescribed me the fertility medicine and told me to take it days 3 through 7 of my cycle... well I waited and waited and never got my period . I had to call my obgyn and let him know my period never came so he prescribed me a medicine called Provera that would make me start. I went to my local pharmacy and got the prescription and went home. I started reading on the warning label the side effects...may cause pregnancy syptoms, etc. I was like okay medicine dont normally affect me so there shouldnt be any harm in taking this medicine.. boy was I wrong!!! I took the medcine for like a week and I woke up that Friday I believe and was so sick... I couldnt even function. well needless to say I didnt get pregnant that month and no period and so the next month came around and I had to do the same thing.... still not pregnant and still no period the next month came around and had to repeat the process again... finally I got tired of takinf the Provera and getting sick everytime!! I got online on amazon and typed in fertility. Not exactly thinking I would find anything but just to see what was out there I scrolled through amazon looking at the possibilities. I came across Premama and read alot of the reviews how it helped them start or how it helped them possibly get pregnant, and there was nothing but great reviews so I ordered Premama. Let me tell you I have taken this everyday for the last 3 months and this has helped me out with having a period!!!! i have had a period the last 3 months in a row and on time and i have never been able to do that unless I was on birth control!!! Premama has been a huge blessing to me considering I was having to take Provera each month and getting sick with that. Now i just take my Premama everyday in my morning bottle of water with a Spark energy from advocare and I love it!!! I havent gotten pregnant yet and this past month the Dr. finally got me to ovulate with a higher dosage of fertility meds but Im still keeping my head up because I know that miracles can happen!!!
