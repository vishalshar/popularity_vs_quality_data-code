We had some issues starting out with this product, as our air here in Colorado is very dry and arid, where mushrooms grow best in humid climates. We had to re-soak a few times but still grew a good portion of mushrooms! With re-soaking the whole process from pre-soak to harvest was about two weeks. You really have to keep the soil moist, and really can't over-water! I love how it also comes with tomato seeds to reuse the soil in the box for planting.
