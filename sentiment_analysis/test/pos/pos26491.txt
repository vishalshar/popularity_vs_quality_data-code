I love this product. With the colder weather here it has been great to send my daughter off to Kindy with hot and cold foods as part of her lunch. The hot stuff stays warm and doesn't cause the fruit to sweat. The lid on the insulated section is easy for my 4 year old to remove and the whole section is easy to remove to place a sandwich or other item in instead. The size allows more than enough food for her lunch. The OmieBox is easy to clean and the latch isn't too hard for her to open. The only draw back is the small removable divider. It was missing the first day she brought it back from school. I've made do with using baking paper to separate items but perhaps the box needs to either be sold with extra dividers or be changed to a slider moves up and down the length of the box or which can't be removed?? Lastly a slightly larger version for adults would be a definite winner.
