The next best thing to a Keybar. It saves my pockets from freshly cut keys and the ridiculous rattle normally associated with carrying a bunch of keys via a retractable keyring and belt clip. Assembly was child's play. Researched other items and chose this based on a personal recommendation. Functional, clean design and an overall very nice feel.
