I Love the Idea... and It does Exactly what it says it will do via the Phone.. But I can't seem to get it to connect via Bluetooth (Direct Link) nor can I connect to it outside in the Real world... I'm Sure I'm Probably doing something wrong.. But I can't seem to find any help.. and there aren't that many Settings on it that I could be "Screwing' up?.. Anyway.. Any help would be appreciate.. I want to buy another one, but will need to make sure this one works Correctly first..
