Beautiful high end well designed fitness tracker. The packaging is super luxe and it would make an amazing present!I have lost a lot of watches and 2 Fitbits over the years- especially at night when asleep. This is so light and  comfy. Doesn't  get wet and itchy like other fitness trackers. It is so comfortable well made and most importantly.. it is really pretty! It looks like a cool piece of jewelry so I don't take it off. The ceramic core looks and feels just like a beautiful stone. You can also pop it off and wear it as a necklace.They have a necklace accessory that you can get as well. There are more wristband styles too. I think the white one with gold would look supercool with this too. The iphone app works well. Not buggy or anything which is a relief when using a new brand... I think they will probably add in more features to it soon but in many ways - I just like the simplicity of it as is....
