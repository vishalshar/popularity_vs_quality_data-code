This product is amazing, easy to install and nice and tidy on the bike.  I have had it on the bike only a few days and been asked by several bikers as well as car drivers where I got this product.  This means they are seeing it and not running me over....I like that idea.  Works independent of my brake lights which adds a high degree of visibility  to me when downshifting or decelerating.  Price is fair and shipping was fast.
