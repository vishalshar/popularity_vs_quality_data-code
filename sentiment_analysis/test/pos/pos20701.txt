I often dye and tint my lashes, the look of mascara is too dramatic for me.  I'd rather have a more natural look.  For me this product delivered.  I apply only one coat and it works similar to a die in that the translucent tips of my lashes are darkened.  The results do not last as long as a permanent die, only a few days with most lost during the first night.No problem with breakage for me, but I have somewhat oily skin.  If you must remove this product prior to wearing off over time, use of a waterproof makeup cleanser is needed.  I think attempting to use this product with more than one coat to build volume would create a sticky stiff result, one coat is perfect and natural.
