The product works the best of any of my existing water bottles especially when cleaning any biofilm thats grown inside.  The top and end caps seal completely and I've had no leaks.  The only recommendation I would make would be to clean the bottle with amild soap solution.  The bottles can pick up the soap taste in the dish washer.  Overall I would recommend this purchase to anyone.
