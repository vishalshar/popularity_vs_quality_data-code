This case is vary good it is thin and lite but only one thing worried me and sure enough that one thing happened. It was the top cap the clip broke off abou 5 - 6 months after getting the case the only thing that could be improved is if the creators of Thin Charge would add an extra of the top cap otherwise great product and would buy it again.
