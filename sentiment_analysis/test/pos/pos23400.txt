I received 3 packages of the BIXBI Pocket Trainers (Chicken Flavor) yesterday.  I have purchased these locally before and the packages that delivered appeared dry,discolored, and did not smell as flavorful as the locally purchased treats.Is this something that I should be concerned about?  The expiration date has not elapsed but the product/quality is nothing like what i was expecting.Edit:I spoke to Emily at customer Service and she explained that there had been some changes to the formula and that this would account for the differences in what i received versus what I was expecting.  Emily had an excellent demeanor and offered that I could return the Pocket trainers if I was not satisfied with what I received.  Knowing that the difference is expected and after my wonderful experience with customer service, I will happily use this batch of pocket trainers with my puppy and continue to give BIXBI my business.  They have won a customer for life.
