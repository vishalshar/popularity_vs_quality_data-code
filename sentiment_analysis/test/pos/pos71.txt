I used these for overseas travel. I flattened them out and put them in the bottom of my briefcase (where they took up minimal space) to use as airplane slippers and hotel slippers. They were perfect for use on the plane and wearing down to the lobby, etc. in the hotel when I did not want to put on dress shoes. They were comfortable with a bare foot and thin trouser socks. They don't breathe well though, so feet start to feel a bit sweaty after a wearing them for a while, though they are otherwise comfortable for wearing most of the day. I wear a 7.5, so the photo gives an idea of the extra give available in the heel, but did not have any problems with them slipping off. Would be great if the company made some with a more breathable upper to increase the comfort.
