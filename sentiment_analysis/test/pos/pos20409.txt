I have a black lab and golden retriever i use this collar system on and i love it! i only use the beep most times. I have ordered 2 of these only because my golden lost his once in the corn field and I couldn't find it anywhere. They hold a good charge and work well with the double remote. Good price compared to other stores as well.
