so i purchased one of these and for me its cheaper than a tenis lesson. I am a level 5.5 player and i really enjoy looking to see what this sensor offers in terms of data on my matches as well as, hitting sessions.  I had a small problem with my sensor and to say the least PIQ customer service went above and beyond so I feel obliged to tell people that you are dealing with a great company that stand behind their products and give a hoot about their customers. This is a great new space for tennis lovers. its all aboput the data!
