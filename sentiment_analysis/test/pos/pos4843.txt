This is a great little kit, very cute and easy to put together! I got it for my 3.5 year old and me to grow together, and I'll update in a few weeks with growth progress. The included instructions only tell you to visit their website to watch a video, and while the video is effective and informative, it would've been nice to have a quick set of step-by-step written instructions in case someone isn't in a position to watch an internet video when they're ready to assemble the kit.
