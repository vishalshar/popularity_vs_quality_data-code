This phone is worth its price. I was considering getting the LG V20 but I think it was $600 for some awesome features that I realized I would hardly use. Always reverse engineer when purchasing (electronics, everything?!). Ask yourself what do you really want it for and everything else is bells and whistles. You can often save money if you guard yourself from getting dazzled. For me, my first priority was a big screen to watch videos on. I also wanted something that I could feel in my pocket as my old phone slipped out of my pants and I didn't notice! I also wanted an unlocked phone.PROS: Nice big, crisp screen. Fast, agile processor(?) operating system(?) Opening and navigation between apps is fast and smooth. Although I haven't used it much, I think it has a nice camera. It takes very nice pictures and the video is nice, too. Very little if any bloatware. Screen protector is factory applied. Clear protective back case, charger, and a few other things like headphones included. I like the white front - it doesn't disappear in the background so in low lighting I can find it better. It seems to charge faster than my old phone. I don't know why that would be but it seems to. It seems not to use any power at all on standby whereas my old phone would drain pretty fast but maybe this could be attributed to bloaty vampire apps. Customer service (see below) is adequate to good. It has FM radio. I don't recall listening through the headphones yet so can't critique them.CONS: 3000 mah battery for a screen this big? My old phone which was like a 3 year old LG volt(?) had a 3000 mah battery, which is why I bought it. Not a big deal I figure I can just charge pretty much anywhere but it means I have to more often. Again, it does seem to charge really fast. The clear protective case that comes with it for the back of the phone had red splotches on it that I couldn't clean off. I emailed support and they sent out a clear case and now the phone is nice and shiny and you can see the brushed gold back through the case. A few times I've had it freeze up and have had to reboot. I don't think the old LG has ever froze. When you boot it up it has an annoying whoosh sound that's pretty loud so don't do it at night when people are sleeping! It's probably some setting that I have to adjust. Physically, if they could squeeze a bit smaller the spaces where the receiver speaker and selfie camera are on the top and the buttons are on the bottom that would help reduce the height. The speaker isn't all that loud. It would be nice if all phones came with stereo speakers. Not the best screen in bright sunlight. Auto dim feature doesn't seem to dim very much at all. It would be nice if it came with a dimmer that went down to zero so a person could adjust it to use the least amount of energy. As it stands, I pulled down an app that dims the screen but I don't know if it's just applying a filter and the phone is still putting out full power for the screen or if it's actually using less juice.Overall, well worth the $130. I give it 4 stars because you can't give 4.5. The 4 is because the battery is somewhat wimpy for this large screen, the loud speaker is somewhat on the quiet side, and the auto dim barely does anything. Thanks!
