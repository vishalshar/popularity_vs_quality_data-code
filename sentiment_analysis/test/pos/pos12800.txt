I love this thing.  It took me less than 5 minutes from start to finish.  Just spray your degreaser or bike wash (I use foaming simple green on the drivetrain and Wicked Wash on the rest), then scrub and clean with the brush hero.  White (stiffer) brush for the drivetrain, and the soft black brush on your paint and wheels.  This thing seriously reduces the time and effort, and it's just the right size for the hard to reach areas around your brakes and hubs.
