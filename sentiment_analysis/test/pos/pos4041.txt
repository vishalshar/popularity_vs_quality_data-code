I don't eat cheese and I had never heard of "Cheese Paper".  I bought a huge piece at Costco for my boyfriend and went to the internet to research how to store it.  That is how I discovered cheese paper. I ordered this in July, followed the wrapping instructions and just finished the last amount of cheese about two weeks ago (mid October).  It works!!!  The cheese was just as fresh as it was when purchased in July!  6 stars if another star were available!
