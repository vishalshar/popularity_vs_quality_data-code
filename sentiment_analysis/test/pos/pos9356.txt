I've tried a few different products now. I've got to say this one hugs the member rather well. There wasn't any slippage during performance so I didn't have to pause or stop during the good times, (know-what-I-mean). I'm thinking to test this one out with the Tor cockring to see if it can keep up well.That being said, I do wish they came flavored.
