I received this a few days ago and am very pleased with it thus far.  I have a Day-Light Sky lamp,and through using the Sunsprite have discovered that I needed to get much closer to the light to receive a therapeutic dose of light.  I now am trying to get my dose of light in the morning to help me sleep better at night.  One comment though is that the magnet that holds it on is very effective but found my Sunsprite missing off of my short sleeved T-shirt.  When I went looking for it, I discovered it attached to the doorframe of my bedroom which is apparently magnetized metal underneath the paint.  The front of the plastic was scratched a little bit when Imremoved it from the doorframe.  This occurred another time so I now  wear the device attached to the front of my T-shirt so as not to lose it to the stronger pull of the doorframe (I did not feel it coming off).  I love the fact that the Sunsprite recharges itself and it does stay on well provided it does not come in contact with a stronger magnet.
