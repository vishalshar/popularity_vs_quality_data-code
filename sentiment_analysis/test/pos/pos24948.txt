Who knew these would work so well. I kind of ordered them because I buy a lot of cheese and the investment wasn't so grand that if they didn't work that well it wouldn't have cost much. Guess what!!! They work super well and I will never be without them in my kitchen again. Cheese stays soft and fresh like you just opened it and that is from the most expensive down to plain old American. If you're a cheese lover be sure to get these and if you give cheese as gifts be sure to include a box of these with it. This is a product that really can change your life!!!
