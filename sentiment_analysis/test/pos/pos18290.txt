Definitely adds volume to hair. But it will leave a residue on your hair. Can't see it, but if you run your fingers through hair you can fill it. Can't wear for multiple days. Almost need to wash hair the next day. Also it's kinda difficult to apply. Either none comes out or too much when you shake it.
