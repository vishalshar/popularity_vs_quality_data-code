I love this product.  Great taste.  Great crunch.  Love that it's simply coconut.  No coloring, preservatives, no chemicals.  It's so good just on it's own.  I also add it to yogurt.  I love it.  The only negative thing....is the cost.  These are pricey.  I did buy a huge box.  But I don't think I can be buying these too often because of the cost.
