The Corvain is a game changer for true wine enthusiasts. It does take some effort to master its use, but frankly I was completely comfortable with it  the second use I used it. I am now actively drinking 7 different bottles of wine and have seen no seepage in any of them. In terms of how long a bottle will last once I start using the Coravain on it, I have no intention of a bottle lasting for more than a few months after it is tapped. As for the comment here about the cost of the gas cartridges, I have to admit that the folks shaming Coravin for the cost of these are annoying to me. If you don't think the value is there, don't buy the device.
