Love this lotion. I didn't have any problems nor reports of break outs. Because to eczema.  Some may not like it due to the lotion not having fragrance so, it may not have a pleasant smell it does come with Lavender if I'm not mistaken. It works for me. And is better for those who have sensitive skin. I will buy again.
