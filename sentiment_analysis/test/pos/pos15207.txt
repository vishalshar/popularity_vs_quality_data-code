I wanted a security option that allowed me to both view my home exterior live as well as be able to provide recorded footage in the event of an issue. The Kuna Smart Home Security Light & Camera does this; however, both the live images and the recorded images when it's dark outside did not meet my needs. I purchased and tried three different wattage bulbs to no avail. That being said, I can not say enough good things about the Kuna customer support staff. Prior to making this purchase, I read a few reviews that voiced their displeasure with the customer support aspect but I can unequivocally attest to the excellent support I received. It was timely, the agent was patient, helpful, informative and courteous. Additionally, the light design itself is excellent in that it is well-made and very pretty. The main reason I chose the Kuna is that I could install it without having to run any additional wiring or ever replace batteries. This is definitely a five-star product if you are not concerned with the night-time images.
