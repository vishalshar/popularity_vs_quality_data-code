Here is my honest INITIAL review. I don't have the tracker, yet (I receive it on Friday and will update this review a month from my arrival date). But I have been following Bellabeat LEAF's start up for the last year (since they launched their product at CES). Their customer service has been FANTASTIC (especially on the social media presence, i.e. Facebook specifically). Again, I downloaded the app and I do not have a leaf yet (I was too excited-- I couldn't wait). I know they have had a few bugs and kinks to work through since the initial launch. Bellabeat stands alone when it comes to customer satisfaction and product development. They are constantly evolving (as a 'leaf' would) to make changes that appease to their users, if applicable. I have owned the Up band by Jawbone (very good sleep memory, but you can't wash dishes with it-- duly noted) and the Fitbit Flex (essentially waterproof, but I didn't like the way it recorded my sleep) and I still wanted the LEAF because of the way it looks. And the fact that it is versatile enough to wear three different ways so I can wash dishes by wearing it as a brooch or a necklace. As with any initial startup risk, there are going to be bugs and kinks. But I am confident that Bellabeat will do the best they can to correct them with efficiency and efficacy. The fact that you don't have to charge the device is a bonus. My Fitbit and Up bands were always dead when I approached the weekend (when I move the most). And the sheer fact that it is made out of wood makes this hippie girl at heart very fond.UPDATED AND HONEST REVIEW:I am putting this beauty in between the four and five star category. When it arrived it was like getting a Christmas present or being initiated into a club. It feels special. I had no issues syncing it to my phone, and then I got an upgraded one. I couldn't get the LEAF to connect to my device at all. It kept crashing. Enter, Bellabeat Support. I sent an email on a Friday and I did a quick follow up on Social Media (you get a faster response). They were on the case and I had a new update for the app within 48 hours. Their customer support alone is 10 stars! Very helpful and nice people.I find that the tracker is fairly accurate. I love, love, loved the fact that during the time they were dealing with the app issue, my LEAF kept ALL of my data. I continued to wear it. You can't get that with some fitness trackers. You have to log on and sync daily or your sleep and step information is lost. I also love that I don't have to charge the thing. My favorite way to wear it is as a brooch. I get tons of compliments on it. TONS OF COMPLIMENTS! Wearing it as a necklace is my next favorite way to wear it, but I feel that I get more steps in during the day because of the sway. I have a desk job, I go through files and am bending and stretching which causes the necklace to sway even though I am at a standstill. After a few times wearing it as a bracelet, I got the hang of putting it on, but I am not a fan of activity trackers on my wrist, personally. I don't swing my arm enough when I walk... Haha! Which is why I hated my Fitbit. I tried to wear the Fitbit piece in an arm band around my ankle (NOT JOKING).Again, I love this little piece of technology and I am excited to see what Bellabeat does in the future.
