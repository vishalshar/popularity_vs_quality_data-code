So, for someone who doesnt maintain dress/business clothes regularly, these collar stay pieces were somewhat of a puzzle to me at first. I pulled the plastic case out of the cardboard wrapper and thought the only instructions were what was shown on the exterior of the packaging. Once I took a closer look, I found that the inside of the cardboard wrap actually had the instructions. If you follow the instruction on how to extend the Cleverfit, you wont have any problems. Its still a bit stiff to get the metal to expand as it should, but as long as you press down on the clasp as shown, it will slide normally.The clasps are strong and seem to hold a collar open normally. Please note, these will ONLY work with standard button down/collared dress shirts that have the slot on the underside of a collar. Originally, I had wanted to try and use these with a polo shirt that typically has a floppy collar, but found quite quickly that was not possible. These are a great accessory for anyone who typically uses a dress shirt with collar.
