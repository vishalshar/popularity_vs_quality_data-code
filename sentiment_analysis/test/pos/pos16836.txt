Fantasitic product! I've grown tired of buying the energy drinks and their loads of sugar so after discovering Voke Tab, I was ready to give them a try. I do a lot of off shore fishing and when wanting a nice surge of energy I can reach in my pocket and chew a tab. These are all natural and i can honestly say they don't give you that tingling feeling after you down a 5 hour energy...the Voke Tabs are more like a nice long boost of energy without all the jitters normally associated with the other energy products. I found where I was drinking several Red Bulls out on the boat, and I really didn't like doing that...these tabs are a much more natural ingredient which maybe explains why you don't get a crash from these. If you're on the fence about them, I'd highly suggest you try them.
