I purchased this because the reviews for customer service were so good.  I hadn't really heard anything about the company as it's small.  I called once I received the unit and completely agree with the other reviews.  I tried to set it up on my own but I'm not very technical so I needed help with the TV.  The agent was so patient and clear.  I needed to get an account with Netflix or Hulu before we could finish so he held the case open for me.  When I called back, I got a different agent who was also excellent.  I was having some trouble with the TV connection at first, but it got resolved.  They even called me back to make sure I didn't need more assistance. Very impressive. The product is good too, providing a strong signal to all our devices. It's small enough to go pretty much anywhere.
