They aren't cheap, but they are really good for kids lunches.  I have them on autodelivery so I save a little money that way and two bags does last quite a while that some times I skip a month of auto-delivery.  They are  nice and crunch and the bag is resealable.  A nice alternative to fatty potato chips.
