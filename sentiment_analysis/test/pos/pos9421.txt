This flashlight was being promoted by the company that installed our PV solar panels. We purchased it thru  Amazon for my wife who travels. It lays in a sunny window and self-charges via the solar panel side of the light. Only once have we had to charge it via the usb port. it is a compact and variable light from low to bright, She also uses it to charge and extend the battery life of her Iphone 6. Well made and durable. We have used it during power outages by placing  the light on a self and shining it up onto the white ceiling of our living room, lighting the living room, kitchen and dining room an area of about 800 sq ft. She was able to charge her Iphone 6 and her friends Iphone 5 on one charge. The light was laying in a sunny window sill at the time and I am sure that helped. She always like to travel with a source of light. During a visit to an office on Long Island she was able to exit a building during a partial power outage of the building. Again she held the light up towards the ceiling on max and enough reflected light shone down to give her and her companions enough light the see the well.
