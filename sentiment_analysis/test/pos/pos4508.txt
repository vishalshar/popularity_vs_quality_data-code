I have two things to say- first, the device and the app does everything it claims to do. I bought it to better understand my Miniature Labradoodle's activity behavior, especially at daycare when we don't know what she really does there. It was a snap to set up, and it really works. I find myself taking her for walks more just because I'm now accountable for her activity levels. The app works great, but like all apps, I'm sure it will continue to get better. It even interfaces with FitBit somehow. Second, the device is smaller and lighter than I expected, which is largely my fault because there are plenty of pictures showing it on other dogs, etc.Bottom line- it works, it's fun, and it provides me with useful data for my dog and me. I haven't tried any of the competing products out there, but after having such a great experience with this one, why would I?
