Before this purchase I was well familiar with Clean Bottle, having seen the commercial (Bottle Boy) on ProTour races on TV. Clever marketing positioned this product in a "made by bikers, for bikers--so we get you" kind of category.In terms of cleaning the bottle, it's great. It does the trick exactly how you would think it should. Very clever, effective design.BUT, in terms of an on-the-bike water bottlee, it's as typical as most. The decals have already started scraping off after a few weeks of use, and it's not particularly easy to open or close--or even drink from.Would I recommend it? Yes, absolutely. But I don't think Clean Bottle is THE ONLY bottle for me.
