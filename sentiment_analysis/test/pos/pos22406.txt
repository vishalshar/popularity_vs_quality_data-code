I love my Nextbit, it's really good looking and different. Phone calls sound very clear. The screen is very easy to read and battery life seems good for now even after connecting my Asus Zenwatch 2 via Bluetooth.The camera app has been updated and is blazing fast now.This phone is a tremendous upgrade compared to my old Nexus 4. The Nextbit gets signal in many places where I had none before, it's so much faster etc.Full disk encryption was enabled out of the box and the fingerprint reader is working well, so that's two security improvements for me.I only wish it were a bit smaller.This is a very good deal.
