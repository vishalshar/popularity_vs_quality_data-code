Bought this for my nephew and now I have a matching one. Don't expect a piece of fine china for sure. This will be a conversation starter and expect people to want to use it once they know you have it around. As soon as I brought it out everyone wanted to use it. It's lightweight and easily washable and pretty neat in general.
