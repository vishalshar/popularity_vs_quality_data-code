Buying THIS (along with a 200GB micro SD card) has been the BEST tip I'd gotten in a while! No hassles connecting an external HD for my backups. Time Machine backs up to my micro drive. I'm considering moving my music collection to this drive, too. Great product! Super fast shipping. I'm a happy buyer.
