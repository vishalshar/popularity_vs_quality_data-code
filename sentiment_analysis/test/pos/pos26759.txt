I have owned a number of bluetooth speakers including the Bose Soundlink Mini, Bose Soundlink III, JBL Charge, and Amazon Tap. I got the Zipp a few weeks ago and it is easily my favorite. Heres why:Convenience: It's a big speaker, but still very portable. I got tired of the rectangular shape of the Soundlink III and the Zipp doesn't need a case. It comes with a handle and the narrower design allows it to fit pretty much anywhere. It's a little on the heavy side but thats what you get for in a speaker with this sound output.Quality: This thing is loud! But more importantly, for me at least, its crystal clear. 360Â° sound doesn't seem like a big deal to most but it makes a huge difference, especially if you connect multiple Zipp speakers and are looking for a 'surround sound' experience. You can also change the acoustics of each individual linked Zipp to give a broader spectrum of sound (set one to classical, one to rock, and one to hip hop for example). It also has really good bass for a bluetooth speaker. This was a huge plus for me because generally you can't expect much bass from portable bluetooth speakers.Connectivity - Everything you can ask for and more: 3.5 mm heaphone jack, standard USB port, AIRPLAY, WIFI.Battery life - VERY GOOD. Long lasting. Libratone Zipp App shows you remaining battery life. Charges up in about 2 hours or so, for 11 or so hours of playback. Robust braided power cord supplied for charging.Libratone App: This took some time to get used to but I don't understand where all the complaints are coming from. Really straightforward and convenient app. Also enables software updates for the speaker (not available for most speakers).Bonuses: This is my favorite part. The Zipp has so much more to offer than a simple bluetooth speaker. Airplay and USB mass storage are awesome. It literally plays off the wifi and can store radio stations and music. Airplay works great and is easy to set up.Overall thoughts? Better sound quality, better range and longer lasting battery than any other bluetooth speaker I have used and blows comparable models out of the water (Bose Soundlink). It looks great, sounds great, is convenient, and has new features that make it an instant favorite (you can even hold your hand over it and it will "Hush" the music!!). Well worth the price tag.
