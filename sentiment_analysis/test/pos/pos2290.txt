I have used many mice over my gaming lifetime, the castor provides an extremely well balanced option.Pros--Close to perfect sensor, no hardware acceleration to speak of-Extremely comfortable grip, for all grip styles.-Well balanced weight distribution-"just right" teflon feet.Cons--Had an early issue with my right click, already contacted mionix support, will cost me quite a fair bit to RMA my unit. (DIY'd my own solution though)Overall excellent mouse if not for the right click.
