This works pretty well with my Note II. I wanted something that would hold my phone when I'm using the GPS and this does the trick. I do have an Otterbox case on my phone and it makes it so the phone won't go all the way into the holder, but it stays put. Also, it comes out of the CD player every once in a while when I'm pulling out my phone.
