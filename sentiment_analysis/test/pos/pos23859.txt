I've been using the TICKR X for two months now, and it has completely changed how I think about fitness.Pros:- It's comfortable and un-intrusive to wear.- The built in memory allows you to workout without bringing your device along- When connected with a device, the double-tap action on the hardware can be customized to perform a couple different tasks, such as skipping to the next song- The app has a lot of cool reporting features and can be tailored to show you the data you want to see- The app tracks past workouts and can even upload them to a number of other fitness apps (I personally send mine straight to MyFitnessPal)Cons:- Theres a slight learning curve to the app because the packaged instructions aren't very clear and/or thorough. Most of the features of the app, in particular, I found through tinkering, but there are some videos on Wahoo's site- (Minor) The app is geared more toward running/cycling/etc types of activity, and a single one of those activities at a time. My gym workout routine involves a few minutes of treadmill cardio to get my heart rate up, then some moderate strength training, then even more treadmill cardio. I've customized the strength training profile to give me detailed HR information only, and this suffices for my needs, but I can't help but feel like I'm not quite making the best use of all of the features of the device.- (Minor) Along the lines of "using all the features", I'm still not sure how the "rep counting" feature of the tracker works. While I initially purchased this product primarily for the heart rate and activity tracking, I was looking forward to integrating a digital rep counter into my process, but I'm not sure if or how it works with the strength training routine I use.In spite of those three relatively minor instances (which are actually tied more specifically to the companion app and not so much to the hardware), I still find this product to be an outstanding addition to my fitness lifestyle.
