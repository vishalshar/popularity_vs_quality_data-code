I was honestly a bit skeptical when I first opened this up. The freeze dried powdered looking food is just not what I'm used to seeing.  There are benefits to it coming in this form, however - the pack is very light and easy to take in the diaper bag, and when you prepare it for your child, you add the liquid YOU want and the amount you want to make the consistency right for your baby and change the consistency as he/she grows and gains new skills in eating and can handle thicker foods.So far we have mixed this with expressed breast milk, water, and apple juice. All three versions are appealing to our 7 month old daughter. Of all the different foods she has tried, I would say this is her favorite. She accepts it every time we offer it and almost always finishes the whole serving. My husband and I have both tasted it too and both comment that you can taste the actual foods, no weird chemical taste or smell, and that we feel confident feeding this to our daughter. I'm going to try out some other flavors from this company. There's also some toddler recipe suggestions on the back like adding this dried food to make pancakes and I  plan to try that too.
