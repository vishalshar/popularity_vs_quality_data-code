I am super pleased with how seamlessly I was able to begin using this feeder. I have a 16 year old cat who needs to eat wet food in small quantities several times a day, including really early in the morning. Set up on the wifi was really easy, and my cat had no problem eating out of the new feeder right away.  It was easy to record the voice alert, although I think the cat just hears the motor and reacts to that rather than by using the "call my pet over" function. The motor is quite loud, it doesn't scare the cat but it wakes me up when the morning feeding happens. Luckily I'm able to go back to sleep and it's way better than having the cat begging for food so early. I have only programmed up to 3 feedings (afternoon, night and morning when I was away from the house for a night) and she ate most of it, and it was nice to actually see her eating on the camera so I could be sure it was working. In general the wet food seems to stay fresh enough for 3 meals, but this may be different when the seasons change and it's hotter out. Overall so happy with how well this has worked.
