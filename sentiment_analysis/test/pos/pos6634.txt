So glad I started using this avocado oil. I love it's mild flavor. I bake with it...muffins, cornbread, cakes, breads. I've never cared for the strong flavor of olive oil and the flavor it gave my baked items. This oil is also great for seasoning my cast iron and frying/roasting foods due to its high smoke point! Just about to open my 3rd bottle and I just ordered two more. Love that it's packaged in dark glass bottles.
