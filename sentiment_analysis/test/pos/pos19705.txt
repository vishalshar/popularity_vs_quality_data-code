Easy to setup and use. The app interface makes sense and enables locating your tag (and whatever it is attached to) a breeze. I carry a backpack with vital personal medical supplies and the KeepnearÂ™ feature ensures they never get left behind. Finally, the ability to find your phone, by pressing button on the tag is what makes this a "must own" product. - Brit Yocum
