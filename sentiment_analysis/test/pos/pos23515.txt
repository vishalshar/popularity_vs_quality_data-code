Totally, completely impressed.  Setup couldn't have been any easier, and the system just works.  No muss, no fuss, no drama.  I looked long and hard before deciding on Abode, and have no regrets whatsoever.  It took a grand total of 15 minutes to be up and running, and that included a non-abode smart plug.
