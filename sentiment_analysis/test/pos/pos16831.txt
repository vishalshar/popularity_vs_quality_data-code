We are huge fans of the Build & Imagine Magnetic Building Tile Sets. This is our second purchase and I highly recommend! It is a great starter set that you can use with or without the markers. It does come with a doll, but it will fit any small doll or figure. I love the creative side where you can decorate the walls of your house anyway you like. Your set comes with a small cloth to wipe off the marker. The only thing I wish this set had was one more square piece to use as a base, but we have our other set and they combine well. All tiles line up well! Awesome gift to have on hand!
