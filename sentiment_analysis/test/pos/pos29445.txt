Since they are oven dried and thin sliced, they start off crunchy like a chip, then they burst apple and cinnamon. Love that the cinnamon is already added, since it doesn't stick well to previously dried fruit. This was my first time buying this brand, usually go with Trader Joe's dried fruit. Will definitely buy these again.
