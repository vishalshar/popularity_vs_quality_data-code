I used FitBark for 2 weeks. Never would of believed its that great if havent tried it my self. Battery lasts a week, I charge it every Sunday. Easily pairs to both android and ios, data pushes whenever in range with bluetooth on. I can leave one of my devices at home with bluetooth on and watch live data when I'm away. FitBark is not just a gadget, it's a lifestyle. It helped us learn so much about our dog. I know when she gets up at night and how long she sleeps in after I leave to work. Definitly worth it. In fact I think its worth more than what the official price is.
