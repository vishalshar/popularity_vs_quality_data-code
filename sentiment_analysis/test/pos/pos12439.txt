This bulb is fantastic.  Not only do you get the endless colors and white levels of a normal LIFX bulb, but what really sets this apart is the infrared light that gets emitted.  If you have a baby monitor or security camera, often the images are hidden in darkness in certain areas that are very dark.  Not any more!  I have this in my young daughter's bedroom.  She likes to have a "night light" on, but I don't want it on all night.  So, I can program the bulb to turn off after a certain period.  Once this bulb is turned "off", it begins to emit the infrared light.  Obviously it can't be seen so the room is still dark.  However, now one when I check on her with the baby monitor, it looks as if her room is completely lit up, and I have a much better view than without the bulb.
