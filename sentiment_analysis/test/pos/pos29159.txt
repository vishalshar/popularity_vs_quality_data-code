Using Birchbox introduced me to a wide variety of facial cleansers, but none has made me feel as radiant as this one. I have pretty large pores and tend towards a bumpy forehead, but using this helped significantly reduce both. In fact, it completely eliminated my bumpy forehead. When I wake up in the morning after using this, my skin looks and feels younger. I go through phases where I get too busy for a nighttime face wash routine, and the difference is clear. I look and feel better with this cleanser. I use it in combination with a toner and a brightening cream, also by Don't Call Me Ma'am.
