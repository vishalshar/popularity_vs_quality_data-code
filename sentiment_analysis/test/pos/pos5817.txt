These are amazing.  I never liked banana chips as a kid - they were just too sweet!  These are great with the cocoa powder on them and I have to stop myself from eating the whole bag in one sitting.  I like the texture of these better than the ones I had growing up - I don't feel like I'm going to break a tooth on them.  I can sometimes find these in the grocery store and I don't think the Amazon price is great, but oh are they delicious!
