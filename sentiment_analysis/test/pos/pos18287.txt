I agree with the other 5 star reviews.  I used it this morning on unwashed hair (I wash it every other day).  Just added some lightly to my roots after pre-styling my hair.  Holy cow!  Volume was amazing and I didn't have a greasy look or feel.  More of that tousled just left the salon look.  Love it and ordering more to keep in my purse!!
