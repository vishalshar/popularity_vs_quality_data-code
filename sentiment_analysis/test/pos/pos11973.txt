This is an excellent product.  It is packaged well to avoid damage to the bag or possible contamination.  We had been using a corn based xylitol but with concerns about GMOs and wanting to avoid grain products, we switched and this product meets the need.  We did have to adjust the amount used as it seems to be sweeter than sugar and we limit the amount used per day to avoid any intestinal discomfort.
