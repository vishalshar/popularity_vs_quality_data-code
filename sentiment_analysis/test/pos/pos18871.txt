These buds are phenomenal.  I know I paid a small premium over market price, but I regret nothing.They sound great, and I have had no issues.  I think they sound on par with my PowerBeats 2 Wireless buds.Package presentation is great.Features and software (version 1.4 as of now) are flawless.Sound is 9/10.Range is fine, when I carry the device.  I do t often leave my phone away from my pocket.  If you try to walk around without your device, you may have issues.I can't wait to see what his company does from here.
