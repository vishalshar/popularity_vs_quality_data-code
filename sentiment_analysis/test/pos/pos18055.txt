I cannot say enough good things about this deodorant. I've tried every brand deodorant/antiperspirant available at local stores such as Walmart & Target, both women's and men's. Nothing has made me stop sweating, nothing has made me stop stinking. I've always smelled like a combination of sweat and whatever scent the deodorant was.I made the decision this year to switch my family over to more natural products. This was the first product I switched to. I was amazed. I tried Tom's deodorant in the past and ended up with a nasty rash. I was expecting the same with this. In nearly four months I haven't experienced any type of rash or bad reaction. I live in Florida so I was expecting to have to reapply this multiple times throughout the day. I normally put it on around 8am, and it lasts all day. Even when hiking in 80 degree heat, it holds up. The strange thing is that this isn't an antiperspirant, but I sweat considerably less with this than conventional (even "clinical strength") deodorant/antiperspirant combos. I don't stink either. I've tried the lavender, thyme lemongrass & jasmine varieties. Not once have I smelled like a strange sweat and perfume combo.It's also worth mentioning that I've tried the jar and stick versions. I prefer the jar. I don't find the stick as easy to apply. It has beeswax added to maintain a solid stick form, and that seems to make it drag across my skin rather than blend in smoothly like the original jar version. The directions say to hold it to your skin for a few seconds to allow it to warm up, but that doesn't help me much. My husband however prefers the stick. He says he doesn't have the time or patience to be rubbing something into his armpits before work. I think it actually takes less time to blend the jar version in, versus waiting for the stick to warm up. I do think it has an advantage for travel applications though. I put my pit stick into my camping bag so that I don't have to worry about applying it with dirty fingers while I'm out in the woods.As far as scents go, out of the three I've tried (lavender, thyme lemongrass & jasmine), I prefer the lavender or thyme lemongrass. My husband likes the thyme & lemongrass, the first day I wore it he came home from work and asked if I was eating candy. It smells like very sweet lemonade. The lavender is herbal but not overpowering. The jasmine is my least favorite, it reminds me of a soap or perfume my grandmother used to wear. My husband says he doesn't mind it on me, but he definitely wouldn't wear it.
