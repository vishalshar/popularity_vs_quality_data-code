The camera works as expected, but has a hugely reduced field of view compared to the Samsung S3's camera.  When trying to get the images to match via the swipe screen, the normal light camera often hits maximum zoom and produces less than optimal composite pictures.For the price this is a good entry tool to the Thermal world though and will no doubt help to pick up hot spots in switchboards before they become fire hazards.
