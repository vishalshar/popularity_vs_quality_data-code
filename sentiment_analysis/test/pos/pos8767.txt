Great product!  Tastes very good and adds automatic protein to vegetable dishes.  Sometimes, it is overpriced. Then I do not buy it.  I refuse to spend more on pasta than people spend on good quality meat. $10 a pound is too much for pasta, no matter how it's packaged.  It's not even organic and beans are cheap.  I don't buy meat for environmental and health reasons, but neither do I want to pay for trendiness in vegetable alternatives. I hope they are in this for the long term and stabilize at reasonable prices. .
