I was so happy to find a basic, non-gendered, red kid's bike that wasn't covered in sparkle-princess-fairy nonsense nor superhero-smash-aggression garbage. My 5 year old wanted a red bike and this one is just right for her. She's about 44" tall and this bike fits great. It's sturdy, easy for her to ride, and I really like that it has both coaster brakes and a hand brake. It's good practice for her and helps her easily control her speed when going downhill. This is an excellent starter bike.
