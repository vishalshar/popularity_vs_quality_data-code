Compact and unobtrusive on my key ring.  Goes perfectly with my Key Smart too.  No need to carry cords now to festivals with a battery pack.  Got my boss a Mini-USB one for as a Christmas gift since she is always forgetting a charging cable for her Android phone (always ended up giving her my Jawbone cable to use).  She loved it.
