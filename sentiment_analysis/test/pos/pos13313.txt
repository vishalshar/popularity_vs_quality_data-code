Great looking, great working.  Replaced my FitBit Charge HR with this.  This doesn't have heart rate function but I never found the HR particularly functional either.  The App for this - Health Mate - does have function for heart rate.  Of course, long battery life is also a big advantage over other trackers.  I would certainly recommend this to anyone.
