I knew I wanted a hardware firewall to protect my home network as I have a smart home. Counting computers/phones/ipad/kindle/thermostat/cameras/lights etc there are more than 25 items on my network.I looked at several items and this one appears to be the best in terms of what it does and the critical app (on iphone) that controls it. Bitdfender Box has had some apparent issues with their app and Cujo's app appears to work well.BEFORE I purchased I called Cujo and spoke with a tech support person (Iggy M) who was great. He really answered all my questions and helped put my mind at ease that this device was not difficult to set up and would not "mess up" my router or my network.I ordered the device on a Friday, received it the next day and Iggy spent about 30 minutes on the phone with me helping me configure device and MAKING SURE it was working.SO FAR, SO GOOD. I had one attempted hack picked up 3 days ago which was blocked and I was notified.Amazon now has the device for $23 less than when I bought it. WIsh I had ordered it now.
