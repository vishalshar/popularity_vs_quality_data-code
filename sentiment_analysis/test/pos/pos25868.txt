Arrived right away, but limited instructions, no details as to light exposure levels or temperatures needed to grow oyster mushrooms. I have had large success growing button mushrooms in the past, but nothing from this kit so far.6/1/2015 Update :I am changing my review to add more stars. After doing some research on oyster mushroom growing, I find that the requirements are the same for button mushroom growing. Namely, 55-65 degrees Fahrenheit, and kept in the dark. I did this by putting the block of oyster mushrooms in a larger cardboard box with a lid that covers the top. After a month of nothing, two weeks after putting the mushroom block in a large box, covered to keep it dark, and placing this in an air conditioned room at 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and spritzing it daily with water, I noticed some "budding" on the surface of the block. A week after that I had what appeared to be tubes growing up from the block. A day or so later they formed circular disk shaped mushrooms.I really enjoy growing my own mushrooms. Kits simplify the job somewhat, but I want to set up some shelves in an air conditioned back room and grow mushrooms from purchased spawn on cardboard boxes that I save to recycle. When the mushrooms are done with the cardboard box pieces, the boxes are compost for the garden, or potted plants.I would now award 5 stars instead of 1, except for the fact that the instructions were so lacking. This could be fixed by sending customers to the internet for more information.I would recommend it now and give it 4 out of 5 stars.
