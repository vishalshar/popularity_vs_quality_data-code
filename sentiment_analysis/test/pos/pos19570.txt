The brush guards are great for keeping the shape of most style of makeup brushes, though they are obviously not intended for speciality shapes like fan brushes.  I use these after washing my brushes in order to keep their shape as well as to elevate them so they do not sit in any water that has dripped down as they dry.  I also use them when I bring a few brushes in a makeup case/bag while traveling.  They have held up well and I've not had any begin to deteriorate.  I would purchase these again in a heartbeat...and that may be sooner than later as I just moved and I'm not quite sure where my Brush Guards are now.
