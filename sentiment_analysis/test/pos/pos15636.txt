I've been a drinker of Soylent 2.0 for several months now, and finally tried Coffiest. It tastes amazing. It's like Soylent 2.0, mixed with coffee. The flavor is like a frappucino, but with virtually no sugar and a hint of dark chocolate. I don't notice the caffeine in this, but I'm a regular coffee drinker.Like Soylent 2.0, this is a nutritionally complete, meal replacement. The only difference is this is missing the 20% Vitamin A and C. This works great for a wake up every morning.
