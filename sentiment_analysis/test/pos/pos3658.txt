I was using Kuna Security System for about 3 months. I would give it 3.5 stars, if Amazon allowed it.What I like:The recorded/live video is of good quality at day (720p). Colors are good and I am able to see details.Camera has quite wide angle and with manual tuning it can cover most of my sidewalk.App is OK, I can access all necessary functions.The preview function is quite good. I rarely now watch full video because of this.What I don't like:It does not catch events at night time well and also I can barely see things even though 60W lamp is  turned on. Definitely IR light is needed to make it fully 24x7.It misses sometimes events especially when a person does not pass immediately below light, but rather 3 meters away.Ideally there should be another plan to keep recording for 24 hours. It should be half of essential price ~2.5 dollars per light per month. Integration with google drive or AWS would be great too. AWS integration would be especially great.App sometimes slow or don't show live/recorded  videos and you need to restart it to stop misbehaving.Lantern light blinds camera unless camera is turned all the way from camera.I turned detection all the way to 100%, because it was missing events. It causes now a lot of false positives especially when sun go over my front-yard. Not a big deal, but it takes some time to check all videos because of it.In general there is a lot of space for improvements for this system. Especially I hope they deal with missed events.
