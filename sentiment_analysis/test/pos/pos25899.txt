Fun amp. This is my second Line 6 amplifier, my other is a Spider IV 120. Personally I like the overall tone of the Spider IV better, it definitely has more on the bottom end. However the AMPLIFI 150 is a more attractive amp and I appreciate the lighter weight and extended capabilities. Being able to control your sound with a smart phone is definitely a nice feature. Honestly though once I found the sounds I wanted I programmed my FBV Shortboard MKII and rarely access the amp with my phone. Still happy I made the purchase.
