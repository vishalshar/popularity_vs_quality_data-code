Truly love this switch and the technology behind it. I have been upgrading my home with several WiFi based devices, and for a long time, I have been wanting to update multiple light switches with WiFi capability, allowing me to remotely operate them while away, as I hate coming home to a dark house - an obvious sign (at night) that no one is home with all the lights off.After seeing multiple mixed reviews, I was hesitant about making the purchase, so I went ahead and ordered (2) switches to operate my front outdoor lights & entry way lights, allowing me to test the switches to see if they would function well. A friend assisted me with the installation, and the process was uneventful, and I am very happy with the aesthetics of the switches themselves - specifically of the small Green power symbol when the lights are on, and the small White light that is emitted when powered off - handy to navigate towards when dark, versus "feeling" for the light switches as before.Others have complained about the app and other aspects of the functionality, but I am very pleased with the way the light switches work, along with the app as well. Pairing the lights to the app and using the app is very easy. Further, the ability to setup my front outdoor lights to come on at dusk at turn off at dawn (also accounting for the time change correctly) is an awesome feature, as I literally never need to turn these lights on or off again - fantastic.After a few weeks of use, I did receive a prompt for a firmware update, which I was happy about - makes me feel that the manufacturer is making improvements and correcting any issues that may be at play. However, I have had zero complaints so far, and I am sure more updates will be en-route with new features. The sky truly is the limit with technology like this, as change is simply a firmware update / app update away.So far I have had the switches installed for close to a month, and they have worked flawlessly. I love having control over the lights when I am away - the perfect example of me being able to turn on my entry way light while out shopping with my wife, making it seem as if someone was home, which is what I appreciate the most. Further this with IFTTT technology and many other cool features that can be utilized via the app, and this switch is well worth the money.Overall, I am very impressed with this light switch system, and already have friends & family that will be installing them after seeing my switches at work. Now that I have a feel for this switch and know of its reliability, I will be purchasing (8) more to outfit many other lights in my home, giving me a massive amount of control over my home when away.Excellent product - a must have for anyone wanting to bring some smarts to their home!
