These guys care. I had a couple hiccups along the way and they were Johnny on the spot with fixing them, even on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The support on this product is probably top 3 if not #1 of other purchases I have made. DO NOT FEAR buying this. Yes it's expensive but it does what it says and for a year you will have fantastic support.
