I really like my new sidekick remote!! I had to watch the "how to" video several times and make several attempts to get it synced with my Direct TV & TV remote. I still haven't been successful at syncing the up and down channel buttons, but they aren't important for using my Apple remote. I also love the fact that the sidekick makes my tiny Apple remote more difficult to lose. I lost my original remote and had to order another one, so this one is hooked to my Sidekick! Changing the input, adjusting the volume and even muting volume are features I use on my Sidekick. Makes using my Apple TV so much easier!!
