I'm very impressed with the quality and features of my Bluesmart. I am always looking for outlets in airports and am excited to no longer have to sit on the floor waiting for my devices to charge. The high quality suitcase itself and sleek design make this a great purchase even without the tech. The front pocket to hold my computer is helpful as well.The suitcase is on the smaller end, as described, given that it is built to International requirements. It is still good for short trips and I no longer have to worry that my bag will be gate checked due to size issues.
