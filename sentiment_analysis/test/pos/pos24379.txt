Powerful stuff here, it's strong, super strong.  The instructions recommend 1/3 cup of Bizzy and then 2/3rds cup of water or milk to make a serving.  I used milk with my first glass and let me tell ya, it still had that strong coffee kick to it.I bring that up not as a downside, but just as a warning I guess.  If there are any coffee drinkers out there like me that like their coffee to taste as little like coffee as possible, don't expect to just raw dog this and be fine.  There are other similar-ish products on Amazon that DO have a softer taste to them and are easier to get down for coffee drinkers like me.  This ain't no weak regular-ass coffee, it's good stuff!  Just know you'll still have to doctor it up a bit with sweeteners and such if you don't really like a pure coffee flavor.
