UPDATE-7/30/2016 - I had a small connectivity issue with the device.  I was only able to go 500ft or so and then would lose connectivity with the video feed.  Contacted support and they answered on the second ring with a live human who spoke perfect english.  They were very helpful and they even had one of their engineers helping to answer my questions.  Turns out it was something simple.  The tablet I was using was not powerful enough to do the job.  Swapped out tablets with a newer one and it works beautifully.  Took it to 1500ft yesterday with a very stable connection.  Just haven't been brave enough to go over that yet.I can't recommend this company or their product highly enough.  They understand customer service and have built a brilliant drone.  No complaints after around 3 weeks of ownership.  Only thing I will say is buy a couple of extra batteries.  20 minutes is not enough and you are going to want to stay out longer than that.Speaking of batteries, I bought my X-Star below MSRP and outside of the promotional dates for their free battery promotion that is going on this summer.  Even so, I decided to submit the paperwork to see if it would be honored.  To my shock, I got an email from them saying that even though I technically did not qualify for the promotion, they would honor it anyway just for being a loyal customer.  They said they were sending out the battery soon.  So beyond thrilled with the level of customer service I have received so far from Autel  I could just go on and on.BUY THIS DRONE!!!  STOP THINKING ABOUT IT AND BUY IT!!!!!  YOU WON'T REGRET THIS PURCHASE.ORIGINAL REVIEW-7/14/16  This is my first drone so let me say that up front.  I am having so much fun with this bird.  It is incredibly user friendly and easy to fly.  I have taken it up for 2 flights so far and was able to manually take off and land on the first try.  Haven't pushed it to its limits by any means yet but I can't imagine many other drones doing better than this one.  The picture quality is incredible and I am not getting the screen flare that other users have reported.  Anyway, I am charging up right now to go fly again.  I will update this review in a month or so once I get a good feel for it.
