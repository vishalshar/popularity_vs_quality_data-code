Hatch Baby's customer service support is fantastic. We have always had trouble with our home wifi, and had some trouble getting the pad connected to my internet. I emailed Hatch Baby for some technical support and got an email response back almost immediately with detailed instructions to help me troubleshoot my internet issues. They even offered to do a video chat to help me walk through my set-up! I was so thankful to get a response from a real person. What a great product from a great company!
