So far, so good. I bought a much more expensive gaming laptop right before this, but had to return it because the screen stopped working within 24-hours. I've been using this one for over a week now and I've really liked it. I haven't used it for gaming--I do data analysis. But, for my purposes, it's been easily satisfactory. The screen resolution is nice, but I do seem to struggle between "that's too small to read" and "now it's sort of fuzzy for being enlarged." This is likely a simple settings issue which I'll figure out at some point. I wish the keyboard keys were lighted.Update: the keyboard DOES have backlighting, but without a manual and not being familiar with the keyboard icons, it just took me over a week before I realized what the function + f3/f4 were.
