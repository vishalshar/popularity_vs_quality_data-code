I was told by my local church that the use of such dice may lead to my soul being stolen by Satan. After one month of rolling these dice I have not seen the appearance of the Satan or anything you could describe as a satan. In spite of that I still give these dice a 5 star rating for craftsmanship. However do not buy if you wish to see the supernatural.
