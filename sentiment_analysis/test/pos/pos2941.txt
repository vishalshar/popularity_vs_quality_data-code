This is a great product. Well designed and nice looking. I ended up returning it only because I have limited counter space and was undecided if I wanted another thing to take care of. The idea of having fresh basil whenever I want it was tempting. Also, the 3-pack replacements are $20 each and would last a couple of months. Not sure I would use enough to justify the cost.
