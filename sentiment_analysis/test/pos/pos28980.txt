The Seek Thermal Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) Imager is amazing!  The camera uses an uncooled, Vanadium Oxide, 206 x 156 pixel, microbolometer focal plane array whose spectral response extends from 7.2 Â– 13 micrometers.  The final thermal jpeg images are 832 x 624 pixels (expanded 4 times).  The camera and software work with my Motorola Droid RAZR HD running the Android 4.4.2 OS as well as my wife's Motorola Droid Ultra running the Android 4.4.4 OS.  The camera periodically uses a thermal reference shutter to allow stable continuous thermal images.  Apparent temperatures can be displayed.  You can create IR images using your choice of multiple color look up tables or black and white for the image representations.  One option uses a side by side visible color image (from the cell phones camera) and a thermal image.  Because these two cameras are offset parallax occurs.  Both low frame rate video and still imagery is supported by the camera and software.  I have used image processing software to enhance the images and it seems that the black and white images are the easiest images to interpret.  The attached processed, black and white thermal image (white is hot) is of an exterior wall of my home which was built in 2002.  You can easily see the wooden studs behind the sheet rock wall on exterior walls when it is cold outside.  I would imagine that the jpeg thermal images can be read as an array of numbers for those wanting to examine the image more closely.  Although the camera connects properly to the Motorola cell phones, I have used an OTG cable to allow connection to our Motorola Droid smart phones when the phones are used with plastic protective cases such as the Otterbox.  This makes a more reliable electrical connection which prevents the software from crashing.  This LWIR camera is the most capable, least expensive LWIR thermal imager available today.  It is a lot of fun!
