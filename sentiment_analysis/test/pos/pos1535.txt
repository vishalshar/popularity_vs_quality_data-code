This thing is amazing. It integrates Java after the first use, It integrates any and all minecraft files, and even comes built with many of the popular modpack launchers! There seems to be some confusion as to what the "Full Version" vs "Demo Version" of minecraft actually are in the questions section here. Yes this band comes with a completely functioning minecraft executable. The only thing you need to have to play the "Full Version" is a minecraft account(Purchased Separately).Beware, despite being connected over USB 3.0 there is still some inherent lag. Even though USB 3.0 has transfer speeds that rival that of SSDs It's the initialization of each new transfer that bottlenecks in USB 3.0. This causes the game to have some latency issues. I would rate the performance somewhere slower than minecraft played on a normal hard drive and faster than minecraft played on an online multiplayer server. The latency issues from the band are somewhat different that normal multiplayer lag though. Sometimes the flash drive "sleeps" (in a way) so that if you have not broken a block in a while you get a short few seconds where your block breaking isn't doing anything while it "wakes up" the flash drive to write your newly broken blocks to the world save.Also if you plan to play some of the bigger modpacks, like a lot of what feed the beast has to offer, Expect some pretty serious slowdowns. It's still playable over USB 3.0 but these modpacks will be nearly impossible to play over USB 2.0.It sucks that this little thing is limited by modern technology from being a perfect device but it works fantastically for Vanilla Minecraft and I highly recommend it for anyone who is on more than one computer with their minecraft worlds. The creators truly did everything humanly possible to make this thing the most amazing flash drive you will ever play minecraft from and with the cloud backup you never have to loose another minecraft world! I know I've lost many of them.
