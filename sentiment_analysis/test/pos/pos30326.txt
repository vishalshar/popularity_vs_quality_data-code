A fantastic phone all around, especially at the current price 12-05-2016 price.I bought two of these as gifts- with 100gb of cloud storage and it's quick system makes this phone a great purchase. The only thing this phone fails at is taking pictures with it. They don't all come out good or nice. Don't get me wrong you will be able to take some good pictures, but with a lot , a lot of misses. But I am still giving it five stars because its a great company to buy from with it's outstanding customer support and dedication to it's product. AND the speed of this phone is amazing.  If taking pictures is extremely important to you, then skip it. If not then GO For it BUY IT!
