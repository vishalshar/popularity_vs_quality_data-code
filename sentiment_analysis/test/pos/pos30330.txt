Had the gadget for about a week and it seems pretty accurate. It's snapped onto my Tempurpedic pillow which is pretty heavy and firm. I was worried that there wouldn't be enough movement with a heavy foam pillow for correct readings, but this has proven an unfounded concern. The sleep pill has reported my sleep times within a few minutes of actual every night so far. What I really like is that I don't need to remember to perform a procedure before going to bed, such as wearing a gadget or pressing a button. Just go to bed and it does all the work. Would purchase again.
