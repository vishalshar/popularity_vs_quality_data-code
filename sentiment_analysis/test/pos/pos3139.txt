I've been using miniMD by Trophy skin for about 2 weeks , so far I'm very pleased with this product, my face looks cleaner and it feels smother after my treatment, it removes all the dead skin .My face gets a little irritated when I do my treatments, but I use vitamin c cerum plus a pure moringa oil so my face won't feel so dry with the vitamin c cerum. I usually do it at night, I see the difference in the morning when the redness is gone. I recommend this product. I love it??I will update soon on my progress. I have a couple of dark spots on my cheeks that I'm hoping to get rid of along with premature wrinkles.
