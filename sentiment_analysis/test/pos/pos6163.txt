First ordered a pawbo which didn't work properly.. So I returned that and ordered a petzi. The price was better than the pawbo. Very easy to install it. There is a bit of a lag but it's okay. The quality of the camera is good. When the treat comes out, it kind of chucks it far. Overall I love my petzi!
