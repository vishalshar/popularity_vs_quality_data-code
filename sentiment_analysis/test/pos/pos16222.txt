Success! After numerous attempts to resync base to craft with the first Email address,Crazybabys US cust service Email immediately sent me more detailed pairing instructions to correct the subwoofer in the base not pairing up with the upper hover craft.Problem I was having was not releasing craft power button at EXACTLY the moment the second lite bar comes on the upper crafts pairing mode (after putting base into its beeping pairing mode, which can be tricky also). A long audible base beep confirms when pairing is working between the two units,wow what a difference the base makes! If you donÂ’t catch that exact moment after the second lite bar comes on the Craft , the  base just wont pair up.This is back to 5 stars for an excellent sounding product along with excellent cust service.Thx Crazybaby!
