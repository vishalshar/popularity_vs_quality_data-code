Received it yesterday, worked great.  Used the restroom after dark last night and it lit the way as soon as I entered the restroom door, and looked really cool in the process.  Today it does not work at all.  Even though I put in 3 new AAA batteries yesterday, I decided to to replace them with 3 more new batteries to test.  It does not work.  One day and dead.  Maybe I received a dud.  I also read about suction cups not sticking to the toilet, I did not experience any issue with the suction cup, just a dead device.Update, I must have received a defective unit the first go around, however the company sent me a new unit, and it works beautifully.  I wanted to use the new unit for a couple weeks before updating.  I have not had any issues with suction cups losing suction.  The motion detector works very well illuminating the bowl before I even breech the bathroom doorway.  I have mine set to the aqua blue, and it is plenty bright to illuminate the Target area, without being so bright that it wakes you completely for the middle of the night trips to the bathroom.  So I am changing my review from 1 star to 5 stars, for a great and useful product, as well as excellent customer service from a company that stands behind their product.  Thanks.
