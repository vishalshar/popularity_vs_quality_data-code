I am a previous user ofÂ Whistle Activity Monitor For Dogs.  I stopped using my activity tracker some time ago after my dog managed to kill it.  I missed checking up on what my dog, Sunshine, was up to from work and decided to go for the newer product.The two devices are similarly sized, although the GPS device has wings that extend from the device.  These wings go along the length of the collar and don't seem to add any meaningful bulk to the collar or device.  I've attached a photo of Sunshine to show her off and to give everyone an idea of the size of the device.  The two devices both use the same IOS app, which I've found to be a nice user experience with a mix of some features I enjoy using, such as activity tracking and other features which I have no problem ignoring, such as all the social aspects.When I received the device I immediately had to give the GPS features a test run to see how accurate and responsive they were, given some of the negative reviews.  As noted by many other reviewers, the notifications for leaving the whistle zone don't happen immediately, but in my experience they came in within a few minutes.  My dog isn't the type of dog to roam far from home, so in the accidental event of Sunshine being let out unsupervised, I feel as though I'd easily be able to contact a neighbor with her position to assist in locating her and getting her home.Overall I can't reconcile my experience with this device and the experience of other reviewers.  I've only had the device for about a week, but so far it seems like a nice improvement in features over the whistle activity monitor.
