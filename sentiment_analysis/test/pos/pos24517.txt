LOVE this bag. I'm a sucker for pockets and this has tons of them. I do crossfit style workouts, so I can fit my workout clothes, shoes, shower shoes, and shower toiletries along with my workout gloves and be fine. Just know, the bag is not huge, it's similar to a small gym bag. If you want to fit a lot of things, I suggest getting the duffle bag. Another person at my gym has it and it definitely has more room.Also, shoes do not fit in the shoe compartment if you have average size (size 9 female) shoe size. It works fine for me because I use that section for my shower shoes.I do love it and highly recommend it!
