We love the OmieBox.  I have wanted something like this ever since my daughter started preschool 3 years ago and I finally found it a few weeks ago.  This is an amazing product which will work for your family if your kids like warm lunches, like mine do. It is very easy to wash as well and we have had no issues with leakage.  I highly recommend this product.
