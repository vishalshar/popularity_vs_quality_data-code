Ordered your curtain keepers and really like them but you should include 4 in the pack instead of 3, it just does not have enough weight to hold the curtain away with only 3. Now I am debating if I should order another set so I can add 1 more to the curtain to keep it from blowing on me. Include 4 in the package and your product would be a solid 5 stars!
