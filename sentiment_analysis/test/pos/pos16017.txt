I started coaching my nephews recreational football team, and I have been helping him with his receiver position because I used to play one when I was younger. I grabbed this product to help improve the grip on his gloves, which I was able to get approval from the league, and it has been awesome. Its really easy to use, and the best part is that it dries lighting quick, so he doesnt have to sit for a while and wave his hands around to dry them. It improves the grip the he is able to get on the ball, and doesnt have a very sticky feeling. His reception completions have improved by around 15%, which is great. I have been really impressed with this grip booster, and was told by some of the other parents that they even picked some up for their kids too.
