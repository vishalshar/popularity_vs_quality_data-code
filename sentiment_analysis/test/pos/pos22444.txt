I have 2 zones in my house that get poor wifi signals from my main router.  I recently purchased the Securifi Almond 2015 to replace a Netgear AC1200 wifi range extender.  I also have an Almond that I purchased in 2014, which replaced an Almond that I bought in 2013.  I bought the Netgear AC1200 and the Almond 2014 to compare side by side.The pros:  The Almond 2015 definitely has a longer range than the older Almonds, and it is also better than the Netgear. The touch screen setup could not be simpler.  I had to call customer service because I had an issue with my xFinity modem dropping the Almond.  Securifi customer service is outstanding - as good as any I have had from a technology provider, and much better than most.The cons:  My Almond 2013 touch screen died after about 18 months - this meant that I  could not reconnect it after I had to reset my wifi network (this is why I purchased the Almond 2014 and Netgear AC1200 to compare).  The Almond 2015 comes with a "Peanut" which is a pretty cool device that enables you to control power to a device using an app through your Almond 2015.  You need to get a code sent to your Almond device to do this - I tried several times but never got the code.  At some point I will call customer service, but haven't yet had time.  These are the reasons for the 4 star rather than the 5 star rating.  If my two new Almonds last longer than 2 years, I will update the star rating to 5.Comparison with the Netgear AC1200.  For the layout of my house the Almond 2015 has a longer range and stronger signal than the Netgear AC1200 (the Netgear had a slightly stronger signal than the Almond 2014).  It takes maybe 1/10th of the time to set up an Almond compared to the Netgear.  The Netgear requires a modicum more technical skill and understanding of how range extenders work.  This also means that you save time if for any reason you have to re-set; the Almond is so much simpler. As the Netgear needed to be re-set a few times, I gave up and replaced it with the Almond 2015 which has, so far, worked much more effectively.  If choosing a range extender, I definitely recommend the Almond 2015.
