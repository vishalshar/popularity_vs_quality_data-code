I have had my Robox printer now for about two months and I can say that I LOVE IT!This is a really easy to use printer and the models I make come out great. I like that Robox has an 800 number that I can call when I have questions. I called a few times when I first received the printer and they helped me with the entire setup. They were friendly and really helpful.The software is easy to use and gives me a lot of options. I like that I can choose between printing in a draft mode or create something really high definition in a fine setting. The software allows me to decide how solid or hollow I want the model which really saves on filament. I have printed a lot of models and still have the filament the printer came with. Seems very efficient!The print bed is heated which is important. I have heard that it is common for models not to stick with other printers. I had trouble in the beginning but the tech support guys walked me through a few calibrations and now everything sticks perfectly without tape on the print bed.The printing area has a see through door that can close and lock so I can keep the kids away from the hot parts while still watching it print.I would recommend this printer to anyone who is looking for a high quality 3D printer that is easy to use and prints well!
