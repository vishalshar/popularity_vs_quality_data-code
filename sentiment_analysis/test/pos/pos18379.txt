As a previous tile user and owner, I was frustrated when I could not replace the battery in my Tile. So I decided to give TrackR a try. I primarily use this for my wallet and I must use the app to locate it 4 times a week because I am a special kind of idiot.The size is awesome compared to the original tile size imbedded inside of my wallet, however, TrackR volume is not NEARLY as loud as the tile which IS a problem for me and why I knocked off 1 star.When I hit the locate button in Tile, I can hear the audio through my wallet from rooms away. The TrackR volume feels like half of the output of the Tile and there have been times when I am a few feet away from it and can barely hear it. Mind you, the device is buried in my wallet, and then could be in a couch cushion, but this was never a problem with Tile.However, the piece of mind to open the app and go "oh crap! where's my wallet!" and see that it's at my house is always a good feeling.
