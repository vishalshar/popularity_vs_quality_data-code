This ZIPP Mini is an amazing speaker, and the first product I've ever felt strongly enough about to review.It's genius right out of the box and totally ready to go, it's design is sleek and cool, and it's controls and app are flawless and intuitive--couldn't be easier to use. Wifi set up is a breeze and it works fantastically with Spotify, sounds flawless through iTunes/Bluetooth, does fantastic as an additional speaker with my HiFi at home, and even does awesome as a speaker phone. I've had other, similar speakers and this blows all of them out of the water in terms of design, controls and sound quality.As for the most important measure, it's sound quality, this thing is genius. All my Jazz tunes play vibrantly and the instrumentation/vocals come through spectacularly well with all the shades of tone and subtlety of voicing, and with rough and gritty rock/blues etc. this thing has guts!Great speaker, amazing value, technically brilliant: all thumbs up!!!
