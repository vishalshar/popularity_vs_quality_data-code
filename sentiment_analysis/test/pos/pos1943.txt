I absolutely love my Feed and Go.  I have two of them, one for each of my cats.  I feed them wet food twice per day.  I wanted an automatic feeder because I have to work late sometimes and feel really bad making my cats wait to eat their dinner.  The ability to have it feed them on a schedule is really nice too so that I don't have to remember to do it remotely while I'm at work.  The mobile site is super easy to use.  The webcams are also fun so I can make sure each cat is actually eating their food.  The feeders are short and wide so that the cats can't knock them over.  I've also seen one of my cats get pretty aggressive with it trying to make the tray turn prematurely but was unsuccessful, so I was pleased to find out that the tray is actually very secure.  I love my cats very very much, but one of my favorite things about the feeders is that the cats don't associate me with meal time anymore--they used to bombard me in the morning, running over my face to wake me up and feed them.  Now, they just wait patiently for the tray to turn and leave me in peace.The CEO Marissa is also super great!  My cats have issues drinking enough water so I have to add it to their food.  Recently I accidentally spilled some of the water outside the tray, and it went down into the computer board, and the feeder stopped working (it took a couple weeks for the damage to really break it).  Marissa personally contacted me to find out more about the issue.  I sent them directly to her and she opened them up, sent photos and an explanation of the damage, and then even did the repair herself!  This is a fantastic company and an awesome product and I would recommend it to anyone. A zillion stars.
