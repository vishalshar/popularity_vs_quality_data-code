I took a chance with this bed because of all the reviews and I'm glad I did. We love it. At first the bed feels very firm whether sitting or lying, but after a few seconds you sink into the bed. We also bought a metal frame from Zinus to put the mattress on for good support. It was cheaper than getting a GhostBed boxspring and it's higher so now we have extra storage space under the frame.If you are considering this bed, buy it, it's worth the money.
