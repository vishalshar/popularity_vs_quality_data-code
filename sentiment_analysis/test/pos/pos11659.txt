I have been a fan of Peanut Butter & Co.'s peanut butter for a long time, so I was really excited to try out the Mighty Nut Powdered PB. These are so great to add into smoothies, oatmeal, yogurt, etc. I really love that they are only 1 Weight Watchers Smartpoint per 2 tbsp serving, so I have it with an apple or banana for a filling afternoon snack.
