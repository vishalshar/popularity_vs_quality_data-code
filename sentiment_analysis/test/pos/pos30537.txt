I bought this to read the temperatures on some motor drive electronics I'm building.  I've used Fluke IR imagers in the past and this compares favorably, considering the price.  It's simple to use, easy to capture and upload screen shots, and I really like the video feature.  The resolution isn't as high as you'll find in a (much) more expensive imager, but it's plenty good enough for determining the temperature of components on a board, or looking for hot spots in a piece of machinery.  I'm very pleased with it.  I've been using it for about 6 weeks on a Samsung Note 3 smart phone.
