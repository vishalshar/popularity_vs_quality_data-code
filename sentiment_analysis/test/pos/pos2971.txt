Got myself one of these because I was hankering to grow some oyster mushrooms.  I usually do my own baskets....  But this time I got lazy, didn't feel like going through all the sterilizing.Anyways, the box looks great, the directions are clear and accurate for the most part.Just one tiiiiiny little problem.  There are not NEARLY enough holes for the mycelium to escape once it starts pinning.  Within 5 days I had 3 pins smushed up against the plastic, nowhere near the holes.(for those of you not knowledgeable about mycology, pinning is the growth of baby mushrooms on the mycelium block.)So I cut my own holes in the plastic.  Next day, the pins were happily jutting out of the holes I had made, as if to thank me for granting them freedom from their plastic prison.Good purchase overall.  Just be sure to cut *ALOT* more holes in the bag.
