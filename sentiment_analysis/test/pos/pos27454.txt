Freaking hysterical! Such a fun time. The reason I opted for 4 stars is this:It says for ages 8 and up (and includes several child size mouth guards), but some of the phrases on the cards are too difficult for an 8-year-old to say, let alone understand. (Ex. Fu-man-chu)It's definitely a good time for adults and can be fun for kids when the easier cards are used.
