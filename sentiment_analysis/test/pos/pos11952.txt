This is a breakthrough thermal imaging product that is one of the first that is affordable ($300 price range) to the general public as an attachment to Android or iOS phones.  Although it is not emphasized as much as it might be, it works with iOS7 or later iPads, which is what I'm using. Downloading the free app and plugging in the camera in the Lightning port gave thermal images within a few seconds.  There are several false color palettes that give temperature maps that allow differences of 1 degree F or less to be displayed.  The resolution of 206 x 156 is low compared to visual cameras but is the highest by far available in its price range.  I've been using it for neighborhood watch, wildlife spotting, and general exploration.  It is a whole new and educational way of looking at the world.A few issues that are not showstoppers: the routine to save images does not work with iOS7 iPads yet.  I contacted Seek Thermal, which says they are aware and working on a fix.  I was told the iOS8 version corrects this problem, but in the meantime, stills are available with screenshots.When the iPad is rotated from vertical to landscape mode, the image sometimes ends up upside down.  The problem can be avoided by rotating it more slowly.I note that the temperature algorithm is still being refined by the manufacturer and should not be expected to be as accurate as scientific-grade cameras costing $10 K or more. Readings for vigorously boiling water were around 210 F, albeit bouncing around several degrees because of the turbulence (the actual boiling point at my elevation) and 39 F for an ice/water mix as opposed to 32 F. Readings below these are systematically too high (15 F for a clear sky on a cold night after stabilizing vs. effective temperature of less than -40).  I used a commercial imager from another manufacturer that I also own to verify that despite the high night sky readings with the Seek, the Seek Thermal XR sensor was able to see thin clouds with temperatures under -40, matching the manufacturer's claim.Software and firmware updates are available to download free from the Seek Thermal website.  Despite the problems I mentioned, I recommend the Seek Thermal XR without reservation.
