I am enjoying my new Kuna Light. I tried the Ring Doorbell Pro with video camera and after two days I returned it. Seems the voltage in my doorbell system wasn't correct and the system kept shutting down. Now I have the Kuna, which was $110 less than the Ring Doorbell Pro. It took about 15 minutes, a wrench, screwdriver and small ladder to get the light connected. The hardest part was locating the correct breaker switch to turn off. Connection to my WiFi was pretty straightforward. I found the video installation instructions on YouTube demonstrated the installation process in a clear way in just a couple of minutes.The HD video quality is fine, but the frame rate is somewhat slow, maybe 25 fps. Sound quality is fine but with a very slight delay which is expected from a system running through WiFi. I am running the system using Kuna app on my iPhone and it is fine.The quality of the materials appear to be wonderful. I replaced a brass light fixture from a local home center that tarnished after only 2-3 years. I think the Kuna will withstand being outside much better.The light is metal, perhaps aluminum, painted with an electrostatic process.Oh BTW, I get a notice on my Apple Watch when someone approaches my door. How Cool. Love it.Update Sept 04, 2016:Had a slight nondetection of motion problem. I contacted Kuna from within the Kuna App. All of my account information was sent to Kuna and a technician emailed me back within 12 hours. He offered several suggestions to improve me motion detection sensitivity.
