THESE ARE THE BEST! The soft side feels like unicorn clouds on your face, fact. Also, the scrub fluff side is not too harsh. I have had some that feel like broken glass and others that don't scrub enough. Perfect scrubber on this sponge I tell ya! AND. It all wraps up into a germ free bundle. Totally worth it, I'll buy it again. And put it in people's stockings. And then buy more because bath products make me happy. I don't work for this company either. You're welcome to thank me later after you've bought your puff.
