Great concept and twist on an old idea.....the alphabet.  I love Scrabble and Boggle so thought I would give this a try.  I personally love these cards and love the many ways you can play with these cards so they are well worth the money.  Here's the problem though.  I would not recommend these cards to anyone who struggles with letter recognition such as dyslexia.  I could foresee frustration or possible problems arising if you do give these cards to someone with Dyslexia; especially a younger child.  But, I am not an expert in Dyslexia nor do I have experience in this area.  Do some research first just in case...better safe than sorry.
