I like this a lot. You really do BUILD the tint on your lashes, so it takes more than one coat to make a very dark look. Even one coat provides a very natural looking enhancement. The fluid itself is wonderfully NEVER clumpy, and does a great job showing up the very thin long tips to your lashes, both top and bottom. I especially like this on my bottom lashes, since in my mid-50s, I don't want a harsh eyeline or lash look, just an emphasis to make my eyes pop in a more natural and soft way. Wish it weren't so expensive compared to other mascaras.Edit late 2015: I was quite disappointed with my second tube of this product. It seems thicker, much more prone to clumping especially with the still-needed repeat application. Also seems more prone to flaking this time. Not sure I'll buy again. Sad because I had thought this was the answer to my quest for naturally enhanced lashes. Downgraded to 4 stars from my original 5 star review, to be honest I considered making it 3 stars.
