I have had this product for a week and so far it's been great! It even caught our first criminal, our dog Baci walking around our table for 30 minutes.Pros:The night vision is great! The infrared lights up the whole room so we can see just about anything that happens. Video during the day is perfect.I haven't looked at the video saved on the SD card, but the images/video I pull up on the iPhone app is clear enough to make faces.Have had no trouble with the iPhone app/browser login.Took 5 minutes to setup.Facial recognition took 2-3 days, but it recognized my wife and I every time; even when I change from contacts to glasses to sun glasses.It catches all motion in it's range of view.Notifies me of movement almost instantly. Delay on the video is only 8 seconds.The entire device is smaller than I expected. I don't notice it most of the time.No monthly fee.Cons:The motion detection is so sensitive that it gets our dog every time. Would love to turn down the sensitivity on parts of the camera.Camera is not made for outside. Looking forward to Netatmo's Presence!Does not offer a monitoring service. The only way to make sure someone is not breaking into our house is to watch the app/camera.Only offers 20 profiles. Would  love to have more.No battery backup.No alarm/siren.I am impressed by this product. It works as advertised and will only get better with future camera/app updates! I am looking forward to everything this camera can do with Tags and Presence (hopefully these come out soon). It is an impressive product and I cannot wait to see what the future holds.
