Worked on my backstrap exactly as I had hoped.  The two tightening screws are too long for my application, which means they poke out of the back and caused some discomfort on my ascent of Mt Etna.  I guess its better than coming up too short.  I'm sure every application is different.  I will cut off the extra length to solve the problem.
