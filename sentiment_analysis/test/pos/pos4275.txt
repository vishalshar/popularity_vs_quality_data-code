There is no finer drinking vessel! The horn I'd made out of durable plastic and is quite thick. Its glossy and has a shiny steel rim. It feels quite premium and expensive. The strap is good quality and easy to adjust. The only problem I have is with the stand. It seems a bit feeble, so I might craft one out of wood. It would be fun to take a dremle and carve some runes into the horn as well, since the plastic is thick enough.
