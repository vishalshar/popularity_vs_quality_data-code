Bare Fruit got it SO right with these! They're sweet but not too sweet, you could eat the entire bag and not feel guilty about calorie consumption (under 200 calories), and very satisfying if you're a snacker that can't resist eating the whole bag. Love the salty-sweet combo. It's subtle, but so tasty!
