Love the Petzi, only downsides being 1) you can't silence the 'ding' when it turns on. It actually freaks my dog out - we would like to engage it without disturbing her. She had separation anxiety so is overly sensitive 2) Sound is only 1 way (you can't listen to your pet).  This would be super helpful for when you can't see them, to understand if they are barking/freaking out.  Other functionality is great, unfortunately my dog doesn't react well to me talking to her and doesn't eat treats if we aren't there (stressed) but it works great as a camera, and love the app.
