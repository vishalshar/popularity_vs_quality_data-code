Very small kibble so it is great for all three dogs (small, med and large). I will rotate proteins from beef to lamb, chicken, etc so they will most likely never develop allergies. They gobble this food up! Stools are smaller, firmer and I like the label for the most part and this is affordable in a 40 pound bag!!!!
