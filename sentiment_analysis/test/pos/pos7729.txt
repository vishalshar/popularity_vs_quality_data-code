Initially, wasn't sure about a $$$ (before xmas) "robot" that rolls around... but it was what my kids wanted for xmas and turns out they're kind of fun to watch rolling around. Controlled by an app on their ipods, they wander around the house and make silly noises when they fall down. However, my kids haven't figured out what else more they can do than that and lose interest in about 15 min :(UPDATE: There's a lot more that these little "things" can do, the kids are figuring it out. There's lasers (sounds) that they can "shoot" at each other (two kids = two MiPs) that'll knock the other over. There's a way to make them follow the user... I'm sure there's more, but honestly, I'm just glad I don't have to figure out how to make them work and the kids are happy :)
