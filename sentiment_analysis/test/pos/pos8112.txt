Ordered the Wemo smart plug on 16 APR 16- (prime shipping, 32.99 + 2.23 tax), installed it in minutes when it arrived.It's been in use for over 5 months at the time of this review (19SEP16).-------------------------------------------------------OVERVIEW:  I use this (and several other Wemo devices) with my Echo (aka Alexa!)- which means I only use this device "locally".  (I don't have any application where I count on this device to respond to me when I'm abroad.)  This Wemo outlet works flawlessly when house-power is stable (See  below).  I have other Wemo devices that I have programmed on/off times of day... my personal application of this switch does not require any daily routines to be programmed.My only interaction with this device is voice commands (e.g. "Alexa, turn TV off").>>The outlet controls the power to the TV.  There are times when the TV has been left on and the remote is not within eyesight.  Walking through the room I can simply command Alexa to turn off the TV - and walah! for a one-time expense of 40 bucks I have solved the family conflict of "where's the *+=#$*@ remote. (and the buttons on the new TVs are too stealthy for me).The PRO's:Part of the Wemo family- Wemo's simple *but stable* cloud programming allows me to set up times of day to turn my device on or off.  Times of day can be absolute (e.g. "11:00 PM- TURN OFF") or can be relative (e.g. "Turn off 30 min after sunset").  Really... if you aren't familiar with Wemo power in your home- read up or just buy a single device to test it out.  Simple home automation done affordably well.)The CON's: Large protrusion from the outlet, bulky on the wall.  (As you can see- I gave it 5 stars because I don't care about the bulky protrusion- but this "feature" still exists). Doesn't always recover from a power outage. A power outage can be hard on devices, since it's often not a clean drop in line voltage... but more of a "brown out" situation (low voltage still present/not cool for electronic components)- or worse-a surge in power before a brown out.  This condition also impacts my wireless router (randomly)- so the inability for the switch to come back online following a power outage is also affected by my router's ability to come back online.  In the 5 months I've had this switch I've had to walk over an manually press the reset button on the rear of the device.  No biggee- unless I used this device in a remote-control scenario).  Again- this feature hasn't diminished my 5 star rating.Net Evaluation= none of the cons take away from why I purchased this device.  It's stable, provides lots of flexibility and IS a recommended buy.Would I buy another one?  The $40 price tag drives a fair amount of "need" on my part before I'll part with the cash.  I've tried other competitors with a slightly lower price, however the cloud support & set up doesn't hold a candle to Wemo.DISCLOSURE:  Wemo (nor anyone else) gave me a single nickel to write this review.  It's absolutely unbiased- I'm motivated only by the desire to share a good thing with others when I come across it.  Happy Automating.....
