This is my new favorite cooking oil. It has a very neutral flavor and is more versatile than other oils because of the high cooking point. I even started sometimes using it in my popcorn when I want the flavor of the corn to come out  instead of the oil.Like many other people, I was curious about the omega breakdown. I was hoping there would be Omega 3's in the oil (a lot of omega 3 supplements use algae oil). I e-mailed Thrive and got a very quick reply:>Great question. ThriveŽ Algae Oil has 90% Omega-9, 4.7% Omega-6 and 0.3% Omega-3. ThriveŽ Culinary Algae Oil is low in omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, which enables the extremely high smoke point.  Oils high in omega-3s contain health benefits as well, but should not be used in high-heat cooking.Low in omega 3, but as I understand it omega 9s are generally considered health-neutral i.e. not unhealthy.
