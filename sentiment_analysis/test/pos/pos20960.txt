This is a very good 5 star device, and an excellent "toy" to add to my kitchen....except it's not a "toy" any longer, but my go to method of cooking for most of my meats/most fish.  I haven't had it long enough to experiment with vegetables, but that will come.The unit seems well built.  Temperature was checked against 2 ThermoPro thermometers and a laboratory mercury thermometer, and the factory settings are spot on.  The "ring" on the top, used to set the temperature of the bath operates smoothly, and it is easy to set a temperature to 0.2째 increments.  The unit is stable and not top heavy when sitting on the bottom of the pot I use for the bath.  Previous reviewers have mentioned the circulation seems to be impeded when sitting flush on the bottom of the bath, but I observed the circulation to be more than adequate.The internet provide a plethora of information (temperatures, times) on SousVide cooking, most of which is contradictory.  For example, anyone cooking an expensive steak at 136째 expecting it to be rare is going to be in for a serious disappointment!  In this regard, the CookingGuide which comes with the unit is an excellent guide to the proper techniques, and is an excellent starting point from which to tweak the conditions.As regards the sear, I have found this is best done on a very hot gas grill, which gives a good sear after 30 seconds/side.  I found the cast iron skillet indoors was not hot enough to give the sear this quickly, and having to sear too long defeats the purpose of the whole deal.Get this unit! You won't be disappointed, and you'll make some great meals!The pictures attached are first a filet mignon, cooked very rare at 120째, followed by a sear on a hot gas grill.  The other is a loin lamb chop, cooked rare at 128째, and seared on the grill.
