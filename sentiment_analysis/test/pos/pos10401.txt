My husband has psoriasis, is extremely scent sensitive, and cannot stand the feeling of most lotions, creams, and ointments on his skin. He loves the Seaweed Bath Company unscented body lotion. It sinks right in and moisturizes without leaving any film on his skin. And while we love the citrus and peppermint scents, the unscented lotion is lovely and doesn't have the weird chemical smell that many unscented products have.
