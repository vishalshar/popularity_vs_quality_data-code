This system is absolutely AWESOME!  It was very easy to setup, connect and install...  I am totally impressed on the ease of installation and zone setup.  It took just a matter of minutes to configure each zone and test to make sure each zone worked.  In North Texas, we are under water restrictions and it was very easy to schedule water times based on these restrictions - with the old system I had to remember to turn the system off manually every other week and then remember to turn it back on!  I am anxious to see how the Weather interface works.  The WiFi was configured very easily with the iPhone and synced without issue.  I also tested connectivity via 4G iPhone data network and it worker without issue as well.  I would definitely recommend this system!
