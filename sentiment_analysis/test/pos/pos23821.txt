These are the perfect master clippers I have ever gotten! The mechanics are basically the same the only difference I feel is that this Clipper doesn't get hot as fast as a regular master. My guess is that the power is more evenly balanced because of the 3 tip connection instead of a regular 2 tips. I love this machine it's great!
