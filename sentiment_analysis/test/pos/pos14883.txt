These laces are amazing! Now I just can't live without them. I think I forgot how to tie a traditional shoe lace now :)UPDATE: After 4 months of daily use, two of the laces snapped out of the blue. They just snapped! Changing the 5-star rating to a 4-star. ;(I hope more attention is given to the quality by the manufacturer
