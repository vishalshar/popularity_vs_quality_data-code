These underwear fit as expected, have a nice big zipper in the front and you can keep your needed items close and secure.  The material is soft and feels great - the tag in the back was a little itchy to me.  The leg fittings were also a little looser than I like but I like my trunks to grip my legs.  Overall, a great fun pair of underwear.  I received at a discount for my honest review.
