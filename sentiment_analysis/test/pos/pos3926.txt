They work as advertised. I bought these because sometimes, I would buy a block of cheese and not finish it, only to find edges of it hard and uneatable. This was a major disappointment for me, so I invested in these.While these cheese bags work wonderfully, I felt they were a bit expensive for me. But then again, I don't buy expensive cheeses except on rare occassions, so if that's your style, then I'd wholly recommend these if you find yourself with leftover cheese.
