Note that I already brought these two issues yesterday to the attention of Bragi Support Team. They said that I will hear from them in 1-2 business days:ON FIT SLEEVES:I have difficulty finding the perfect fit among the fitsleeves that came with the package, specially for a swimming activity. I tried them all and as the user manual recommends, the biggest comfortable fit possible. Good thing I constantly check when I was testing it. I  almost lost the left earphone when it fell in the pool! It took some time to locate it as the color matched the dark tiles/lines  of the pool. Will there be a leash specifically designed for these headphones?  I will feel more confident to swim with the headphones and not worry it falling while swimming.ON BRAGI APP'S ACTIVITY TRACKING FEATURE:The GUI of the activity tracking  is nice. Better if an "auto-pause" mode be included. Other basic activities that I think will be useful to track will be walk (or power walk), stairs, treadmill (walk/run), or even push ups.----Will update my review particularly on the heart rate monitoring function so keep posted!
