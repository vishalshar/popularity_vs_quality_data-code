Ingnore all bad review because they clearly state they got them from target and such place. Second I'm using a friends account but to correct the wrong the the bad reviews. Now I've had 2 of these 1 over a year and a half the other 6 months the first I got for my xbox and it has never stopped working execpt once when I didn't have it plugged in all the way the second I use for school and transferring files around and it hasn't stopped working yet I don't know if there quality changed from when I last bought one but these are great (at least in my experience)Pros: great for xbox  great for transferring files  Great speed for transferringCons: I use horizon sometimes and it wouldn't pick up it but the horizon icon looked different than it did on my other computer but that would pic it up anyway but my computer would pick it up so that's horizons faultIt is large so it may block other USBs of they are large aswell
