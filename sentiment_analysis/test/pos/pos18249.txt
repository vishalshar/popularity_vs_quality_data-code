This is easily a 4-5 star mouse, but it wasn't for me. Excellent quality of materials, though I did find the textured rubber thumb grip to feel a little odd compared to the rest of the mouse, and just as with my Naos 7000, the rubber is too slippery until you "break it in". As I can attest with my Naos, though, once you do (after a month or two), it will grip just fine, though it is still a little slick for my tastes. It also definitely grips better once your hands work up a slight sweat during gameplay.The mouse buttons all feel great. Nice, light and consistent, as Omrons should be. The oft-overlooked mousewheel button uses a proper (and light) mechanical switch, so unlike Logitech mice which use cheap click pads for the middle click, you won't have to worry about wearing it out. The scrolling also feels fantastic. Quiet and smooth, and each "bump" gets tracked perfectly. No need to worry about unintentional scrolling with this mouse. I know it may seem silly, but I love a good scroll wheel, and this mouse definitely has one.The side buttons feel nice and are well-placed, easily within reach with medium-size hands (18.5 cm) and they feel nice. I don't foresee any problems with side button accessibility with small hands, either, but if your hands are relatively large you might find it a little cramped.The weight feels good and balanced at under 95g, but the cable is braided, which adds a lot of weight. I know braided cables exude "quality", but I have never really seen the benefit to them. They can snag on larger mousepads and they're heavy. The cable adds almost 50g to the overall weight of this mouse. So the mouse is technically nice and light, but certainly doesn't feel it compared to other mice of a similar size. That, combined with the shape of the body and slightly slippery exterior definitely make this mouse feel a lot more dense than it actually is. That may be a good or a bad thing for you, but I like my mice to feel as light as possible.So this is a great mouse, and I think most people will love it. They should. It really is a fantastic, quality product. But I returned it. I can't fault Mionix too much here. The shape is smart, ergonomic, and very comfortable. Your hand feels very natural resting on it. The problem, for me, is that I have never found ergonomic shapes to be as easy to aim because they almost always interfere with how I would naturally grip the mouse otherwise. You may not have the same problem as I did, but there was a little ridge for your ring finger to rest on that, for whatever reason, simply bothered me during gameplay. I simply didn't feel like I could grip or control the mouse nearly as well because of that little ridge than I would if they had simply made the sides flush. I suppose this comes down to personal preference, but I was looking for a mouse that made me feel more in control of my aiming than my Naos did, and I simply didn't find it here due to the protruding ring finger rest and the overall dense feeling of the mouse. But I'm not going to reduce my rating for the product because I honestly believe that 99% of you reading this review will be thrilled with this product. It's simply a matter of personal preference.
