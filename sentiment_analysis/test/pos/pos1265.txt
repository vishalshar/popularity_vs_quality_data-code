First thing is I have MS.  I am fortunate enough to still have a good sense of balance.  What I don't have is a prolonged strength in my legs.  So I did not want to go full on electric scooter (hopefully not for a few years anyways).  I wanted something in between.  After a lot of research I found URB-E.  My primary concern was cost.  It was way outside of my budget.  Because of the uniqueness of this device I would not get any funding (MS).  At the same time this looked to be exactly what I was hoping to find.  I took a chance and financed it.  I am happy to report that it was exactly what I was hoping for.  I live in Chicago and used to be able to walk to a great many places.  As time has gone on, my circle or area of walking was getting smaller and smaller.  Not anymore.  With URB-E I am able to go anywhere I used to be able to go and much much further.  URB-E has given back my freedom.  Right out of the box you will realize the incredible hand built quality.  Every detail is perfect.  From the battery, the airplane aluminum frame, and the very comfortable seat, all of it is extreme quality.  Setup was super easy.  After a small charge, I was ready to go.  Again living in Chicago, the sidewalks and streets can be pretty rough.  I was worried about handling and balance.  There was no need.  While my balance isn't the best, URB-E is very easy to drive and control even on the sidewalks of Chicago.  I should also mention comfort.  I am 6'2 and 175 pounds and the ride is very comfortable.  The seat is comfortable with a well adjusted spring shock absorber just below it.I cannot recommend the URB-E enough.  As I said it has given me my freedom back and I am excited every day, whether it is to just explore or run errands, I know I will have a blast.Photo includes additional basket purchased at URB-E's home page.
