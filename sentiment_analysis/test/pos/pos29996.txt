Pros:- I don't have to charge the device.- My activity and sleep data are included in a weekly email summary.- The always-on screen reminds me to achieve my activity goal.Cons:- The loop on the wrist strap gets caught on the cuffs of my dress shirts.- The analog clock feature is difficult to interpret (wish it was a numeric readout).
