Great-looking and sounding speaker for its size. It's not perfect but my overall experience has been 5 stars. I'm looking forward to seeing the Sugr team continue to update with refinements. The audio-based wifi pairing process is a bit tricky, and I can see it being frustrating for people when it doesn't "just work". Still, this is one of the more versatile and enjoyable gadgets I've bought recently. I ordered a second one now that they're on sale so that I can try the stereo pairing.
