Classic bullet pencil. Been around for decades and at one time given away as promotional items imprinted with a company's name and phone number. A simple but usable item that most anyone could use. Extends the life of a stubby wooden pencil and protects the point when not in use. You didn't see them much in recent decades. Good examples are collector's items today  Glad to see these available again even if you have to pay a lot more for them now.
