Got this for our newborn as we wanted to keep an eye on his growth especially his weight. It helps that it also doubles as a changing pad. I couldn't give it 5 stars because I know for the price that this product's functions are still at its beginning stage. We use this pad with Amazon's Echo and wish that there were more commands than just to log a wet/dirty/both diaper and which side baby was last nursed on. Either way, this fits the bill but I really would like for this and Echo's products to continue to improve.
