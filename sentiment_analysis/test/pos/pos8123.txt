I got this chair on sale. For the price I paid it is a fantastic chair. Comfortable and sturdy. My back feels great since I've been using it. The lumbar pillow works well but has gotten soft and flat pretty quickly. Arm rests have great adjustability but are kind of hard. I will probably get an armrest pillow of some kind. This chair may not be worth the full price tag since you can get other chairs with more features at around the same price. If this is on sale though it's worth a buy.
