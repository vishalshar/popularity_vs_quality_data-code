This is a great play set for the grand kids and the kids for quiet times-church, travel on airplane, rainy days! It really needs a pocket to hold all the little pieces and i really think that if 3 years olds are using it, they need to be supervised or you will lose the little pieces. It is better for 40 months or older.
