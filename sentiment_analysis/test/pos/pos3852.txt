I love this thing I bring it with me on every trip to make memories and stick them in my travel journal. It's like being harry potter when these pictures come to life right on the page. if your into SCRAPBOOKING give this a try and give a interactive aspect to your scrap book! Honestly it's so magical you gotta use it to really understand. It gives such a rush and makes me feel like im actually reliving that moment through the little 5 second video. Honestly this has got to be the most magical thing I have ever bought.
