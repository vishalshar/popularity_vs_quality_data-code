Great product! Works almost perfect... I say almost because for some reason its a little difficult for the lock to detect my touch.. Perhaps my dry skin? But after a firm touch and rub it would work.. If it was more sensitive I would definitely give it a 5 star rating,, This is the 3rd electronic type lock I've owned. First lock I had was Morning Industry Deadbolt and door lock ,, work fine but the mechanism was very weak, kids broke it when they closed the door when the stud was extended, replaced the lock 3 times. 2nd lock Kevo... horrible.. sometimes we would stand outside for minutes before we could get it to work.. Very frustrating, unreliable.... This lock by far has been the best...Wish it was linked to the web and had alerts sent to an app..Also very good quality hardware,,
