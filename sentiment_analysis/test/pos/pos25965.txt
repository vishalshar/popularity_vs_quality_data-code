I've only been using the G10 for a couple of days, but I love it, so far!  It's great not being tethered to cables any more and I haven't noticed any differences in sound quality.  It's very easy to setup and works perfectly with my Stratocaster, Ovation Elite, and Taylor 314ce.  I also have 2 different amps, one for use with my Strat and the other for my electric/acoustic guitars.  It works well with both of them.The transmitter is small/lightweight so it doesn't interfere with the feel of your guitar.  It also goes into standby mode when not being used to conserve battery life and wakes up quickly as soon as you start playing.  It's also rechargeable via the receiver base.  I've been using the G10 in my home where I do most of my practicing.
