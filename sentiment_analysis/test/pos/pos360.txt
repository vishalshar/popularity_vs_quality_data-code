Initially, I was surprised at how firm this mattress was. I didn't think I'd like it. I'm wrong a lot. This is the most comfortable mattress I've ever owned. Prior to this, I had an expensive, high-end spring mattress. I thought my back hurting was just a matter of health, and something I simply had to live with. My back hasn't hurt at all since I started sleeping on this mattress. Also, I've had sex in just about every position on this thing, and it provides for an ideal balance of... um... bounce to leverage. Buy one, immediately.
