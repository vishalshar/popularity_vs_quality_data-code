Great for the price. I am able to see my dog all day and talk to her like a crazy person. It is a bit difficult to get the camera in a specific position, but if you turn your phone sideways you can see a wider view. The laser is difficult to use as well. I wish I was able to see the camera on my laptop and just not my phone. Overall, I am impressed with the product and do not consider my cons to be that big of a deal.
