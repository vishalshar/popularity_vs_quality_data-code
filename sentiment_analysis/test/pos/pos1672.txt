This is the second time that I have ordered this product.  I bought it through Amazon about 3 months ago, from a different seller.  Xylitol was recommended to me by my dental hygienist, to prevent cavities & to help promote healthy gums.  I use it in my recipe for toothpowder and also put a small amount in the water for my Waterpik irrigator.  So far it's doing a good job.  My periodontal checkup was perfect.  And the taste is fresh without being overpowering.  I'll buy it again when I need more.
