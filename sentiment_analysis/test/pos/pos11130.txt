My German Shorthair is THE PICKIEST eater...I battled with her as a puppy trying to get her to choke down the Eukanuba puppy food her breeder recommended, then my handlers wanted me to try her on Royal Canin to try to get some weight on her--and she didn't like it either. I let myself be bullied into trying a couple of things at Petco before getting bawled out by my vet for succumbing to all the hype about certain foods--but mainly I just wanted her to EAT. My breeder suggested BillJac, which she sort of liked, but it is very dry and you can't wet it or it turns to pure mush. Then another German Shorthair showdog owner suggested I try Victor. It has the reputation for being a good food. It IS pricey, but it isn't available to me locally. Now I give her two cups of Victor beside two cups of Billjac in her bowl each evening. She alternates on which side of the bowl she goes after. Usually all four cups are gone by mid-day the next day, at which point we load her up again. She is MAINTAINING her weight--not gaining, but I find I have to really coddle her to get weight on her. Food just doesn't motivate her--unless it's blocks of cheese.
