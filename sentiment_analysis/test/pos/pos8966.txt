I placed my first Amazon order in 2002 and this is my first product review for an Amazon purchase.  The quality of this product and the exceptional customer service from PatrolTag Inc. prompted me to write this review.A bit about my security needs.  This is the 3rd security system I have owned since 2000.  My first home security system was purchased through a large nationwide provider who's name is a three letter acronym.  The system was fine, but very complex and required a 2 year monitoring commitment.  The system cost about $200 to install and $30 a month for 2 years.  Once while on vacation this company called me to tell me a motion sensor had been triggered and asked if I would like them to call the police.  Really?  I am paying these people to call me ask me if the police should be called?  I can do that myself.  I could not wait to get out of that contract.  Once I did, I told myself never again.My second security system is a self monitored system that includes all wireless sensors.  It has worked fine, but I have no way of knowing when the system is armed/disarmed or when doors were opened.  The benefit, though is that I am not paying a company to monitor it for me.  The biggest drawback is that it requires a landline for notifying me of an event.My interest has increased in new security systems recently with advent of cloud services.  Over the last several months I have investigated several crowd funded security systems that could be used in my new business.  Korner really stood out.  Especially after seeing the near perfect reviews on Amazon.Even though this product is marketed toward home security, I ordered it for my business.  The building was built in the 1920's and has numerous interior brick walls.  I mention this because it affected the number of range extenders that were purchased.  The business is located on the second floor and the only access to the space is by two doors on the ground floor.  I purchased the following items from Amazon.2 Korner Home Security range extender and additional indoor Alarm Siren1 Korner Home Security Additional Door and Window Wireless Sensor1 Korner Home Security & App, 3 Door and Window Wireless Sensors, indoor Alarm SirenDue to the fact that our entrances are on the first floor and the Stick is on the second floor, and the number of interior brick walls, I ordered 2 range extenders.  I initially did not order the range extenders, but I could not get 1 of the tags on an entrance doors to activate.  The other entrance door activated, but occasionally would not register as being opened/closed in the web/mobile interface.  I contacted support, who was able to see that the signal was very week on the one door that activated.  I then ordered the 2 range extenders and set them up which was very easy by the way.  Once the range extenders were installed, my door tags activated.  I contact support again asking them if they could tell me if I had appropriate signal strength.  They assured me that all of my tags had the proper signal strength.  I used the remaining 2 tags to secure the door to our server room and an additional interior door.When installing the system, you first plug in the stick into your router or switch.  After it registers with the Korner web services, you begin installing your tags.  The whole process can be done through a web browser or using the mobile app on your phone.  I installed the Stick, tags, and range extenders using the mobile phone app.  The app is very convenient when installing your tags because you can follow the process on your phone while standing at the door or window.From what I can tell, the web interface has the same functionality as the mobile app.  The things you can do through the mobile app are:* See all of your tags and their status* See all of your range extenders* See 24 hours worth of activity from each of your tags and when the system was armed and disarmed* You can manually arm and disarm through the mobile app, as well as setup arm/disarm schedules* You can setup multiple zones, but only have one active zone at any given time, this is a bit of a drawback, it would be nice to have separate arm and disarm schedules by zone.  I suspect this will be an upcoming feature.* You can configure your circle feed through the mobile app (this is who want want to be contacted when your alarm is triggered, for example your neighbor so they can check things out for you)* You can see your profile through the mobile app, you can add a picture to your profile.  The app is already setup in a way that you can have multiple profiles.  This would come into play if you had multiple houses or a business where you have a stick installed.* Maintenance notes are visible in the mobile app as well.  I assume this will contain information from Korner in the event that they have upgrades or what not going on and they want to alert their customers.The system has been installed for several days and has been reliable.  I know it works because one of my employees set it off one night when they were working late.Time will tell how reliable the hardware will be, but my first impression is that all the components are engineered and made well.I am looking forward to the new features and devices that Korner releases in the future.Oh yeah, one note that is not obvious, the first year of monitoring is included with the hardware purchase.  Following the first year you pay $39 a year.  I don't mind this because they have servers and software somewhere on the internet they have to maintain.  The official list of what is included in the $39 per year can be found at this link.  I have included part of it for convenience.[...]The annual fee allows you to link to our servers. We will be constantly monitoring the health of the your system, notifying you of any potential problems and we provide very active customer support when needed. In addition, features of our App include:- Arms and Disarms system- Ability to manage Tag Setup process- Monitors battery life of Tags- Notifies user of intrusion, allows them to respond with the press of a button by either calling police of forwarding the notice to the users Security Circle- Allows the user to pre-populate their app with contacts for friends, family and neighbors (we call this the users Security Circle), such that any alerts can be instantly forwarded to the users personal networks- The Security Circle supports an inherently social form of Neighborhood Watch and ultimately provides a basic platform for communities to interact (similar to NextDoor).- Korner is very focused on highly responsive customer support.  Korner is a constantly live and critical part of your home, so we believe that responsiveness to customer inquiries is a top priority and something that defines us as a company.As far as I can tell, Korner meets and exceeds their commitments.
