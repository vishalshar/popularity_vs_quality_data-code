My dog has learned that the bright yellow bag holds some of his favorite treats so he'll punch at it until we give him one, the demanding little thing. He absolutely loves these, and I feel good about giving them to him because he seems much livelier and sprightlier ever since I picked these up. My only qualm is that some of the strips break up and get crumbly Â— they're a little brittle and dry but my puppy's happy to vacuum up the crumbs anyway.
