Everyone talks about the good part of Osmo, but there is one downside, the ads.  Whenever my son goes into Osmo, it tries to sell him Osmo coding.  My son is not old enough for the coding and I wanted to make sure he was using Osmo enough before putting more money into it.  The ads appear _every_ time he goes into the different games.  It's annoying and a huge downside as my son does not read yet, so he does not know what button to push to get rid of the ad.Other than the ads, the product works well and does what I expect
