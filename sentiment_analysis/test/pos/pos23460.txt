This was an awesome purchase (1 month ago). The first thing I did was add this RAM Ballistix Sport LT 16GB Single DDR4 2400 MT/s (PC4-19200) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - BLS16G4S240FSD in the open slot to get it to 24 GB. It was pretty easy using Youtube to see how to take the back off. 24 is a lot, but I had 8 on my last computer and the difference in the amount of things I can have going at once is very satisfying. The processor and GPU are nice to have, Nvidia has great support and features for devs and gamers alike. The input (trackpad, keys) is above average. The 512 GB SSD that I got is perfect for me (Dev, including AR apps). The battery life is great. The build is sturdy, which I like and it weighs less than average for these specs. I have been very happy with Asus as a company and it is very important note that this came with NO BLOATWARE, so you can just use the Windows 10 that it comes with without being annoyed by useless software.The biggest con is the screen. It's not IPS, as you probably know. The quality from bad angles is ok, but my issue is that the max brightness is a little low for working outside on a sunny day.
