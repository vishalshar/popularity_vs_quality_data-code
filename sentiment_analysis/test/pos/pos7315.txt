Just got it and it is exactly what I hoped. It is cute, solid, and you can hear the seal pop when you open it. I think each section is perfectly sized. I didn't notice the handle in the pics and was concerned I would also have to buy a bag. Happy not to. The only thing that would make it perfect is a way to handle drinks but I wouldn't want to lose any of its existing space to it.
