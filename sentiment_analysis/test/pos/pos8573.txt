I love having easy access to the contents of my mason jars.  These work great so far but I find them cost prohibitive to purchase as many as I actually need.  I bought one and use it on the item I use every day (cacao powder in my smoothies).  I wish there were a more cost effective option  to buy multiples as I could use more of them.
