I just bought this on Amazon, not via the crowdfunding, after my friend got one and I had pangs of envy.It is cool, and has a good wow factor.  Having said that, there are a significant number of issues with the current version.  Luckily, I imagine most can be polished away with software updates.  My overall rating of 4 stars takes this future potential into account.The good:* Levitation!  Seriously cool.* Magnetic pod - I'm sure that could be handy in some situations* Waterproof* The lights are neat, though I find myself wishing they had variable color and more patterns available* At some volumes and for some types of music, the sound quality is quite crisp and niceThe bad:* Pricy - this really is a novelty purchase at this price, there isn't a lot of value to be had here* Unlike most other reviewers, I don't have a problem with the speakers not being loud enough, but I guess that's because I am using them in a quieter office setting.  In fact, I have the opposite problem - I can't set these speakers quiet enough to not bother others in offices near mine.  The lowest volume setting is at least twice as loud as the lowest setting on my laptop speakers.* The volume control is also finicky.  There is the volume on your phone, and a separate volume in the app, and they are not the same, and the volume will sometimes jump between them.* If you're listening to music from the phone, then launch the app, the music pauses.  Why?  You can turn it right back on again.* Sound quality - As some others have reported, the treble/midrange is decent, but the bass is often boomy without sounding good.  Which brings us to...* EQ: No flat EQ setting?  No custom EQ settings?  The 4 built in ones are all bad to my ears, and having to select one is annoying.* The "music" section of the app is, in a word, terrible.  As far as I can tell, the only "option" is to just randomly shuffle all songs.  It needs to integrate better with the music app on the phone, or stay out of the way.  Ideally it will work with any other source too (Spotify, Pandora, etc.)* As others have said, the startup and shutdown sounds are annoying - too loud and awful sounding.  I get why they decided to give an indication that the BT is changing state, but be a little more subtle please.  I was on a phone call once when it shut down on me, leading the person I was talking to to ask what was going on, and scaring the crap out of me.* I had no trouble pairing the device with my phone.  But I find myself walking out of BT range frequently throughout the day.  Once that happens, you will not be able to automatically re-pair.  You will have to either go into your BT settings and force a reconnection manually, or power the pod off and back on again.  This may be a limitation of the technology, but it is not ideal.  I would prefer if the pod tried to reconnect every 15 seconds automatically somehow, for up to an hour or some such.* I wish the pod stayed powered on longer, too.  It seems to power off after only 30 min or so of inactivity.  I have it on a base which is plugged in all of the time, I want it to stay powered on for at least a couple of hours, if not longer.* Speaking of power and pairing, who decided on a button on the bottom of a levitating disc?  It is not very convenient to press, and if it is already levitating (which it will be most of the time if you've powered the base on), you run the risk of knocking off the levitating area and having it snap onto the base.  Which, you will see, happens with a decided force.* Quality control wise, my first purchase arrived, and within an hour the top "shell" of the pod had fallen off the rest of the pod, exposing some glue underneath, probably as a result of several cases of the magnetic snap described above.  It is clear that the glue that was used didn't cure quite right.  Amazon shipped out a replacement immediately, which was great, but I worry that all of them likely have this same design and build flaw.  I hope I'm wrong.In the end, I still love this little thing after a week.  The downsides are incredibly annoying, but almost all of them can be cured with software updates I think.  And this is just rev 1, so hopefully that is exactly what they are working on.  I am really hopeful for the future with this neat little device.
