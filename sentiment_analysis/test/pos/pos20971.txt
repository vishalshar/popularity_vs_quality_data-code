I love this cord.  I use it on an iphone 6 coming out of an aftermarket wall wart.  Definitely make sure your wall wart is compatible amperage and volt-wise!  Frankly, you'll be better off ditching the apple wall wart and getting an aftermarket, as I've found the apple product gets so hot that the longevity of the piece of equipment can't be that great.  Could even be a fire hazard.  Anyway, the pulsing electronic current lights up this cord a lot - to the point where it's extremely visible even in a well lit room.  Cats love this thing, but if yours is a biter, maybe steer clear.  Mine just stares at it and tries to steal its soul.
