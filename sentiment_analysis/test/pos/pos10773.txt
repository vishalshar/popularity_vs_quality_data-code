Great camera. Was very easy to setup. Even someone that is not tech smart could set it up in seconds. Night mode is very good, better than i excpected. Streaming is very fast with bearly any slow down. Has a wide angle of view wich is great when you place it in the living room. One thing that I would suggest is making it a little smaller. Other than this it's an outstanding product.
