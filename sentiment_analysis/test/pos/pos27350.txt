My wife loves having a fitness tracker but the previous ones needed to be recharged every few days.  She would make it through several recharges but eventually she would misplace the charger or just forget to put it back on.  That's when I discovered  the Misfit Flash which runs on a button battery so no recharging needed.  Great,  problem solved until it came time to wear it.  Misfit products are excellent fitness trackers but the flash/shine are kinda strange looking when worn as a watch, especially when you already wear a watch.  So how to solve problem number two, finding a stylish fitness tracker that does not require recharging.  Along comes the Misfit Ray.  Purchased it for her and it has not been off of her wrist in months.  It solved every possible issue my wife had with previous trackers: no recharging - in 6 months when the very inexpensive button batteries die just throw in a new set.  Waterproof - no need to ever take it off. Very stylish but discreet - does not look like a typical fitness tracker but instead looks like a very nice bracelet.  My wife is extremely happy with the Ray.
