A couple of leaves today, a couple tomorrow - I had so many good spaghettis before running low on laves. Really liked it.Tip: pretty much every seed will become a long stem.. try to spread them out across the full surface.Tip2: keep the bottom part clean, to let more stems come up - landscaping makes it prettier too.
