I first had an otterbox defender which was way too bulky. So I got this one which isn't nearly as bulky and still offers a good amount of protection. I got the Rokshield with the magnet because I have a motorcycle and thought it would be convenient to put on the gas tank while I ride. It can be really conveniently placed on the gas tank but going faster than 30 mph the vibrations (I have a Harley) and wind make the phone shake around so I can't safely leave it on the gas tank while riding. If the magnet were a little stronger I'd give this 5 stars.
