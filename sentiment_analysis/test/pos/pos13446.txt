As a parent of a child with a severe peanut/tree nut allergy, I am always searching for delicious safe snacks and Skeeter cookies are just that! We love them in our house. I do not always have time to bake cookies, so these are a wonderful option. The prepackaged 2-pack of cookies are also great for safe treats at school!
