I was introduced to TINE tags when I received a wedding invitation with a TINE tag on the back.  I thought it was a fun, easy, and clever way to add video and I have since used them to add to birthday cards/notes to family, and just bought more to add onto our Christmas cards this year.  The app is really easy to use and my family members have loved the personal touch.  Great product and the uses are endless.
