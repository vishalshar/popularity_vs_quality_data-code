currently using this laptop for a few weeks.  its been really nice. my biggest complaint is the number pad zero button is underneath the 2 button, it would make more sense if it was underneath the 1 button for thumb usage.  also the headphone jack is  further back then i expected, it makes the cord travel farther which is kind of annoying.  the head phone jack position is on the right side next to the minus button on the number pad.  the speed of the laptop doesn't seem  very special to me.. its fast just not blazing or out of this world fast.  and you have to use the fn key to control volume and brightness. also annoying..  i like the laptop, just a few minor things that bother me..
