I bought this to put on my dog as we go on a lot of trips and I am constantly worried my little Houdini is going to escape. It definitely gave me a sense of peace of mind knowing if she escaped in a strange city I had a way to track her down. Thankfully she didn't so I did not need to test out the tracking ability other than playing around the house.
