It says what it does and it's nice to have this to be used as a motivator for me to get back into running. I was hoping for a little more features, such as focusing on more than one aspect of your form while you run, although for someone who is getting back into running and working out it is good to focus on one thing at a time. Also I saw a video of the product that gave a visualization of your hip rotation vs olympic runners and that is not available (which would be really cool to see).I would not say this is for an advanced runner, it is more like a beginner or intermediate athlete. This product is only for running outside or in a place that can track your route, it is not useful for someone running on a treadmill.
