I love love love popcorn...it is one of my comfort foods after a hard day. It's pretty healthy as well....easy to make and yummy. My brother told me about these popcorn seasonings and so I decided to give it a try. I like how there are a lot of different flavors that I can try out so that I can figure out which flavors that I like that best. The only problem is that I wasted a lot of the seasoning because it wasn't sticking to the popcorn and I thought that there wasn't any or something and so I kept sprinkling seasoning and when I got to the end of the bowl there was a lot of leftover seasoning and that was when I realized that the seasoning was not sticking to the popcorn. So what I ended up doing was after I popped the popcorn I tossed the popped corn in coconut oil and then tossed it with the season and it stuck and it tasted YUMMY! I recommend this little seasoning set to anyone who likes popcorn...because even though it says "mini jars"...you can get plenty of uses out of each jars.
