This was a Christmas present to myself, and I love it. It is easy to set up and use, though I has to play around with the right amount of coffee to use to get just the right strength of the delicious beverage. The coffee tastes smooth, and I love that it only takes a few hours. I usually set one up over night, and start another one in the morning, which I take with me to work where it wraps up just in time for me to be ready for my second cup of coffee. Easy to clean, transport, and use. Saves me a ton of money and opens a whole lot of possibilities for experimenting with flavors. Highly recommended.
