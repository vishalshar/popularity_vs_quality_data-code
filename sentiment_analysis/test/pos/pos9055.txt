I've been wanting a health tracker and I'm glad that I went with Leaf over the others. It's made specifically for women with the cycle tracker, although that seems to work best if you have a typical cycle with a clear number of days. I wish it were more customizable.Love the steps and sleep tracking--I never feel like I sleep well and now I can see why.The Leaf is also sleek and stylish and feels like jewelry!
