I first saw these in a Kickstarter forum. I was skeptical at first, but just the idea of this design product and use was just just had me curious and hoping that they actually delivered.Surprisingly they are awesome!Yes, the magnets are pretty strong and such a joy to own. I use them on my EarPods and USB cables.They are a bit pricey, but they're differently worth the investment since they do seem to hold up. I've had them for over 2 months and they have not worn out or lost they're elasticity.A must have for earphones and charging cables.
