I was a little unsure about the value and quality of the product before I ordered it. Mostly I was worried about it being poor quality because of the low price compared to professional IR cameras. After I spent some time using it in different situations, I' very happy with it and really enjoy using it.First of all, the quality of the sensor and sensitivity exceeds my expectations. It really picks up very small differences in temperature. For example if you stand on the ground barefoot for 10 seconds and walk away, the camera will see your 'heat footprint' on the ground! It will visually show warmer areas very clearly that would be impossible to feel with your hands. But also very large differences and very high temperatures are no problem. You can aim it at a pan while you are cooking and it will show the heat pattern well. You can even overlay a temperature measurement spot which is pretty accurate. Since it works based on hear radiation, not on visible light, it doesn't matter if you are in bright daylight or in total darkness. You this camera sees it temperature, not light.Apart from being a cool thing to have, it has many very good uses. For example you can see where electrical devices produce heat, you can see where windows, door or walls have leaks that let heat or cold air through. It is very helpful seeing if there are wasteful electronic devices that produce wasted heat even when turned off. If you aim it at your tires after you drive, it will show you if the wheels need alignment based on the heat pattern on the tire. You can check if electrical wires get hot with use. You can see animals or people in complete darkness.I got the Android version and using it with a Galaxy S5. It works perfectly without any issues. Plug in the camera, start the app, that's it. You can takes stills and video. Overlay temperature and slide between the normal camera and the IR camera. The resolution of the camera is limited but since we are looking at temperature, a lower resolution is totally fine. The photos and videos are saved to your normal image gallery. You can also share them directly from the app.So far no crashes or issues. The only thing I noticed is when looking at a photo and then wanting to switching back to the IR camera, it is better to use the phone's 'back' button rather than the app's [X] button. It sometimes doesn't activate the camera if you use the X.It will drain your battery much faster than normal use of the phone which is expected as it needs to power the external camera. You can't charge the phone and have the IR camera connected as they use the same USB port. The camera comes with a small protective case which is very useful!Overall I'm really happy with it. I think it's a great quality camera for the relatively low price and an excellent value compared to professional alternatives. It works well and it works all the time, no issues here on my Galaxy S5.
