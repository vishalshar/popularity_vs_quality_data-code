I purchased this as a replacement for the Easy One Touch 2, which I had attached to my (textured plastic) dashboard for six months without any falling off or loosening. The suction cup did not leave a residue. It was somewhat tough to remove, but that is a good thing since that means it was extremely secure. Just pulling the suction cup's built-in tab to break suction and wiggling it firmly pulled it all loose.The sticky pad is the same in the One Touch 3, so I know it will stay secure and not come loose. The One Touch 2 was already an excellent product, but it did have some flaws that this one fixes. The adjustment knob for the arm extension moved to an easier-accessible location, the knob for the arm ratchet is designed better, the ratchet allows more precise positioning increments, the whole system vibrates less, and then we come to the 'One Touch' gripper.The gripping arms' spring strength has been strengthened, which makes it hold the device more firmly. I had issues with the old one where the phone could rotate around the axis created by the line between the grip pads, but this one does not do that. It is helped by the fact that the 'bottom foot' is now highly adjustable, in and out plus side to side, allowing a firmer hold there as well. The adjustability allows you to shift the position of the phone in the mount also, allowing you to make sure that the gripper arms do not latch down on your power/volume buttons.One important thing to note, though, on the topic of the bottom foot, is that if you have a phone like the S5 (USB3.0) or the older iPhones (30pin), et cetera, that have charge plugs larger than a regular MicroUSB plug, you can NOT plug them in while they are in this mount. The opening between the foot pads is not wide enough to allow it. I have found that the following work, though; with a USB3.0 phone, you can use a USB2.0 cable which is smaller to still have it charge, or you can (with any large plug phone) plug in the device first and slide the device in from the front so that the foot pads rest against the charge plug instead of the phone. The gripper arms are firm enough to still hold it well.I had little issue with the smaller One Touch button on the 2, but I definitely like the larger rubberized button on the 3. It also helps keep the phone secure.In my opinion, if you are looking for a dashboard mount (or windshield mount for those of you in states that allow that), this one is one of the best.CAUTIONARY NOTE: If you have laminated, fabric-covered, leather, or any surface that can deform similarly, and that is where you intend to mount this, ALWAYS use the included black sticky pad under the suction cup as per instructions. The bare suction cup can and will damage soft surfaces because it is so strongly secured.
