UPDATE 3/21/15:  Just received my new two-month bill.  My water usage was 35% less than the prior bill (which only had one month of IRO savings based on my install date) and 41% less than my bill for the same period last year.  Based on lower usage, I estimate that I've saved $58 and 12,700 gallons of water in just three months.  At this rate, the IRO will have paid for itself well before the end of the year, which is an incredible return on my investment.  What's more, my grass and plants have have never looked better!  If anybody is on the fence about buying an IRO, jump down and get it.  You won't be sorry.  And if you're like me, you'll kick yourself for waiting so long.UPDATE 1/17/15:  My city bills me every two months for my water usage, and I just received my first bill after having installed my IRO.  Even though the bill is for two months and I only had my IRO for one of those months, my water usage literally dropped by 1/3 and my bill was $35 less than the prior two-month bill!  I'll be honest and say that I never put much effort into conserving water previously, mainly because my old timer was such a pain in the butt to change.  But while I expected some savings in this first bill, I never imagined it would be this big.  As much as I don't like getting bills, I can't wait to get my next water bill to see how much I save over the full two months.  Thank you again, Rachio, for making such a great product.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have (had) a traditional Rain Bird 8-station timer that has served me well for many years.  But I'd been getting more frustrated with it recently, as it's a pain to change programs.  Too many buttons to push to cycle through all the day/time/length options.  Plus, it's in my detached garage, so it was far from convenient to shut off if I woke up to rain...not to mention having to remember to flip the switch back to normal operation after the rain stopped.  And don't get me started on having to shut it off quickly if my dogs needed to go out and do their business while the sprinklers were running in the back yard.I honestly hadn't even considered my options before seeing the IRO on a Gold Box deal on Black Friday.  But after reading all the reviews and doing as much research as possible in the few hours before the deal expired, I decided to give it a try as my very first home automation product.Seeing the demos online, it almost seemed too good to be true.  I just couldn't believe that it was that "idiot-proof" and was anticipating a tougher installation and set up.  But my expectations were blown away!  The hardware was no more challenging to install than plugging in a lamp, and programming was as easy as setting my DVR.Literally all I had to do was remove the wires from my old timer, plug them into the IRO, mount the base plate to the wall, attach the face plate and plug it.  After that, I downloaded the app, linked it to my wifi network and programmed it.  From start to finish, including fully testing every station, it took less than a half hour.I live in So Cal (OC to be more specific) and I love having the ability to tell the system what type of plants or grass I have, the type and compaction of the soil, the type of sprinkler heads, and even assign a custom name to each individual station.Being the OCD-kinda-guy that I am, I had already mapped the wires to each station, so I knew that when I plugged in a wire to #1, it was my front yard grass, #2 was the main flower bed, and so on.  But even if I hadn't, by having all the programming done in the app and being able to walk around with my iPhone while the testing was being done, it wouldn't have been an issue.  (I'll never forget when I first programmed my Rain Bird, having to run back and forth from the garage to the front or back yard during testing.)When I was done programming everything, I reviewed the recommended watering schedules, and based on years of tweaking things and watching things drown, dry up or flourish, I knew that I could safely reduce the times.  But to be perfectly honest, they weren't far off from my settings, so I wouldn't have been unhappy had I left them alone.The weather station Rachio uses in my area is from a local radio station only three miles away from my house, so the forecast is pretty accurate.  (Would be nice to have the option to use Weather Underground or other services that have closer stations/sensors, but this isn't really a big deal.)Within two days of being installed, I received my first weekly "seasonal adjustment" notification.  The email gave me detailed reasoning for the change, which resulted in a reduction of 7 minutes from my original schedule (12% less watering time).The next week, we had our first rain since the install, and I was concerned about exactly how or when the rain delay feature would kick in.  It started raining lightly about 11pm and my schedule was set to start at 3:30am, but I had no intention of staying up all night long just to make sure it didn't come on.  Thankfully, when I woke up, not only was it easy to see that they hadn't come on (normal sidewalk puddles weren't where they usually were), but I received emails and in-app notifications (types of notifications can be customized) that the schedule was skipped due to rain.  We've had a few more rainy days since, and it hasn't failed to skip the scheduled watering.Just a few days ago, I woke up to rain around 3:45am, and the sprinklers were on, so I just opened the app and hit the "stop" button.  Some would consider this a failure, but I do not.  Given that my local weather station is three miles away (and more inland, as I live in a coastal city), it's completely possible that it wasn't raining there, even though it was at my house.The IRO has the option to use third-party personal weather stations or rain sensors, and they even recommend specific ones if you don't know what you're looking for.  I plan to keep an eye on things this winter (such that it is, in So Cal), and if I come across more than a few of these situations where my sprinklers went off while it was raining, I may just pick up a rain sensor to prevent it from happening again. The one Rachio recommends is only about $25 on Amazon, and looks really simple to install.  Just plug in the wires to the IRO, run the wiring to a nearby rain gutter and clip it on.  It will require drilling a hole through my garage wall near a rafter and running the wire below my roof overhang, but that's not hard to do, and if it saves a substantial amount of water (i.e. money), would be well worth the effort.Obviously, having installed it only a month ago, I can't speak to the longevity of the IRO.  But with a two-year warranty, it's clear that they stand behind their products, so I have no doubt it will continue to save me money and frustration for years to come.One quick note about programming.  It's infinitely customizable as far as how often or what specific days you want it to water, which stations are operational during a given program, etc., and is really simple to use.  So don't feel like you have to stick with their recommended schedule if you know what your grass and plants need to survive.  And since it's controllable from anywhere, whether you're at home or not, you have total control over your timer 24/7/365.
