I have 5 cats and I've been using this product for over 2 years. It's the best thing that I have added into our cats diet. In order to keep my cats healthy and coats shiny I feed them the immunity 2x a day with their presription can food. My cats are the healthiest looking cats I have ever seen.  I have 2, 12 year old girls that are crazy energetic. I've never seen them be so full of energy.  They run back and forth around our place and they actually play with their mouse toys.  Then, I have a 6, 5, and 4 year old. Now, they are non stop playful. They never have digestive issues anymore. My 4 year old has IBS, and I haven't seen a flare up in a while. My cats are the most important thing to me and knowing that I am doing everything possible to keep them healthy(and maybe even lengthening their life) is a very great feeling :)
