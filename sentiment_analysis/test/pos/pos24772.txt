We are first time parents and love the Starling.  As easy as it seems to just talk to your baby, we were actually amazed at how few words we could speak in a day.  It's become the little reminder in our lives to put down our phones or to stop what we're doing and focus on our baby.  Its also become a fun little personal challenge to try to beat our word goal each day! I find myself reading an extra book at bedtime or talking to my child more about what i'm doing while I cook or clean, etc. to make sure I'm getting those words in.  Starling has become a daily part of our lives and I really believe its helping us be better parents.  Definitely grateful we came across this product!
