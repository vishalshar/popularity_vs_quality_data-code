This thing is great. It comes with a screen protector but I had a heck of a time trying to line it up properly so I said forget it! So, I have to clean the screen a lot but otherwise this is a great product! My son carries the iPad around by the handle, he's thrown it a few times (not too far thankfully!), and it's fine. Sturdy and good quality. Buttons are very accessible.
