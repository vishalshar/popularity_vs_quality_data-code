I am very happy with this camera. So much fun. I can check it while I'm at work and see what everyone's up too. I love playing with the laser pointer with my cats. They have a fantastic time. I can talk to them through it as well. I've used to when leaving the house for a bit so I can leave the dogs out and let them know through the camera that I can still see any questionable behavior. Lol. I love the app that you can download. There is a whole community of people and pet rescues that use the cube and it's fun to share pictures with them. You also can make your pet cube be available to the public for short amounts of time. You can disable the voice and laser features if you want for that. I disabled the voice because I felt that it would scare them to have people's voices heard and not see anyone's. But the public have been so kind always have thoughtful comments about my fur kids and play nicely with them with the laser. My cats can tell as soon as the laser is turned on and run up to it ready to play!You can also set up private accounts for family and friends to have access and can control that as well. The cube is not too big and is a nice silver color. It its anywhere basically. I did have an issue with the cable that connects to the back of it to plug it into the wall. For some reason where it connected in the back of the cube it was really loose. I simply used an android style cable and replaced it and now no problem.I have also had some issues with it not connecting to online. Every now and then it has trouble with being  available. That could be something to do with my internet? I'm not sure. It hasn't been a problem enough for me to call customer service.I would get it again, and plan on buying more because I have so many pets.If you are a rescue organization you can set it up so the camera is always on so people can play laser with potential adoptable cats. There are several shelters and rescues that have accounts on the app for people to see their available cats and dogs. This is a wonderful product and you won't regret it.I've added some pictures so you can see them playing. Also it shows that it covers quite a bit of space for you to see your pets.
