Techbrutha here with another no-nonsense review, son. Here I go again: trying to create the perfect wallet/battery/kickstand/thin case.  I definitely need a battery case because I just learned how to use my iPhone as a MIDI sound bank for my midi controllers for live gigging! Friggin' awesome! My phone powers both controllers and I want to make sure I don't run out of juice while on stage.While this is a cool battery case, I had a little bit of issues:1) No battery case allows me to run a camera connection through it that would power my MIDI controllers. This gripe didn't bring down my rating, though.2) The top piece of the phone comes off way too easily. Mine fell off when getting my phone out of my pocket and is lost forever. Had to order a replacement piece. The replacement was free so I bought and additional piece for $5.3) Every battery case adds weight and thickness to the phone. I love the form factor of my iPhone 6 and hate that I have to give that up when putting on a battery case. Ugh. Adding my wallet/kickstand adds more weight and thickness to it, too. It's like carrying a brick in my pocket. Double ugh.The headphone cutout is small. It's cool for Apple headphones but sucks for other 3.5mm cables. I literally have to force the cable I have in my car into the case. The cord pops out at times, too. Ugh x3.Aside from the hiccups, it's an alright case. It charges the iPhone well and it allows me to affix an adhesive wallet thingie on it. A little too heavy for me, though. Hope my review helps you!
