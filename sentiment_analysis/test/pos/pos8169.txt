I've been using this for a few weeks now and I really, really like it. Keeps me upright without a hot, sweaty pillow against my back. The only improvement I would make would be to have the connector that keeps your knees together allow a wider space between the knees. I have also tried seatback inserts, seat wedges, and saddle seats. So far I like this the best!
