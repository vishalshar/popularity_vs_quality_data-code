Worked great!! Fit and finish was on par as usual from iCracked and had no problems. As a bonus they have added a tempered glass screen protector on top of the replacement screen for added protection (they used to just had a plastic screen protector). Color and brightness was no different then the OEM apple screen. This is the 4th screen i have bought from iCracked and will continue to use them for the phones I fix.
