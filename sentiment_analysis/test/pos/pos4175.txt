I ordered this in hopes to use it for lighting in a craft fair booth.  I have seen descriptions of using marine batteries and converters and contraption-y set-ups, but didn't want to go that route if I didn't have to.  Enter this little gadget that has a large battery capacity and--wonder of wonders--an AC outlet!  This is perfect for the strings of LED lights I want to use in my booth.  To test them I fully charged the battery (it came with 1/2 charge and took about 1.5 hours to top off) and plugged everything together.  Everything is three 25' strands of LED globe lights that each pull 2W.  I turned them on using the switch on the battery and they lit up perfectly.  For 12 1/2 hours.  The lights did not dim as the battery ran down.  The only indication I had that power was almost gone was the final of 4 indicator lights had begun flashing.This battery is light weight, charges quickly, and lasts.  Time will tell if it will continue to hold a charge so impressively.  If it does not (I fully expect it to continue to be fantastic) I will update my review.
