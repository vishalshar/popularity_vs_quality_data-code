I've had this mattress for about 2 months now, and I'm truly getting the best sleep of my life. I've always been an insomniac and just thought that I'd have to suffer through laying in bed for hours trying to fall asleep and waking up multiple times every night. Now I feel dumb for suffering so long when I didn't need to, turned out I've just been sleeping on the wrong mattresses. Now I can fall asleep in minutes and I stay asleep all night. I can finally wake up at a normal time feeling rested and refreshed instead of feeling exhausted. This is truly life changing. I can't say enough good things about this mattress.
