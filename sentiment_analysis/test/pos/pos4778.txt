If you're looking for a fantastic alternative to using thousands of baggies that will all eventually end up in a landfill this Stasher bag is perfect! They seal great and are air tight. I now own 4 of them and I love knowing that my little one isn't ingesting any plasticizers from his food being stored in them.
