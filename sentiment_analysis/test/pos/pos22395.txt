Great sound quality, it does act like a shotgun and isolates very well. Was in a twin-prop plane over the Grand Canyon and it isolated my voice phenomenally well. Great purchase! I also use it for tuning PA systems with various iPhone apps (like Analyzer) - its great for this because it allows me to point it at the speakers while the screen is perpendicular to me (I can see it).
