Works well.  A bit of a learning curve, but it is a well functioning unit.  I even have it connected to my amazon fire.  I have a few suggestions, a better interface to create remotes, and allowing the user to create buttons that will switch to other remotes, but overall I like the product.I am technically proficient, but with a little patience I think anyone could figure how this device to work.
