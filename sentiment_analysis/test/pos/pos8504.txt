I have really enjoyed my Amazfit moonbeam activity tracker. The Pros are - it looks like a beautiful piece of jewelry, it is water resistant, and it gives great details about my sleep activity. I suffer from mild sleep apnea and with the data it downloads, gives me a better idea on what I need to improve to get better deep sleep. Highly Recommend!!
