I bought this lunch box after a lot of research for my 7and half year old son. He does not finish his lunch eat school. He is always more interested in playing. But with longer school hours I was always worried that, he is not getting enough nutrition, because he used to eat lunch late when he used to come home from school at 3:00 pm. I got this lunch box, and got few ideas from their video as well, as to what to keep in the lunch. I wanted him to eat lentil soup in lunch which is our staple diet, but with all the lunch boxes I had in the past for him, I was never able to pack it. Omiebox gave me the opportunity to keep the food that my son and I both love and he also makes sure that he eats out of his new "cool" lunch box! He has the lunch box in his favorite color, blue:)I am really happy I found this, although the price is on higher side for a lunch box, but my husband and I decided to go for it since we were really concerned for our son's nutrition, and I believe the price paid off! I am able to pack, which I really want my son to eat, and at the same time, he loves that food, which was not possible with other bento lunch boxes in the past.The divider is a great plus, which I think should have been two. As there are two rectangular sections. Two divider would've been helpful in keeping more variety of food. The bigger rectangular box is big enough to fit the horizon/O Organics milk carton, which is a must for my kid in his short recess.Over all, I am really glad, I made this purchase and I would definitely recommend this to any parent looking for a "real" lunch box:)
