I wore a Surge for over a year, and while I was happy with the food and activity logs, it was awkward to sleep with and honestly looked unprofessional for my work life.  Big, clunky and on top of that, it never kept the time zones properly when I traveled.  I randomly saw the Leaf when looking for a more acceptable choice and am thrilled.  I love the flexibility of the wear methods and the sleek look - I get lots of comments and people are so impressed that it's not just a piece of jewelry. Next I'd love to see optional colors for the wrist strap...I'd love to add a black color strap to switch out from the tan one I have; or options for other colors.
