I am so very impressed! My niece and nephew will just love these magnetic boards. They are well made and the magnets firmly stay on the board...but not too firm so that a 2 and 4 year old can't move them around easily. I can just see their little imaginations working overtime when they sit down to play. I highly recommend this product!
