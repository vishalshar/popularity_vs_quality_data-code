Pros: The speaker sounds great not too loud but loud enough.Con: Bass is not very good but it will hold it's own just have to adjust the volume.Pro: easy to connect I connected to my I phone 5 seconds and it was done.Con: I haven't been able to figure out how to turn it back on when it goes into sleep mode. All I been doing is turning it off then back on again and that "on off" switch it's not easy to use mine has to us a lot of force to move it why that is I have no idea.Pro: feels very well built and solid defiantly gonna use it for camping and outdoor BBQ at the house.Con: they say it's water proof but on the package it says "water proof with in reason" so don't leave it out in a rain storm and you'll be fine.Pro: defiantly worth the money.
