Loved my new BEDDI the voice update weather lets me know what I need to wear and the traffic update tell me when I need to leave so I won't be late for work and the find my phone is always useful because when I'm running late I always seem to misplace my phone lol. This is a beautiful alarm clock with many bonuses.
