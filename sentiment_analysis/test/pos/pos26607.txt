For electronics, I must admit Im not the best at keeping up to date with the best brands.  I usually gravitate towards well-known brands such as Bose or Jawbox; however, I took the advice of a friend and purchased a Libratone Zipp Mini for my upcoming trip to Hawaii.  Right away I loved the look (great packaging too) and design.  Love the leather strap so I can easily carry it with me anywhere I go and it fits nicely in a backpack or tote.  One drawback is it is not waterproof.Sound quality is solid.  I tested a few favorite songs and the sound was surprisingly very good.  Sure, it doesnt have the bass of my McIntosh amp but for a portable speaker it is very strong and much better than my iPhone speaker.  One of the great features of the speaker is depending on where you have the Libratone you can  adjust the placement profiles which tweak the sound accordingly.  I currently have my Libratone in my living room set to on a bookshelf and it sounds fantastic!  You can also set the music profiles, like Jazz or Rock.  This actually does make a difference.  I tested one of my favorite jazz songs, Concierto De Aranjuez by Jim Hall.  The song actually had more depth and better clarity around each instrument in the Jazz setting.  Another cool feature, is you can mute the sound by covering the top of the speaker/ bird logo with your hand.  Also, I should mention setup was super easy.  Instructions were clear, Bluetooth hookup a cinch.  Overall, the Libratone Zipp Mini is a solid choice.
