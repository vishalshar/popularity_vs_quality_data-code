I bought this unit as a gift for my folks for the retro look and feel. My dad had a similar looking unit from the early eighties that had recently kicked the bucket, so i decided to replace it with this one. This one has the same great style, but modern features like a CD player and Bluetooth. After I set it up for them and took a listen, I was very impressed with the sound quality. BIG sound for the price. The radio reception was crystal clear too. The speaker wire is short, but this is not an issue unless you would like the speakers positioned a large distance from the stereo system. The presets are easily assigned on the provided remote as well and prove to be very convenient for my folks. Overall, I highly recommend the product and plan on buying another one to keep for myself.
