Let me say the GOOD stuff first.  IT WORKS!I had some issues getting it going, but now that I'm through a couple of issues, it works VERY well.Issues:It arrived without the little black Velcro strip, so there was no way to attach it to the adhesive strips.I have to say that Customer Support was VERY responsive and they sent me a couple of the black Velcro hook strips and for my troubles an additional 21 adhesive pads.Next, it seemed to disconnect from my iPhone frequently. Again, Customer Service gave me instructions on updating the firmware.Now it works great.  I have to recalibrate it every once in a while, but that takes about 12 seconds.  In the meantime, when I use it, it forces me to set up straight, tones my core muscles and I like it.  I am recovering from an 8 vertebrae back fusion and this is just the thing to help me rebuild those muscles I could not use for a long time.
