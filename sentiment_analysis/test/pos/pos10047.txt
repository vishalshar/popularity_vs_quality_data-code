I have an almost two year old golden retriever who has, from day one as a puppy, had issues with loose stools.  I tried changing her food, trying grain free, all kinds of probiotics, adding rice to her food, a vet prescribed medication, nothing worked.  Some things seemed to work temporarily, but I wouldn't dare give her a greenie or a treat she hadn't had before as the loose stool problem would be back.  Once it came back, it was so hard to get rid of.  I finally discovered this product and I now feed her Blue Buffalo Freedom grain free, Merrick grain free wet food and two tsps of this Digestion as her main meal and she's been great. She weighs 60 pounds. Her stools are normal, her energy level is high, her nose is cold, her eyes are bright, her breath is good and her coat is soft and shiny.  I will not be without this product.
