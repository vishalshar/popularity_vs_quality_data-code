I've been using Cutter Gloves for the longest and always felt they will never lose they're tack but after awhile the tack in the glove have out. I tired washing them but it would last for a couple mins and wear off. After I found grip boost, it saved me so much money in replacing gloves. The fact that it drys instantly and gives you maximum tack is awesome. I was able to play 4 full games on just 1 squeeze! Granted, it doesn't bring back the orginial tack of the glove but it still makes it feel brand new! I hate using gloves that are worn out with no grib so any amount of help making the tack come back makes it so much better. Great product! Truly recommend it !
