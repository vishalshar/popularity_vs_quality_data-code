I bought the 3 pack and I'm hoping to upgrade my rating to 5 stars in a few weeks.Pros:- Packaging is well done- the unit and screen size are appropriate given what it is designed to do- easy to set-up and use given the interface design- sound and video quality are better than I expected- the fact that they are wireless means you can put them anywhere you have a power outlet or POE.  Traditional intercom systems require hard wiring which can be a problem for an existing home vs new construction.- allowing linkages to other people's (homes) Nucleus units is brilliant- ability to use Amazon Alexa was a nice surprise and useful feature.- customer service is outstanding. They are Prompt and will give non BS responses to questions.Cons:- call all rooms feature is missing.  This is a must for any intercom system.  I am told by customer support that this is a top priority for them to deliver.  I'm willing to wait given their response.- some additional settings and features need to be added.  Ability to set disconnect call after x minutes.  A setting to "not" have a confirm exit call pop up after pressing end call.  Or a count down to abort end call by pressing stop.  Ability to use Alexa to place a voice  or video call.  For example, "Alexa, call Home Kitchen", "Alexa, video Home Garage", "Alexa, call Home All", etc.- my units will lock up every couple of days requiring hard re-sets.  This really needs to get fixed and fast or I will be returning my units for a refund.I'm rooting for them as it's a great concept and I need something like this for our home, but it needs to work reliably.------------------------------------------------------------------------09/29/16 Update:  I upped my rating from 3 to 4 stars as the last couple of software updates have addressed my need to re-set every couple of days. Also, they eliminated the "End call" confirmation pop-up which was an unnecessary extra click/touch to end a call.  Waiting for the "Call All" Home rooms feature now, once available I will up my rating to 5 stars.
