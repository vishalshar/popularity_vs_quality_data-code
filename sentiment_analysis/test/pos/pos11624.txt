Hi,This is my review for the product listed on Amazon as:Trustworthy Buy Set of 6 Pieces 12-Inch Heat Resistant Nylon Cooking Utensil Set  PinkI received this product recently and had time to evaluate it for review.  I have also taken some photos in case anyone is interested.Being that I recently came from using some stainless steel cooking utensils, I was a little unsure that nylon utensils would hold up to the same value, but what I found from using these nylon utensils from Trustyworthy Buy is that they provide an advantage in this package that I dont get with the stainless steel utensils.First, theres flexibility.  These nylon utensils are designed with a bent angle already in place towards the end of the neck before the scooper which makes it easier to position your hand as your using the utensils in a way thats comfortable and effective.  From all of the utensils, there is clearly a dent that was molded to create that easier effort of scooping, flipping, or poking at a food being cooked.  The only one that doesnt have that bent angle is the whish, but that makes sense.Another advantage here is that these nylon products have a thumb groove design on the handles that makes it comfortable and fitting to place your thumb into the correct position to grip with your hand in the spacing provided and get a better forced effort when using each utensil.  Each utensil in this set has that thumb groove.  I like that a lot.  My stainless steel utensils didnt have that.So I would say that the stainless steel products tend to look better and complement the kitchen with your stainless steel flatware and other products.  This nylon set which not shiny or sparkly, has a nice vibrant contrast between pink and dark gray that stands out well and is attractive in its own way.  Sometimes I mix and match days when Im using one or the other.  It gets noticed and talked about.Lastly, this is a 6 piece set which has most of the main essentials for cooking.  I dont normally find a stainless steel set like this sold or marketed from Amazon Retailers and Im used to having to buy each of them separately.  This package does more of the thinking for you to remind you what you need and why you may need it.  And by the way, theyre cheaper in comparison.Overall, a good set of heat resistant cooking package of utensils to get you on the right track of cooking.I received a sample of this product from the manufacturer to give a detailed review of the user experience.  I am also providing this review to help prospective buyers make smart informed decisions.I hope you like my photos.Thanks for reading my review.
