I struggle with insomnia.  I have been dependant on benedryl based products (Motrin PM, Tylenol PM, etc) for several years.  Then I tried alternating nights with a half tablet of Norco that was prescribed to me after a tooth implant.  I did not like being dependent on any of these pills, but I was desperate to fall asleep instead of flipping and flopping for hours.  I bought Dream Water on a whim, just to see if it made a difference.  Holy Cow! It worked!  About a half hour after drinking it, I started feeling relaxed, then almost in a dream-like state.  I went to bed and fell right asleep, and slept comfortably for 8.5 hours.  No morning headache, no after effects.  No gastrointestinal side effects.  I'm a believer!
