The moment I found these at Starbucks I knew I had to order them. In my opinion these are a healthy and delicious alternative for vegans an non-vegans alike, it's not full of junk or fillers.I love it and recommend it, especially if you're not a fan of Earth Balance Puffs as a dairy free cheese puff alternative. My only wish is that these came in larger bags as well as the small bags.
