What I needed was a switch that would let me activate my island light - which  had only one switch that was located in an inconvenient place.I was hoping the WeMo light switch would allow me to turn on the lights from multiple locations since we ended up using our island lights more than any other light.I read some of the reviews on here & was hesitant NOT about the Wifi Connection setup but about my first time wiring an electrical switch.But WeMo made it a breeze & being in a newerall home,  the wires needed including the white neutral was as it was described in the WeMo install video.WeMo even labeled them clearly & the wire nuts were nice to have been included even if they were a bit small.My install took about 30 mins just because I was extra careful working textbook style & being the first time and all for electrical work.Now as for the network connection setup:  it went smoothly & followed the video as described.I got connected to my ASUS R68U ac router right away via the Android App + manually selecting my network.My Echo found the WeMo switch right away on its connected home setup.And everything was working perfectly.Even if you got knocked off your network, you can still use the switch like a normal decora type switch.Which leads me to the bad part: what got me in trouble was that the Android App told me a firmware was neededSo I proceeded to update the switch's firmware.This locked up the app & knocked the switch off line.The App just hung.I had to uninstall the app since it wouldn't allow me back in even after closing & rebooting the phone.I had  to reset & reboot using the 2 buttons at the switch itself.Then I had to reinstall the app, redo the entire setup & new connection again to both my network & Echo & phone.So all in all, the app is the trouble maker.  It isn't smooth nor helpful.As of right now: it is a good remote light scheduler & remote light switcher but an awful updater.To this moment I still don't know if my firmware on the switch is updated & it leaves me with an uneasy feeling that my security is exposed somehow.Belkin made a nice network switch that was easy to install & setup but the execution of its app is why I dock it 1 star.*UPDATE1 (09.22.15) :  My review to add that the included face plate - while it looks great - doesn't attach to the WeMo switch.  I had to buy a 2 piece  Lutron  hidden screw plate @ Lowes to mimic the look (see pics of these faceplates)**UPDATE2 (09.27.15):  Confirm that switching router's channel seem to smooth the WeMo's reset & broadcast protocols making setting up & signal retention more consistent. See here for a similar confirmation in the last post:[...]***UPDATE3(10.03.15).:  Installed my 2nd WeMo switch shortly after my first one above & the App asked me update the firmware for the switches.I noticed this go around the firmware installed as advertised.  It appears the router channel adjustment in  update2 made instantaneous improvements for WeMo to adapt to my network & now it turns on the light switch consistently as expected!.I noticed this go around the firmware installed as advertised.  It appears the router channel adjustment in  update2 made instantaneous improvements for WeMo to adapt to my network & now it turns on the light switch consistently as expected!.Everything is working as is advertised now & adding back 1 star.  It will be based on Belkin continuously improving this switch & its app that will make its stars go up!****UPDATE4(06.06.16).:  Installed my 3rd WeMo WALL switch along with 3 plug switches & the app has gotten really good @ the plug & play setup procedure.  Only problem I have is the app doesn't recognize turning off the light using ON = Sunset  + OFF=exact time scenario.  But I am sure they will resolve it in the app after they see my feedback.As I stated before, when Belkin updates the App & firmware consistently,  this is a very good toe in the water to home automation esp. with Echo voice command.
