I purchased a Gray Trio approximately 1 year ago and I love it. Having my utensils at hand and not having to depend on the hit or miss of the stocking of utensils at work has been a time saver. I pull my GoBites trio from my bag and I'm ready to go. The set is durable, easy to carry, clean and very convenient. The spoon and fork are formed just right. The knife is sharp enough I have quartered and cored apples with it. The tooth pick is an added bonus. I highly recommend the GoBites Trio!! The Trio set would be easy to carry in a purse, back pack or even the glove compartment of one's vehicle. A definite positive purchase!!
