I have been using this product for about 6 months or more. I have 2 collies, one with a growth on her eyelid. These are usually viral in origin, and can become large and obstruct the vision if left untreated. Sometimes they disappear on their own. One of my collies had a small growth which I was monitoring. On another front, as I was advising a friend about her dog's eye with an immense growth on the outer eye orbit, I mentioned this product. When we got home my husband questioned the growth on our friend's dog mentioning how incredibly large it is and obtrusive. Our collies was sitting near, and as we were speaking of this malady were shocked to see hers was no longer there. It had actually disappeared after 2 years. I have every reason to believe that this product is in part responsible for the disappearance of the growth. We feed a premium diet in part home made with raw meat added, nutrient dense and in proportion. This product is just the icing on the cake for our collie. Originally bought in the summer to assist during the heavy chemical spraying to keep our neighboring lawns "green". ;( Great product. Encouraging others to educate themselves on nutrition for their companions.
