When I first saw this on Kickstarter, I kinda shook my head and scoffed at the ridiculous millennials too busy/lazy to eat actual food.  Then I was convinced it was really just the beginning of a government plan to replace our food supply with an easily made environmentally friendly food type product.After I got over myself & looked into it further, I decided to try it.  I'm thin & struggle with my appetite due to anxiety.  This is an easy way to add extra calories to my diet.  The flavor is unobjectionable. As many have said, it tastes just like cereal milk with a similar consistency.  Not thick like some meal replacement shakes & no lingering people aftertaste.
