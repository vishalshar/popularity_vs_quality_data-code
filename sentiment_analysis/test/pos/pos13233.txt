In one little clock you get the following:Alarm ClockBelkin WeMo controlPhillips HUE controlBluetooth SpeakerSpotify IntegrationFM RadioUSB charging (dual)Wake up / SAD light*.Mood lightPhone dockPlus several features I haven't had a chance to use like Uber and Nest. I suspect it can control your heating and then call a cab :)Every one of the features is very usable and effective, nothing is a gimmick. Even the multicoloured mood-light, which I expected to be gimmicky, ended up being something I use all the time.Most of the features are configured and accused using the companion 'app' for iPhone and Androids, however the top face of the clock has programmable function buttons for control of the lights, music, volume etc. It's *very* flexible.Almost everything can be configured just the way you like it, from the colours of the mood light, the brightness of the wake light,I sincerely cannot recommend the BEDDI enough, it's a dream for gadget fans and easy enough to use for your mum.*Prior to this I used the Philips SAD alarm clock and while the BEDDI does not claim to be a SAD light, having the illumination gently get brighter before the alarm sounds works just as well (though it's not quite as bright).
