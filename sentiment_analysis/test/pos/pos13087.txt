Best, most convenient case for a mountain bike. Period. I've used almost every case available for bikes, and this is head and shoulders above the rest. It's super-easy to take on and off the bike, and securely holds it even in a crash. What really makes the difference for me, though, is that the case is slim enough that I can leave this case on it indefinitely. With other systems I was taking the case on and off every time I rode my bike because it was too bulky to use daily. This one is small enough to stay on the phone all the time. Quad Lock has other mounts that allow you to mount this case to other things like a camera tripod.The only problem I have noticed with this case is that there are small holes in the mount that allow dust & dirt to get in, so periodically I have to take the case off and clean the dirt out of the back of the phone. No big deal but something to be aware of.
