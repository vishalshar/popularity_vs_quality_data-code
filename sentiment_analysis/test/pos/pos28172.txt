TPMS systems are great.  This one is competitively priced, and the app works well.  Sensors are a little larger than I expected compared to the Garmin ones.  But I like being able to read on my phone.  App gets regular updates.  I'll probably get at least another set for another bike.  Multiple bikes seem to be handled very well.  I doubt you could get a tire pressure warning while riding but it's a super-easy check before you head out.
