This is a really nice case!  I bought it before I had read any reviews but had a Rokform case for my iPhone 4s.  It was hard plastic and felt rugged-- and I found the lanyard helped with the ease of use for pulling it from my pocket.  However, I wasn't sure what to do with the lanyard-- if I draped it around my wrist it would dangle-- if I looped it around my belt buckle I wouldn't be able to quickly answer my phone.  But I found it cool to pull from my pocket-- easy to grab onto.Now the iPhone 6 case has a lot more going for it.  A lot the plastic has been replaced with more rubberized solid material.  It's fairly thin compared to the iPhone4s case which keeps the iPhone6 sleek.The magnet built into the case is quite clever and adds benefit in holding steady against a whiteboard or other metallic material.  The rubber piece on the back covering the magnet has the ribbed rubber piece for additional friction on slick/smooth tabletops.The lanyard is included-- and this time it has a quick release part-- even more functionality.It has the hole in the back for the Rockform mount.  I haven't made use of it but I think it is very nice that it is completely compatible with existing mounts.I like this rugged case a lot-- even more than the iPhone4s case. It was a good purchase for me even before I could see any reviews on it.  Good job Rokform!
