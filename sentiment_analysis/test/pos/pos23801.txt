As a BCBA who was first a behavior technician, I am quite familiar with this particular box set of pictures because I have used it extensively in the past.  This box set is very helpful.  It has a good variety of common stimuli in multiple categories including colors, all pictures are photographic images, all cards are the same size, and it has several examples for both identical and non-identical matching stimuli.  However, this box set has always been far from perfect.  Those who are familiar with it may think of the pictures of electronics in particular especially the phone and the cassette tape.  I was very pleasantly surprised when I received my box of pictures this morning to find the electronics section updated.  The computer is now a laptop, the TV is fairly thin, and an MP3 player and a tablet are each pictured.  The main reason this box set still only gets 4 stars from me instead of 5 is that many of the other pictures look outdated in that some items appear to be outdated, like stimuli more commonly found when my husband and I were children than today.  Also, it would be nice if this box set included pictures of basic human body parts (e.g., eyes, noes, arm, leg).
