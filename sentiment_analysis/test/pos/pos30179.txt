I wasn't really sure how one condom could be much better than another, but now I know.My lady parts smell like latex for a full day after using a Durex condom (sorry, real talk, it's v unpleasant), but these condoms don't leave any plastic-y odor behind. The Hex is also thinner than the average drugstore condom, and the honeycomb construction is like subtle ribbing, which adds a nice sensation. Average lubrication, though Lelo also makes a "personal moisturizer" or whatever that would complement them nicely.We've never had a condom break  maybe we aren't athletic enough with it?  but you can tell right away that the Hex has greater structural integrity than the average rubber. It's super sturdy; tearing one was impossibly difficult, even with concerted effort and both hands (one of several bedroom activities fitting that description).As with all things from Lelo, the packaging is so beautiful and sophisticated. This is one of the classiest condoms you could produce at that critical moment, and an impressive box for your date to find if they're poking around your place beforehand. They seem kind of expensive, maybe, but a worthy investment (especially if your long-term relationship is such that one box is effectively a lifetime supply.)
