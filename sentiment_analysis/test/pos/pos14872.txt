I bought this for my nephew is has always been an artsy, creative kid. I did A LOT of research on other products in the STEAM field prior to purchase. In the end I chose Little Bits in part because i liked their large community who put projects on their website. It's been a total hit. The modules snap with magnets so it's super super easy to connect the electronics. He immediately make the "Defend your Domain" project to protect his room, and within the hour he had taken it apart and was modifying it to make a project of his own.Big big hit! I was a hero and i feel good that i didn't get him junk that he would discard after one day of playing(and now i know i can keep buying him separate pieces anytime i need to get him a gift! - I'm so smart)
