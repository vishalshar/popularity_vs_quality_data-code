I was looking for an activity tracker when I came across the Spire on Amazon. The idea that it could help me manage stress and help me focus was very appealing to me, so I decided to give it a try.I've now had my Spire for 3 months and I use it every day! I have never used a tracker before - every time I've tried to use a pedometer, it didn't work out - I forgot to wear it or the step measurements didn't seem accurate, etc. I'm surprised at how easily using the Spire became a habit. I feel like this product is well-priced for all of the benefits it provides and I'm so glad I purchased it. I mainly use it to monitor my tension. It has worked well for that for the most part. I have it set to buzz me when I'm tense so I can take a deep breath and reboot if you will.I have ADHD and I thought maybe this device would help me learn to focus better at work. I was interested to see that I am actually focused a lot more than I assumed. I guess maybe it's that thing where once I focus on something, I'm uber focused. In any case, it actually made me feel better about myself! ;)I have not used the activity part particularly yet - you set your own daily steps goal, Spire tracks your steps and the app shows you where you are at towards your goal. It does seem extremely accurate. On work days, I have very few steps. It makes you realize how sedentary our lives have become!!!I am very pleased with how well it stays connected to my device and the charging system is a breeze. I wear it on my bra strap under my arm. The soft, rubber coating looks like a pebble. I forget that it's there. It shows no signs of wear after 3 months of daily use.I have done at least one calm exercise - they are like miniature guided meditations. Unfortunately, I don't make a lot of time to use that feature.Finally, I wanted to mention that one of the Spire developers contacts me for my feedback, which I think is a very good sign of things to come. They obviously care deeply about their product and are invested in its future.
