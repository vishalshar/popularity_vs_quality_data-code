So, I was thrilled to be able to review this with him. He is a big critic too. If he does not like something, he points out all the things he hates, lol. I do have to say, these cars arrive very well packaged, and arrive with an easy to follow instruction booklet. They stress in this booklet to be gentle with the cars, and advise that they be used indoors only. Keep that in mind. They also require that you have a smart phone or tablet where you can download the necessary app to utilize them. There are two Rev cars in the set, and each car requires 4 AA batteries, which are not included. You will need a Philips Head screwdriver to access the battery compartments. I have Android devices, and you can find the REV app in your Google Play Store, for free. It comes up as REV Robotic Enhance Vehicles by WowWee Group. It even has 4.2 stars, which is pretty good for a toy app. The app lets your smart phone or tablet connect to the cars. It connects fast too. I was very impressed with it. You have to have a tablet or smartphone, there is no separate controller to operate these cars. These cars are operating off our Galaxy Note 5 phones, and Samsung tablets perfectly. You can just drive it around or battle them. I love the shooting sounds. They sound more futuristic, and not like real active guns. I am amazed at how fast the card actually go. The controls to make the cars move are finger controlled from you screen. Your right hand does the direction, and the left hand does the acceleration. There is actually reverse with the car too.  The screen on the app is easy to follow, and if you choose the wrong option, its easy to redo. My son loves the campaign mode. He was so excited once he beat it the first time. With the campaign mode the cars shoot lasers at each other, and score points, until one of them wins. He is such a computer kid, I am happy to see him up and at least playing with this toy. Its great because he can play with someone else, as well as me or his dad. Its fun for all ages. You dont have to play with anyone either, My son even did the campaign mode as one person. So, this is a great set for an only child as well. I am very impressed at how responsive this toy is to the app. Its really well done. And, the speed of the cars is so impressive. Its a great set overall.I received this, for free. I was under no obligation to leave my unbiased and honest review.
