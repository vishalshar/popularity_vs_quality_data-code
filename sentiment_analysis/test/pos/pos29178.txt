This is a neat toy.  When i first started playing with it, I wondered what the point was.  It's not overly fast, not incredibly useful.  But it's a lot of fun.  The "Sphero" app (not the "Drive" app) gives you tasks to complete.  Once you've completed a few you can "purchase" (free) tricks that the Sphero will do.  Sneezing, jumping, dancing and such.  My 3 year old loves it.My initial thought was that it would be fun, but the fact that there is a programming app might be neat for kid to learn.  I hope that new apps that take advantage of this toy will continue to come online in the near future.
