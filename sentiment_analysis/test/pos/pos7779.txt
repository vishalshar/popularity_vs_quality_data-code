I have tried many different phone holders for my road bike but I have finally found a solution to all my searching and it the Quad Lock mount. I have a S6 that i use on my bike with Strava, S health, and music and this allows me easy access to all of them securely. I hate having anything on my bars because it keeps me from leaning on the bars or just holding them with no interference so I have to have a mount that goes on the stem. The universal mount hooks on in a flash with the supplied rubber o rings and does not move around much. I may just use zip ties when they loose there elasticity but the supplied one works well. The clip that hooks to the back of your phone case is super sturdy and will not come off, I would imagine you would have to just throw the case away before it came off. It hooks in with a depression of the blue part and a twist of the phone and it is locked in place. The phone is secure and safe and can be taken off with a pull and twist method. Anyone who is looking for a mount with clean minimal lines and does not create huge drag this would be the one. I like it so much I will buy another one for my girlfriends bike also.
