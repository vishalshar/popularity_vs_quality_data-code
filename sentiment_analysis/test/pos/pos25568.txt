My young nephew loves this littleBits kit. He is mechanically inclined and always love to build and discover how things work and why. I think he will probably grow up to be an engineer or an inventor of some sort. For children like him, this kit is perfect. It teaches children in a fun way. It is also good for parents because you can spend time with your child and bond while you learn together. I wish I had one of these when I was young. It seems like so much fun. A great learning toy that gets children to exercise their brains and their creativity. I really don't have any negatives to say about it and neither does my nephew. I feel like the 'cool aunt' for getting him this.Please leave any questions in the comment section if you would like to know any more about the item. Thanks for reading my review. I hope it was helpful to you.
