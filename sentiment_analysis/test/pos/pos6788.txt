Great camera! This is all you need. I got this camera a few days back. My impression is a way above than expected. The overall performance is outstanding.The camera is well built. Image quality is crystal crisp. Setting up is super easy. Everything you need is included into the package. I want to mention the super wide angle view, so each point is covered for monitoring.I have tested all functions and modes. Everything is working as promised. 5+ stars!Highly recommended camera!
