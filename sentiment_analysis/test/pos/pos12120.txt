I ordered the PlushDeluxe cover because I finally got fed up with what I had till now - junky creaky plastic mattress covers that kept ripping and annoyed my son. I'm glad I did because it's exactly what I needed.Pros:Precise fitStays on even when removing top sheetsComfortablePerfectly waterproofCons:None so farIt fits my son's bed perfectly, just like a fitted sheet. It even stays on when I remove the regular sheets to wash them.I took a nap in my son's bed to test the comfort, and I was pleased to notice that it really doesn't change the feel of the mattress. There's no plasticky sound or feel under the sheets, even though the protector has a waterproof layer that keeps the mattress safe from spills (and nocturnal accidents...) It's the perfect thickness if you want to keep your mattress clean without changing the texture or comfort.I am thinking of ordering one for each mattress in the house.
