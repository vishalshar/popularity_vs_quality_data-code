I received this in early December and I've been printing non-stop.  Yes I've made a few improvements to it but for the most part it was ready right out of the box.  I did have 1 minor problem with the z axis during startup.  During the homing process, the axis would just go up and never go down to the bed.  It appeared it was a problem with one of the z axis limit switches. After a brief call to tech support (which they answered right way over a weekend), they sent me a few videos and I fixed the problem very quickly.  Everything else I figured out as I went.  It's not too difficult for people who are tech savvy.  If you have problems, it looks like there are plenty of people on tech support that can answer your questions.  This printer is a good value and right before Christmas they ha it for $100 off which made it even a better bargain.  There is an art to getting things to print well - just read the forums and experiment with settings/temperatures/filament until you find out what works well.
