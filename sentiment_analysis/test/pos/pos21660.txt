We bought the Grace Digital Wi-Fi Music Player (GDI-IRC6000) "Mondo", which was so buggy I couldn't even get the alarms to work, then tried the GGMM E3, which also had problems, and then tried the BEDDI.  After trying to simply get the Grace and the E3 alarms to work, the BEDDI was a total delight.  The App is very well organized, works extremely well, and has a ton of features, and they all work!!  For example, it has three programmable soft keys and you can set them up so that if you push one you get the weather report, or you can wake up to beeping and the weather report, there's a plethora of options.I was very impressed with the Bluetooth range, I was 50 feet away with three intervening walls and the Bluetooth connection was solid.  The BEDDI includes instructions and access to a user manual, something the others forgot.There are a few issues with the BEDDI though.The BEDDI does not have built-in battery backup.  You can use a USB power bank plugged into the BEDDI's "service" port.  But now you have to keep the power bank charged.  Not bad, but an annoyance.  If you lose power the alarms disappear and you have to set them up again.The BEDDI only provides access to the Spotify music service, and you need a premium account.  Why not provide access to a free iHeart account like so many others?There should be a factory reset selection to clear out your application passwords.Other than that I really like the BEDDI.  Note that there is also a Black version on Amazon in a separate listing.  The time shows up better on the black version.
