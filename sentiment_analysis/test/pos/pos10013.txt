Like the adjustable nature of these.  I used to have the cheaper plastic ones that ended up everywhere in my drawer or bag from spilling out of the container.  I can take this small package with me when I travel and not have to worry about which size I may need or what shirts I am bringing.  I use them almost every day and have been totally happy.  My only minor complaint was the interior plastic tray does not seem to stay friction fit to the outer casing so I had to glue it in place to keep it from popping out on occasion.  Not really a big deal at all but it happened enough times to get me to resolve it.
