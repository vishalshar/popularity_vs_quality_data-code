My dog had the non-contagious mange, demodex, above his eye.  We originally tried the Ivermectin approach but the high dose made him a little crazy.  So I took him off of that and decided to try and boost up his immune system.  Within a few weeks of putting him on this superfood, his fur started to grow back.  Hopefully it will keep the balance in check from here on out.  He's only been on it for about a month.  We'll see.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
