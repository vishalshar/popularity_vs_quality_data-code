This is BY FAR one of the best products I have purchased on Amazon!  I have an older Genie garage door opener, and the remote no longer works.  I tried pairing a newly purchased remote with it, but as it is mounted in the peak of my very tall garage, I have never been ambitious enough to climb up there.  While browsing on Amazon, I came across this product and was intrigued by a reviewer who described installing the gLink not attached to the garage door opener itself, but to the push button opener mounted right inside my walk-in door.  As this configuration was not described in the directions that arrived with the device, I reached out to Tech Support.  I needed to do a little troubleshooting, but the responses and advice I received via e-mail were quick and accurate...it was clear that the process was something that they knew how to accommodate.  It was a very quick and easy installation and works seamlessly!  What a brilliant concept!  With the app my husband, myself, my children, and my sister (and sometimes dog-sitter) can all use our phones to open the garage door with no more need to share the remote or have multiple copies of a key.  This is one of those products that I didn't know existed, didn't know I needed, but am so, so happy that I found!
