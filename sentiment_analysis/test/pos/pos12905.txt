I can't give enough stars! Not only does it tell you the temperature it also let's you have a profile from each family member. It keeps a record of temperatures and symptoms as well! I have 4 kids at home and remembering which kid has which illness with what temp is a nightmare. Let's face it that many kids I forget their names half the time lol I carry this with me at all times and I want to get one for my mom's and one for home. Really an amazing product.
