Golf Tags are a great addition to my golf bag, I love the concept and the tags so far have held up well on my clubs. Using NFC on your phone can sometimes be hit or miss when it comes to tagging clubs during a round. I have played several rounds with golf tags and spend quite a bit of time finding the sweet spot on my phone to tag clubs sometimes. I have a Galaxy 5 Note and for the most part tagging works most of the time, but occasionally I am at the ball tapping my phone multiple times during my rounds trying to find that sweet spot which sometimes I just can't find. So to not hold up play I sometimes will input my shot manually instead which defeats the purpose of the tags in the first place. With the new Link product coming out this spring, maybe the antenna system with the new device will be better and less frustrating while playing. The software for Golf Tags is exceptional, now if the tags worked a little bit better it would be 5 stars.
