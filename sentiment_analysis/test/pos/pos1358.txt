Thank you.  My grandson LOVES it.  Absolutely his favorite present.  I loved all the features it has, he's excited that he's been able to make it fart and belch...yes, he's an 8 yr old boy! My daughter and son-in-law had to figure out the controls, but once that was done, he's been learning new functions.
