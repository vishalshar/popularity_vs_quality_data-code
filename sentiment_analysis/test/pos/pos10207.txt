Man, I was not expecting such a nice and sturdy bike. This thing is built to last and with quality. My daughter loves riding this bicycle. Slightly heavier than most bikes, but that lends to its sturdiness.The tires are large with good grips to help them gain traction, and the hand brake works decently, but don't fully trust it yet.All in all, very happy I purchased this for my 4 year old who is 37lbs and 41inches tall.
