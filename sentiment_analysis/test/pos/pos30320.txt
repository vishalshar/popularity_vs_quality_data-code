WOW look if you are looking for a great deal especially around this time of the year. This is the dark horse of all mobile deals. I am a power user when it comes to smartphones. There are so many options out there for smartphones. If you have a family having the budget to place a great phone in every hand is always an issue. Well this is a great buy. Nextbit Robbin as shown came in the factory packing, brand new, and ready to accept your nano sim already unlocked supporting all GSM carriers in the US. Device has fast charging, dual front facing speakers, and 32G storage with 100G additional cloud storage. This storage manage itself ! No more sorting through folders deleting apps, and backing files on your PC. Free cloud base storage build-in the hardware of the phone. Trust me this is no trick with a catch. It works time after time without any issues. Must by for college students, families, or business mobile device.
