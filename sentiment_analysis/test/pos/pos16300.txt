As a paranormal investigator the Seek thermal camera will work just fine.  Using my LG camera on a tripod, the Seek works well in clients homes or business.  We use many cameras such as IR and Full Spectrum to capture evidence of paranormal happenings and the Seek thermal just adds another weapon to our arsonal.  Since this is the first generation camera it does not offer the distance needed for some locations but for inside homes it works just fine.  In the future I am hoping they make one with a wider lense.  The price is right and if your on a budget, the Seek thermal camera might be what you need.
