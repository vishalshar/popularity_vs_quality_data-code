One reviewer commented that your opinion of this item will depend upon how it fits your car and your phone. I agree. I have the Galaxy Note 2 and it fits fine (and that's big). I bought this mount because I really need something to hold the phone when I'm using the navigation function.I have an Infiniti G37x and I didn't want anything stuck to the windshield with a suction cup, and my dash layout isn't conducive to mounting a suction cup or sticky base to it, and I was wary of mounting anything in the air slots because those things aren't that strong. Sometimes my knuckles hit the mount when I place the shifter into park, but that's just a matter of getting used to it being there.My cd slot is located in the center of the dash, I don't use it for cd's, and the mounted phone only covers up the clock, which is not a problem because I can get the time from my phone. A few other dials and buttons are not visible, but I don't use them because the automatic setting on the climate control makes their use unnecessary. I can still see the back up camera screen fine.My advice is, look at the picture of this thing, then picture it mounted in your cd slot and visualize what will be covered up and decide if that works for you.The design and quality of construction is adequate for the function of the device, and it fulfills my needs. It looks better without the little yellow sticker, so you can just read and heed the warning about texting and driving and remove the sticker.
