This is a very well designed stick as well as very durable.  My only complaint (resulting in a 4 star rating) is that the directions are so vague that they are hard to follow.  I did finally figure out how to set up the stick !!  An outlet adapter is not included so used one that comes with my iPhone, another negative. I carry it with me all the time now....  Great addition to my new iPhone 7plus !!
