So when the shipped my laptop the outer box was in a pretty poor condition and that when I opened my laptop the screen came off of the bezel, but popped it back it and was good as new as it can be. As soon as it arrived I went straight to upgrading the RAM. One my problems with the this laptop is that the lithium-ion battery wrapping was punctured when it arrived but since the battery hasn't expanded or exploded yet, I'm pretty sure I'm safe for now. The other problem I had with the laptop was how easily the clips on the bottom cover for the laptop on mine broke. I work at a electronics repair shop for part-time so I'm confident in my ability to use pry tools, and this is my first time that any plastic clips broke on me.So the good things for this laptop. I didn't buy this laptop as a dedicated gaming rig as the spec aren't on par for modern AAA games for enthusiasts. But that doesn't mean it can't game. This machine can still run on high/medium settings on League, Overwatch, or any games before 2014 just takes a little bit tweaking. So this laptop can still be considered a "gaming laptop" just don't expect it to run on ultra settings for current games like W3 or Fallout 4. I use this laptop for CAD and occasional gaming when I can't get access to my gaming rig. The trackpad on this is almost perfect has the tactile feel and accuracy of a Macbook Pro with the excpetion that this trackpad is very "clicky" for my taste. The screen well since its matte and not ips you are sacrficing true color for this. If you're an artsist this laptop might not be it unless you want to spend a lot of time tweaking he screen color and contrast. The on board speakers are alright but not something you would use primarily, for music or anything but can still get the job done. The battery life is decent and acceptable, CAD on battery I can get around 4-6 hours depending on screen brightness. I can get 7-8 hours of just light Chrome browsing while also working on Word docs. I can manage 6 hours on average. The webcam on this thing is not something you would want to use but for last resort. One last thing since this thing has an SSD on top PCIe this thing has a about 15 to 20 second boot up time which is quite fast.So if you're looking for college laptops and you want light gaming or something to make CAD run smoother than this laptop can get the job done. Also if looking for a budget laptop and don't mind sacrificing resolution and other settings for a better fps than maybe consider getting it.
