I bought this kit for my 9 year old son after seeing a video on it on CNET a couple of weeks ago and thought it would be cool to build robots will teaching him coding principles.  His summer school actually has some basic coding exercises on a tablet which he doesn't enjoy very much.  They also use Mindstorms but he and his friends find it boring.  Thought this product might make learning robotics and coding a little more fun .Worked on the one of the characters for about 3 hours together building with the help of the 3D part of the app.  Not the easiest thing the first time around but was fun doing it together.  Then my son took over and had a blast controlling what he built.  He's built another character since by himself and programmed about 10 new actions by himself.  The blockly code part of the app was good because he was familiar with similar programs in summer school but using the blockly part to control the robot made him pretty happy.  I just ordered the larger kit with more parts because he wants to build an elephant.  Once I get that I'll review again to see if it's worth the $399.  But this kit was well worth the $$.
