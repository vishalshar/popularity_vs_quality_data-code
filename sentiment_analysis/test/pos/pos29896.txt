Great jacket. Fits nice and is very comfortable. The vents in front along with full venting in back keeps the air flowing on warm nights. If I need more warmth in cooler months it has enough roominess to wear a warmer layer underneath.Everyone says I light up at night and can be seen from a mile away.Four-wheelers would have to be driving with their eyes closed to say they didn't see me.I feel more secure riding at night on my Harley.
