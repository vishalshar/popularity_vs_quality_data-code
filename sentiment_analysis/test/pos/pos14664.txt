This is a life saver for me!  I am short (5'1") and it's very hard for me to reach into my crib, lift the mattress, and get the fitted sheets on and off.  The zip sheets make it actually possible for me to change the crib sheets on my own.  The zippers are covered up so it's still nice and soft for the baby, and you still have the option to get some cute patterns too!  Just for fun I tried to put a regular fitted crib sheet on the crib mattress once... I actually ended up having to pull the entire mattress out of the crib (thank goodness I got the light one) and change it on the floor, and then put the whole thing back in the crib.  Not cool.  So happy I found zip sheets instead!
