I'm not a music produce or dj, but I do like my music. This product works exactly as it's described and is amazing with a nice pair of over eat headphones. Had I tried it out first, I would not have bought it because it's so expensive, but it is a good conversation starter, people (on a college campus) will come up to me and ask what it is and I'll usually let them try it. It also works great with fps video games.
