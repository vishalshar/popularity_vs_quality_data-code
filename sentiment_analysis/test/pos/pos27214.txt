I did a lot of research, and decided that Autel was the right drone for me.  My order came in quickly and in fantastic condition, but the weather turned cold and windy, so I have not been able to get out and launch the drone yet.  The drone came well packaged, and it seems to be a solidly built drone.  I can't wait to get it up in the air.  I bought it for photography.
