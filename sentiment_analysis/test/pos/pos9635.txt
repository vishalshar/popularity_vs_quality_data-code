The luggage has been working great for me.  I don't expect to travel internationally for another month or so (heading to Tajikistan), but I have taken a few domestic trips with it.  The battery charge capability was very useful this past weekend when we checked out of the resort room by 11am but stayed at the resort for several more hours before leaving.  It charged my mothers phone so quickly that she was shocked and amazed because it was faster than her wall charger.I do like the digital lock feature when I go out of range but would also like an option to unlock when I return to close proximity.  I am unsure about this feature though because the range can be greater than I am thinking about.I do like the sturdy construction of the luggage.  I was originally concerned about how rugged it would be as I was following the progress of the campaign.  I am now convinced  it will survive my Africa trips.  I was surprised that there was no side handle as it was shown in the video.  I would add it to future versions as it can be helpful when loading an unloading to planes and cars.  Another note is that it seems off balance for four wheel rolling and works best when two wheel rolling for me.  I do like four wheel rolling so I would look into making it more stable in four wheel mode.
