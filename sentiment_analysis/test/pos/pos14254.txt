I tried many feeders and this one works the best for our cat after two weeks in.Pros:1. Great design! Our cat can not get more food than she is allowed (she was crafty w the others).2. It's reliable! our cat is eating on time, every time. I get a text and email letting me know.3. I can feed her with a touch of a button if I can't make it home for her dinner time (so awesome).4. This is great while away from home, we used the webcam to see her eating (that's hysterical btw).5. We are sleeping longer in the morning now! YayCons:1. The motor that turns the tray is LOUD. So loud that it scares the cat! Still!2. Tech folks, don't be confused by other reviews that say there is an app. There is NOT a mobile app. I have to login to a portal online and open my phone browser on my phone while away. FYI!3. Do not expect a good camera for the money you are spending. It's not in the product.4. Watch the videos to set up the feeder. The written instructions are missing a few steps.
