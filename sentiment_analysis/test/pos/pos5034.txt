I don't usually write reviews for products because I haven't the time or inclination most of the time.  I bought LUMO Run and was immediately impressed by the coaching aspect of the app and how fast my road running progressed.  This is NOT for trail runners because of the focus on cadence, bounce, rotation, etc.  Those aspects are difficult to control on technical terrain.  Back to road running, if you follow what LUMO is coaching, you will improve your road running.  This is a great product with a great app to support it.  Worth the money.
