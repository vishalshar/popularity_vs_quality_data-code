If you love coconut and chocolate you'll love this product. It's very flavorful and is perfect as a dip, spread, or my favorite..with bananas!! However you need to mix it a lot and make sure to mix the bottom because by the end I had to throw a lot out because the bottom was all dried up. I also paid $12.99 for this and found the same one a lot cheaper at Wegmans and other stores like it.
