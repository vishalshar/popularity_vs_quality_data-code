I love it so much I bought one for each door. But one of my doors isn't aligned properly, so it's annoying because it doesn't close well on its own. I need to fix the door, but I seem to always have too much going on. Must... simplify... my life... somehow. Now, the keypad, is really annoying. Half the time it doesn't even take your code, and if you enter it incorrectly once, good luck trying to get in with the keypad in any relatively short amount of time.
