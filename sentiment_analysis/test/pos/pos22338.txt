We have had the Whistle tracker for a few weeks. It works as advertised, so far. We have two dogs that roam freely on our place in the country. They are not inclined to leave. However, we want to know if they get the notion. We get about two days on a charge. The only requests would be more flexibility in setting the safe zone, better organization of information on how things work, and some improvements in their "basestation" - based power saving scheme. Can't comment, yet, on durability.
