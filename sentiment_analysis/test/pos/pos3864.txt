Bluesmart Smart Carry-On Suitcase, Connects to Your Smartphone on iOS/AndroidI recently received my Bluesmart carry-on after ordering it through Amazon. The case arrived quickly. The first thing that struck me as I unboxed it were the simple aesthetic touches that the company has added that complement the overall elegance. Its definitely an attractive carry-on case and simple touches like the hubless wheels, clean lines and blue color accents on the wheels and handles definitely contribute to its good looks. On a closer inspection, I was impressed with the quality and feel of the wheels. They have a solid construction with good bearings and a nice smooth rolling action.  The front of the case is made from a strong canvas-like material and stitching all appears to have a high level of durability to it. The remainder of the case is a polycarbonate material with a tidy finish and appears to reasonably scratch resistant.I tend to do overnighters or 2-3 day trips and in the past Ive usually opted to leave the carry-on at home and instead take a shoulder carry bag as I found other carry-ons a little bulky for short trips. The Bluesmart is definitely smaller than your standard carry-on but in my opinion its an ideal size for a couple of nights away, particularly if youre a business traveller who travels fairly light. The main internal compartment will happily take a pair of shoes, couple of pairs of shirts, toiletries and a jacket with ease. As other reviewers have noted, it may not be suitable if youre travelling for an extended period of time or like to take a lot of things with you.The easy access front pocket is fantastic for getting through the TSA check quickly (and Im TSAPre checked so its now lightening quick). I usually just throw in my wallet and keys into the front pocket and sometimes I dont even need to grab an extra tray. Its great when youre getting on and off the plane also, just flick open the pocket grab your laptop and throw the bluesmart in the overhead. Absolutely love it.My absolute biggest travel pain is running low on battery on my phone. In the past it happened to me almost routinely. Id be stuck in meetings throughout the day and then rush off to the airport with my boarding pass on my phone. Id get to the security line with my phone beeping for low battery praying that it will hold up enough to let me get to the plane. It has completely removed that stress knowing that I dont have to worry about running out of battery while traveling.The rolling action of a carry-on is top of my list of things to look out for. Theres nothing worse than racing through an airport with a dodgy wheel. The wheels on the Bluesmart are silky smooth. I was even able to pull off the 360 shown on the video.The global positioning is a nice touch and Im sure that was the kicker feature in the campaign. From what I can see it seems to be accurate when I have checked it. I think this feature will really come into its own if Bluesmart releases a full size travel case that gets checked into the hold. With the carry-on, its certainly a nice bit of peace of mind but given that the case is usually by your side it hasnt resonated with me quite as much. Its a difficult piece of technology to pull off so Im looking forward to seeing the company leverage this in upcoming products.The remote lock and unlock and bluetooth proximity are two features Im definitely excited about, however they still feel a bit version 1.0. Im hoping that the team may be able to do a software update at some point. The lock and unlock works well when the phone is connected to the case but the connection between the phone and case seems to require getting reconnected each time which takes some of the delight away from this feature. I have an android phone and it looks like some of the features on iOS are not yet available on Android such as the trip data.Ive noticed other reviewers comment on poor security features. In my opinion its pretty difficult to make a carry-on that would prevent someone from accessing it if they had it in their possession. My take on security for a carry-on is that it should prevent a passer by from opening the case to slip something in. I think the lock mechanism definitely provides that level of security but certainly with the right tools or time you could gain access.TL;DRGreat Features: - Easy Access Front Pocket - Built in phone charging - Good Looks and sturdy build quality - Super smooth rolling action - GPS positioning anywhere in the world (without an extra subscription)Version 1.0 Features (Will be great after a little improvement) - Bluetooth Features (sometimes tricky to connect phone to case over BLE) - Lock/Unlock by Phone (would be great if Bluetooth connectivity is improved) - Built in scale (again will be a great feature once Bluetooth connectivity is improved)Overall - Smaller than some other carry-ons but perfect size for over-nighters or 2-3 day trips. Good quality little carry-on case with some novel innovative and useful features.
