I use the speaker for a Fit4Mom class called Stroller Strides. It's a mommy and me workout. I use the speaker in a outdoor park setting at least 3x/week. The speaker is just right to hear over outdoor noise and baby talks. The sound is very clear without distortion, has a bit of base but not too much. My bluetooth connects well. It's been very durable and dropped several times. I am reviewing the turtle shell with 6 months of ownership. I can not review the water resistance, just haven't been in a situation where water has gotten on it.
