I LOVE the smell.. that's the only thing to like about this.  I've used tons of different conditioners on my thick, curly, long hair, and this might be the worst I've ever used.  It leaves a really strange residue and makes it almost impossible to comb out.  I have used all natural hair products before and I know that there's an adjustment period but I've given it 3 weeks and there is zero improvement in it's effectiveness, in fact, it may have gotten worse as time as went by.REVISION: I admittedly hated this shampoo and conditioner for about 3 weeks, not kidding, HATED it.  But, after I talked to a friend about it, they told me that I need to do a cleansing mask to remove residue from past shampoos and conditioners. So I used a clay mask and stripped all the residual "crap".. the VERY next time I used it, I finally got what the big deal was.  I know I sound very wishy washy, but I will buy this again.  Only real drawback now is the amount of conditioner I have to use on my hair for good coverage, but that's nothing new with this brand as opposed to others.
