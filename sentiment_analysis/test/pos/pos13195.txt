My dogs took to it like fish to water, I just put some of their waste on the grass and they just know to do their business.  Instead of using the special absorbant powder that goes with the kit I just use kitty litter in the urine collection drawers to help mask the smell.  Never regretted the purchase even though the price was $30 higher when I purchased it.
