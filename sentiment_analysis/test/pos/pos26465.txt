This is the most fun you will ever have growing a garden!  The basil practically grows overnight!  I bought a second Click and Grow garden and I'm trying the miniature strawberries.  They grow very slowly, but they are gorgeous and I can't wait for them to bud.  This is an excellent way to get children interested in growing plants and to grow fresh food for your own health.
