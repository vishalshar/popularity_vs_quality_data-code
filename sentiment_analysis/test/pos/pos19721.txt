I ordered this not too long ago. It came quickly. It was pretty easy to set up. There wasn't much to it.The suction cup has a very sticky surface so its not going to budge from where you place it. Which is great, until you want to relocate the stand. Removing the suction cup from the surface you placed it is extremely hard. It took me roughly 10 minutes and a lot of awkward positioning to remove it from my windshield. If I didnt know any better I would have thought someone pulled a prank on my and super glued it to my window.That being said, the sticky surface of the suction cup did not become any less sticky after relocating it so that is pretty impressive. And It does what it is intended to do. Hold you phone in place and not fall from where you put it. So I cant dock it that much for being hard to pull off. Just keep that in mind when you go to place it in your car and make sure you're placing it where you want it to stay.Aside from that, Its sometimes a slight pain to open the arm that holds your phone, Its spring activated and when you push your phone onto the release button, it closes shut. But sometimes, it takes a minute for me to get the arm open and in the lock position. Just a minor annoyance but nothing that would discourage me from using the product.Other than that. Its a great product.Some final notes, If your phone has buttons on the side, be mindful of how you place your phone on the mount. My phone's power button is on the side and if I dont position the phone correctly, it holds it down and turns the phone off. So be aware of where your buttons are and place your phone in a way so that they dont get pressed when you mount your phone.
