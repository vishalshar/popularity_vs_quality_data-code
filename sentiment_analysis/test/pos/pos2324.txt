I ordered this along with a Lytro Camera. While it does not like the Lytro cap (the cap gets stuck on it, so that you should remove the camera cap before pushing it into this sleeve) it protects the camera nicely, allowing one to carry the camera in a pocket (or purse) without risking damage to the front element. I am glad that I acquired it, but I wish it would allow the cap to stay in the camera. That would allow a dual layer of protection to be used at once...
