I dont typically leave reviews, but felt the need to provide one for this product.  I have battled a rat in my garage for years.  I wasnt able to use poison traps, because I have four Yorkshire Terriers that could have ended up getting to those types of baits.I have tried various types of rat traps, but they never worked.  I tried the spring loaded and maze traps, without results.  I always worried my dogs would get around the barriers I constructed to keep them away from the spring loaded traps and end up hurting themselves.After an acquaintance told me about the Raticator, I was skeptical.  But, it was better than dealing with the rat.  I purchased it, and loaded it with some dry dog food and on the third night, I had my first kill.  This thing is AWESOME, I just walked it to the trash can, dumped it out, and baited it up again with no mess within a few seconds.My only suggestion for improvement would be to include a small sticker set with the Raticator, so that you could attach a sticker on the side of the unit for each kill.  You could have a trophy board of all your successful hunts.  Maybe the rats would see your wall of success stories and just decide to leave on their own accord.Just buy it, you wont regret it!  Unless you like doing battle, without results from those creatures.
