Used to keep the dogs honest. These are larger than I was expecting (didn't bother to read the dimensions) and are probably better with less dexterous/arthritic/huge hands. Doesn't feel especially heavy or super-durable but how durable does it have to be while adhered to the inside of a closet or fridge?  The buttons do their jobs well and latch at their endpoints. As best as I can tell, it's held up without any degradation.Bought a second one for a family member who does fostering for a dog rescue.. three people live there on difference schedules and they double, even triple fed once in a while. They're in love with this thing.
