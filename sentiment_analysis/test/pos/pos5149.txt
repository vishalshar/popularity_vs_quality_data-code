The Bare Natural Coconut Chips are one of my favorite snacks, but they are EXPENSIVE! I used to purchase them regularly from my local Starbucks, but when they ran out, I ran to Amazon (as usual) to stock up. For those customers who are like me that love the taste but not the price, I have a better alternative....Trader Joes has their own toasted coconut chips that are GRAND! And get this, their price: $1.99!!! Their bags are similar in size, not much of a difference, and they contain more product (which is an issue many of us have with the Bare brand). I don't mean to take Bare's customers away, but I think they should consider lowering the price of their product.
