The replacement itself went pretty smoothly. My phone works great, no short circuiting or anything. My only complaint is that the touch-sensors on the screen sometimes work with the lightest touch, like the original screen, and sometimes I have to tap multiple times. Pretty sure this is product quality, not installation related. Texting is a pain.
