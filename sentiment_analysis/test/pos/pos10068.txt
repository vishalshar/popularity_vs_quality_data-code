I learned about this product a few years ago by watching Michelle Phan's make up tutorials on YouTube. I thought it was a great idea back then but for some reason, never made the purchase. However, I purchased the product 2 weeks ago and LOVE the item. It's mesh design is a great way to store my makeup brushes and keep them damage free while letting them dry. I am cleaning my brushes more now than I was before. This product is so good and inexpensive that I am purchasing another set as we speak! I recommend this product to anyone who's serious about the care of their makeup brushes.
