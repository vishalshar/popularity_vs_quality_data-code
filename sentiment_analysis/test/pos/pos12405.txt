Even if you've used iCracked before, make sure you have some time on your hands when you sit down for this because the iPhone 6 is a good bit more complicated than the previous models I dealt with.ICracked screens have been as good as the original every time I've used them before but only giving 4 stars because there's a small bit of the top of the new screen that's faded and a little lighter than the rest of the screen. It was probably something on my end though - full faith in iCracked!
