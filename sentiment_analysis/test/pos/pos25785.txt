Purchased this after my Sony pulse headset crapped out after 3 years.  I would have purchased the pulse pro if it was available but this is a High quality product, very comfortable, product that feels solid.  The controls are quick and easy.  Great sound and solid directional sound from a stereo headset.  I game nightly on PS4 almost exclusively fps games.  Directional sound not as good as Sony 'virtual surround sound' imo but good enough.  Worth the money,paid about 130 for them, would pay more.
