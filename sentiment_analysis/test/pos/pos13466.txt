(1) The packaging is amazing. The best packaging I've ever seen for earphones.(2) They sound is crystal clear. The highs sound amazing and, in general, I find that I can hear way more of the mix with these - definitely a lot closer to what the artist/producer intended. Songs with perceptual panning sound amazing. I would have liked a tiny bit more low end but only a minor complaint. The mids are good and the highs are not harsh at all.(3) The earbuds are not very comfortable - they're not the worst, but I've definitely had much better. I've been using in-ears for ~10 years at this stage so I definitely know what I like and don't like. I wouldn't say this is a deal-breaker though. There's a ton of additional earbuds in the box but I only really found 1 pair that were (somewhat) comfortable in my ears. My ears felt a bit sore after listening to them throughout my work-day.(4) They are not suitable for exercising - trust me on this one. They won't stay in your ears. I have a pair of $50 similar style Sony earphones that sit perfectly in my ears without moving while I workout but with these that wasn't the case. Again, not a deal-breaker if you're only buying them for casual listening. They're well suited for listening at a desk in work or walking around with.(5) The mic control is good quality and works perfectly with my iPhone 6.The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I unfortunately have to return them due to a slight defect on the left earbud causing a slight (but very annoying) rattle. The earphones feel premium but this defect makes me question to actual build quality and the longevity of the earphones.Would I buy them again? Though they sound great, I'm skeptical about they'll last more than 6-9 months.Are they worth $99? I would personally say no. Somewhere around the ~$70 mark would be more suitable.Would I recommend them? I would definitely recommend giving them a chance and deciding for yourself.
