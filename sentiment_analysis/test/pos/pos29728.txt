It is the best 3d pen I have ever bought! It has a very nice build quality. I could throw it on the ground and it would still not break. It is very easy to clear jams and with this pen your can buy the nozzle and change out the nozzles. How cool is that. It is the best, i think that everybody should buy this pen.
