These are good pour caps that function as intended.  The pour cleanly and, when seated properly they do not leak.  However, after extensive use I have found several minor issues.1)  The flip cap often closes by itself when pouring.  Annoying.  I remove the cap when pouring and put it back on afterwards.2)  I find the wide mouth cap to be quite hard to remove from a cold jar.  I need to run it under warm water to loosen it.3)  The rubber gaskets stretch with use.  Perhaps mine weren't always seated perfectly, but nonetheless, plan on replacing them periodically.Even with these issues, I would buy them again.
