No kidding about the boost grip... Makes difficult or one handed catches a dream. Unfortunately I tried to use it to recondition older gloves that had lost grip and realized it's a temporary solution. Dirt/water will remove the effect from the gloves. I'm going to have to invest in new gloves, but will definitely continue to use this
