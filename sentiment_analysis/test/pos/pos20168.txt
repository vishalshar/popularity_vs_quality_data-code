Always have been a fan of Outburst as a party game.  Some of the categories were not exactly what I expected especially some of the answers.  Not always the most popular answers, we had one with Seinfeld phrases and 3 people that have seen every episode and they got 3 out of 10 answers.  Not for a lack of trying but some of the phrases just were not popular.  Found the same thing with Number 1 hits of the 80's.  I love and know my 80's music but some of the songs and band names I never heard of them.  I do like the more ADULT questions because they are absolutely hilarious.  So some very good cards and others your going to scratch your head.
