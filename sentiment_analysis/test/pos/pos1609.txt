This product is remarkable! It works exactly as claimed. The set-up is quite simple if you follow the cartoon-style instructions. Being challenged that way, I emailed Vecto-Volo with questions. The response was immediate and amazing. In the interest of enhanced safety, I highly recommend this product to anyone who drives a motorcycle. My club made me ride sweep (last in line) at our last rally to provide decel warnings to the cars behind us.
