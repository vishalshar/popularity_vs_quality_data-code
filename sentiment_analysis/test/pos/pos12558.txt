I had this case for my iPhone 5, and had 2 complaints with that one.1) it was really thick. Everyone used to ask me how much extra battery life my case gave me.2) I couldn't fit the 4 cards I needed to in the case. It was always difficult to position them all in to get the case to close, and only 1 of them had any raised numbers. I don't carry a purse or wallet around any more so this is very important for me to always have these 4 cards. Required constant reshuffling of the cards to get the phone to close at minimum to not interfere with the camera. I eventually had to take the card with raised numbers out and that proved extremely inconvenient since I had to constantly change it in when I needed it.Both of these complaints are solved with this case. The new internal clip helps this phone be slimmer than the last case AND makes it easy to fit even 5 cards.I really like the design as well, it goes very well with my white-faced phone. I've only had it a couple weeks but I think it will resist dirt well, so far so good! Also, others have complained that the material isn't very good. I had the 'rubber' material case for my iPhone 4 and it would get dirty very quickly. I haven't had many issues with phone slippage, just if I have it in my back pocket and I am sitting on the floor, it slips out of my pocket - but I attribute that to the size of the phone v. the material of the case.
