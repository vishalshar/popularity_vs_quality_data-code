I really love this new Kinsa thermometer. It's great for kids. My little son likes to hear Elmo talk to him and play with the thermometer while I'm in the Kinsa app reading their guidance on what to do next based on his symptoms. Really cool product and most importantly it takes an accurate temperature in one second! I would highly recommend it for any parent with young kids and as a cute baby registry gift.
