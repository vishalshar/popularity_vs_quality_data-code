I bought Kuna for a number of reasons. One being to know who's at my door when I'm not home and being able to speak with the person via two way mic and keeping an eye on delivered packages to my home throughout the day. It has many features and prerecorded messages to set and customize. The light can be set for motion or dusk to dawn motion sensitivity needs tweaking this thing will pick up people walking by if your front door faces the sidewalk like mine. It picks up from 10-15 ft. away. Night vision is OK it's not the best but you can see whats going on. Also try not to use a very bright led the bright light will shine into the camera lens making it harder to see at night. It's a great product at a great price point. It will send a notification to your smartphone when movement is detected it's a must have!
