The taste isn't spectacular, but I'm planning on using these for an early morning breakfast-on-the-go so taste isn't a huge issue. As far as the people losing it over the L-carnithine, theres no point in losing it over something no one would care about if it was only listed on the ingredients list and not on the front of the box. I definitely feel that caffeine boost as if I had a cup of regular coffee. It also kept me full for the better part of a day (not an easy task).
