I bought this for my brother in law for christmas. Hes into vikings and thngs of that nature. He loves it! I was a little concerned about needing the stand every time you want to set the cup down but it comes with a neckstrap that makes his beer portable! And when he wears it while we're playing card games at the table when he laughs the cup clicks on the table! Its hilarious!
