I have been looking for a way to use the Amazon Echo as a complete remote control voice interface to my dozen or so entertainment center devices. The Logitech Harmony system I have been using is very good at what it does, but it simply does not allow, even with IFTTT, direct individual button control via voice command.Anymote Home essentially replaces that expensive Harmony Hub based system. And, the battery powered IR blaster is great, allowing placement on my coffee table w/o any cables needed. If it lasts even half as long as the 1 year the mfgr claims, I will be very happy.I have not yet found anything the Harmony can do as far as RC functions that the Anymote cannot do. That includes complicated macros and extensive remote and button editing. And further, I do not see any "15 device" limit like the Harmony has. It has a learning mode as well for those remotes that are not already in the extensive database.I do have many years of programmable remote control (primary Logitech's) experience, so learning a new system was fairly straight forward. But like any powerful and programmable system, there will be a learning curve. But once you get a feel for it, it becomes faster to program it via the smartphone app (Android in my case) than the Logitech system is.I had no real problems except with the learning mode for one of my (very cheap) remote controls. This was one of those small, cheapo watch battery type remotes that controlled a HDMI matrix switch I use. I had to make several tries for the 8 individual codes to all 'take'. My take was it had little or nothing to do with the Anymote device or learning mode setup, but with the cheap remote control itself, since only 2 of the 8 codes presented any problem.When I did have the learning mode problem, I received prompt and courteous email support. The only thing really not up to par IMO was the lack of more concise and organized documentation. The site does have Faqs that cover, in a limited way, many of the questions that come up, but it seems a bit scattered. Thanks to the great email support, the lack of better online documentation was no real problem.Anymote Home is now my primary RC system, thanks to its thorough Amazon Echo integration and powerful programming capabilities.
