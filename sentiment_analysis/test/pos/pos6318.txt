I'm a big fan of playing cards: card tricks, games, even just shuffling a deck to keep my hands busy. I've had some decks so long that their cases ended up being held together by more tape than cardboard, so that's why I wanted to try out a more durable alternative for my recently acquired Princess Bride themed deck.With the Card Caddy, the plastic feels incredibly strong, and while it's not quite as satisfying as sliding your deck out of its normal case, it's very easy to open and retrieve your cards. The big hole in the center does make it possible for debris or water to get into the case, and damage your cards, but that won't be too much of an issue for your average user. And as mentioned in the title, the Card Caddy is definitely more bulky than your normal case, but that serves to make your cards basically-invulnerable to any drops or impacts while in this case.My main suggestion would be to design an option for slightly larger decks of cards, but otherwise I feel that I've made a good investment with the two that I bought.
