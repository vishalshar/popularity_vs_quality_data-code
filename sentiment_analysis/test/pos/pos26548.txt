We bought this for our Christmas tree since it was such a hassle to reach behind the tree to turn on and off the other power cord. I love that I don't have to do that anymore! We already had Wink for other devices in our home so we just had to add this to the app, which was easy.There are 4 outlets, however only 2 of them are able to be used remotely. The only other issue I have is that sometimes when I open the app, it shows them as off when they're actually on, so I end up turning them on and then back off. But if I'm not home to see that they're actually on, I would think that they're already off, when they're on.My husband said that after our Christmas Tree is gone, he's going to put it in our room so I can plug my hair iron in it since I'm always forgetting to turn it off!
