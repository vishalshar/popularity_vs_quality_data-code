As someone who was never a butter person, 4th & Heart's ghee has absolutely changed the way my wife and I eat and cook everyday. Our personal favorite is the Himalayan Pink Salt, but all the flavors have a distinct use in our kitchen. Whether it be on a nice toasted English Muffin for breakfast, basting a a nice piece of steak, or even a bulletproof coffee on the go, my wife and I literally use it on everything! I highly recommend checking out this delicious ghee for your own and adding it to your daily diet. You won't regret it!
