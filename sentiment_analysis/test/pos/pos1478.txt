I bought the kit at Christmas for my husband. We followed the instructions and got one tiny stalk but it quickly hardened and did not grow out properly. Then nothing - for almost two months. Even with his green thumb - we had no luck and realized it must be because of the winter dryness.We moved it upstairs into the master bedroom which gets residual humidity from the bathroom. Within a week - they took off and grew as shown in the picture.My advice would be not to keep it near a heat register and be aware that the "moister" the atmosphere the better they grow. Keep them out of the light also. The corner of the room that we moved them to gets no light.Good luck!
