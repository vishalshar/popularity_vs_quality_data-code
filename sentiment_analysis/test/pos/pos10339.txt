This is one of the most useful products I've ever purchased.It is fast drying and odor resistant, just it claims. I use it daily for showering. By patting my hair dry with the superabsorbent material, I cut my haircare time in at least half.I was really nervous about taking the company's word that the towel was UV protective though. I'm very pale and burn easily. When I went to my friend's graduation earlier this month though, I had to cross my fingers and hope for the best while baking in the heavy afternoon sun for four hours. I brought this towel with me and wore it as a shawl. It is so lightweight and airy that it wasn't awkward to wear. I wrapped it over my shoulders and head for the duration of the event, and no part of me that was covered by the towel got burned or tanned. My shins got burned where my dress didn't fully cover my legs; the difference between the two areas was startling.This towel is perfect. Buy a few.
