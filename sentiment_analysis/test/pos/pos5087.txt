I purchased the Misfit Ray right after it was released to use as a sleep tracker and step counter. I love that it is waterproof and that it does not require charging. That means I never have to take it off to charge it, shower, or swim. It is very comfortable and easy to adjust. I barely notice that I even have it on. As far as I can tell, it tracks accurately, in steps, activity, and sleep. I have used the locate phone feature more times than I can count, and it has worked perfectly every time. I havent had any trouble getting it to sync correctly with my phone, and I find the app easy to use. I love that it integrates with map my fitness so I can add specific workouts to my daily log. Its nice to be able to wear it alongside my running watch without taking up a ton of space on my wrist. The batteries lasted me just about 3 months before I had to change them. Which leads me to its only drawback. When changing the batteries, I lost the very tiny rubber washer that keeps the unit waterproof. I contacted the company and I am hoping to get a replacement washer for it. Besides that, I love using this tracker, it is an easy way to keep track of sleep and activity, and has boosted my game in keeping fit and healthy.UPDATE: Since it was still under warranty, the company exchanged my tracker for a brand new one, free of charge. Excellent customer service!
