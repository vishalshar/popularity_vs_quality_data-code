Great vitamin...son loves the taste!. The sugar doesn't really bother me so much, knowing the fact he's getting a vitamin that's non GMO, has no dyes, no preservatives, and is gluten and allergen free! My son is also is a little hyperactive and lacks focus at times. I really feel that these have helped with thoae issues too. Second time buying, and will continue to buy. Great vitamin compared to others on the market.
