Works well.  I used it to troubleshoot an electronic circuit and discovered two transistors were over heating.  However these transistors were OK, but it indicated another short in the circuitry and by finding these two transistors were over heating, it put me in the ball-park and made it easier to locate the problem.  If an animal (or person) is standing behind the curtains, the heat is sometimes detectable.  I was able to see my cat behind the curtain using the thermal imagining.  It is a little awkward when using the double mode because the two cameras do not see the same size image.  Still it's fun to use
