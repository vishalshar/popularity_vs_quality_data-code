I bought this enclosure to keep my Rachio controller out of the weather and was really surprised at the quality of the unit.  The controller uses a power converter - one of those little black boxes you plug in with a wire to the controller.  This box is designed with an outlet inside the box to fit that power converter so that it is also out of the weather.  This makes the enclosure kind of large, but its worth the space. The only complaint I have about the enclosure is that in order to use the internal electrical outlet, you have to wire in a regular power cord and that's not included.  The recommendation was to use the cord from the old controller, which assumes you are upgrading.  While I was upgrading, I wanted to run the new system in phantom mode in parallel with the old system to make sure it was going to do the job.  So, I bought a power cord at the local hardware store for a few bucks.  Its not a problem, but Rachio might want to consider including the power cord with the unit.  It would raise the cost slightly, but the cost as is is really a good deal considering what you actually get for your money.
