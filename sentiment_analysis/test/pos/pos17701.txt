I've always wondered why all of the normal sprinkler programmers were so miserable to operate. Finally one that makes sense and has a UI that wasn't designed in the 50's. I love this thing so much. Install took about ten minutes. Super easy to program and operate.It makes replacing and adjusting sprinkler heads so much easier too. Just carry your phone and you can turn them on and off remotely while you replace/adjust.
