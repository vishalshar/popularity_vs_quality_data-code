I am a computer science student that also does photo and video editing so I needed something that could handle about 5 different IDE's as well as the full Adobe creative cloud suite. While I am in CS when it comes to hardware I am not the most knowledgeable so I'll just share some pros and cons.Pros:1. Can run Photoshop and Lightroom simultaneously without lagging. My previous laptop could barely handle one at a time.2. I can render a 5-8  minute HD 1080p video in 5 min or less. Legit insane as my previous laptop would take about an hour.3. The graphic card is awesome and the fact that is has both an Nvidia and an Intel integrated graphics card is even more awesome! I didn't even know about this until after I bought the laptop.4. I don't have to worry about my computer freezing up when I compile projects or run local servers. This was a big issues with my last laptop.5. It's soooooo light! I hated carrying around my other laptop and the fact that this is still a 15in but is easy to travel with is awesome. To be honest this was probably to biggest selling point for me.Cons:1. Though the sound quality is good they don't get very loud. I like to play music in my room when I am getting ready and pretty much just use my phone as the laptop speakers are tough to hear.2. The fact that I had to go in and change which graphics card I wanted it to use for programs that should clearly be using the Nvidia card was slightly annoying but it was only a one time thing that took about 10 minutes, but still.Overall I think its a great laptop especially for the price. A mac that cost more than this wouldn't have half the stuff this laptop has.I definitely think it was worth the money I spent on it!
