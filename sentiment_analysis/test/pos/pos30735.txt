I have used this case exclusivly since the iPhone IV and have not found another case that compares to it. The magnet is Ã¼ber helpful for me at work. It allows me to keep my phone out of the way and yet still in view. I do not use the rubber surround in that it makes it feel too bulky in my pocket. That being said, I've never felt wanting for more protection. If I used the surround I probably would not have had to replace the case.  That was my fault, not a defect in the case. I've dropped my phone from heights in excess of 6 feet with no damge to the phone. Another aspect of the case that is worthy of mentioning is that the lip around the screen does not prevent the use of an accurately installed glass screen protector.
