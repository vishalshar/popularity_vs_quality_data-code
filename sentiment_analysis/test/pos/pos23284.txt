I purchased this with the specific intention of using it with my neice and nephew.  The unit has since been named "Dancing Walter" and has been the source of a ton of fun.  The unit itself is easy to control, durable with solid battery life.  Definitely purchase the rugged tires for outdoor use btw.  The only knock is that you need to re-calibrate the unit pretty often as location and angle relative to the cell phone make the driving inaccurate.  This is best used if you can stay stationary without turning much.  Either way, for the speed, maneuverability, and customization for the lights this is a great toy for kids and fun to drive for adults.
