I use these for quick clean up at Bonnaroo. I love it there, but I do not love the smell of my B.O. And sometimes, I need something a little stronger than baby wipes.These are pretty big towelettes. They have a pleasant smell, plans don't leave you feeling sticky when it dries. This is the 3rd year I'm bringing some of these with me, that's how much I like them.
