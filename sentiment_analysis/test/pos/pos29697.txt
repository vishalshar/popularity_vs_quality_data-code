Good product, sturdy and fun. After 3 months of use (and some 100 miles on it) it keeps on going and almost paid 25% of its cost back in avoided parking fees. The speed is great to get around yet not excessive where you would get in trouble.A few minor issues:- The rubber cover for the rear hub (where the power cable penetrates to the rear axle) keeps coming off. I am thinking of super-gluing it to the frame, as riding with exposed wires cannot be good for the longevity of the product.- The handlebars are very flimsy- The accelerator handle heats up considerably when engaged for long periods of time- Something rattles terribly in the chassis when riding on uneven pavement, sounds like a loose part somewhere- The pin assembly is a bit unergonomic and laborious to operate; there are surely better solutions to fold/unfold the scooter.- The ride is pretty hard. You have to ride in a skiing position, with knees slightly bent otherwise you will find yourself with some pain in the lower back.
