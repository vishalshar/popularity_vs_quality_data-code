I was an early adopter of Orbotix "robots."  I had a Sphero almost immediately after they came out, and a Sphero 2.0 the day they came out.  My wife has a regular Sphero as well.I've had an Ollie since about a week after it came out, and I'm just now getting around to reviewing it.I've used the Ollie extensively.  Fun is an understatement.  This thing FLIES.  It's fast, precise, and works very well.  I like how it almost magically turns on just by me holding my phone up to it.Many of the options you find in Sphero you find here...such as the ability to change the color of the lights and things like that.  You can adjust the speeds for indoor use or for outdoor use.Outdoor use is one of the big advantages to Ollie to me.  I've used the Sphero outside, and it just doesn't seem to be as fun as it is indoors.  It's simply a bit too slow.  Ollie, on the other hand, has plenty of wheels to get himself going on pavement and cement.  He's a blast to drive around outside.The only negative to Ollie??  I kind of wish I had gotten the Darkside version...the black looks killer...but, there's nothing wrong with being the good guy, I guess!!!This is a fun toy...I highly recommend it!!!
