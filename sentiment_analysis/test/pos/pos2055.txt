We love this idea.  We introduced the switch witch to our 2 1/2 year old son this Halloween and it was a success.  He doesn't fully understand the concept of Halloween and the switch witch, but he seemed to really enjoy the story and of course was thrilled to get a gift from the witch.We know we can simply tell our son "no" and limit his candy consumption, but I love the idea of having a fun family tradition.  We're also limiting his candy through positive reinforcement.  We're not total scrooges though so we let our son have just enough candy to fill the little cauldron, which will last him a while.  He gave up most of his candy, but in return he got a fun toy so there was no kicking and screaming from him.  It was a win win for all of us.In regards to the physical product, the quality is really nice.  The book is written in rhyme and has beautiful illustrations.  And the witch herself is very cute.  There aren't a lot of girly details on the doll, which I'm thankful for because it appeals to all genders.
