I've been searching for a doorbell that will let me monitor my front door with my phone. The problem is that I don't have a doorbell at my house, and I've seen other products like Ring and SkyBell, and they all require an electrical doorbell to connect. For a guy like me who doesn't have electrical wires at my front door found RemoBell a match made in heaven product.You only need 6 AA batteries, which they provided, and it works just fine. I haven't had any issues with the batteries. They said it will last for 4 months, which is pretty efficient battery usage.The sound quality is amazing and the picture is crystal clear. RemoBell also came with a mount. One of my fear with a battery powered doorbell is that someone could steal it; however, I can tell you it is very safe and secure. No one is taking that thing without breaking the wall or the door. Trust me. I've tested it.Overall, the quality is great, the sound is great, but most of all, I can mount it anywhere without electrical wires.
