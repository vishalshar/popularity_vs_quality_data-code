First I want to say I love this tank, my beta and 2 snails are happy. Its a nice size tank for 1 beta and a couple snails.Plants are growing great.  I took off one star because there are design flaws. First some seeds fall through the cups and end up in the tank. Not a problem as I kinda like the live plants in the tank, except daily they get sucked up by the water pump and I have to disrupt the tank to clean the pump. Second there is no place for other cords to come out if i want to add a heater, bubble decor, or lights. Finally the top is flimsy. I had read there where updates done to this tank to address some problems like adding more places for cords, but that is not what I received. After all is said I still really love the tank, though its the only one I own so therefore have nothing to compare it to.
