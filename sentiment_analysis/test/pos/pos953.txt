Warning:You must have a Sirius Internet plan for this radio to work. This is a totally separate plan than what you may have in your car  Typically if you have a car plan, you can bundle this with the internet plan for a reduced cost. Also this radio will only receive Sirius content.  Other internet radio channels are not allowedI bought this as a replacement to the Sirius TTR1, which stopped working.  I find this to be a very good radio.  Here are my pros/consPro:Very good speaker quality.  Even on low volume the sound fills a room.On Demand accessibility.  This is is one of the best features  of the radioImproved WiFi capability over the TTR1Remote control comes with the radio.Con:Initial setup is very cumbersome.  You have to dial through the series of letters and numbers for each new entry.  It took me 15 mins to get the radio set up and linked to my Sirius accountLCD display is to bright.  In a darkened room the LCD fills the room with light. Even turning down the settings down to the lowest level does not alleviate the issue. I had to cover the LCD display to darken my bedroom.  Honestly I almost returned the radio because of this, but the positives of the radio outweighed the negatives.
