I absolutely love the Bellabeat Leaf! I was really looking for a simple technology that would easy track my activities throughout the day and this was the easy choice. Before this I actually had an Apple Watch, which I did love, however it was a little too fancy and advanced for what I was looking for. The Leaf is fashionable, easy to use and probably the most accurate tracker I've ever used! I'm buying one for my best friend for her birthday because I know she'lol love it too!
