Got it for 50 bucks and wasn't expecting it to be very good.  Turns out I was wrong!  It is my sons favorite Christmas present and I have fun chasing him around shooting and boxing his other toys with my iPhone.  Crushes batteries so you may want to invest the extra 30 to buy the rechargeable battery pack.  If I can find another Mip for 50 I'm definitely gonna get another for bot battles!
