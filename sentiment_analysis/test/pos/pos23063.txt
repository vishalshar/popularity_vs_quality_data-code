To the people who are giving these bad reviews are obviously not using these correctly. There are multiple ways to lace these. There is a regular fit, a tight fit, and a loose fit. You can also do a "custom" fit like I did. Please go to HICKIES.com to learn how to tie them correctly.I don't use these all the time but to be honest, I much prefer "Lock Laces"None of them broke. None of them bent out of proportion. Some of them came loose and I had to put them back into place but it was quite rare. Overall, it does its job perfectly, even for adults with wide feet.Would recommend and buy again.
