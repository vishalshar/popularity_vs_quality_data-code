It says you can moisten them for more flavor, but my puppy loved them just the way they were.  I used them as a treat to train him to enter his kennel on command and he was so ecstatic he was falling over himself trying to get into it ASAP.  They lasted forever, as well, and I used about 2 per day for training (about 2 months worth).
