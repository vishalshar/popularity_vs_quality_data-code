This travel pillow is very versatile! I love that this pillow can transform into whatever you want it to be, unlike other travel pillows that only take one shape.I bought this pillow for travel purposes-I wanted something to help me sleep sitting up that would stop my head from bobbing. I found that wearing it like an infinity scarf is a bit too big for me where it doesn't give me much head support, but making it into a U shape and pulling one end into the other end worked like a charm! The only thing that prevented me from sleeping my entire flight was the child kicking my chair behind me.When I arrived at my destination I used this pillow as a body pillow. It is so long that it was able to go between my knees and I could rest my chin on it. I later used it as suplimental neck support after my wisdom teeth surgery when I was laying on the couch.This pillow might seem pricey for a travel pillow, but it could be used as much more than just a travel pillow! I would never spend $40 on a pillow that doesn't allow for movement. 10/10 would recommend this pillow because it is everything that the description says (soft material (feels like comforter material), vibrant color, etc.) and it can be used for so much more than just a travel pillow. This pillow is any kind of pillow you want it to be!TL;DRPros-soft material, solid color, is more than just a travel pillow, you think it this pillow does it, makes sleeping up comfortableCons-a bit bulky and big
