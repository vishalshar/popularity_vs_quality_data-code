I fly over 100,000 miles a year, so I'm really familiar with feeling like a mosquito looking for an open outlet. This little thing adds convenience and fun to the hunt. Being able to use the "tail" as a ledge to prop the phone up is very cool.I gave it 4 stars because I feel the cable management still needs a bit of work. It's very simple and elegant, but does tend to bend the cable pretty harshly as it leaves the brick, and the loose end doesn't really stay fixed in the notch the way the photo would have you believe, at least not once you've tossed it in your bag. The old-style 30-pin connector would make this a challenge, but I have to believe the manufacturer can do better for the Lightning cables.
