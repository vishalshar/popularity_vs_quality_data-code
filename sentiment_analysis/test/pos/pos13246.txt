If you are a geeky power-traveler such as myself, this is the perfect carry-on companion.  Plenty of space for the gadgets, including the ideal space for my iPad pro.  Plenty of juice to power your devices during those international trips where its hard to find an outlet that works in small airports.  The app has worked perfectly so far, especially for the lock and unlocking and checking the battery level.  Really liked the attention to detail in the materials and it's just a great looking piece of luggage all around.
