logical set-up.  Base is nice, b/c if you have 4 sleep trackers, you only need to pair the base back to a new router, rather than 4 different devices.  and you can turn down/off the LED glow of this device, which I found not helpful after a couple days.  If I have an air quality issue, send me alerts in the app, or light up visual notification.  I don't need the constant all clear blue glow...unless this is supposed to be a smart LED that is waking me up more naturally when I stir in the AM, but I don't think that's what it is.
