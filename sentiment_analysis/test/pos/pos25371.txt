Whenever I need to "scan" something I usually take a picture with my cell phone. I have a Galaxy S7 Edge so the camera is very good and you can easily take pictures and zoom in and read the words. Where this method falls short is the camera can't do anything with the picture other than show it. With this pen, you can scan the document and it recognizes the text. It's pretty cool because you can then translate the text into many different languages. This is great for travel as you can scan just the text you want and translate it quickly. It paired quickly with my phone and I never experienced any drops. I'm wondering if the Android app is more stable than iOS but I never had issues. The reason it lost one star was that sometimes I needed to rescan an item in order to get it to work. Still very cool and definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a scanner that can "understand" what you scanned and interact with it.
