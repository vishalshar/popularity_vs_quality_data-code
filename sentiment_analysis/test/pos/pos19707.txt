Great product for someone who is often misplacing his keys and not the most 'tech' savvy. The 'App' was easy to install and works seamlessly with the beacon. I really like the range of this product too. Perfect for any sized home. Like the reverse aspect of being able to 'ping'/find my phone if that's misplaced but you have your keys with you. Definitely worth the price.
