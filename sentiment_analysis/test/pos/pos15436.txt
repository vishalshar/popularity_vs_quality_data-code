I use Sugru mostly for repairing charging cables.  I bought some and repaired a few chargers about a year ago and a few of repairs have cracked because the cable hangs down behind my bed and hangs off the edge of my nightstand, the stress on each end of the cable has caused the wire to come apart from the USB, and if not placed in just the right place, my phone won't charge.  I realize that just like the original cable cracked, this stuff will too over time, and I'm okay with it.  It's still better that a cheap replacement charger that rarely works or spending $20-$30 on a new one from the manufacturer.I might try to find a way to reinforce the ends and then cover it all in Sugru!
