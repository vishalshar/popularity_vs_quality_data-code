I'm giving The Number Cube Logic Puzzle a 5 for the great idea. I just ordered one for my grandson. He's into both number series and cube puzzles, so it seems like it will be a great gift for him. Contrary to what another reviewer posted, it is still available and the website is here: http://number-cube.com/. I'll try to remember to write another review after my grandson has tested it out.12/28/15 - Well, I guess I can't write another review, so I will add to this one. My grandson loved the Number Cube Logic Puzzle and solved it within a couple of hours. He also said that it was the easiest to manipulate of any the cube puzzles that he owns. Mr. Puzzlemaker,  would you please make a harder number puzzle?
