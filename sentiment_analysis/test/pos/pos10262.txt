The thync device works very well.I haven't tried all modes yet. The energy vibe is works very well so far. Cant wait to try the calm vibes.I have used thync on my Xperia Z3, which is currently an unsupported device.Before I purchased it, I emailed the company and asked if other android devices would work even though they weren't advertised on their site as supported. In their reply they said amongst other things that "we aren't able to support your device at this time".I believe that when they say a device is unsupported they probably mean it is untested. Obviously Thync can't test every device.Of course if they said it may work on an unsupported device, more people would buy it but most would end up returning it.As the thync device uses bluetooth as long as your device has at least bluetooth 4.0 it should work. I don't know Thync's return policies but If you do decide to do as I did and buy knowing your device is unsupported, you might not get your money back. Also don't blame me or them if it explodes or gives you brain damage. If you do test on an unsupported device you are on your on and don't expect much support.If you wish to use an unsupported android device you will have to install the apk file manually. Search on google "thync apk" then move to your device and locate using a file explorer and click on it to install.Have fun
