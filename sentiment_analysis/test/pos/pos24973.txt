The Nextbit Robin is by far the most performant phone you can get brand new for the price, and the cloud storage for apps is interesting, if gimmicky. This review is for the Midnight model, though my wife owns the Mint one.The Specs: $200 buys you a Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 SoC, 3GB RAM, a 5.2" 1080p LCD covered by Gorilla Glass 4, 13MP/5MP cameras, front facing stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor, and - unusually for unlocked phones in this price range - NFC, for using Android Pay.The Pros:SPECS. The specs above outperform every other phone in this price range, at least thanks to the Snapdragon 808. While most phones in this price range generally use octa-core Cortex-A53 parts - a core designed for efficiency over performance (for example, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 616 found in the Honor 5X or the MediaTek MT6753T found in the Blu Vivo 5R) - the Robin opts for a hexa-core Cortex-A72/A53 part, which uses four efficient A53 cores and two powerful A72 cores. It's a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but the point is that on paper, the Nextbit Robin is a better performer than anything else in its class.REAL-WORLD PERFORMANCE. During day-to-day use, the phone does indeed perform very smoothly and can handle even gaming just fine.FINGERPRINT SENSOR. The fingerprint sensor is a nice thing to have, and since this phone runs Android 6.0 out of the box, it uses the Android fingerprint sensor API to allow simple authentication for apps like Android Pay and LastPass. Being side mounted thanks to doubling as the power button is a nice touch too, since it allows simple access while you're holding the phone without cluttering up the front or back of the phone.CAMERAS. The cameras can both take some decent shots - about what you'd expect from a phone in this price range, though, so temper your expectations.ANDROID SKIN. The skinning of Android is fairly light, opting to change the visual style more than seriously modify anything. This even means you have a Nexus/Pixel style System UI tuner if you hold down the Settings gear above the Quick Settings panel!NEXTBIT CLOUD STORAGE. The cloud storage works as advertised - all of your apps come back from cloud storage as though you never had them uninstalled in the first place.QUICK CHARGE. Quick Charge 2.0 helps alleviate some of the battery life woes (see below).DESIGN. This will be polarizing, but I think the Midnight Robin is gorgeous and the Mint Robin is adorable. The fact that it's flat on all sides seems like it would make it a hard phone to hold, but it's really nice in the hands.The Cons:BATTERY LIFE. This is an "All day only with light use" smartphone. There's really no sugar coating it. Even out of the box, battery life is pretty poor. Screen on time is only about 2 to 3 hours in my experience.FINGERPRINT SENSOR. It's fairly fast, but probably because of its small size, it's really sensitive to how you put your finger on it. If your finger is angled differently than it expects, it has a tendency to reject it.HEAT. The Snapdragon 808 is not a great chip. It gets very hot and has to switch to its more efficient cores fairly often. This means that the Robin can get uncomfortably hot if you're doing anything very taxing on the processor.BUTTONS. The volume buttons on the left side are hard to pick out on the side without a case. While I kind of like it now, the recessed power button/fingerprint sensor on the right side is easily confused with the also recessed SIM tray that sits below the power button.SPEAKERS. While a lot better than they were with the factory software, they still distort badly on high volumes. HTC BoomSound these ain't.CLOUD STORAGE. The Robin provides virtually no control over the cloud storage at all. Your apps get backed up, your photos (but not videos!) get backed up. You can't uninstall backed up apps until they're restored, either.NEXTBIT HOME. Like launchers on most Chinese phones, all apps are dumped onto your home screen. There is an app drawer, but it's fairly unintuitive to use. Better to dump it for something like Nova or Google Now Launcher.NO SD SLOT OR REMOVABLE BATTERY. The expandable storage on the Robin is limited to cloud storage, which is kind of depressing. Applying Nextbit's smart storage features to local storage would be outstanding. Also, carrying around spare batteries would help alleviate the Robin's battery life woes, but this battery is not removable.Overall, the Robin is a competent first attempt from Nextbit Systems. It's a beautifully designed, deceptively simple phone that ticks a lot of good boxes without too many bad. That all said, the cloud storage... is pretty gimmicky, and the mediocre battery life is frustrating. But it provides a nice glimpse into what we can look forward to from Nextbit.
