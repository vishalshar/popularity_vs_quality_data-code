2 MONTH UPDATE: Still "pulling" Free 2 months later - I still wear it every day but rarely use it (feels great to know it is there, however). The Pavlok works, charges, and syncs like it always has. The band has begun to lose some of its shiny top coating but that doesn't really matter to me as it is hidden under my shirt.Suffering with eyebrow trichotillomania for 6 years now. Tried just about everything and the kitchen sink to no avail. Pavlok made me stop the habit within 48 hours and its been an incredible 2 weeks since. With the device on my wrist I feel like the urges, IF they return, will be dealt with swiftly and effectively. Next up: nail biting. I don't use the app much so can't comment but I do notice it is temperamental about connecting. Not a big deal for me, set it once and not too concerned as it isn't needed for daily use. I find the device comfortable and discreet. People think it's a fit bit. I absolutely love and recommend it, even at the exorbitant price. I hope long term quality remains the same. Will update this review if otherwise.
