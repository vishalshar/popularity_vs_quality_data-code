This sleep bag is divine. My three month old daughter was ready to transition to sleeping sans swaddle. We decided to try cold turkey. This bag is so cozy she had zero problem sleeping without a swaddle. Not only is this bag gorgeous and incredibly well made, it is perfect for all weather and sleep environments. I wish they made one for adults! Completely worth the price and for me, I am so happy to support a local Seattle company.
