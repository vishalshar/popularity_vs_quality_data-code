I've been taking this for a week now and so far there's no difference I have not received my period or a positive test the flavor is nonexistent there's no changing the taste of the drinks...it dissolves completely..I put three stars because I feel like the taste is great the packaging is convenient it arrived on time but I don't want to give it five stars until I have taken the full month and see what results I have received if any I will update.Today, I got my period (first time in around 6 years) and that's a miracle in itself lol so I think it's doing something! I've raised the stars to 4...  will update when my supply is empty or if I end up pregnant with hopefully another star or another comment lol so far, I give it 4 stars.UPDATE: Positive pregnancy test on 9/23 I give 5 stars.
