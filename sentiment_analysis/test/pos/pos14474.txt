Best for non-stick frying and baking. I use this mostly on my smooth top electric cooktop. It only took 4 days of use to develop a perfect hard smooth finish. After each use I rubbed a very small amount of Barleen's flax oil over the surface until the desired surface has developed. Last nite I made perfect scallops: slice frozen scallops into 2mm 'chips', allow to thaw, blot with a towel, saut√© in thin coat of avacado oil at 500F. Perfect golden crips scallop chips with no sticking.Also, great in the oven for biskets, cookies, etc.PROSFlat with full contact on smooth top range.Non- stick after proper curing.Drip ring on one side helps keep stove top clean.CONSNone really
