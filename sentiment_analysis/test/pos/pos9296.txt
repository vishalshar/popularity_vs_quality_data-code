The ThinOPTICS are attached to my phone case so I always have them with me since I always have my phone with me. That is very convenient when you don't expect to need glass, or don't want to carry regular glasses with you. I wavered between a 3 and 4 star and would have given it a 3.5 if that was available. The reason is the ease of which the lenses scratch. I take very good care of the glasses, but after only 3 months, of very light usage, they are very scratched up. It seems just taking them in and out of the provided case scratches the lenses. They really need to fix that!
