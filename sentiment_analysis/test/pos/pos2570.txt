After doing some research on different products to remote open, close, and monitor your garage door (other than buying and installing a whole new WiFi enabled unit) I saw this unique approach using the laser.  The main concern with all the other technologies is that users frequently had issues with false notifications of the door status which almost entirely defeats the purpose of installing something like this.  I took a chance on this laser approach and overall it's been pretty good:1.  Installation was very easy and took less than 15 minutes.  Connecting it with the app and opening an account was quick as well.2.  The operation afterwards required a bit more patience and adjustment.  A few days after installation, it began to register as open even though no one touched it.  When I checked, the laser was not pointing to the sticker.  Not sure how this happened as there was no interference from wind, sunlight, earthquakes, or people.  I think perhaps the adhesive on the unit settled and caused the laser to misalign.  I read the blogs and bought some reflective tape to make the area larger but turns out after I repositioned small sticker that came with it, it never moved again.  If it gets windy and that makes the door move too much, I may have to use the reflective tape to account for that.  I did test the tape and it reflects like the sticker that came with it, in fact they look identical.The next issue I had was when the door opened, the laser pointed at the top of the door which was a metal and previously it registered low enough on the sensor threshold that it counted that as opened.  I think after a firmware upgrade, the sensitivity went up and it began to think the door was still closed due to the higher sensor threshold value.  I quickly fixed this with a piece of painters tape over that area and now it shows up as near-zero sensor threshold and correctly shows a status of open.3.  I noticed sometimes the app doesn't show the door opening and goes directly from closed to open but that's very minor and can easily be fixed in software updates.I'm looking for more app improvements and Homekit compatibility.  I would definitely buy another one!
