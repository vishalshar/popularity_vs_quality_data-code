I'm so glad I found these bags! No more storing cheese in parchment paper, saran wrap, or ziploc bags, which is either messy or inefficient. These bags let the cheese breathe while also keeping it fresh.I love that you can reuse the bags. The first one I use tore a little on an edge of Parmesan, but I feel like the more you use it, it gets broken in and becomes more flexible. Even with the tear, the cheese stayed fresh, so I wasn't upset about it.I'll definitely be repurchasing these bags.
