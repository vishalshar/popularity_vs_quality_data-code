Anyone that's ever commuted on public transportation knows the value of any saved extra minutes and the frustration of additional minutes added on. As a commuter, I've always thought about what trade offs are necessary to shorten my commute on public transportation.  A bike was cumbersome and eventually caused my laundry bill to increase.  Skateboarding almost broke my tailbone (I never was good at any sort of "boards"). Enter the URB-E, a spectacle but a very functional spectacle.  I typically don't like being the first adopter to new products as I'm always wary of eventual defects or issues that will eventually pop up.  However, after a friend let me borrow his to try it out, I realized that this machine was well built, easy to ride, and a time saver.  I've used the URB-E to commute aboard public transportation in Los Angeles, to make a trip to the grocery store (no parking required), and to catch Pokemon (kidding, kind of).  There hasn't been a single moment where I've regretted using the URB-E to do these tasks.  I've saved so much time as well.I know the price tag is high and it's often what deters my friends from considering this.  But when you start factoring in the price of gas, insurance, parking, and time spent, the price tag becomes much more reasonable.  Add to the fact that it's assembled in the US (and the manufacturing facility is really cool), I think that it's worth it.And I actually do ride it.  Pictures added to show I do.  There are definitely some reviewers here who clearly haven't ridden it.
