These are GREAT.  I keep a gray set in the little-used back pocket of my purse.  They aren't metal, so it's great when I'm grabbing something to go at the airport.  A lot of the "to go" cutlery is junk and inadequate to the task, this stuff is great.  You don't feel like you're using disposables - because you aren't!  These are substantial, but you'll never know you're carrying them unless you know ;-)  I also keep the UNOs (more than one) in the car for company or in case I don't have my purse with me.  Also - for anyone wondering...  although these don't have a "smooth" feel of a polished stainless steel, it isn't a weird or off-putting feeling... and it's consistent, no rough edges.  If you're looking for such an item, this is a good choice.  (I also got a set of these for my friends who travel by motorcycle and do a lot of camping.  (When they travel, space is a premium, but weight isn't as big a deal as it is for hikers.)  I also love that they store "together" - keeps things tidy!
