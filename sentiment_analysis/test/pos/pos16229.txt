After seeing a post on one of my friends page, I ordered this lunch box for the same reasons the other parents did: have a variety of cold and hot food for lunch. My 5 year old daughter is VERY picky and this helped out get somewhat a nutritious lunch for her (eating vegetables is a challenge!). When the lunch box first came, I thought it was a little heavy for my daughter but watched her reaction when she first started to carry it - no complaints. She loves it! I can fit her boxed drink and spoon in the same area as well as mix and match between hot and cold meals. My daughter also drops her lunch box  numerous times throughout the week and it has uphold. No cracks or leaks. So far so good OmieBox!!!
