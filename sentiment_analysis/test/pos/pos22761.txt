This unit is very nicely packaged.  When it arrived I was surprised by how heavy the package was but when I opened it, the weight came from the base of the unit.  It was very easy to assemble and plug in.  The red light panel lights up well and is square.  Dimensions are a little less than 6" x 6".  The red light panel is connected to the base through a completely flexible but sturdy rod.  It's well designed but I worry that the red light panel won't hold up over time since it is extremely lightweight.  It is definitely one of the better red light therapy units I've seen.  Most are very small.  Not sure it's worth the big price tag though.  Time will tell.  I haven't used it enough to tell if it 'works' but will follow up (that's why only 4 stars).
