Been my dream since I was a kid watching MTV to make music, but never got around to it. Saw this keyboard on Kickstarter last year and decided to buy myself one. Played through some lessons and the bought some beginner versions of the popular songs (not a classical fan, sorry not sorry). It will be a while until I win a Grammy, but this thing is pretty fun and I definitely know how to play a couple Adele songs when my girlfriend asks me to. I like that the software is an app that can be updated - already saw some imporvements in the most recent update so I think this was money well spent.
