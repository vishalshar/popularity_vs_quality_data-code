The roll comes well packaged in a vacuum sealed bag, with desiccant. All of my prints using this Filament turned out great, even while finding its sweet spot. I had the best results printing at the lower end of PLA temp range. No warping at all, very little stringing. Prints have a nice high gloss finish. This is hassle free Filament. Another factor other than Filament quality that I gave a star for is AIO Filament is available in 500g spools, which I think is a great option.
