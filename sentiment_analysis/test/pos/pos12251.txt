Sometimes you just want to watch a show, or you are working, or whatever.  I picked this up for Buddy because if I don't want to play fetch, he just lays on the couch staring at me with a sad face.Day 1:  Took a lot of guidance.  I would have to hold my hand right by the opening and filter the ball in.  He was not scared of it, just couldn't quite figure it out.  Day2:  I would have to prompt him everytime, but he would put the ball in the bowl and get ready for it to come out.  Day 3-4:  He acted like this was a foreign object and pretty much wanted nothing to do with it.  He would fetch the ball if I put it in, but thats about it.  Day 5:  I was just sitting here and he was checking the machine out.  Putting his nose in the bowl without the ball and trippping the trigger.  Looking in the front wondering where the ball was.  Licking the inside of the bowl.  Day 6:  Its like a switch in his little brain flipped and he got.  He brought me the ball, and I threw it in the Ifetch and turned back to my desk to do some thanksgiving day shopping.  Without any prompting he put it in himself.  He did this for 10 minutes without any prompting.  After 10 minutes he brought the ball to me.  So I threw it across the room for him like we normally do.  Did that about 5 times and without any prompting he went back to the Ifetch.  So this will be a nice addition and a time consumer for him.As for the balls.  It comes with 3 balls that are 1.5"  My dog destroys tennis balls and these hold up better than expected.  I had read that the mini kong balls work.  The mini Kong are 1.6".  Just that .1" does make a difference.  The Kong balls do work but, It has gotten stuck a couple of times, they do not fly out as far or fast.  If the Kong's worked 100% of the time versus 95% of the time, I would give this a 5 star rating.  5 pack of replacement ifetch balls are 15.00 (3 bucks a ball) the Kong mini (extra small) are a 3 pack for 2.77, so you can see why I would bring this down 1 star as its 2 bucks a ball difference.Ifetch, if you make your balls less expensive without degrading quality, I will change this to 5 stars.
