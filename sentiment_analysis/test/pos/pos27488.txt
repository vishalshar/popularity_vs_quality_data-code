This is one of the greatest inventions EVER! Because you can change the measuring point from the front (normal) to the back, which includes the width of the tool itself, you can get exact measurements for things like the insides of windows & cabinets, not to mention trim & molding. The manufacturer also stands behind its product; not that you'll likely need it, but I had a problem with one of mine (I now have three of them!) and I emailed the company and received a new unit a day or two later via Fedex.
