My wife requested this drive after a previous iteration was rendered inoperable. The new sliding design makes it keychain friendly. No sharp corners to bother pockets or scratchable surfaces. Several read and writes make it a decent USB drive for every day needs. The self-contained sliding cap is what pushes this from an average three stars to four.
