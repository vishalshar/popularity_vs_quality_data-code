UPDATE 2:  It's now been over a year since my original review.  I am still using this deodorant and will not go back to traditional ones.  This still works amazingly well for me, and I have not had any rashes from it.  I have, since my original review, bought this in other scents from here as well as their website.  I tried out a few samples to see if I preferred other scents.  Jacked up Jasmine is still my favorite.  Orange Creamsicle is what I am using now and definitely my second favorite.UPDATE:  I am now 2 months in using this deodorant and it is only 1/2 gone!!  So my 8 week estimate was way off.  This is going to last me at least 4 months!  I have been using it daily and still no irritation.  I know I already mentioned this above in my review, but I ALWAYS shower at night and wash it off and do not reapply until morning.  This may be the reason I have not had any irritation.  I never sleep in deodorant. It still works just as well as it did when I first started using it.  I used my regular deodorant (Dove) one day when I was going out of town because I didn't want to deal with sweating really bad. Not that it stops me from sweating, but I thought it might not make me sweat as bad.  Um, never again!  I was only a few hours in and already smelled.  I also noticed that washing regular deodorant off is such a task. It leaves a film on my underarms and is sticky.  This Primal Pit Paste washes off like there's nothing there.  I have never been this pleased with a deodorant in all my life.  This is the best thing I have ever tried.  I will be back for more as soon as this one runs out.Original Review:This stuff really does work!  I sweat bad.  I mean really bad.  I certainly don't smell all that nice when I am sweating either.  I have tried all different types of deodorants and antiperspirants.  Nothing works, even the clinical ones.  Regular antiperspirant/deodorant actually makes me smell worse than using nothing at all and doesn't do a thing for sweat.I knew this was just a deodorant so I didn't expect it to stop me from sweating.  I didn't mind since not even an antiperspirant does that for me.  I am more concerned with smelling nice after a long hot day.  I initially received a sample of this to try and had to come straight here and order a full size one after a few days of trying it.I spent the weekend scrubbing and staining my deck in almost 90 degree weather.  I never expected to smell as good as I did after.  I smelled fantastic!  There was not even a hint of odor.  I couldn't believe it.  Nothing has ever worked this well.I don't know if I will experience irritation like others have mentioned.  So far I have not.  I have been using it for a little over a week now.  I shower at night and wash off all of my deodorant and do not reapply until the morning .I don't know if that might help to not get irritation.This is definitely worth every penny.  It is small, but you are only supposed to use a tiny bit each time.  This should last me a few months.  The sample size I have is .25 oz and it has lasted over a week now with still more to go.  So a 2 oz should last at least 8 weeks but I am betting it will last even longer.
