I got these for Christmas.  It was a little temperamental on the best position at the bottom of the phone,but I once I figured out the correct spot the rest went smoothly.  No problem putting them into the smoke detector.  Creating the locations in the application was not difficult.  I down graded to a 4 because of time it took to program each battery by the sound programming
