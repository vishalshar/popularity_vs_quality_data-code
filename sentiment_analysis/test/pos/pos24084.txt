I damaged my misfit Shine and decided to replace it with a Shine 2.  The replacement Shine 2 had a problem, it would occasionally send a text or phone notification even though I had the option turned off.  I contacted support and they immediately emailed me a postage paid return label I also received a new Shine 2 through priority mail.  The new Shine 2 had a new, improved wrist strap. The new strap has a more substantial clip on the back making it much more secure.  The new Shine 2 works perfectly.  I typically do not write reviews, however the  professionalism and courteousness of the person helping me prompted me to write this.  Also I feel the new strap is great, I believe they have remedied the issue of the Shine 2 popping out of the strap.
