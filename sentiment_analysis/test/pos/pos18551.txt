It arrived in the toughest packaging I have ever had to cut through.  I was sure that I was destroying the product.  So why have I given it 5-STARS?It's the reading glasses.  They are so tiny and weigh next to nothing.  They have nothing  to use your ears.  I simply clip it on my nose.  Yes, my nose.  And it stays put as long as I want to wear it.  The magnification is perfect for me.  The lenses filter out some of visible blue.  This gives things a little more sharpness and its easier on the eyes.  (They don't mention this in their ad.)  Lastly, they sit on the bridge of my nose so that  I can easily see over the lenses, and the positioning is also perfect for use with my computers - Desktop and Amazon Kendal Fire 10.
