UPDATE: I received communication from the company about my post. They sent along a free replacement! You can't ask for better customer service. We haven't been able to use the spoons as my son isn't old enough yet. BUT, I will recommend this product to anyone. A company that cares about its customers goes a long, long, long way.We read about this on a parenting blog. I was excited to get it but was disappointed when I opened. Only one spoon arrived. We returned it.
