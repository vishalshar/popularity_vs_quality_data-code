This is such a marvelous invention. Its superbly engineered and designed. Moreover, it does exactly what it is intended to do.I dont have a lot of money to spend on beef, so I buy it the few times I can afford to. I dont want to be disappointed with the way its done. I try hard eyeing it up and testing, but I just cant get it right on my own.With this marvelous thermometer you dont have to poke at a steak (and lose juices) to see if it is ready. You just slip it all the way in from the side in the middle. It will alert you with its LED light when it is cooked to the level you prefer. It comes out PERFECT using the SteakChamp, and I love it!Its great for home use, grilling, or for professional cooks. This is one of the best products I have ever come across. Excellent in every way...SteakChamp - The Ultimate Steak Thermometer was provided free of charge to complete and post a factual review without compensation.
