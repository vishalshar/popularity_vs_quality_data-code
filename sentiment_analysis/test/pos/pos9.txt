I had a brief stumble with a defective pump. PicoBrew immediately sent me a replacement pump, the tools to replace it and a new brew pack to replace the one the got wasted.Customer service is EXCEPTIONAL!  Everyone took immediate steps to answer my questions and help me.As far as the brewing process ... flawless.  There are quite a few steps but the extensive and clearly written manual helped walk through the process ... great for this first-time home-brewer.  My first beer finished the other day - Chin Curtain IPA - can't distinguish it from "professionally" made micro-brews ... and that means it is perfect.If you are a fan of brew and want to try your hand at brewing your own ... I highly recommend PicoBrew!
