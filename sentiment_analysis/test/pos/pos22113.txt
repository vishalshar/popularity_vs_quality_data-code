My cat absolutely loves these.  From a kitten he has had a hard time chewing hard food/treats so I gave these a try.  He eats them like air but still eats his regular cat food.  They do make a mess though with a fine dusting of chicken around the bowl.  I even give him the 'dust' from the bottom.  He licks the bowl clean while the dust blows from his breath as he vigorously attacks the bowl.
