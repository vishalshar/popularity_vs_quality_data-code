This mug works, I was skeptical at first but now I'm a believer in the mighty mug. I put some water in the glass then put the life on and lightly tapped the side of the glass. I couldn't believe what happened it didn't spill, then I went a little harder still no spill, then I smacked the side nothing happened. I was in tears because this will save on cleanups and people being careless or clumsy where ever they are.
