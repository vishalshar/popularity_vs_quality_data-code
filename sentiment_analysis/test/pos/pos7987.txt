They asked twice for a review so here goes...  Build quality is excellent; it will last a long time.  Attachment of strap w/rings to camera requires some dexterity but seems very secure once in place.  I love the strap/camera disconnect feature; you can unhook the main strap for unencumbered use of the camera (only the attachment straps/rings stay with camera but they don't get in the way).  I think I would have preferred lobster-claw releases rather than the trigger snaps (lobsters you have to pull, triggers you push) but that's a personal preference and takes nothing away from the design.Overall length of the fully extended strap when disconnected from camera is approx 50 inches unstretched and 60 inches with bungees fully stretched.  50 inches isn't that long and when carrying with the strap cross-body, things get a little snug; I'm not that big (5'10/200).  Length is good though if the strap is just dropped on one shoulder.  That's where my first complaint comes in:  This strap works best cross-body.  If you do hang the camera off one shoulder, the strap pad is stiff enough so it won't lay flat against your sloped shoulder.  It sits on an angle severe enough so that only the inner edge of the pad touches your shoulder and it tends to slide down pretty easily.  Perhaps if the middle 12" or so of the strap was separated into two sections, the section that rides nearest your neck could be a little looser than the section further down your shoulder.  Second complaint is that the pad cannot be secured to the strap.  As you bring the camera up to your eye, the strap slides within the pad--which is okay--but when you drop it back down, the pad generally doesn't move with the strap--after just a couple of up/down actions the strap pad is in the middle of your back (or front).  Perhaps if there were some Velcro strips between the strap and pad, one could adjust the pad location to their liking and it would then stay in place (yes, the pad would rotate around with strap when coming up for a shot but at that stage you're not supporting the camera so it doesn't matter.)Overall this is a very nice, sturdy, versatile strap (I forgot to mention you can attach both ends of the strap to one ring or to a tripod mount adapter for various carrying options).  I recommend this strap if one isn't too large a person.P.S.  The Velcro modification I plan to do myself and I'm hoping that with use the shoulder angle problem will take care of itself.  Four stars rather than five only because the strap may be too short for some.
