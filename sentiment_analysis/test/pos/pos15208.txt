It's been three months and couldn't be happier with the Kuna light. The unit has been 100% reliable and any issues have been operator error. I plan on buying another Kuna for my front porch along with a matching companion light. I read some other reviews that were less than glowing. Kuna is very upfront on the technical specifications, and related fees for service,  so I'm surprised to read reviews complaining about either. I did a lot of research before purchasing and while not the least expensive option, the Kuna is well made, easy to use, reliable and easy to install.The attached photo was taken today of my back deck. Very good quality and I can adjust the camera as needed. I'm using the Apple App to control the camera. The 2-way communication feature is great. I was able to talk to my dog sitter last month while on a cruise in the Mediterranean. There was a 2-second or so delay, understandable considering I was 5,000 miles away using a WiFi connection. There is no IR feature for night viewing. However, I found by installing a lower wattage bulb the glare is reduced to the point the video is crystal clear even on a very dark night.
