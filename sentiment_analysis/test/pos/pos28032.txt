So far, so good. Easy to install and configure. I think I will still have to do a little fine tuning, but so far I have been very impressed. I do wonder if the gallons it says I am using is accurate (200 gallons in less than 40 minutes seems high). Very slick interface. I also like how it lets me know when my rain sensor is activated & deactivated.
