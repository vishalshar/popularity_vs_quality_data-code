Easy setup and it works very well with my Almond router. I assume it'd work just as well with any other hubs.This feels well built and will only use the top outlet in your wall outlet pair. There's a button to toggle the power without using your smart-home.It's pricy but it's the same price as similar cheaply made devices. I got one for free with my router and had to buy more - it's so nice."Alexa, turn the fan on" and them I'm back to bed :)
