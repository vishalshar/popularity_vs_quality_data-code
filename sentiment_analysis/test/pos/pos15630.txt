I recently started drinking the regular Soylent, so I thought I would give this a try as well. I have to say that I really like Soylent and the idea of having a meal ready to go at any time. IT has come in handy when I work at home and don't want to waste time cooking a full lunch or breakfast, I can just grab a Soylent and be back to work.I just finished my first case of Coffiest, and over all I like it. The flavor is better than regular Soylent, but still nothing special. I do like the chocolate flavor profile, but the coffee is just odd. As some other reviewers have said, it tastes more like a burnt espresso than anything. You first taste the chocolate and then the after taste is pretty much burnt coffee. You get coffee breath without the joy of drinking good coffee. It's not terrible, just feels like something that needs to be improved.I have to say though, I don't get jittery from this the eay I would drinking a cup of coffee very fast. Whatever they have done to it seems to work and I just get a little more energy and don't really feel a crash after words. I was using 5 hour energy before I started drinking Coffiest and I feel like the Coffiest gives a more uniform energy for the day instead of a quick rush of caffine powered jolt. That's just my experience, your milage may vary.I would recommend Coffiest. I think it can be improved, but I think it's a very promising first try for a breakfast focused Soylent drink.
