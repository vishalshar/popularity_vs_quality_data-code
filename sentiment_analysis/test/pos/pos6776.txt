I have three dogs, two big ones (that we purchased the SD system for) and a recently added 5 pound toy mix.  This collar works well for the small dog and keeps her within the yard when I occasionally put the collar on her for peace of mind.  She is an indoor dog, but she likes to play with her big dog brothers outside occasionally.  I do need to go ahead and order some replacement batteries just to be on the safe side, but so far so good.
