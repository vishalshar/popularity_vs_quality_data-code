I don't write many reviews but Nucleus is exactly what we've been looking for since we've moved into our house last year. Our kids room and their play area is isolated (noise-wise) from the common areas of the house. We've used a combination of baby monitors and IP cameras to keep a connection with them but the Nucleus intercom with its wide angle camera is working great. Since it communicates both ways and has a simple interface, our 4 year old now calls us if she needs anything and was able to do that with no tutorial.We have an Amazon echo, so we're already Alexa users but now we have two more Alexa devices with Nucleus. This has given us more coverage in the house to tell Alexa to shut off the lights,  start a timer or answer some random question.The other big consideration for this product was our grandparent situation. We have grandparents from both sides in MN while we're in CA. We want the kids to have as much contact with them as possible but getting our parents to figure out FaceTime or remember passwords for Skype, etc has not worked well. Since this is a gen 1 product, I wanted to try it out at home first and if all went well, we'd consider remote units for the grandparents. After a few days, we've already ordered one for my dad. The connections between units have been instantaneous and supposedly the remote connections only take milliseconds. Looking forward to trying that out.Now for the shortcomings...There are issues but it appears most can be solved by software updates. I've been part of startups so I get how initial software releases are with deadlines and that probably makes me more lenient. Though I'd prefer a bigger screen, their hardware feels solid and has a ton of potential. The sound quality is fine for voice but could be better. The software is currently displaying at SD resolution but in speaking with the Nucleus folks, I was told HD and many other features (including a baby monitor mode) are coming soon. The image doesn't seem to handle low light situations well but we're hoping it's more about the lack of HD. I'll update on this after HD is added.The IOS app (haven't tried Android) is closer to a proof of concept than a polished app but it launches with a big message explaining they plan to add a lot of updates. This will hopefully result in seamless interoperability with mobile devices. I also would like to see integration with IOT systems. It's definitely not there yet but the Alexa feature is huge in that way and then some. My primary use case was for a basic intercom system, so l can be patient with the other features.Overall we're happy with Nucleus and it's potential. I'll try to update this review as the product itself updates.
