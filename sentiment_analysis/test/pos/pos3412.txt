I've only used the growler twice, but I'm very happy with this product as of now.  My main concern is keeping the beer fresh for long periods of time, since that is my frustration with glass growlers. I filled the growler on a Tuesday and then drank a pint a day until it was empty on Sunday. The beer stayed fresh throughout. I filled it again on that Sunday and I'm going to wait a few days more before I start drinking it. This time I plan to do a pint every other day to see how that goes. So far so good.
