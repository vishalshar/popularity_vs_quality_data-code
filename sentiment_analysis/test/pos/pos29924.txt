We bought this for our 7 year old who loves to draw and doodle. I was a little nervous of the learning curve other's mention. But it's a short learning curve! My 7 year old picked it up quickly!! She still has some to learn - she moves the pen faster than the filament comes out. But she'll get more patience in time ;)  Within 2 hours out of the box, she'd already made glasses! (photo attached)This came with a full charge (I was pleasantly surprised!) and an idea book that has templates in it, on thick excellent quality paper. It's a great way to start!! And there's a bunch of silicone molds she has fun with, too! The idea book tells you how many filament strips each design takes - we found that's not accurate. The glasses should have taken 4 strands and really took her 7. It may be just because she's still learning.It is not hot to the touch at all. Which is great, because it's harder to "cut" a line of plastic when you're done. Pushing it off the end with your finger works best (so far). And there's zero fear of burning yourself!My only wish is that I would love it to have a speed setting. The plastic comes out very slowly. Which is good for little kids as they trace a template. But when you're just filling in the lines to make the design thicker or connecting two pieces together, it would be nice to double the speed and go faster. All said though, it's a great toy that our 7 year old will love for weeks, months, and probably years to come!The charging cord is the same style as the kindle fire - which is great. The fewer cords we need at our ever growing family charging station, the better ;)
