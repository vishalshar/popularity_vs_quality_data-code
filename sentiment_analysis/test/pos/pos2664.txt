This is the perfect pencil to carry with you at all times.  It extends to a perfect length.  The  eraser is great and the pencil is very sturdy.  It looks so good when you pull it out to write a note.  I work a lot with athletics and this would be a perfect pencil for volleyball refs to use when tracking the game.  I purchased extra pencils and erasers through the "add-on" program so you might think about that when buying the pencil.  I plan to get another one for a friend that I know will have many uses for it.  I really enjoy practical and unique writing pens/pencils and this is just wonderful!
