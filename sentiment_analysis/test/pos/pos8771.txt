I have to be gluten free, and I LOVED this product: I can cook my favorite pasta recipes again! Banza Pasta is rich with proteins and fibers, and low on carbs. When pasta is ready, its consistence is slightly different from the regular wheat pasta, but the taste is good, and I don't feel guilty for eating pasta any more. Thank you!
