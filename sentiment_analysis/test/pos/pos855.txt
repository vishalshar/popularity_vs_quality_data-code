I was nervous from so many negative reviews it almost made me not purchase this product. I'm very happy I did. Cleaned it and poured beer in it from a growler I had that was a couple days old and flat. Beer flowed out of the tap like it was a fresh. Gave it a great head. I highly recommend this for all beer lovers. Especially if you have micro brewery's close to you that don't bottle or can products.
