Esthetically pleasant and so discreet! I wish I had known about Elvie years ago. This takes the mystery out of pelvic floor exercising.  I love being able to see when I gain strength and also being able to see when I completely relax. My only caveat is be sure not to activate other muscles in an effort to reach the goal.
