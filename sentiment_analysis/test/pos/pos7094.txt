I don't have much to add than what other reviews have mentioned here, but I am disappointed with the mounting boards. If you have not played with these things yet, each module can be connected together magnetically, but can easily pulled apart if not mounted one of the provided boards.The boards are a great idea but they just don't work! When you place a module into the board (which has a hole) the modules just pop right out of the holes. We have to use the shoes to keep the modules together - but would really like to use the boards.Otherwise we have had lots of fun with inventing stuff...
