I've been battling poor sleep for some time now for whatever reason whether it be stress, my brain not shutting down, or whatever. However, I discovered this product at a supermarket and did my internet homework and found it to be all natural and non habit forming. Within 20 minutes of drinking a bottle, I am out like a light. Snoozeberry is my favorite and tastes very good. I've also tried the tea one and it has a pleasing citrus-like taste. If you have trouble sleeping, I can't recommend Dream Water high enough. You can avoid prescription drugs like Ambien and get a good nights' sleep on an all natural product. It works 100% of the time for me and I have not build up any tolerance to it.
