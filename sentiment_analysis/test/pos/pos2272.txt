I love Four Sigma Foods products and recommend them. I am usually leery of tonic herb products simply based on sourcing and processing. However, after trying Four Sigma Foods and drilling them on their products via email, I am so pleased and happy that I have found a great source. If I were to make my own, I would do what they're doing because they've thought of everything.Although I've purchased easily from Amazon, you should know that their website offers wholesale / bulk buying options to save money. Also, their website has a lot of good information on the products and which are good for what. Lion's Mane is particular for brain power and mental enhancing.The little packets are useful and keep the product extra fresh.
