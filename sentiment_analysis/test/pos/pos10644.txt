I waited to post my opinion. I really like this product. The tint is just enough that it darkens my lashes with a natural look. The conditioners have helped my sparse eyelashes grow also!  Lashes become a rich dark brown. Very different than mascara so it did take a bit of getting used to. I love my natural look!
