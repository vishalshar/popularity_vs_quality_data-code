Cute design. Ap is user friendly --able to figure out the technology without having to refer to the manual.  Lots of nice features, like a wake up alarm, sleep monitor, and activity tracker.  You are also able to add activities manually like swimming that you are not able to wear the tracker during. The only issue I have had so far is the loop that the strap fits through is too loose so the end dangles.  It is probably just a flaw in my particular bracelet and I have not yet tried to contact the manufacturer to see if they can resolve. Over all happy with my purchase.
