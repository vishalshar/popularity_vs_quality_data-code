So far I'm very happy with this product.I've used it on all my Apple devises and use it with my MacBook Pro when mobile - that was the big selling point, along with the length of time before recharging the unit is needed.Previously I'd used a Halo brand and with a year it had stopped charging. I'm, fingers crossed, hoping this does not happen with the ChargeTech.
