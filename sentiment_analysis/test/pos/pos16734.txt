I bought this one so I can carry it on me and also my portable charger instead of carrying a long cord. I also like that it is secure when on my keychain. Its a bit of a pain when it resists the way you are trying to bend it but I have found ways around all that. I usually charge mine sideways now while connected to my laptop and it is sturdy enough that it holds my phone up and I can watch videos comfortably.
