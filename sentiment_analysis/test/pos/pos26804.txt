I really like my device and feel that it was certainly worth money I paid. Also I love attention Upright team pays to me. They time by time send me friendly reminders to train and give some useful advices.I use the device on upper and lower back. At the beginning I used it only on my lower back but now I use it 30/70 as my main problem is my shoulders. Best thing is that now I more often feel when my back goes "in hook" and remember to keep it straighter myself - without device.To be honest it took some training sessions for me to get used to connecting device with my phone. I am not modern and was unsure if everything will be OK. Once I even wrote to Upright team an angry letter and got fast and excellent service&attitude. Problem was more in me not in device :). Now I've used and it seems funny that connecting made problems for me at the beginning.Vibrating is without noise but is still heard - exactly as phone when put on vibrating mode. As I use the device in my working place, I would like it to be a bit more silent. Maybe I can regulate it?I have teenager daughter and sometimes I give my device to her. For her connection with phone is main benefit, as she, like many other youngsters, are too found of phone.
