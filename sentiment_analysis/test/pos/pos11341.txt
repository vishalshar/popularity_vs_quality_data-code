So far I really love this watch; it is beautiful on the wrist, it is extremely comfortable, and I like that I always have a watch face to view with the e-paper display.  I agree with other users that I love it for it's simplicity and the easy accesibility of the most-used features/apps.  I get the notifications I need, I have a few apps that I use frequently (timer, weather, fitness), and frankly I can easily do without the rest of the (cumbersome) bells and whistles of some of the other smartwatches - nor would I want to try and navigate/use them on a device with a watch-size display.  The battery life (2+ days for me) and the super-fast charging make it very convenient, and I also find the phone conduit app very user-friendly.  If I had one criticism of the display, it would be on the readability in low light, especially with the analog faces; changing watch faces (light background/dark background/digital readout) can help with this, but my eyes would love a little more contrast for the analog faces.
