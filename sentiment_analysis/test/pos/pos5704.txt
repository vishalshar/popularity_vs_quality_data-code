This is absolutely the best product on the market.  I can't recommend it enough.  Try it - you won't be sorry.  The tip for ordering a shade darker than you think you need is right on.  I did the medium brown which was close to my hair color, but ended up buying the dark brown which is PERFECT for me.  Can't wait to try this new pump thing as shaking it on can get messy both on your person and on your vanity (a small price to pay for the effect this product provides!).  Be sure to try not to breathe too much while the fibers are floating in the air if you are shaking it on.  I think this new pump might be just the thing.  If you are on the fence about trying this, just DO it.  You won't be sorry.Update:  8/21/2015:  I tried the pump and was unimpressed.  I think if you only had a spot of two it would work ok.  Either that or my pump doesn't work right.  So I will spend my money on PRODUCT not on the pump.  I don't recommend it.  If someone else tries it and has a different experience, please post.  Any tips for it actually spraying the fibers in more than a tiny area, rather than a thin little puff would be helpful.  Maybe the manufacturer will see this and offer some tips.
