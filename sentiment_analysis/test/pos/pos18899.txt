Our 7 month old LOVES eating, but literally refuses to eat off any spoon but these. I don't know what kind of voodoo these guys used to engineer the World's Best Baby Spoon, but he's a believer.(only downside: the baby food that inevitably gets all over the handle can make it a little slippery - wish it had some silicone on the handle)
