Works reasonably well. I didn't read the requirements and had to jump through some hoops to find a device with the right Android version. Hard to tell what you're looking at due to zoom factor. Took photos around the house to look for heat leaks; seems to work well, though most of the pics were missing the high/low temperature marks like I requested.
