I ordered this 11/7/13.  Read instructions and set it aside and forgot about it.  I picked the box up in 1/5/14 and I couldn't believe it. The mushrooms had broken thru the top of the sealed package in several places and were growing!  I never did anything, not even open the package!  I'm going to see how much and how big the mushrooms will grow and leave another review.
