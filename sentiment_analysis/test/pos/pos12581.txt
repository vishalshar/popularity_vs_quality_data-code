This is an awesome speaker. I like the sound more than the Bose SoundTouch speaker. The Bass and treble were just right and I didnt need to touch my EQ settings.Easy to use touch interface, Bluetooth 4.1 and Wifi pairing capability. I paired the speaker to my phone via Bluetooth and Wifi through my home network with the Libratone App from the Google Play store.  I use my Zipp Mini as a speaker phone and main speaker. The five radio station pre-sets are very useful, I use Spotify via Wifi and, Google Music and Amazon Prime music via Bluetooth.I was able to play internet radio by pressing the Heart icon on the speakers touch interface without my phone after programming them using the Libratone app. The Libratone app gives you a lot of radio stations to choose from for free.I would recommend this speaker to anyone looking for great sound.
