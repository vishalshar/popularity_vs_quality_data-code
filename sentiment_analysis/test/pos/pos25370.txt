This is a unique smart device.  I really like it.  It is a device that can help with many everyday needs depending on your personal and professional life.  I do not have a scanner in my house or at work that is friendly to use.  This device has made it very easy to scan a document onto my smartphone and then quickly and easily move the document into a PDF.  From the PDF, I can easily email it or share it however I need. On the app, once you have scanned the document you can have the app read you the document, not that I can't read, but it can read the document to me while I am working on something else.  This is a cool function as I need help with saving time in any way in my busy life.Some of you might say why can't I just take a picture of the document and send it that way?  Well, I was thinking the same thing, but this is a much clearer and accurate way of sending a document to someone.  I wish I would have had this when I needed to send a picture of my photo ID and other documents when I was applying to grad school. If you have any questions on the device feel free to ask me.Lastly,  the only reason why I scored it 4 out of 5 is because the activation process and the set up wasn't laid out perfectly clear.  I would still highly recommend this product even with that minor set back.
