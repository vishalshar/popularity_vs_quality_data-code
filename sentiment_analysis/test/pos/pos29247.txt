Folks,If you're using user ratings to judge which mouse to buy, for god's sake pay attention to which model is actually being rated.  I can't fathom why Amazon would combine reviews for the 3200, 8200, and 7000.  It simply isn't fair to the product, as there are things wrong with the older products that have been fixed in the 7000.  The 7000 is being hurt because the avg review score is being dragged down by the older models' flaws.Positive points for all three models:*The (identical) shape of all three models is absolutely amazing/wonderful.  It feels molded to my hand.*Clicking on all three is solid and satisfying, neither too sensitive nor too difficult.*Excellent quasi-rubberized surface that strikes the perfect balance between grippy-ness and smoothness.Regarding the sensors in the 3200 & 8200:*Poor.  Prone to random acceleration / pixel-skipping, making for imprecise pointing.*My 8200 also tended to just wig out and go crazy every once in awhile, with the DPI dipping down to almost nothing for no apparent reason.Regarding the sensor in the 7000:*AWESOME.  No pixel-skipping EVER (okay, well, maybe if you go up into the REALLY high DPI ranges like 5000, but I know no one who actually uses those settings).  You're getting totally raw responsiveness.  What your hand does is exactly what the pointer is going to do.More great stuff about the 7000 specifically:*Adjustable lift-off distance.*Adjustable angle-snapping.The only negative thing about the 7000 that I can think of:*They removed the DPI indicator lights they had on the 8200.  These are the only lights I used on the 8200, and I miss them a little, but not a big loss at all.Overall: get the 7000.  It's basically the perfect mouse in my book.  The sensor is so much better than the 3200/5000/8200, it's just not a contest at all.  Stay away from those, get the 7000.
