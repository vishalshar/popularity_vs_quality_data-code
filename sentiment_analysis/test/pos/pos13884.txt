I will preface my review by saying that this company has excellent tech support. If you email them with a suggestion or concern, they will respond within a day or so and they care about your opinion and want you to love their product. I give it 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it will, and because of the service.Now for the downside, to me anyway, and the reason I contacted service.Each notification you receive for any of the alerts you choose with occur exactly once. You will get your chosen vibration pattern one time per text, per call, per alarm, per timer, etc. I don't know about you, but there is no way I am waking up from a deep sleep when my wrist vibrates 4 or 5 times then stops. I contacted the company about the possibility of getting repeating notifications and was told they were looking at adding in the future.If you want to know if you are getting a call or text while you are out and about and your phone is in your pocket or purse, this works great, but if you are doing anything that would cause you to miss the initial vibration, you won't get it again. I use it every day and it works well for what it is designed to do, but I need repeating notifications for this to be perfect for me
