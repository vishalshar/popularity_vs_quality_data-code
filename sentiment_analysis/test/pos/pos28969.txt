I've used a lot of different brands of activated charcoal soap to help heal my adult acne in the last six months, I even made my own to save a few bucks (it was a disaster). So how did SAPO Bamboo Charcoal Soap measure up? Well, I'm not going to buy another brand ever again.....or make my own. Their soap wins, by far.SAPO Bamboo Charcoal strikes the perfect balance between gentleness and effectiveness. It will leave your skin squeaky clean without over drying- they do suggest using a moisturizer afterwards as soap is not intended to add moisture but to really clean your skin. I've been using Pacifica's dreamy youth day/night cream afterwards and so far, just a couple weeks later, I've yet to have a single breakout which is really rare for me. My skin tone is more even. My face has never felt more smooth (all those little bumps are starting to disappear). And my face just generally feels really clean.....something I had been missing. I also like the scent which is super mild.One of my favorite perks of this soap is that I don't need a make-up remover. I use this soap once to remove my makeup (even stubborn mascara and eyeliner melts off without much effort) and then I wash my face again immediately afterwards to really clean my skin. And that's it. Super quick, super effective. I tossed out my oil make up removers (even my beloved coconut oil which I swore by). This soap is truly a winner and keeper.Their customer service is outstanding too. They provide great tips for using their soap and making it last longer.I'd recommend this to everyone- especially those like me with oily-combo skin who is prone to a lot of breakouts.
