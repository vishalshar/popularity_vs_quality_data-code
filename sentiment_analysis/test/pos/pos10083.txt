This inexpensive item is probably the best product I've bought all year.  As a busy family with 2 dogs, someone is always coming and going and if everyone is home, yelling out, "Did anyone feed the dogs?" is great.  But nowadays, it's rare that we're all home at the same time.  One of our dogs is getting a bit chunky because the dogs have been getting double meals and she eats whatever is put in front of her.  This little plaque is now permanently adhered to the fridge, lol.  And it's exactly what we've needed to make sure the dogs get fed enough, but not too much.
