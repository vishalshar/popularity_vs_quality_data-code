I got the Vololights and installed it on my 2009 BMW R1200RT. I got the power from the license plate circuit as per the instructions but the unit was malfunctioning. I emailed the company explaining what I've done and the type of bike I was installing the lights on. They promptly emailed back letting me know I needed to power the Vololights from a 12v power source since the license plate circuit on my BMW was only a 3 volt source. Once I rerouted the wiring to the correct power source, it worked without any problems. For troubleshooting purposes, when the lights were connected to the 3 volt source, only the upper light would light and the bottom light was barely lit. I could not get it calibrated or otherwise adjust the light sequence.Aside from the voltage issue, I think the Vololights work great. They alert drivers behind you when you  let off the throttle and you are slowing without braking and of course when you are actively braking. I actually took me about 20 minutes to install them if you take away the troubleshooting of the  lights.
