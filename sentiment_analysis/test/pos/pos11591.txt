I've been THAT guy....the oblivious guy standing in a doorway, impeding traffic.  And I've been that guy "slow-walking" down the center of the sidewalk, eyes glued to his phone.  This bell was designed to reform people like me.  A cheery little chime to alert me to my bad behavior; that's all it takes to alert me to the error of my ways.
