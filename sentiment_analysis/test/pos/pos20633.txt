Overall great device. I like to preload my workouts and most of my exercises are available. However, my reps are usually spot on but sometimes I will have to adjust them a bit up or down. The interface on the app to create new workouts can be a bit time consuming but works well after all the data is in. There is a bug when you want to use kilograms so I have to use a workaround to get it to read properly. It really doesn't get in the way of any of my exercises and the interface is simple enough to save my information in between sets. One caveat be careful what charger you plug inot because my unit overheated, melted and stopped working. However, I got in contact with customer support and I have a new unit on the way. I would recommend just charging off a computer usb port. I'm only withholding the last star because I feel the app can be improved. Little things like being a able to edit workouts and the addition of some more exercises. I'm sure it will be 5 stars very soon.
