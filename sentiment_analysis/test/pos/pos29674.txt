Thank you for inventing this great product!  I use " flush puppies" bags to pick up my dog's waste because I prefer to flush his waste down my toilet.  Before the Wise Walker, I had to bring the bag of poop inside, keep track of it so it didn't touch anything while I removed my dog's harness and then carry it into my bathroom to flush it.  This was a stinky and unsightly process.  And so much worse in the winter months with boots and a heavy coat to deal with as well.  Now I just place the bag of poop into my Wise Walker and when I go back inside my house, I take the whole thing to my bathroom, remove the bag of poop, and flush away.  If I need to I can set the Wise Walker down without worrying about having the bag of waste touching anything.
