This one has been a big surprise. It is still an unknown brand but it has good sound and after 2 months is still working,  which is way better that the last 3 CD players we bought on Amazon (Always buy the $5 warranty!!!)It looks great. My son loves it. It should not be the centerpiece of any audiophiles home theater but for a kid's room it is 100% perfect.
