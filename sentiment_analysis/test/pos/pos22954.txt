Works great and is as good as the reviews claim... only bug is the charger cable/USB and wall plug transformer... USB wants to unplug easily...oh and the led light blinking when charging...never goes solid (full charge). Blinks and blinks.... I just keep up on changing it...idk 4-5 months old and hasn't let me down
