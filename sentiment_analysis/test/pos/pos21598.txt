Works so well. My cat normally peeks in the box and avoids until he absolutely cannot wait any longer if he sees anything but normal litter. I've tried the small clear pellets but when he finally uses the box, I find the pellets tracked all over the house. Got him once with the plastic hair beads but only once. Last time used two Kit4Kat hoping the added depth would help. This time used just one and again...SUCCESS! Worth every penny.
