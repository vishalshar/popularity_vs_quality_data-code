Absolutely love my leaf. I was really nervous with the low reviews but none of those issues have come up with me. I get a lot of compliments on it and it's actually easy and fun to use. Its dead on with my sleeping habits (which is one of the main reasons I wanted it) and even reminds me if I have been still too long. I also love that I don't have to have my phone on me for the activity to be recorded. I know a lot of people have concerns about its size but I haven't had an issue with that either, especially at night. I hook it onto my sports bra to sleep and it lies flat against my skin. I honestly don't even remember I have it on. The app is really easy to use and I love how it always has encouraging words for me when I check in. Overall, I find it to be extremely gorgeous and functions just the way as described. I am recommending it to all of my friends and family who want are looking for a tracker. My leaf makes me smile and my steps a little bouncier.
