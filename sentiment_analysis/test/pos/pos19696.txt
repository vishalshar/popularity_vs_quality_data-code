From the standpoint of protection...I would give it a 5 stars...I have dropped my phone onpavement a few times and am VERY glad I had the case on.  The looks, especially the  large UAG emblem is annoying...but I knew that when I bought it since this is my second UAG case...the first one is what hooked me on the case/brand...the case quite simply does the job.
