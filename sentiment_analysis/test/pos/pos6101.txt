This is now our ONLY kitty treat. Even our pickiest "I don't like treats" cat loves 'em. With chicken as the only ingredient, no issues with allergies, sensitivities or concerns over safety of minor ingredients. Soft so cats w/dental issues can easily eat, but with enough crunch to satisfy hunter instincts. Using this as a reward for pill-taking has simplified our lives tremendously: no more wrestling matches at pill-time! Expensive, but SO worth it.
