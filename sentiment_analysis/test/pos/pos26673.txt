Needed some new lights for the kitchen and decided to try these out.  My wife loves them!  Pretty easy to set-up and can be controlled with a phone app. However, we don't touch them most of time and let them turn on and off and change colors automatically.  The changing hue in the evenings is pretty neat and what we like best.
