The ongoing challenge of "staying charged" while traveling has been solved!  I travel about 3/4 of the year either in airports and planes, so the chance of running low on power is high. Sure a quick USB charge is fairly easy to find but what about for your laptop..oh yeah, its in my backpack. With the ChargeTech portable AC no matter where I go I never worry about power, with plenty of juice to charge my Surface Pro 4 and phone and Ipad, I'm good all day whether at a trade show, flying or in my car.Yes it may be a little heavy but it is compact enough to carry in my day bag and easily in my backpack. There hasn't been a problem with heat as of yet, although I like to take it out of its bag when I charge it.  Road warriors carry cords, mini rechargers and who knows what else to stay connected.  My compact charging cords and ChargeTec are all I need now.  You won't be disappointed
