I initially ordered the wrong version, I wanted the type that goes completely under the mattress so there is no chance that the sheet can be moved or pulled off.  The manufacturer was wonderful and worked with me to get the right product.  The sheets are an excellent solution for my disabled adult. I would constantly find her sleeping on a bare mattress because the sheets had come off and she didn't notice. Now I know that the mattress is protected and she isn't sleeping on a non-washable surface. Wish I had these when my kids were young, sheets have always been a challenge, especially when we had an elevated bed with a desk underneath. We couldn't get up there and my daughter couldn't get the corners securely under the mattress.  Always coming off.
