I admittedly picked up a Robin as an intermediate device while I decided on the next phone I was going to get. Now that I've spent a couple weeks using the Robin, I think it's an impressive device that I can stick with for a couple years. If you have used other Android phones before, you might not be too impressed with the level of customization from the stock rom. With that being said, you can definitely flash something else on here if you wanted (I'm not exactly sure how a custom rom would handle the cloud storage features).I've noticed significantly faster charge times via USB C. I assume the charge times will vary if you aren't getting the right voltage. I'm not too knowledgeable about this subject.The Robin takes nano sims. I didn't realize this when I purchased it. I just ended up cutting my micro sim down to fit and everything worked fine.I'm a big fan of the industrial design of the Robin. The design of most smartphones have seemed to converge to one look these days. The Robin definitely stands out next to the other phones on the market.
