The Brush Guard came in an envelope, which really was an appropriate packaging size given the size of the products, but I initially thought that the "card" inside the envelope was a promotional "booklet" for the Brush Guard so I tossed the envelope into the trash. A day later, I thought it was strange that my product hadn't been delivered when the tracking information was listed as "delivered"--I thought maybe my package had gotten mixed up in the mail, until I had an epiphany that the envelope I had thrown away might have been my product! Good thing I only had papers in my trash because I was able to immediately retrieve it. When I fully emptied the contents of the envelope, the actual brush guards came out of the little "card". (You'd think that I would realize that this product would come lying flat...).So, note to future customers, just in case you have 'human' moments like me sometimes, THE ENVELOPE CONTAINS THE PRODUCT ITSELF DO NOT THROW OUT!Other than the packaging itself, the product is pretty standard--nothing totally innovative, but it's definitely useful. It reminds me of the Chinese finger trap toy.
