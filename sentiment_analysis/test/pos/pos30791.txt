ShowerPills are amazing! I used them during Ragnar Relay Race, and I'm now sold. I just bought another box so that I can have a ShowerPill on hand at all times, for after sweaty workouts, running races, biking, and playing sports. They smell great. They are individually wrapped, so you can throw one of two in your bag. Super light weight, yet they get the job done.
