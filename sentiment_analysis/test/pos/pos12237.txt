I was first informed about this product from the Jackson Galaxy web site.  I order almost exclusively all products through Amazon whenever I can.  Not that other sites aren't as good I just like working with one vendor.My cat loves this turkey and so do I because it is pure turkey!  Nothing else.  I place a few pieces in warm water when I want to serve it as a meal, it softens quite quickly.  I would recommend this to anyone for both dogs and cats.  I brought some to friends who have dogs and the dogs went crazy for it!Give it a try!
