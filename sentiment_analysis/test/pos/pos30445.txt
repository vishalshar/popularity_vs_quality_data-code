I purchased this, from Amazon, as a Christmas gift for my parents.  I was a little worried, because there are several reports of these breaking down, or not working. The reviews all state, however, that the Petzi customer service people are great.  I went ahead and purchased this, assuming my parents would be taken care of, if they received a bad unit.Well, that's exactly what happened.  They received a bad unit.  First, it wouldn't connect (my father was told that the Petzi update server was overloaded, due to the huge number of Christmas sales).  Then, the light went out on the unit -- totally dead.  The good news is that Petzi sent him a brand new one via Fedex immediately, along with a pre-paid shipping label to send the non-working unit back.  The second unit arrived after a few days and a weekend.  My father tried to run the required firmware update... same problem.  A call to customer service confirmed that their server was overloaded, and they told him to keep trying several times.  Eventually, it got through, and updated.  All is working fine with the second unit.As per the product and how it works -- their cat has already learned to come when it hears the little bell-like call.  It knows, "TREATS ON THE WAY!" and comes running.  My parents are having fun with it.  It does shoot too many treats for a cat.  My mom told dad to put fewer treats in (they're never away from the house for too long, anyway), but dad says it doesn't work as well with just a few treats.  I'm not sure I understand why this is -- I didn't ask. But it does work.If I were to turn around and buy one for myself, I would probably wait for Gen2.  Our experience with Petzi has been positive enough that I'd consider them a worthy company to purchase from again.So, I'm giving an honest 4-star review of this product.  If customer service had not been excellent, I would have dropped another star or two.  But rest assured, if you have problems, the company offers exemplary customer service.Please note that I am an Amazon Verified Purchase, and I believe in HONEST reviews of a product.  With all of the fake reviews on products these days (not saying this about Petzi, mind you), you can rest assured that I am being honest.  This has become more difficult over time, with other products I've purchased, because some sellers take great offense to truthful reports, and I have actually been told, "I'm not going to help you anymore" for posting my true experiences.  So far, the Petzi people, however, have offered EXCELLENT customer service.
