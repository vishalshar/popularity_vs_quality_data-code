I accidentally slammed my keys in the door a couple months back and have been walking around with the broken car key FOB in my pocket ever since. Sugru was the answer to reattaching it back to my key chain! With Sugru, I was able to build a whole new attachment. There was a short youtube tutorial which gave some tips on creating texture. Using the stippling technique, I was able to add a more custom finish that also functionally gave it some anti-slippage benefits. Overall, the FOB is better than everÂ– the size and feel is more ergonomic and now I don't have to fish for it each time I want to open/lock my car door. Thanks, Sugru!
