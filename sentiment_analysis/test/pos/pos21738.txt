I love this mount, as it holds my phone very securely by just pressing it against the button embedded in the back of the mount. It also has one lever that secures it to my CD slot, as opposed to a screw like my last mount. However, I would caution that although I have very strong hands, I still have trouble setting and releasing the slot lock lever. If this is for someone with arthritis or poor grip strength, someone would need to help them mount and unmount it. Regular operation once it's mounted is not a problem, as the release requires much less grip strength, and could be done with two hands if necessary.
