This works!!  I sustained a 12 hour car trip with two teenage boys, a cooler of fish and a tackle box and fishing equipment that left my car unbearable to be in; we were literally dry heaving. I made a joke about it on Facebook and a friend told me about this product and I ordered it immediately. I put it in the back seat of my car at noon and left my house at 2:15 and the odor was already gone. My son who has huge odor sensitivities got in the car and immediately said the smell was gone. I am purchasing more of these for shoes and bathrooms!
