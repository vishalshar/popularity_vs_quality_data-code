I have had more fun with this toy than I thought I would.  Pairing with my iPhone was easy and now I mainly use my Surface Pro 2 to control the Sphero.  I have also paired it with my Galaxy S5 and Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, both were just as easy as syncing up with my iPhone.  The controls for this are dead simple and there are some extra apps that act as games.  I don't really use them though, I just rely on the basic Sphero control app.You can change colors, make it flash between two colors, and access special abilities like speed boost.  I can attest both to the agility of the Sphero as well as its ruggedness.  I've run the Sphero over carpet, hard wood, grass, dirt, sand, concrete, asphalt, and even in the pool.  Nothing really seems to stop it or even make a dent.  I mainly have my dogs chase the Sphero around and one of them seems to enjoy it, the other gets bored pretty quickly.  The Sphero seems to last for a long time on a single charge, mine normally goes for 2-2.5 hours before needing to be recharged.  Orbotix includes a wireless charger for the Sphero so all you have to do is put it in its charging cradle.  The recharge time is atrocious though as it takes about 3 hours to full recharge again.  In other words, if you have kids, they could literally drain the Sphero and recharge it all day.  I'm knocking it by 1/2 star for the recharge time.  It's nice and convenient to have wireless charging but it does seem to take forever.I do recommend getting one of the nub covers though.  It adds a level of protection as well as giving the Sphero some grip when going over smooth surfaces like hard wood, dirt, and sand.  It also gives the Sphero some extra speed when running in a pool.  That's why I'm knocking this by another half star, the nub cover should have been included and not a separate add-on.  Orbotix should have included one nub cover (whatever color) in the package and then sold the remaining two different color separately, that would have made more sense.All-in-all, I've had a lot of fun with this.  I originally purchased it to be a dog toy, a ball that they could chase around the apartment but it has become my own toy instead.  I highly recommend taking it to a pool, pond, lake, whatever at least once just to try it out.
