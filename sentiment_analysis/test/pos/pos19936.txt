These speakers are awesome! I use it all the time at home and up the canyon near where I live. While hammocking, it's so easy to attach a carabiner to the hook on the bottom of the speaker to keep your music hanging with you. Haven't tried the speaker in the shower/rain, but from all the reviews I've seen online, it looks like this thing is bullet proof. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
