This is a hilarious but also useful tool to monitor the animals we have. It is a sure fire conversation starter and a smile guaranteed whipping the app out at a party and showing people how you can talk to your animals from anywhere.Some people might make comments about you being crazy or needing to have priorities, but guess what? They're jealous!It is awesome how fast the dogs and our cat have become accustomed to hearing the little chime turn on when the camera is activated and they look over and then run to get the treats and hear our voices.The only reason this is not 5 stars is because it is not night vision and the audio is only one way. It would be great to be able to monitor at night and also listen.
