I am using this product with the LG v20 and a samsung TV.  This cable, unlike most MHL cables, doesn't seem to charge the phone while in use.  That's not a big deal since the phone uses about 10% juice every 30 minutes.  The picture quality is amazing with zero lag and it is idiot-proof (you really just plug it in).
