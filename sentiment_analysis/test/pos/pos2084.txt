This kit was actually perfect. It has all the tools needed plus extra.  I have replaced some screens before (on iPhone 4), but if you have some intuition to what you are doing you hardly even need the instructions.  The screen works perfectly and only took about half hour to install.  I originally was going to Apple since they charge same price plus tax for it to be replaced, but was told one time that my phone was too bent and couldn't be fixed, but that's because apple geniuses are in fact, not, in any sense of the word educated or geniuses.  You can bend phone back with screen off work and a little wiggle and it will work perfectly.  Spending half hour on this beats the 2 hour trips to the store it would take to drop it off to be fixed.
