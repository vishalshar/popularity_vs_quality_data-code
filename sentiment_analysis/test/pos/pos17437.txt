This is ultimately the best exercise bike I've used to date, I even quit cycling classes after two days of this, now don't get me wrong, a VR headset is an absolute must have to get the most out of it, but combined with PSVR, and you can bid your personal trainer a fairwell, after 30 minutes of cardio with this I am sweating like crazy, buy it, you will not regret it, trust me this is an amazing experience....  looking for ward to some mortocyke type arcadish fun in the future with this, since you can use your body to maneuver left and right this is simply amazing folks.  I'd give it 10 stars if I could
