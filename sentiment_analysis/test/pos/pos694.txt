My first encounter with the Rokform iPhone case was actually with the iPhone 4S version- the Rokbed.  I was so impressed with that case that I immediately ordered the Rokshield when I upgraded to the 5S.  This case is essentially the same design as the Rokbed, but with a few improvements.The case is made of a high quality, dense plastic.  It has openings along the top, sides and bottom that allow for easy access to the few buttons that exist on the iPhone.  It maintains a slim profile, but it does add a noticeable amount of weight.  It's not overbearing by any means, but it is substantial. One of the improvements in this case over previous versions is the addition of a felt material to the inside of the case that protects the phone from scratches that may occur from dust/debris that have collected inside.  In my experience, it also stops a lot of debris from entering in the first place.The other major improvement is a rubber bumper for added protection against drops that slips around the outside of the case after it is snapped onto the phone.  In all honesty, though, the case itself is more than enough protection against the vast majority of drops.  Once I realized that the bumper was making it more difficult to remove the phone from my pocket because it kept catching on the pocket material and wanting to turn it inside out, I took it off and threw it in a drawer.  I haven't really thought about it since.The case has a rubber insert in the back that allows for some grip so the phone doesn't slide around on whatever surface you set it down on.  These inserts can be switched out for different colors (available for purchase separately) and even have versions that hold a strong magnet- allowing you to magnetically attach the phone to any ferrous metal surface.  The original Rokbed case that I bought came with the magnet included, but sadly the Rokshield does not. Along the bottom, the opening does round out a bit around the headphone jack to allow for headphone plugs, but in my experience, it is still a little too small to allow for anything but the slimmest of jacks to fit with the case still intact.  If your headphone jack is bigger than the case allows, it isn't hard to remove the bottom third to plug in- but you are compromising the safety of your phone each time that you do.The true beauty in this case is the larger system of accessories that are made to work seamlessly with it.  When you purchase this case, it comes with a simple car mount that you attach to your dashboard using the 3M auto tape that is already on the back.  The mount then attaches to the central opening in the back of the case to maintain a strong hold on your phone.  If you've ever used auto tape, you know that it is very sturdy and you can rest assured that the mount will stay mounted for a long time.  It holds the phone in place on the dash with ease.  The negative to that is that you have to be willing to have that mount on your dash long term and, if you want to remove it down the road, you will definitely have a messy chore of Goo Gone and elbow grease in your future.  Not to mention the very real possibility that your dash will be damaged during the removal process.In addition to the dash mount, Rokform sells many other different types of mounts that connect to the case.  Most useful is the bike mount.  It easily mounts to your handlebars and holds your phone securely enough that you won't have to worry about it falling out mid-ride.It is the large variety of accessories that make this case so useful, and it is this ecosystem that makes me warn that you have to be willing to commit to the case.  In order to get the most use of it, you will end up buying another $10-$50 worth of accessories and once you do, you will want to stay with this case system through different iterations of the iPhone to get the most from your money.
