This is super cute and small. I am shocked to see how power this is compared to its small size. I only use it to hear my baby girl. The sound alerts are great. I like the tips they have in the app specially the one about plants. I added my own mp3 music to it and played it a few times. My baby didnÂ’t like the sound so we stopped using that part. So far its good.
