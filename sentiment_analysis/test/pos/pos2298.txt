This stuff is really great. I saw vast improvement with eczema within a few days of usage. It is truly a cream and not greasy, a pleasure to use not only for those with eczema  but with rough and red skin as well. Also, it's a great alternative to steroid cream some of which have side effects more concerning than the skin problem one is trying to cure. Also, only a small amount of this product is required and it is a large indeed, making this an exceedingly good value.
