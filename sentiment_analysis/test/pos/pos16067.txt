Love the cost savings of these things! I have six, all of which I have scheduled to come on from 6pm until about midnight, some earlier. My electrical bill has not changed much. When I first got them and set them up, they required a firmware update. I recommend doing this by screwing each bulb into a fixture near the wifi router. This makes things much easier. I had a slight problem with a couple of them because I had them update from outside on the patio. I did also purchase a wifi extender, which was helpful. I have had these bulbs for a couple of months now and no problems whatsoever. The app isn't the most intuitive, but it works just fine. Hopefully in time with future updates the app will be more user friendly, especially with scheduling. All things considered I am very happy with these bulbs.
