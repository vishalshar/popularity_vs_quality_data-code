This is a good quality notebook.I'm kind of a notebook/journal aficionado, and I've used many brands for years, including Moleskine, Ecosystem, and Leuchtturm.The paper quality is better than any Moleskine journal I've ever used; no ink seepage. The paper  has a nice, beige color--it isn't white like on a Leuchtturm.The pages on the left side are dotted in a grid-like pattern. This is supposedly for drawing or sketching ideas. In practice, I'm not sure how useful this actually is. The pages on the right side are lined, with subtle indentation marks.The cover is actually a thin neoprene. It's a tad spongy, but this is very subtle and not at all bad. The red logo is frankly one of the weakest aspects. It is glued on the cover, and not very well. Mine hasn't fallen off yet, but I expect it will soon. The logo is also not flush with the cover, it sticks out and is noticeable. If you stick the notebook in your backpack, it might get caught with something.No pocket on the back. If your're used to most other notebooks of this type, you might miss it.It is a dull gray. Not shiny like on the picture. Kinda stands out. Frankly, i'd be more likely to buy again if the manufacturer offered a black option with a printed logo, as opposed to the glued tag.All in all, the paper quality makes this notebook a good purchase.
