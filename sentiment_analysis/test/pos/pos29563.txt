THIS IS A REVISED REVIEWThose of you that don't know the truth about replacing modern day car keys, here is an example of my car key replacement cost.  1992 Toyota Small Truck (this was a normal key but Dealer had to call Toyota to retrieve the key code) $50, 2005 MazdaSpeed Miata flip key $410, 2012 Prius  dash push button iginition $250.  That would be a total of $700 to replace all of the keys on my keychain not counting house keys. GAG!!!REVISED REVIEW - MUCH MUCH BETTER - 5 STARSAfter a not so stellar beginning experience and bad Amazon review with MYNT here is what happened next. My original problem was a very short pairing distance. I received an email from the MYNT people wanting to know how the MYNT tracker was working. Impressive! They wanted to be sure that I am now using the MYNT app v2 instead of the older version. The email explained how to pair the device and mentioned one very important thing. REBOOT YOUR PHONE. I missed that in the original instructions, if it was there,I had installed the v2 app originally but had not rebooted my phone. After rebooting, miraculously the Bluetooth pairing distance has doubled. As a test, I asked my wife to hide my keys. Using the MYNT app radar feature I was able to locate my keys in about 5 minutes. She had placed them in a really sneaky spot. As I walked around the house my iPhone would lose the Bluetooth  connection at about the 30' range and then as I moved closer to the lost keys location the connection would pair again. Seeing the MYNT icon move in and out on the radar, disconnecting sometimes (this was an indication that I was getting very cold) and then reconnecting (which was an indication that I was getting hotter), and then moving very close to the radar center (very hot) eventually led me to within 3' of the keysMy revised opinion. With the GPS Feature and the improved Bluetooth I can highly recommend MYNT. 5 STARS$700 to replace three car keys is a crime!!
