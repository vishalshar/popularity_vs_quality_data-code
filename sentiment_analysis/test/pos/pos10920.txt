This is exactly what I needed!  My cat needs medication every 12 hours - and I'm fortunate enough that she'll take it herself as long as it's hidden in a pill-pocket with the rest of her food.  Now I have confidence that she'll get her medicine even if I'm not home, I can even watch her take it on the webcam!I wish the tray weren't plastic, or there were ceramic or glass inserts since I try to avoid plastic pet dishes.  I'll probably look for small dishes that fit in the tray, but it would be even better if Feed and Go provided something that fit exactly and could rotate between the feeder and the dishwasher.
