I am an active 45 year old female. I have spinal stenosis and degenerative disk disease. I have had 5 back surgeries with a 6th one pending. My muscles are always in knots and cause me a lot of pain. As a busy Mom, I can't just take a pain killer and go to bed, nor do I want to! Like most of us with chronic pain, we are looking for pain relief in the most natural way possible! I have found tremendous relief with this product! I have used foam rollers, but they do not get deep enough into the trigger points for deep massage. I have used a tennis ball against the wall with zero effectiveness. Why? They don't stay in place or go where I need them to. The Body Track in ingenious because in conjunction with the massage track balls, they stay in place and go where you want and need them to go. There are different massage track balls you can order depending on how firm you want them to be. I cannot say enough about the relief I get with this product! This truly helps get rid of the knots and helps me to enjoy a higher quality of life with a lot less pain! I cannot say enough about how much I love this product! The customer service is second to none. The owner even emailed me to see if I had any questions and if I was satisfied, almost unheard of in this day and age!! I suggest you give it a try and you will find some relief too!
