I own the BP-700wf (pictured) and have been using it weekly for over 12 months. I have found it to be both reliable and accurate values as measured with the traditional equipment at the local health clinic . Set up to connect with home wifi was effortless and painless. The device literally has not missed a beat. It may be helpful to know that Microsoft HealthVault (https://www.healthvault.com/us/en) supports Blipcare devices. After setup, it connects seamlessly and transfer is immediate. If interested, it uses 4 AA batteries and I have changed them out once since purchase. Four of Five stars is a stellar endorsement. A fifth star is pending compatibility with more health apps.
