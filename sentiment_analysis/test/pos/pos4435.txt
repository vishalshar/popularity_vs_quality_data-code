I didn't want to write a review until I actually tried the product.  It works wonderfully.  Before I just left my cheese in the original plastic wrapping and then covered it with foil.  This did not work very well and my cheese would go bad.  It also was a pain and I actually ended up with plastic wrappings in some of my cheeses.  I know you're not supposed to leave cheese in its original plastic wrapping, but otherwise it was wrapped in foil and I would forget what it was.  Now it is neatly labeled and I know exactly what type of cheese I have in my refrigerator.Now I just throw the cheese into the cheese bag and fold it over.  The cheese is keeping beautifully.  I was worried that the bags would not be durable, but they are lasting just fine.  I will be able to reuse them again.  I just slip the cheese out of the bag and I am ready to go.  At the price of cheese I didn't want to continue to have to throw moldy cheese away.  Before I bought these bags I threw away $10.00 worth of Gouda so these bags will end paying for themselves.This product was a personal purchase for myself at the normal retail price.
