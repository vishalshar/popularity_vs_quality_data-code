Welcome to the 21st Century and throw your shoelaces away!These are just so cool, I'm 57, somewhat disabled. so that whole shoelace thing is a bit bothersome. These on the other hand, not only make shoes easy, but give them a modern, sleek, look, that makes everybody look at your tennis shoes.All of my tennis shoes and casual shoes will have these, maybe even my wingtips too!Oh, and there are a couple of whinny reviews from people about "they don't fit" "they were too tight" all you have to do is give them two or three pulls before you lace them on your shoes to make them a bit longer. Still too tight give them another pull until they feel better. No problem.
