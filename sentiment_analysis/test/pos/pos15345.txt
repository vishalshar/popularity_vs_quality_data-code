Awesome product.  Allows me to hardwire my Rachio 2nd Gen.  I was going to go with the other guy WIFI controller, then Rachio came out with 2nd Gen.  Now this is great.  Highly recommended.What I don't understand is the lack of pictures from Rachio.  Why don't they take more pictures and show them in details on the site?  I was wondering how do these work.  Why can't they take a picture that shows the plug in there?  Rachio! Have you seen Apple website about their products?  A good idea to copy them, don't you think? '.Anyways, love my Rachio 2nd Gen and this enclosure.
