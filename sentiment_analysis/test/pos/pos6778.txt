Have a mini daschund that kept walking through the wrought iron fence.  Strung wire under bottom rung around entire property, perfect,  Bought 2 extra receivers for cats that insist on being outside but were roaming the neighborhood.  They now play happily in the yard with the puppy and are easy to find.
