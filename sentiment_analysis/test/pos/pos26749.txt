I bought this to mount on my back pack and this mount is perfect for doing so.The plastic is very dense, sturdy and strong. Quality. I really like the dull/flat finish.The metal parts are also quality.My only complaint is that I wish it used the GoPro clip mounts. However, the product still deserves 5 stars.There are many other methods to use this mount that I have not used but the wheels are spinning on the various way to use it. The back side has 2 vertical and 2 horizontal slots.
