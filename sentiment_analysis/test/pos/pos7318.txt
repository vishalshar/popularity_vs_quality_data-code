Excellent product. My sons food is always hot or cold. I was worried that with the spill proof design, it would be hard for him to open it but he had no issues at all!! The compartments are big enough to hold portions that he can finish. I recommend this product for anyone with a little one that has trouble eating his/her lunch because it won't stay hot or cold.
