Love BoomChickaPop popcorn. And I love the individual 80 calories-per-bag, "imposed" portion control. The ingredients are simply popcorn, sunflower oil and sea salt.  Packaging indicates: 0g Trans Fat, Cholesterol-Free, Whole Grain, Gluten-free, Non GMO.  Great taste, not too salty, just right.  The individual bags are packaged in a carton that measures: 15 1/2 x 13 x  7 inches. I also love Skinny Pop popcorn. Not sure which I like better. Both taste good but they have slightly different flavor. It is hard to describe, but the BoomChickaPop tastes more "cooked" to me.
