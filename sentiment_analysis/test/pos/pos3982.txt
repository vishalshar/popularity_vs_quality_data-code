I was debating if I should go with this product versus the Porch Potty that costs $297 with s/h for our new lab.  After reading much reviews from both ends, I decided that this product would serve its purpose for our lab to relieve itself out in the patio.  I simply can't justify the costs to spend close to $300 of the Porch Potty when this product $120 with FREE s/h can't do.  I received this product and I simply LOVE it.  The product does not feel cheap and it's sturdy.  I love how it has a front drawer door where the pet urine ended up.  It comes with a small package of Pee-Pod with Wee Sponge which helps absorb urine on contact for immediate odor control.  The best part is that it turns pet's urine into a gel, so urine never spills onto your hands or the floor.I would recommend this product above other products I've seen at Petco or Petsmart for sure.
