This suitcase is awesome!! Perfect size so I know it'll work with all airlines' carryon policies, and the features work great. Having a charge on the go is a lifesaver especially since my phone's battery can't handle a full day of travel anymore. GPS tracking provides a lot of peace of mind. Overall great addition to my travel set. You guys nailed it Bluesmart.
