This is an amazing device! I'm so glad I ordered it, because over time I'm sure it will allow me to greatly reduce a scar on my cheek. After 3 uses, separated by a week, I've already seen a major improvement. First let me describe the scar. It's not deep, and appears as a white patch covering an area about the size of a quarter. I always felt that the layer of scar tissue was so thin, it could be mostly "erased" with enough dermabrasion. I did go to a professional aesthetician several times for treatments, but saw no improvement. I chose not to invest more money in these expensive treatments, and decided to go it alone. I must admit to being more aggressive in my approach than the Instruction Manual advises, but no lasting harm was done. I'm not advising anyone to do this, I'm just saying it worked for me. I kept drawing the suction tip over the area until I saw tiny pinpoints of red under the scar. Then I stopped and applied a generous amount of Vaseline over the area. The next morning it was just slightly pink around the white area of the scar, so my normal routine of applying concealer to cover the scar worked as usual. In a couple of days, the treated area began to peel, in a "flaky" sort of way. Again, it did not interfere with my normal makeup routine, because the flaking was gradual and hardly noticeable. After a week, all of the flakiness was gone, and I could absolutely see a reduction of the scar. I've repeated the treatment twice since then, with further reduction noticeable. I know that a scar can't ever be completely erased, but with my MiniMD, I expect someday it will be barely visible.
