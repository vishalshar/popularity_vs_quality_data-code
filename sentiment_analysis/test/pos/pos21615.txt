I never even knew these brush guards existed, but now that I know, I never want my brushes to be without them!  I used to keep the plastic sleeve that came with my brushes on them, but they were loose.  The brush guards keep the brushes nicely shaped.  The cleaning cup works great.  My former method of washing swirling the brush in my hand was good, but this cup is better.  Also, I really like the cleaning solution; it seems to work better than my usual baby wash.  Highly recommend this!
