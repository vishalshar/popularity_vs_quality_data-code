Overall I really like my Mighty Mug. Pros: It keeps water cold, even in 100 degree weather. The color is vibrant. Its easy to clean. It doesn't fall over. I like that its not plastic. Cons: It does leak, especially when you put fresh ice cold water in it and then close the lid. It dribbles out the top vent hole thats suppose to seal, and if you don't screw the cap on REALLY tight it will dribble right out of from underneath the mouth piece. I don't like this because I can't put it in my purse and feel confident hat it won't leak all over my things. The other thing I dislike about it is that the mouth piece to let the water out isn't very big at all. If I'm really thirsty I unscrew the cap so I can chug half of the container at a time. If you want slow drinks then the mouth piece is fine. I haven't tried this with hot liquids. Only water.
