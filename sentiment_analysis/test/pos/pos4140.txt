These silicone lids form an amazing seal on almost any flat surface. I bought the 4" size to use as a lid for a camping mug that I use to heat my meals when backpacking, Olicamp Hard Anodized Space Saver Mug (Black Handle) . Its very lightweight and can be stashed inside the mug or on the bottom of the large-size iso-butane canisters.
