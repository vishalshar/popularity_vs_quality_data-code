With 5 kids, we go through A LOT of baggies. I bought a few of these to use as snack bags for outings, or for me of my husband's lunches. For the price, I don't  fully trust my kids not to throw them away until they have seen them for a while.So far, I am pleased. I am going to see how they old up before I buy more.
