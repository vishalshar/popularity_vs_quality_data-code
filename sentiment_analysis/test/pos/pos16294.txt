I've wanted a thermal camera ever since I was a teen, but the cost - even for a used one - has always pushed me away. The Seek is amazing for the price. The setup was as easy as downloading the app and plugging the camera into my phone. The software works well and is easy to figure out. The various color modes make the camera useful in a variety of uses, from general night vision to identifying the drafty spots around your doors and windows. The resolution isn't super-duper, but good enough to identify objects and such. The only complaint I have with it is that on my phone (HTC One) the camera faces the wrong way, so unless I want to take a bunch of thermal selfies, I have to use a small extension cable (not include). Overall, though, I'm very pleased.
