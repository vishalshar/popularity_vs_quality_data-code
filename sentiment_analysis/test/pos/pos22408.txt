The bargain of 2016..most underrated android phone...love its unique design...battery life is good..performance is very fast no lags..smart storage is surprisingly smart and seamless u really see the difference with 100GB available for you to use..charging time is insanely fast..Camera is good enough all of these pros for 169$ i mean who can do better!!! U dont like the launcher just install google launcher or nova.. u dont like the smart storage unlock it and flash cyanogen and keep ure warranty as well! Simply good
