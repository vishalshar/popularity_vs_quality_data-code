This is a good product which works just as intended. One can track house keys as long as TrackR is part of the key chain from iPhone using the app which is very easy to download and install. One can also use TrackR to locate misplaced iPhone from the key chain, but make sure the TrackR app is left running in the background on your iPhone. All in all, I am very happy with TrackR so much so that I bought 2 additional ones fro X-Mas gifts.
