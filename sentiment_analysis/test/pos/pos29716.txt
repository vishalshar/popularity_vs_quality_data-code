LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these jar lids!!  I admit I have somewhat of a Mason Jar crush and use them for everything I can.  I recently decided to "pretty up" my fridge and purchased half gallon Mason jars for milk, chocolate milk, water, tea, and Kool-aid.  These lids are the perfect addition to my fridge makeover.  They pour nicely with no leaks down the side of the jar (important to me).  They are not totally leak proof - if you shake your chocolate milk vigorously they will leak but I have been able to live with that (I just adjust my shake method to avoid directly shaking on the lid)  For shaking/mixing Kool-aid I just use the regular Mason lids and rings (no leaking) and then put the pour cap on.  If you love Mason jars and need a pour spout, these are definitely worth the investment.
