Decided to keep it and play with it. But deduct one star because they need to not confuse customer on instruction to connect.  Key is selecting the right app to connect.  There was no latency when I played.  There was an extra humming noise but I closed the app and reopened it.  Glad it works now I will hopefully enjoy it!
