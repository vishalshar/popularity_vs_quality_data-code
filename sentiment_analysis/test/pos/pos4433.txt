Using Formaticum cheese paper is a great way to keep cheese fresh in the fridge. I immediately take off the store wrappiing and rewrap the cheese in the cheese paper, sealing it with the label supplied by Formaticum. This will lengthen the time you can keep the cheese fresh. My order came really fast. I will definitely use it again.
