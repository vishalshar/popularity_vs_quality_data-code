Great everyday case and locks solidly onto my bike. I have had the misfortune of falling on my bike while my phone was locked on the handle bars and this thing worked exactly as it was supposed to. The phone was kept safely locked in place and was not affected by the fall. This is by the way my second quad lock case. I also had one for my 5S before upgrading to the 6+ and I will have one on my next phone too.
