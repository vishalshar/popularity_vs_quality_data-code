This case is great. Charges my phone and looks good doing it.My only complaint is that I got the white model and the material that the case is made out of scratches incredibly easily. I've only had it for 5 days and there are already dark spots on the phone from scratches.I'll probably just put a sticker over it but it's still kinda frustrating.
