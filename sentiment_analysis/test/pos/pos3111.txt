Normally I am a size small, so I ordered a medium to be on the safe side as this product listing does not come with a sizing chart. In all fairness, I would recommend going UP 2 sizes because this jacket is tight. I would return mine but they are all out of size large and I have no idea when they will be restocking.STYLE: 5 stars - it is very cute and flatteringCOMFORT: 4 stars. The inner fleece is very nice, however this jacket is tight (form fitting) and not flexible at all, I cannot raise my arms even half the way up while it is zipped. This will make for uncomfortable driving or long time wear. I have a competitor waterproof/breathable parka for winter temperatures which cannot be worn most of the year, but they managed to make it comfortable and maneuverable, something this Mia Melon coat is lacking. BUT, as long as you are not raising your arms much, there shouldn't be much trouble.To sum it up: Go up a minimum of 1 size, 2 sizes up for more comfort in the arm area. It is a gorgeous jacket and the olive green is my absolute favorite color. I do see myself wearing this as much as I can, though don't expect to do outdoor sports such as camping, hiking, etc in this jacket. Not  worth the price if you are buying for functionality over fashion but this coat has a "happy medium" between the two.Also, I am disappointed that there are no care and/or washing instructions for this coat anywhere.
