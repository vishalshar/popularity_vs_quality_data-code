our 11 year old mutt loves them and we have seen a drastic improvement in his ability to run and jump, his coat looks great and he's gained a few ponds (it's a good thing)been using theses treats for 3 months, make sure you have plenty of water for your dog to drink ours drinks 3x as much then he used to.
