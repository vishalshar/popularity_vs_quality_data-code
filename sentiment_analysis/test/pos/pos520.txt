I love this phone. I'm glad I didn't go with the somewhat bigger Nexus 6; it just would have been too big for my hands, which aren't that small. Although the tempered glass screen protector it came with was chipped or cracked there was no actual damage to the phone itself. It's taken some getting use to because it is definitely bigger then my old Galaxy S4, but it was totally worth the switch. The UI is pretty easy to learn, and it didn't come with a ton of bloatware. Works perfectly on my Straight Talk network, via AT&T towers. Just had to get a nano SIM and register the card with the carrier online. Had to configure the data network to the right access port though, but I had to do it with the S4 so it wasn't a big deal. The reception is great, I can hear people on the other end of the line, and the features are fun to play with.Would I buy this again?YOU BET!!!
