This was the only mount I found that would work with my Iphone 6 Plus with the Otterbox Defender case. I placed both magnets that the mount came with between the silicone cover and plastic case.  I drive a Lexus RX350, and it mounts fine on the AC vent. I like that I don't have to fuss with the mount to grab my phone and go. Perfect for me.
