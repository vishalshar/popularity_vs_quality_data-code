How did I ever live without this?? My cat eats wet food and I need to feed him several times a day. This was either a huge pain before or just impossible. No more worrying if they get stuck at work and no more paws to the face at 6AM.I looked into many other feeders before I found this one and none of them came close to this. I haven't seen one negative review about the Feed And Go! You can have it play a message when it's time to eat or just whenever you want! I love being able to use my phone or computer to see my cat on the webcam! It's not only fun but it's great to see that he is ok while I'm at work or out of town.If you are looking for a pet feeder you should stop right now. No need to keep looking. The Feed And Go is second to none! And it's so easy to use.  I couldn't be happier and I promise you will love it too! I even had a few questions and they got back to me in minutes.5 stars don't do it justice. Best purchase I've made in years!
