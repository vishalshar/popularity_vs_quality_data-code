UPDATE: I'm enjoying my Ray even more now. After a couple weeks of use, it's doing really well for what I wanted and then some. I discovered the Misfit Link app. The app says it currently only supports their Flash product, but I set my Ray up to use the "Find my phone feature" and it works perfectly! Just a few simple taps of my Ray and my phone starts ringing from wherever I left it. No more asking friends to call my phone so I can find it, or searching endlessly when I'm by myself. I am really liking that this is an accurate, easy to use tracker with so many cool bonus features. Would love to know when the accessories are coming out that we see on Misfit's website. Right now you can only get the sport band or leather.I just started using my Misfit Ray  as a replacement for a malfunctioning Garmin and am thus far very pleased. The app and syncing to My Fitness Pal are seamless and so easy. It would be nice to see a display instead of having to go to your phone to check your step count, etc. But, once you learn the light color sequences, you can at least see how much of your daily goal you've met. As for step counting, it seems to be pretty accurate if not a tad oversensitive. Sleep recording, again, has to be initiated on your phone instead of the device, but it seems pretty accurate in reading that too.  Like others have said, the vibrations are very light, but I can definitely feel them. It did wake me up for my alarm this morning, but I can see how if you're a deep sleeper, it wouldn't wake you. I do love the text/call notification feature. I can leave my phone upstairs charging and still know when I get a call or text, which is nice. Compared to the Garmin, it's much more comfortable to wear, more stylish and very light weight. Im excited for when I can wear it as a pendant too. The only reason I haven't given 5 stars was the battery installation can be a bit tedious, as you have to drop 3 tiny batteries into a slender chamber. If they don't nest properly, they can become lodged in there and be difficult to get out. However, if you get them all in there right the first time, it locks up well. I still prefer long term batteries to constantly re-charging. Overall, I recommend this fitness tracker.
