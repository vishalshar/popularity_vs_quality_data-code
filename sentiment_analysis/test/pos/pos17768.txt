What a great idea for popcorn lovers!  Great flavor and very easy to drizzle over popcorn (or ice cream, pound cake, etc).  Great value for the amount you get (under $4 for 13 oz).  I took it to work and everyone got a chance to 'try' some.  It was a huge hit with everyone wanting more!  I love caramel and this hits the spot!  My only word of caution is that the word 'brittle' is a bit deceiving.  This topping does not get hard, like you would think it would; but I'm okay with that.  Some people complained it is 'messy' on your fingers.  I'd don't think it's any messier that eating buttered popcorn (I lick my fingers with that too)!
