This was a kind of gag gift for the husband at Christmas but it has turned out to be quite practical.  We read online somewhere that color red would make it more likely for him to go back to sleep if he had to, ahem, get up in the night.  Well, he usually does, ahem, get up in the night, and the motion sensor works great.  It's a gentle light and it stays on for a brief period after he has left the room.  He likes it very much.  Kind of took the gag out of my gag gift.
