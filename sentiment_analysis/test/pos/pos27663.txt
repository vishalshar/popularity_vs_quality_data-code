We received a Sphero from one of my closest friends. I love using it & experimenting with it & creating macros & automated routines to run it. I like using the draw & drive app as well. And playing with the cats with it. Zuko, our crazy black cat who overwhelms most kitty toys finds this a great challenge. It helps me wear him out a bit so that we can all get some sleep at night.We bought this one for our nephew for his 10th birthday & gave it to him along with my old iPhone to use as controller. He had just experienced one at his friend's house & had been on his school's robotics team and it turned out to be the perfect gift. He likes playing some of the group games with it & has been learning all the tricks & abilities of the Sphero by completing challenges in the main Sphero app.
