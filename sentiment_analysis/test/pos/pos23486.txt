Perfect size bags for an individual snack.  Good ingredients and simple, fresh stuff.  Highly recommended for the on-the-go person, OR, like in our case, our college daughter.  Grab a bag, toss it in the backpack, and out the door you go. And it helps to avoid the snack machine and unhealthy snack foods.
