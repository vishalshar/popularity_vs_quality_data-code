My wife breaks EVERY cable she ever uses. I replace them monthly. So I though my instead of buying a multi pack of cheapos again I would buy this one. Everything about this cable is solid. I know it's strong. I'm only worried about the tip as that is the main culprit for my wife. The tip is still just seated in a plastic end. I assume underneath is some sort of extra re-enforcement but we'll see in time.I give it a five because it seems worth the price over an apple cable and I think I'm going to get at least a few months out of it.
