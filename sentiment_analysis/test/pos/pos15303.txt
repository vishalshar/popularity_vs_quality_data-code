I really like this jacket. I bike commute, often at night. Visibility is really important and I don't think there's a more reflective jacket on the market. I often get comments from other bikers, even drivers, just how visible I am.That said, I'm holding back on five stars for a few reasons - front pockets are way too deep making it hard to reach my phone and keys. Also, beware of sizing - I'm 5' 10" so usually between small and a medium. The medium I first purchased was more like XXL, so I returned it for a small, but I'm now wishing for an extra small. Last, the jacket is slightly heavier than I'd like for our mild Northern California climate (that's not a complaint, just an observation). All-in-all, I'm willing to make these tradeoffs for great visibility. Happy cycling!
