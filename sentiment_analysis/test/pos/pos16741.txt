Fantastic phone! Where do I start?? Perhaps that  it feels and performs like a $600 phone for a fraction of the price! It has a luxurious and sturdy finish, screen resolution is incredibly bright and clear. Multitasking is a piece of cake, never slugs or slows down.  Don't know specs to compare it to the apples or samsungs, and honestly it doesn't matter when you have owned 4 other $500 + phones that have all broken equally and get replaced yearly, it doesn't make sense, when this phone performs the same. This phone is a keeper. Thank you POSH for making a fantastic phone for an incredibly accesible price!
