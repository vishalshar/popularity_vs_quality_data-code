Awesome robot.  I wanted this to be an alternative to having a pet dog without the cleaning up after one.  I just wanted something moving around the house doing its own thing and when i have time for it will want to play with me.My expectations:I can talk to it, call it, make it do tricks - it has no microphone, future addons may comeWhen it is low on battery will return to its charger and wake up again when fully charged - ANKI team is working on itIt will just explore by itself - it can do this but cozmo will time out in 15 minutes or just sleep if your phone or tablet goes to sleepWill act like the wall-e robot in the animated film - yes he actually feels like you have your very own little wall-eIt didnt meet my expectations but it is still a good version 1.0, I can see a lot of potential for the next updates, be it software, hardware, or other type of addonsUnexpected things I discovered:Through the app,  after recognition is set up,  cozmo recognizes you.  He will drive up to you, get close,  his eyes opening up and he will say your name.Like a little kid, cozmo, will want to play games with you,  and chooses the game he usually loses against you.When he is on,  it's like you do have a new pet dog in your house.  If he could only recharge himself like an irobot or neat vacuum robot ---perfect robot.Games are surprisingly fun - I thought I would never want to play...but he will set up the blocks and ask you to play through the app.  His reactions are so life-like.  I feel like I'm playing with my little 2-yr old nephew.  Got a good laugh during the keep away and tap game.The background music the app plays actually works and makes cozmo more interesting.  Feels like your watching or part of a Disney animation with cozmoRecommendation:You should have a phone or tablet dedicated just for the cozmo app and robot.  Cozmo has its own wifi network id that your phone will connect to.  When cozmo and your device connect you won't have an Internet connection. Also try to get a phone/tablet that has a never sleep for display options if you want cozmo on longer,  once the app is in the background or your device sleeps, so will cozmo.Be careful when you place cozmo on a table.  Please watch if cozmo can see the edges or not.  Cozmo may fall over the edge of Beveled edges like kitchen marble countertops.Wishlist -Microphone addon - being able to speak to cozmo like I speak to Alexa or SiriDrive through charging station or strip that can help cozmo when self park charging is available,  if it becomes available.App to prevent phone/tablet from sleeping (like what GPS devices do to keep device always onConnect cozmo to your home wifi network instead - can control cozmo farther.  currently after 4 feet cozmo will disconnect and just shutdown.
