Pretty neat, but the image is fairly blurry.  I chose this over the Flir one because the temp range on this went far beyond the 212F limit of the Flir one.  But the Flir one does have outstanding imaging with the dual cameras.  I guess you just cant have both...The XR really is best for long distance viewing.  I tried to get an image of the dog, and had to stand about 20 feet away to view the whole dog.  This will work indoors, but it's not very convenient.  I probably should have chosen the compact version for $50 less, with the larger field of view.
