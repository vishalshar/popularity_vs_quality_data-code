After I bought this filter and try to install in my go pro camera, I made a basic mistake and pressed the filter too far in on the GoPro lense causing the glass portion of the filter to pop out. Try to use super glue and the gases emitted by the glue damaged the glass surface of the filter. Frustrated I contacted Polar Pro customer services and to my surprise I was answered immediately (it was a Sunday afternoon), Polar Pro  (Jeff) replaced my filter and sent me an extra set of ND filters that are also amazing and the results with the PL are awesome.Thank you Polar Pro for being behind your product and making a frustrated experience the best outcome ever.
