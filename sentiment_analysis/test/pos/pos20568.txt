Really great mattress! I was able tu use it the first day, as it gave off almost no odor, unlike some other mattresses, which I would have had to store in my garage for weeks to defume. The price is great also. I have had my mattress for a week  now and sleep well on it, which for a 69 year old women, with all kinds of aches and pains is a blessing! Also it came  in only 2 after ordering ,just before Christmas. Great experience, all the stars from me.
