Works great on all our smaller dogs (up to about 25 pounds) - go with the 'full sized' one for larger (and/or hairier) dogs.  One note - the Little Dog collars 'eat' batteries, about one every 3 months, so be sure to set an alarm/alert on your phone or you may find your pups greeting you at the head of the driveway (or the head of the street) instead of within their enclosure!  Batteries in the larger format collar last closer to 1 year, but be sure to set an alarm/alert for these (or test them periodically), too.
