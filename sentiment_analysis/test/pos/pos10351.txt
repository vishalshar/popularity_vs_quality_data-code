I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase. I hesitated for a while because I had already gone through several other "wearable technologies" that tracked my steps and sleep. This Spire kept popping up in my advertising feeds and I checked it out a few times, but just didn't want to fork over more money for something so similar to what I already had.Then at a routine doctor visit I found out I was having heart palpitations. I was given an ECG and then sent to the hospital to be fitted with a Holter Monitor for 4 days. The results, thankfully, were that I was having benign heart palpitations...but they were happening pretty frequently and my doctor recommended some diet (no caffeine) and lifestyle changes (more relaxation).I immediately bought the Spire. After wearing a continuous heart monitor for several days I felt like I wanted to be more aware of my body's response to stress and better manage my stress level and physiological responses.My first impression when I got the Spire is how elegantly it was packaged. Sounds silly, but even just the packaging made it seem like this special, relaxing thing. The Spire itself is a pleasing, soft rounded shape with a stone-like texture. It reminds me of a "worry stone"; how apt.It's very easy to get started. Just put it on, link it to the app on your phone and go live your life. The app is very intuitive and easy to figure out. You can personalize many aspects like when you want alerts and under what conditions.Since I want to manage stress better I set the device to alert me if I am tense for more than 2-minutes. Golly, I had no idea! Let's just say that for several days I was constantly getting the little buzz reminding me to take a deep breath. And it helped! Now I will have entire days without a single moment of stressful breathing. It has not only helped me better manage stress, but also to identify situations that stress me out. Until I worse this device I had no idea how tense I get just talking on the phone - apparently I'm better suited to email. Now when I answer the phone I take a deep breath first and prepare myself to be more calm during phone calls. Sounds a little silly, I know, but little realizations like this lead to big changes in your life.My only complaint is a small one - I don't like the continuous light the Spire emits when it's charging. I'd like to keep the charging base on my bedside table, but the constant light is bothersome.Overall I have had real improvements in my life since purchasing the Spire. I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to be more self-aware and better at managing stress.
