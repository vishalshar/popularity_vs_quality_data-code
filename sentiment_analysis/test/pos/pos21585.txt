I am getting no difference in speeds between my wired PCs and my iPhone, and I now have WiFi in areas around the house where it used to be extremely spotty, including the driveway (2-story 2400 sq ft).The only con, and I'm sure it's on the way, is I cannot assign IPs to my individual devices yet. This isn't enough to bring down from 5 stars as the speed is amazing without this feature.
