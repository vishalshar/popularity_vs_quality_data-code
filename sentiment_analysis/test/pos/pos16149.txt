I have had the Whistle on my Siberian Husky for a week and it is working great!  I am testing its accuracy constantly and have not been disappointed.  If my dog runs, I can be proactive and find her within a few minutes.  I was a bit worried that the face of the tracker would get scratched easily, so I am making removable name stickers that I coordinate with her collars.  Even with the vinyl stickers on the surface, the Whistle remains very responsive to tracking.  I highly recommend this device.
