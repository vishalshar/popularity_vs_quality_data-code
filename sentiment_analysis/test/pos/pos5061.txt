This is my second Nevo.  I was an early backer and I was very disappointed for the longest time, but I got a notice of a couple of updates so I pulled it out of the drawer gave it another try.  Bravo guys.  Nevo now does what it was always supposed to and I love it!  I was so impressed, I bought one for my Dad for Christmas.  Hes semi new to his iphone and not tech-savvy at all but hes trying to stay active but doesnt want to wear just a step tracker.  Ill update with his thoughts on it after Christmas.
