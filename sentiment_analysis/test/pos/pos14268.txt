Protective case for kids. The case has deep corners that should save the mini if it is dropped on its corner or side. The case comes with a cheap screen protector that I didn't choose to use. I bought an Anker tempered glass protector for $10. The handle is a nice feature for kids on the go. The company provides a video if you need any help getting the case on the mini.
