Amazing smart watch. cant be beaten for the features it offers at 179$ price point. some thing i liked.-Heart Rate was accurate i verified from other cardio machines at gym-great watch faces and i hope mobovi will keep releasing new ones)-saw one update to the watch os already, which is great.-blazing fast and shows notifications really well-speaker/mic also works for phone calls
