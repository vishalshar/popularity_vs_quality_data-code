Another great product! Love their sport caps as well! I realize that I am paying for their design..... But I would buy much more of their products at a correct price point (in my opinion)...... The recap products are made of plastic and designed well. For this product, I have bought one and works great. Problem is the price.....I think that I paid 7 or 8 bucks for it. Suits my needs. Worth it. was 4 or 5 ..... Then I would have bought at 3 or 4...I figure that they would have made more money from me, which I am happy to give for a product that works. For the price point... A good idea, 4 for $20.  More money ! I would have paid it... even if I didn't have a use for 4 at the moment
