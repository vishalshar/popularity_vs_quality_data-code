I am a head and neck surgeon and perform a fair number of plastic surgery and reconstructive procedures.  I have used (and recommended) a wide variety of moisturizing and "anti-aging" serums and creams.  While I wouldn't tout this as a miracle, it is a fantastic moisturizer and I do seem to notice some improvement in fine-lines.  I recommend it without reservations.
