Coolest idea/design there is for working out/running with your phone. The quad lock is not going to break. Very strong and durable. I assume would protect against someone trying to rip your phone off. I have a iPhone 6+ and have always either had to squeeze my phone into sleeves that cause those sleeves to rip/bulge or take the case off every time I want to use my phone for music to workout in (which is annoying). This product solved that problem.
