I am using this with my SmartThings v2 Hub. After scratching my head over the extremely confusing state of direct SmartThings support, I got the functionality I wanted using IFTTT:- Install the Wink app on your phone and create an account.- Add the device and program it using your phone.  - At this point my Power Genius was actually configured correctly, but the app gave up before it could ping the Power Genius. I scratched around trying to figure out how to "reset" the Power Genius (seems impossible), but the answer was simply to pretend to program the device again, and this time the app was happy.- Using graph.api.smartthings.com, add New Device, call it "Power Genius Outlet #1" or similar, select "Simulated Switch" as the device type. Do the same for Outlet #2.- Create an account with IFTTT and add the "Wink: Pivot Power Genius" and "SmartThings" channels (and add the two simulated switches when connecting to SmartThings).- Nearly done! Create an on and off recipe in IFTTT for each simulated switch, pairing each virtual action with the equivalent Power Genius action. You should have 4 recipes in total.That's it. There is a little latency due to the IFTTT intermediary, however it has so far proved extremely reliable. The only downside is that the "Wink: Pivot Power Genius" channel appears unable to trigger actions in IFTTT, so if you manually toggle an outlet using the physical buttons on the Power Genius it will go out of phase with the SmartThings app (and you'll have to toggle twice in SmartThings to trigger the action). I have triggered the Power Genius simulated switches many times and have not noticed a single failed event.I would buy another one.
