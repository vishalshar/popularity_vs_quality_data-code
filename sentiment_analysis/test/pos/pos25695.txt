At first I had a great deal of difficulty getting the Lumisounds to work properly, while I had a Bluetooth connection for audio, no luck with the app. But: the more I use them, the more I like them.After reading the rather skimpy and incorrectly printed user manual, I  downloaded and ran the Lumisound app, not realizing that although it was the only one available, it was "Lumisound +" rather than "Lumisound". Huge difference, one is strictly Bluetooth, and the other (+) is WiFi, and in fact the product has not even been released yet. I checked the website too and found even less information,Cutting out a few more hours of following my intuition, training, and proclivity towards blindly racing down dead ends before asking for help, I was in nearly immediate and continuous email contact with Lumisound tech support and soon learned the correct way to find the right app for my device, an iPad mini 4 and possibly still under the radar- I was told to use the search for "iPhone Only" and immediately found, installed and was using the product. I have to say as good as the support is, a product in this price range should have a slightly better level of documentation to keep idiots like myself from jumping to premature and false conclusions deter true appreciation.So, after dowloading and installing the correct app, I was instantly captivated. The UI is as simple and intuitive as it gets; elegant, really. Just like you'd expect: a toggle controls the function of a big dial which in turn controls brightness and volume. I was particular impressed by how sensitive the brightness control is, you can take it to theatrical levels of precision. If that's your thing, obviously.Sizewise they approximate a BR-30 spot/flood, about 3.5 X 5. (Business-end-wise they resemble a shower head, but that's not a bad thing) The first location I had in mind are the two table lamps framing a couch, ideal for light and sound- they do tuck into an average harp and shade, but as I saw them referred to as downlight bulbs, cooling may be an issue, at the highest settings they seem to run on the warm side and burning base down tends to exacerbate that.The sound? I'd have to say so far just a notch or two above most of the other Bluetooth speakers I have tested, but not as good as the best of the best-  but here features balance price. I was pleasantly surprised to see how easily both fire up and connect once you get used to the drill- and, even better, they deliver true stereo, something I have not yet found to be easy or common. Nice.At this point I am still searching for the best location, I have found that a table lamp setting is probably not the best but just OK, although a pleasant effect is created on my two end tables by both sound and light, I found the light bounces off of the shade to provide enough light for reading. (Large text. With +225's)Clearly though, the enclosure defines the speaker. I believe now that enough care went into the design of the Lumisounds that once I get them there, there they will probably stay. I would have to see them go head to head with a competitor to tell you if they are worth the price of admission, but they are indeed quality units.
