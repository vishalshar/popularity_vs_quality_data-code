This speaker looks great and has the heft you would expect from a top range and expensive speaker so imagine how disappointed I was to get the speaker charged and paired with my iPhone 5s and then to crank the tunes and find I was deaf:(Then, thankfully my wife came into the room and quietly asked me if she could get me anything to drink.It was then I gratefully realized my hearing was fine, whew:) and that it was the Fugoo speaker that was lacking in volume.I had the volume up to 2/3 full on my iphone (loud enough to get complaints if I'm using my UE Boom/Monster Superstar/JBL Pulse/Harmon Kardon Esquire/Bose Soundlink Mini (Holy crap I have way too many of these) and my own voice when I sing along:)I had a nice chat with a customer service rep who told me they are working on firmware updates that might help out with this issue, but probably not a heck of a lot (at least they are honest:). He also told me they are working on a new device that supposed to be a lot louder and bigger too.I hope this has helped.MorryUpdate...I have now used the speaker a lot and noticed that listening to my iTunes library sounds "not so good", but streaming quality music (Apple iTunes seems to degrade the music quality quite a bit) actually sounds pretty good;)volume is still an issue but I'm much more impressed than I originally was...Another update: after the latest firmware update I'm a much happier camper... sounds great and finally loud enough!!!well done Fugoo!!!
