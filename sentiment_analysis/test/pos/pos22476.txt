My 8 year old daughter LOVES Mip!! This is a fantastic toy - we all think it's really cute. We had Mip balancing 5 iPhones, delivering treats to the dog, and dancing to her favorite tunes. The major issue we were concerned about was batteries. It lasts about 90 mins before needing a battery change. Here is what we do - bought a rechargeable battery station that holds 4 AAA batteries at a time. Bought 8 AAA rechargeable batteries so she can use 4 while the others charge. The time to charge is pretty much the same as the time they last in MIP so there is no loss of time with Mip if she wants to play continuously. This was the hit of Christmas!! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I wish Mip itself was rechargeable without having to remove the battery pack. Or ideally had 2 rechargeable battery packs so you could easily switch them out and have one charging while using the other. In the meantime our system is working well and our daughter already wants a second Mip so they can battle. Love it!
