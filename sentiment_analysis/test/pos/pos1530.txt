My son LOVES this item!!!  He is 11 and he was thrilled that he can take his game with him.  As others mentioned, it is nice so he can take it to a friend's house to play...he was bringing his laptop before that.  GREAT idea...I got it on sale before Christmas, but otherwise would be on the pricey end.  I still think it is worth it for any family with multiple kids playing minecraft and sharing computers.
