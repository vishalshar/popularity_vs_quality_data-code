This cup is great!My toddler son is constantly pulling and twisting the top off of his cups, spilling liquids in the most inconvenient places at the most inconvenient times. He CANNOT pull the top off of this one.It is also only glass and silicone so I am not worried about potential harmful chemicals that some argue are in plastics, even the bpa-free ones.It does drip a little bit when he turns it upside-down but I like the other aspects so much that it doesn't matter.
