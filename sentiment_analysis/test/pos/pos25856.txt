The good: it (usually) works! For anyone who regularly uses a qi charger, having to ensure the device is perfectly centered is a pain. This does what it claims, specifically eliminates the sweet spot as long as the qi receiving part of the device is on the pad it will charge...usually. I have noticed if 2 devices are being charged it becomes a bit more picky, even if the charging part of both devices are on the pad. Remove one device and suddenly the other device can pretty much hang off the edge and still charge. Add a second device and that doesn't fly anymore.The not so good: it looks like something from the 90s. Gold charge surface, black clunky a/c adapter with wrinkled up cord that looks like it belongs to a cheap remote controlled car. It isn't terrible but I wouldn't call it stylish. How about all black with a modern adapter? That would have made a big difference.The verdict: probably the best qi charger available but design is lacking. If you need to charge 2 devices this is a good option. If you can't stand dealing with the typical chargerÂ’s sweet spot this is also a good option. Hopefully version 2.0 is less picky when charging 2 devices and looks better!
