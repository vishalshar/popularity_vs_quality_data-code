This is so amazing. I set it up with my iphone and their app. The app synched with the Singlecue on the first try and it easily recognized my Sharp TV (not very new) and my Comcast box. The hardest part was finding a free plug. The video instructions on the app were all I used to figure out how to work it. Mostly it is intuitive. It controls my tv from my couch with my finger and it actually works really well. It is not sketchy or sort of effective. It does work and replaces my comcast remote.
