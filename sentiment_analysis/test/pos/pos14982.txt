Lightweight, good quality - perfect for backpacking. Much easier and lighter than a short toothbrush + toothpaste. Your saliva is enough to make the paste on the bristles foam up and the brush is substantial enough to hold up to vigorous brushing. I like that there's a pick in the middle (you pull the two ends apart to reveal the pick) if needed. The brush is a good length and sturdy. The floss part works as expected.
