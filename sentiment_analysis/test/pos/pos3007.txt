Knocks me right out. I work overnight and have a hard time getting to sleep because the sun keeps me up. The first time I took this I passed out within 15 minutes. When I woke up, I felt great and wasn't groggy (which is normally how I wake up). I use these on the days I work to make sure I go to sleep and I love them. They don't taste bad at all.
