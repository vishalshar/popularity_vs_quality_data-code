Really nice, easy to use bike mount.  The only complaint I have (and it's not a terrible thing) is that you have to essentially take the holder off the base to rotate it into the landscape orientation, it doesn't rotate freely like the iOttie dash mount.  I'm using it with an iPhone 5S right now, and it easily accomodates the phone and protective case, and provides excellent retention.
