Absolutely LOVE this headset. Connecting it with ps4 and XB1 is a breeze. Plug and play! Sound quality is better than my old Astro a40. The ability to mute the mic and adjust the volume levels of chat/game audio with the headphone cups is so convenient. Also the dual mic setup helps eliminate sound from the outside while making your own voice crystal clear! And the headset is stylish to boot! An absolute must buy if you're tired of the typical gaming style headphone. Only gripe is I wish Bluetooth worked with all devices not just the included dongle.
