Overall it works well, however, the sensors get loose and need to be tightened a few times during a round.  Sometimes a hassle having to carry your iPhone and be concerned about sitting on it if you are in a cart.  However, it's nice to see the distance and consistency or lack of it.I would recommend you purchase the product, but just be aware of some of the nuances.
