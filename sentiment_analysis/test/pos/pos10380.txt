Okay, I really, really wanted to like this one.  I have 2 girls and am tired of all the princess, fairy, and mermaid sets so was looking for something a little more real.  This one seemed great.  It is not overly pink.  It has cute critters.  I love the spatial/engineering aspect and my daughter loves caring for animals.  It really is a good set.  The pictures are bright and the pieces are solid.  It looks like it has a lot of play-value. But here is the big negative- they don't stick together nearly as well as they should.  Once you get the structure set up, if you just tap it or accidentally bump it, it will collapse.  Maybe the manufacturer could add slots as well as the magnets so the pieces "stick" better?  More magnets?  I don't know but even as an adult I had trouble keeping it together and it was extra frustrating for my 4 year old.  We kept trying to play but she would get mad every time it fell down. We sort of leaned them up against things or kept them flat to try to solve the problem.  I am keeping it because I can see how it might go over a little better with an older child.  But be warned, even as an adult I had some trouble.  :(Pros-Colorful, promotes STEM skills, excellent for story telling, positive feminine role models, cute sea crittersCons- Expensive, the magnetic tiles don't stick together,  magnetic accessories are tiny and will not last long.  They also do not stick to all of the tiles.  There is only 1 character which is limiting when you have 2 children.
