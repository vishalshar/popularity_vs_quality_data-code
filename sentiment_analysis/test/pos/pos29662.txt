The ASUS K501UW-AB78 functions very well as a multimedia notebook for its price.  It is an effective gaming laptop for casual gaming but it can also handle AAA titles fairly well at medium to lower settings.  The product maintains a professional and sleek look that you cannot find in most mid-range gaming laptops.  There are no glaring logos or flashing LEDs like you would find on common gaming laptops.  It is fairly lightweight (4.4 pounds) and is very thin.  The backlit chiclet keyboard is also a fine touch to the laptop.The following photos are pictures of the laptop a day after purchase.  You can see where common complaints about the lack of an IPS monitor come from in the 3rd photo.  I went ahead and opened up the laptop to add additional RAM and noticed that the current 8GB RAM is soldered but there is another slot if you wish to add more memory.  There also seems to be a empty spot for another SSD as you can see in the 4th photo.  I also noticed that the SSD capacity was actually 476GB rather than 512GB.Overall the laptop was very cost efficient and worth the money.  Even with its common gripes the laptop performed as expected.  Any minor issues were not off-putting to me in any way.
