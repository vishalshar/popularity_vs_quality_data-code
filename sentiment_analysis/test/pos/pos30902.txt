Great Call Splash is a fantastic device and the Great Call Service Subscriptions are priced great with several options. I really like the free iphone app which synchs with the Splash easily and allows me to keep track of my elderly mother from afar.  It shows where she is anywhere inside the USA - unlike other devices which only work inside a home with a home security alarm system.I definately recommend this device to be used by kids and elderly and anyone you want to keep track of - including yourself. Yes if you use one for yourself you can call-in to speak with a Rep if you are walking alone at night and want to feel a bit more secure, to request a tow truck, and more.  You can even speak directly with a Registered Nurse or a Doctor! And its unlimited depending on which service subscription you choose.Create your Great Call Splash account online and enter medical information, emergency contacts, medications, doctor and pharmacy info, insurance info and contact info of friends and relatives and more.  Easy to do but if you need help you can call and a Rep will enter the info for you while you are on the phone.  Invite anyone to get the free app for iphone or android and monitor you from anywhere. (Great for monitoring teens!) Update your info anytime.  For someone to use the app to synch to your Splash requires your authorization and a special code you would need to provide them with - otherwise the app alone will not connect to any Splash device.The only issue I had in my purchase is that the package did not include the special magnetic lanyard which is required for automatic fall detection.  When I activated the Great Call Splash and opted for the Ultimate Plan (fall detection is included in this plan) the Rep said I would need to use the Splash with the lanyard for fall detection to work.  He was shocked that there was no lanyard in the package AND had never before spoken with anyone who did not receive the lanyard.  He said the lanyard is put into the package at the factory.  The lanyard "accessory" is available for purchase seperatly for $20.00.  He shipped me one.  But because the lanyard comes with the Splash, and the one I received from this Seller did not include one, I am concerned that the one I bought on Amazon may be a fake or a refurbished one.  I would not recommend purchase from this Seller.  I do recommend purchasing directly from Great Call.  They are the same price (I did not know this when I made my purchase) and Great Call will do the initial set-up of the Splash and ship it for free.Great Call Splash sells itself and you can earn a $25.00 credit on your monthly subscription when you refer a friend. In fact the friend gets $25 off their subscription bill too!
