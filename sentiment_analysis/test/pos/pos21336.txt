I've got to say I was a little leery ordering this ...reading the reviews it just seemed too good to be true... we have a car that we just purchased sheepskin seat covers for and they were smelling up the car... leaving the windows open on a nice day still didn't dissipate the smell ...I started thinking about ozone machine which I've used in the past ....and came across this while researching and decided to give it a chance ....I was expecting it to take a couple of days but I installed it in the evening when I got it in by the next morning the smell was almost totally gone and smelled fresh !! my wife could not be happier...
