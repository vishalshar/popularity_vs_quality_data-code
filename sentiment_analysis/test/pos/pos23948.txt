i give this only 4 stars. I like the sound, quality, and look of this speaker as well as the mounting options. I mount this on my mountain bike and listen when i'm riding. So far it has withstood the terrain well. The only thing i did not like was that IT IS NOT waterproof as stated. The first one i bought, i lightly hosed it off and it went rogue. I had to return. I did buy another one and will just not get it wet.
