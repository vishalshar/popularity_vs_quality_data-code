So many reviewers complain that these didn't fit right.  The instructions on my box were covered with a label I couldn't get off, but I could read enough to see that they had a website, so I visited their website and watched enough of their videos to figure out (A) how to install them on my type of shoes and (B) how to install them with the proper tension so they wouldn't be too tight or too loose.  The whole thing took about twenty minutes from the time I opened the Amazon package to the time I walked away with my new Hickies installed.  That seems pretty good to me.A little bit about myself:  I HATE shoe laces.  People think I'm funny about this, but tying shoes is one of the few things in life that I absolutely hate.  If it were up to me, we would all just go barefoot and/or wear sandals in the summer and UGGs in the winter...anything to avoid having to sit down and tie shoes.  Consequently I have worn many pairs of shoes in my life that were either less attractive than they should have been or less healthy for my feet, just to avoid tying stupid shoes.  I know, it's a weird quirk, but that's how I am.For Christmas my wife got me a really nice new pair of Asics.  They fit great and feel great.  I love them enough to wear them all the time despite the laces.  But then I saw an ad for these Hickies and figured I'd give them a try (even with all the bad reviews).  My shoes still fit great and now they're slip-ons.  The timing has been perfect, because I recently badly injured myself and can't cross my leg to tie my shoes until I heal up.  It's great to be able to just step right into my nice shoes.(For the record, maybe I'm a nutjob and maybe I'm not.  I know it's a weird quirk, but I just really don't like tying shoes and it bugs me that they come untied at the most inconvenient time in my day.  I'm happier not tying my shoes.)UPDATE (July 2016):  I've been using these for over six months now and I still love them, but they don't last forever.  If you have used these for a few weeks/months and decide that you like them, buy another pack and keep a few in your desk drawer at work and some at home.  That way if/when one of them snaps, you'll be able to replace it with a fresh one.
