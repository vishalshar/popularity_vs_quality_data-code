I am not one to right reviews...but I LOVE THIS LAUNDRY DETERGENT!! I discovered this little gem through my Chiropractor. Every time I come in for an adjustment, she has these open back exam tops that are always incredibly soft to the touch and smell absolutely amazing! She gave me 2 pods to try and I have been hooked ever since. The trick is, to throw the pods in just below the water for about 30 seconds before tossing your clothes into the wash. They disolve quickly and clean well which I LOVE and am always complimented on the way my clothes smell! I have also purchased Grab Green's bleach alternative pods and their wet dryer sheets of which I also highly recommended!
