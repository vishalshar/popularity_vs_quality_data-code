I got my husband a Jamstik and he didn't think he would need a cover, especially since it's kind of expensive. But after wrapping it in t-shirts a few times to pack in his suitcase, he admitted a cover would be better. Now he travels with it and can practice in his hotel room, and he feels like it is protected.
