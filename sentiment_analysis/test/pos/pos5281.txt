I purchased this printer after an exhaustive review of printers within the sub 1k price range. I settled on the Robo R1 Plus for its aesthetic appeal, ability to utilize multiple filaments without jumping hoops, large print space, and its warranty and support. Im sure plenty of printers can do the same exact thing for less but I am very pleased with this purchase. I was able to print the first day I got it and already have a slew of friends looking for stuff. Being in the drone hobby theres a lot of useful things to make. I hope the machine maintains its quality and ease of use with time.
