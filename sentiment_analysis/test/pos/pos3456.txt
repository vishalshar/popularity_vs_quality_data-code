I must say, these are amazing! I was diagnosed with Young Onset Parkinson's Disease a year and a half ago, and over the the last year I have noticed a steady decline of the dexterity in my hand. Due to that and the tremor I had difficulty tying my shoes. I resorted to wearing slip on shoes for quite a while, but I did miss wearing my athletic shoes. And on the occasion when I did put them on, it took me 3 times longer than it used to to tie the laces. While looking around on amazon I just happened across this product and thought I would give it a try... Well when it arrived I was so excited to put them on my shoes and not have to tie my laces anymore... Well when I opened the package I discovered that there were 3 missing out of the pack of 14. To my dismay I could not use them at that moment. I contacted the Hickies to let them know that I was missing 3 bands, and their customer service took care of me and shipped out a new set to me. Once I got them on my shoes I was amazed at how nice they fit. and how easy it was to just slip my shoes on. They hold together spectacularly and they are even snug enough for me to not only walk around, but when I decided to try jogging they did not slip, nor make my shoe fall off. Kudos to Hickies for delivering such an awesome product.I am the facilitator for the Young Onset Parkinson's Support Group here and I am going to recommend this product to everyone in my group as it is such a time saver and will make it an easier task to put our shoes on and not bother with the laces. And also for the excellent customer service that they company has provided to me.Thank you very much and I will definitely do business with you in the future.
