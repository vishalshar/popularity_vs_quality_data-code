Brush Hero is the best thing that's happened to auto wheel cleaning in a long, long time. If you're fed up with taking too long to clean your car wheels, yet you want them to look good, Brush Hero is your answer. Forget taking your car to a car wash, having to wait and then having to PAY for it. Plus, they may not even clean your wheels to your satisfaction.  You screw the Hero onto your hose, turn the water on (it has an on-off lever on the handle).  Prepare your wheels, use your favorite wheel cleaner,turn the Hero on and let it do the work!  The brush will turn while water comes out.  You'll wonder why you didn't get this sooner! (Or where it's been all your life).  The Hero will save you scrubbing time, and it'll do a BETTER JOB CLEANING YOUR WHEELS!  Use the soft black brush for your wheels.  There is a firmer white brush, but I haven't used mine.  Ladies will REALLY appreciate the Brush Hero.  Sure, it costs, but this will pay you back in SAVED LABOR over and over!  I could go on, but I urge you to try it for yourself.  Plus, and more importantly,  the company stands behind the Hero.
