Love this gadget.  The video is VERY clear and the treat aspect has been great for getting the dog's attention and training.  We did have to move the device out of their reach as they went after it trying to get the treats out.  That was a good show to watch and the Petzi survived the attack with flying colors- nary a scratch and they couldn't get treats- their first failure at jailbreaking food in 13 years. Have recommended it to several friends with happy results too
