My wife's iphone 6 screen spiderwebbed after being dropped face first on the concrete when she was chasing after our daughter who was trying to run into the street. It slung right out of her purse. I was away at the field when it came in so my wife handled the repair. Now, let me explain about my wife's amount expertise in this type of thing. She also learned how to repair games and game systems recently and would resell them online. She has some technical knowledge of how computer boards work. Now she's no expert though. This product required no soldering, and no extra tools except a hair dryer and a gentle touch. It was simply a matter of keeping your screws from getting lost and keeping them organized.You really don't need a whole lot of skill to do this repair, honestly. The step by step walkthrough provided by iCracked on YouTube was fantastically helpful. She had to rewind a few times to fully understand exactly what he was telling her to do or to catch up because he was lightning quick with removing screws, but the tech was very knowledgeable about each part and what it did. He also gave a lot of caution on the parts that were particularly difficult or fragile.Now, let me caution, the phone has functioned up until now. She replaced it Thursday night. It is now Monday evening and it it still functioning. I will definitely post up on here if it stops working, but it still has full functionality. The screen responds extremely well, it looks just like the one the phone came with, and it was easy to install.
