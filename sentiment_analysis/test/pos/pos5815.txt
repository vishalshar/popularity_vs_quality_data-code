Ive tried the 3 different flavors and can safely say these have now become a staple food for me.  I dont care for the choco ones very much they seemed a bit bitter but Im not a fan of dark chocolate so that is a factor.  I love the other 2 thou.  Could easily sit down and eat a whole bag and it wouldnt really be that bad for you but I try to stretch them out to the recommended serving size.  I love the fact there isnt any sugar added its the reason I tried these.  I strongly suggest trying them.
