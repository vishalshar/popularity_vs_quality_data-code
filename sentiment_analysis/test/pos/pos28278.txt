I bought this for my sister and she loves it.  Oh, the entertainment our family had watching her lick her cats is something I just can't put into words right now.  Watching the cats reaction and the sounds the cats made is priceless. I am not a cat lover and I immediately had to go outside and pat my dogs on the head and they were satisfied with the affection.  My sister said the experience would have been even more pleasurable had the Cat Licki come in a variety of mouth piece flavors like chocolate or strawberry.  She may have licked even longer.  LOL.
