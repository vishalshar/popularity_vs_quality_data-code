I recently got into board games, but originally bought this for my dad who is big into board games HE LOVES it! He bought sleeves for it and everything and it's slowly becoming the first game we play when we get together to game! It's raunchy and hilarious, it's very simple to learn. SO much fun and it's an ice breaker if you're playing with new friends or people you don't know. I will for sure be looking for the expansions.
