People who suffer from chronic pain know how difficult it can be to go shopping, do housework, and even the thought of going for a walk is out of reach (especially if the weather is changing).I was not confident this product would help my chronic pain, but I was willing to give it a try.  After wearing the Quell for two weeks I stopped wearing it for two days. I am here to give you my honest my opinion. The two days were enough to convince me the product works.You will never be totally pain free, but you will experience a relief.My back still hurts, but nothing in comparison after using the Quell. I wear it 24/7 taking it off to recharge or for showers. I have arthritis through out most of my joints. I have three disc in the lower lumbar that have degenerated where the nerves are being pinched. I have two knee replacements and the benefits of the Quell is not affected by either knee.I urge you to try a Quell if you suffer from pain on a daily basis. Before wearing the Quell I could only walk (painfully mind you) a half a mile. Now in three weeks I'm walking at least five miles per day without a cane.I don't know how it works ... I just know it works for me
