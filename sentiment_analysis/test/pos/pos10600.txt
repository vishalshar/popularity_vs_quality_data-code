Can I give this more than 5 stars? Oh man, my brothers and I got this for my dad for father's day.... We really gave ourselves a gift... This thing makes amazing pizza! Don't go crazy with toppings, particularly watery/oily ones as they will make the crust too soggy & even this amazing contraption can't fix that.... But enjoy!
