These have been out for a while but finally gave it a try. I use it on a shared keyring which is helpful since I swear the keys are never in the same place twice. Really nice interface and simple to use. Definitely thinking of getting some more for various items and even thought of some ways to use them at my office. Two thumbs up from me!
