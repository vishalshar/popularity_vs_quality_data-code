Bought this after watching MKBHD's video on it. Despite the video, I still wasn't sure what to expect.  I ended up really liking the display and the functionality.  The one knock on it is that if you're planning on using it as a bluetooth music speaker, the sound quality is just okay.  The equalizer display is nice though. Overall, I'd still give it 5 stars.
