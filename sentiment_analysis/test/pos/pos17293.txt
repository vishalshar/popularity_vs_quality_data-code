Love my LEAF. Previously had Fitbit, of which I'm not a fan. They're ugly, need recharging all of the time, and not accurate in step counting. The LEAF is beautiful, tracks well, doesn't need to charge, and I get compliments on it all of the time. My only concern is the metal leaf has lifted a little away from the wood and I tend to get it caught on fabric sometimes. Otherwise, insanely happy!
