$10 for a bit of fun? Why not?Get to know the little world. This thing can be a bit of fun. The zoom works great. Take the 5 seconds to read the tips on the piece of cardboard they send you. Using the case as a stand on the phone is definitely helpful. I dunno how I'm gonna clean this thing though, but I guess I'll figure it out as I go. It can be a bit hard to know if you got the right spot (or maybe that's just me?).It could come in handy as like a jewelers loupe, or a really good magnify glass. It really magnifies things (see pics). The optics aren't fantastic by any means but for the price you pay you really get a good deal. For something with similar magnification ability, you are probably paying more than you would for this.Nonetheless, for the price you pay and the potential great tool and sciency, nerdy, inner geek comes out of you, this thing is worth it. Check out the pictures of myÂ Patriot Stellar Flash Drive, first photo is with the regular camera, and the 2nd is of the same camera with the Cell Focus Lens. // Shot with my Pixel XL phone. Note: you do have to get really close for this thing to work properly. Probably less than 1 - 1.5 inches away from your object you are trying to view.Why 4/5?It wasn't easy to attach to a camera perfectly, and no real way to know if the fit is optimal. Regardless, for what you pay and the magnification you can get for something similar would be much higher in costs.The item feels sticky on both sides, making cleaning the lens harder as it can attract dirt pretty easy (the lens itself has a sticky feel all over).Regardless, this is cheap, a fun good toy, and overall I really liked it. I don't know how long this thing will survive and if it'll work with future phones, but for $10, eh why not have some fun with it for now?
