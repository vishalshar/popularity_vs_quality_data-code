I am always looking for useful things when I play flag football. This towel has been one of the best accessories I've ever purchased. As a QB/receiver for my team I need to keep my gloves dry and fresh. The first thing I noticed about the towel was the texture, it actually helped my gloves keep their stick. It is also small, it tucks in easily and is very light weight compared to most other towels. I'd definitely add this to any football apparel.
