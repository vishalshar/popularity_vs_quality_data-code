I was somewhat skeptical before I bought this, but having tried other ways to fix my posture and help my back pain to no avail, I figured I might as well try one more. It's so comfortable. It's like having a portable chair with you that always gives you good posture and makes your back feel better. I have a job where I walk around all day, so I use this only when I'm at home, but have now started to consider bringing it around wherever I go. I would highly recommend it.
