A solid 4-star here, and would probably be a 5-star if the led panels would stay attached to my 3DR Solo. I've had one or two incidence of the lights danglin g by the wires when I land the UAV, so I probably need to do a better jon at attaching the leds, or maybe the form fitting molding design needs improvement. I make extra sure the lights are snug whenever I use them. The lights are bright, and certainly aide in complying with the whole "keep the UAV in line of sight with unaided vision". Totally makes the UAV more visible in dusk or dawn portions of the day, and arguably helps in full day light. Have not noticed any appreciable decrees in flight time due to additional power drain. Sometimes I've noticed the 3DR gumball attachment does not work when this accessory is installed, and rebooting the 3DR will eventually correct the issue. The power connector that goes to the 3DR attachment receptacle is not bad, it's functional, but kinda ungainly large.
