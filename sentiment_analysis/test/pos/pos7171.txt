This is a great projector. We have a vaulted ceiling in our bedroom and use it to watch shows instead of having a tv in our room. We just hook it up to our Apple TV and it works perfectly! We can't wait to use it in the backyard during the summer. The photo is from a movie we watched on our ceiling. It is almost as big as a movie screen.
