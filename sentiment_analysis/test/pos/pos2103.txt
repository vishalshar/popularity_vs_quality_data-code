Works as advertised, pretty happy with it! I bought altogether 6 dimmers and 3 switches, all just need one Connect hub. All works, no quality issues, seems pretty solid build, considering I'd applied some force to install some of them; my switch boxes had ton of wires and these devices are bulkier than normal switches/dimmers; looks like taking up half the switch box depth.The App is not bad, and it has its own support for Sunrise/Sunset schedule which is not yet supported by HomeKit.I am still testing, but it looks like the Scenes set up using the Lutron app cannot be see by other HomeKit apps.
