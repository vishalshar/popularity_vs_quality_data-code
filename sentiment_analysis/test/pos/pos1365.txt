By and large a very useful device, especially to keep connected while on the road.  Doing anything more than checking emails can run up the cost very quickly, very important to watch one's data usage.  It has a few quirks, such as weak connectivity at night (at least this was my experience), which can be very frustrating.  But on the whole, I would recommend it.  These days there are not too many places one would travel where internet service is hard to find, still, it can happen.  I recently stayed at two Airbnb apartments that did not have internet (chose the apartments because of their proximity to places I needed to be close to).  A very positive mention to their costumer service/technical support:  they answer emailed questions with lighting speed!
