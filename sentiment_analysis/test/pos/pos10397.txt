I purchased these sippy tops ( along with the Silikids sippy cup) so that I would have a few extra around. These are always with me @ home & on the go. Perfect for taking little ones to a restaurant! Since they no longer use a bottle, this has been the perfect in between! The top goes right over a (dry sided) cup & seals for no liquid to escape & it's strong enough that they can't pull it off! So easy to wash & bring with us again the next day!
