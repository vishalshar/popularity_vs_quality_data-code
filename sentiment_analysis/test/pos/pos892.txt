So many uses, you can pair this with a D-link camera, motion sensor, or water sensor at this time, pair it with IFTTT (If This, Then That) and there are many more possibilities. It connects to your existing wifi network easily through the D-link app. You can get push notifications sent to your smart phone when the siren is activated. I currently use this paired to a security camera for a driveway alarm using IFTTT, it activates to let me know when someone is in my driveway, my driveway entrance is hard to see from the house, this paired with my camera let's me know with an audio alert when someone is here.
