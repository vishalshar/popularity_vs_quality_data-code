I bought this great toy for my 3 1/2 year old twin nieces. They absolutely love it! The girls live in Michigan, so it is cold in the Fall. The Fuzzy Flyer is soft and small enough for them to play with inside their playroom basement in cold weather. My sister in law sent me an adorable video of the girls running all around and laughing. It is very good exercise for them. I think it is better than dancing to a video or Xbox. The kids look at a screen too much as it is.  The Fuzzy Flyer lets them play in their own way and not follow instructions on a screen. Their 6 year old big brother likes to get in on the game too! I would highly recommend this toy!
