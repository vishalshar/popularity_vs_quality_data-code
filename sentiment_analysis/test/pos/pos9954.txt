It was either this product or a similar one I saw on kickstarter a couple of years ago and I thought this was a great idea but for $15, at the time, to buy a strap that cost just as much as a pair of ear buds seemed ridiculous.Since then I've taken up running and wanting my tunes or audiobooks with me.Also, I've tested and reviewed 30+ bluetooth headphones.Yet I keep coming back to wired headphones and earbuds, but never found a good solution between having them in my ears, leaving one earbud out and one in or just having them around my neck in between listens. This solves all that.+ Nice solid strap+ I put the clip right below the remote on the right-side and then make it even on the left and it hangs well on my neck.+ The extra weight allows me to take these running without my earbuds or this strap flopping all over the place.+ The black goes with most clothing so it is the right color for meOVERALL: I don't know why I cared these cost the same as a pair of low end earbuds...the options I get by having them far out weight the small cost. Worth checking out!
