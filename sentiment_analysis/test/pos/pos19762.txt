I got this recently to replace a Flash Drive that I had lost the protective cap to a lomg time ago that was only 2MB.  This was the answer for me.  Easy to use, the cover slides down to cover the connector and it is small in size.  I read many of the reviews complaining about the cover not working right but I have had no problems whatsoever.  Also Amazon's price couldn't be beat.  I would not hesitate to buy again if I ever need another flash drive.Dane-Elec 8 GB USB 2.0 Flash Drive DA-ZMP-08G-CA-N4-R (Black)
