Great concept, some flaws with execution.1. There should be an option to hardwire the device instead of going through charge / recharge cycles with the battery which is annoying. I want something that I can wire up and that works on it's own without somewhat regular maintenance (the battery lasts a week maybe, often less).2. The wire is too short, I have tile around the toilet and didn't want to drill into it. I know I could've stuck it on but don't think that would hold up in the long run.3. The sensor activates even if you're just taking a piss. There should be some sort of time-delay, it activates 30 seconds after it detects your presence.4. If the device was hardwired one could conceivably have a much smaller sensor making it visually appealing , right now with the battery it's massive and well ugly.I'm still rating it four stars since it does do the job it advertises and reasonably well at that.
