The Zesty Nacho flavor of these Kale Chips taste just like cheese without the guilt!! They are vegan, gluten free and made with non GMO certified ingredients. I absolutely love to sprinkle them on top of homemade mac and cheese or a sweet potato! I have also been able to find them in my local Starbucks which has been incredibly convenient! One of my favorite flavors! I received free product for my opinion.
