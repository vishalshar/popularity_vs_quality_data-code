Interesting design. Bought it to use on a drive up to sf. Usually I cannot really sleep in the car the pillow supported my neck enough to actually fall asleep on the ride in. Also didn't keep me too warm making it uncomfortable. It is an expensive pillow but if it can help you sleep and you can wash it, it's worth it. Would buy again
