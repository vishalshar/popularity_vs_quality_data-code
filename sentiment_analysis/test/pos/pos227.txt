I have become increasing aware of how chemicals make their way into the body through the skin.  Most deodorants are loaded with unhealthy chemicals.  At the same time we are expected to NOT smell like human beings.  What to do?  Primal Pit Paste Deodorant (I'm not wild about the name) provides respectable protection while using harm-free ingredients.  As a health care professional, I work closely with people and must be careful about scent.  This has worked well for me in hot and cold weather.  On hotter days a second application may be necessary.  But I would much rather do that than take a chance on slowly poisoning myself with commercial deodorants.
