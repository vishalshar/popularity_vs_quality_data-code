When I originally purchased this item, I had no idea that it had been on Shark Tank.  After seeing it on Shark Tank via Hulu, I decided I should write this review so you don't waste your money.  I purchased this product here on Amazon a few months ago.  The reason I purchased it was because I thought it would be so great to not have to turn on the lights to go to the bathroom at night when I'm half asleep. The idea of this product is solid, but it's design is screwed. First of all, it won't STAY on the bowl. The suction cups wouldn't stick, so most of the time I'd be picking it up off the floor and reattaching it to the bowl. Touching something attached under the toilet seat grosses me out and in turn I'd end up turning on the light to wash my hands. Kinda defeats the purpose, doesn't it? Second of all, the batteries wore down completely after one day of use because the motion detector DOESN'T work right. So it lit up my bowl ALL night long and wore out the fresh batteries I had just put in the product the day prior. I finally gave up on the dang thing. I hope "Mr. Wonderful" is happy with the $19.99 I wasted on this product because I am still peeing in the dark.Updated:  I am updating this review because IllumiBowl sent me a new product to replace the faulty version I had originally reviewed here.  The latest version of this product works MUCH better.  I have had it installed for about a month with zero issues.  The way that the Illumibowl product adheres to the toilet has changed.  No more suction cups!  The product hangs over the side of the toilet and turns on with motion detection.  I've had the product installed in our master bathroom for about a month now and it is working flawlessly.  It comes on at night when it detects motion and then turns itself "off" when the motion is no longer detected.  I left the light color in its default setting where the color changes randomly.  This has worked perfectly.  Where previously I had problems with it staying lit too long or not turning off at all and wearing out the batteries--- this is no longer a problem. The light simply goes on when motion is detected and then turns off when its not.  The instructions suggested installing Illumibowl facing the doorway so that it can "see" you moving.  I installed it as directed and it works just fine. Based on the improvements in how Illumibowl performs, I have decided to upgrade my rating to a "5"!
