I love this product!  It has eliminated 12 chipmunks in my wife's garden.  Sorry - but they were eating my wife's garden - unacceptable after all the work she does.  Now that it is getting colder in New York,  I have brought it inside and it has killed 6 mice so far!!  So easy to use and the battery has last over 2 months.  When red light is blinking - dump critter in garbage and then set-up for next kill.
