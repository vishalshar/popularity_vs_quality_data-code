Works as advertised. I have yet to actually lose my keys (knock on wood), but have confidence that they could now be found with this handy little device. I cannot yet comment on battery life, but I love the fact that I can replace the battery myself when necessary. Much smaller and better form factor than similar devices I have tried in the past.
