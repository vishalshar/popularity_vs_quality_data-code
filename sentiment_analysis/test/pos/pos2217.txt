I like it a lot but there are a few minor problems with it, it doesn't like to stick to textured walls as much as I want and most wood surface it is not okay with, it is great in my car though I have the navigation option but the wanted me too pay 300$ to update the maps so now I just stick it to usually right next to the speedometer and I'm good
