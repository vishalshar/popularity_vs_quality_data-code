I bought 2 pair of these about 1 month ago. 1 for me and the other for my honey, who never seems to have his reading glasses with him!First I love mine, I have been wearing them daily since I received them. I now can also lay in bed on my side and watch tv without the ear piece pushing the lens off my eyes to I can't watch a movie on my iPad! I know sounds crazy but it is what I like to do!Second I can rub the corner of my eye while leaving these on, again sounds stupid but it is amazing to be able to do that without thinking about it!I have a normal width and bridge height to my nose and they stay on very well. I can easily turn my head, lightly shake my head, look down and up and they do not fall off.However I have learned that I can't drink hot coffee or eat a sandwich with them on apparently because I use too much muscle movement in the face area and then...yes they do fall off, but it makes me laugh when it happens because as another reviewer said there is very little warning when this happens. I have had them fall off in the garbage can and right into a pile of gravy ( which washed off easily) but that happened I think because I was in the kitchen cooking for a period of time and didn't reset the glasses onto my nose properly!They have a very small rough surface on the part of the nose area to help grip to your skin and while it is there I really haven't felt that it has affected my skin at all.Now onto my forgetful MAN... who never buys or wears his own glasses and is always taking and breaking mine! He LOVES his, he wears them, he knows where they are, because he likes them and thinks they are neat! He even puts the little case in his wallet and BRINGS his glasses to town with him! So for me this is WONDERFUL!!!Now being a man his nose is larger and broader than mine, but his seem to fit him well and they stay in place for him. However he doesn't wear his for long time periods that I do.We also love that they are frameless and so easy to look over the top and then right back to what you are reading without any effort or visual impairment.They are also so light you forget they are on your face and the bridge of my nose doesn't get sore anymore!I have noticed that mine are already starting to get fine scratches in the lenses, nothing too bad yet but keep in mind I take, carry and wear these glasses everywhere and other lens scratch also.We also own a business where we are in close contact with a lot of customers who always comment when I set these on my nose and I have so much fun telling others about them and letting them try them on.
