I have been using the AnyMote app for years and conversed extensively with the (friendly and helpful) developers. I have multiple custom remotes and macros set up to work with my devices. My phone is an Android with a built in IR blaster, so getting an Home was a low priority until I purchased an Amazon Echo.Cool things:+ The Home works well with the Echo. The voice commands may be a little clunky ("Echo, tell AnyMote to __________"), but that is a function of how the trigger words must be defined in Echo's Skills API.+ The Home works quite well with my girlfriend's iPhone which lacks the glorious IR Blaster of my Android device. It finally allows her to control the television (as I don't leave remotes laying around) via her phone or voice.+ The Home is stylish and minimalist. I detest clutter. Mine sits alongside the Echo Dot. They could nearly be twins.+ The App is extremely customizable (see attached), has an endless supply of features (Widgets! Macros! Web Commands!), and is constantly being updated to work with more devices.Limitations:- The AnyMote must be connected to a phone or tablet via BlueTooth instead of directly to the web via WiFi.- The Home is limited by Line of Sight. This is more of a limitation of my environment and my hatred of leaving devices visible. I would love it if IR leads could be attached directly to devices that I want to control (e.g. the Roku attached behind my TV).Overall, I'm very happy with the device and plan to purchase a second one in the near future. The benefits and convenience far outweigh the understandable limitations.
