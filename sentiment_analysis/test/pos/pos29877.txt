I just received this kit a few days ago and was very interested in installing it right away. I had a 2 gang set of dimmer switches in my home theater in a converted basement next to my wife's craft area. One switch controlled my recessed movie lighting and the other was for the craft area. This should be a simple replacement of switches and actually was up until the realization of the wall plate. I must say the wiring was a simple substitution for anyone able to follow instructions but I soon cam to realize I would need a 2 gang wall plate instead of these individual single wall plates in the kit. Also, since the Lutron wall plates are "screwless" I could not use my existing wall plate which only allowed for 4 screws directly to the box inside the wall. A quick run to Home Depot took care of that and I finalized the installation in the wall.The next issue was adding the switches/remotes to the enclosed wireless bridge through use of the Lutron app. I plugged in the power unit and Ethernet cable to my router and followed the steps in the Lutron app which I had previously downloaded. The phone connected with the bridge and signaled it was updating the software. Unfortunately it continued to show a spinning circle for a half hour where is the point I gave up. I found a potential solution online in the Lutron community forum which was to say to reboot the bridge and my phone and retry opening the app. This proved successful and all was connected. The remotes could be used without any problems.My intention is to link up the Alexa Dot that I have on pre-order to  use voice commands for my lighting. I do have an Echo unit upstairs for general purpose and I added that to the system which was easy and the voice commands work well. Once I have the Echo Dot it will be placed in the mancave for voice control. I would have given this rating 5 stars except for the stumble with the wall plate and difficulty in connecting the bridge but all was able to correct without too much trouble.
