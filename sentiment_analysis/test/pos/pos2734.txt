Bought this speaker and got it yesterday, sound quality is better than the UE boom, it may not be as loud but I'd rather have quality over quantity any day.  I had also purchased the Polk Camden Square, I have been a Polk guy for years but that was a major let down.  Not worth the money by any means.  Back to the Fugoo Tough, I knew just from trying to open the packaging that this would be built well!  The thing looks bomb proof, and easily fills my house and garage with good quality sound, I would highly recommend.  I bought it to use around the camp fire, in the camper etc and no doubt this will be awesome for it!!
