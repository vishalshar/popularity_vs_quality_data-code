Final piece to our baby room monitoring arrived today.  As with other dlink products (wireless babycam and smart plug) setup was a breeze.  Downloaded mydlinkHome app and was quickly able to add devices and love how it will send me notifications when motion is detected.  I found that the range of detection was good and love the fact that I can adjust the sensors sensitivity.
