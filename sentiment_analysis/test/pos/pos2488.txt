Now I've only had this for a few days so I can't speak to its long term usage but I can say as of now I am amazed and impressed by what it can do. I am a long time collector and owner of guitars.  I have 12 I think acoustic and electric a vintage dobro 2 lap steels and a Spanish classical. All well maintained and several pretty old. I play in different tunings and believe me it has been a process to keep them all tuned. Well not anymore thanks to Roadie. After a small learning curve I am having so much fun  This cool tool has made my life soooo much easier.  I'm not sure the point of Roadie if you only have one or two instruments unless you are an idiot and can't tune for s*** but if like me you own multiple guitars mandolins etc this is a godsend. Thank you folks for making this amazing tool
