I bought this for Christmas, along with an Oculus Rift (and an ASUS gaming computer to make it all run). I can't say enough good things about the VirZOOM + Oculus Rift. I have not been a big fan of stationary bikes or treadmills - prefer to be outdoors - but it really is very motivating to be biking in the VR environment -- racing other cars, passing other cyclists, etc. It makes the time goes by really fast, and I get a great workout!! When I first started using the Oculus Rift, I occasionally felt a little bit of motion queasiness, but I got used to it, and now I don't notice it at all. Humans are surprisingly adaptable. I highly recommend this exercise bike with VR games as part of your exercise routine.The bike is also lightweight and I've moved it in front of the tv to pedal during tv shows, so that's a great added flexibility.
