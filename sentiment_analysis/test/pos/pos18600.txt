Formerly used a Hue starter kit in Australia. Moved to US and bought this bulb as a first start to getting home automation here.For the bulb the color shift ability from white to amber is nice and the wifi connectivity was fairly easy if you are used to setting up devices by swapping to temporary networks. I used my iPhone for the whole process and was pleased that whilst a little slow the app actually managed swapping my phone back to my normal home network at the end. The bulb brightness is great with no concerns swapping out the previous incandescent to this one. It's base is solid and a little heavier than I expected.The iPhone app UI is a little easier to control than the Hue one and it's very responsive on the local network. Hooked the light up to my Echo and found the interface to be a little awkward but might just need some getting used to. Resetting my password to get cloud access felt a bit weird but it's all setup now. The Apple watch UI and dashboard widgets also give you the quick access to light control.I did notice that Geo fencing is not built in unlike Hue but the same thing can be achieved by hooking up IFTTT.If you aren't looking for major color changing this bulb is a great starting point.
