Recently bought this case because I hate bulky cases and i absolutely love this case! Battery capacity is great for the thinness of the case and the feel is great too. Only issue I have with the case is I wish the top band was a little more durable but luckily the company is very good about replacing it if it does break. Maybe in future models it can be made of metal or something. Overall the case is a great case. In fact, I have recommended it to many of my friends and family. I never write product reviews so for me to write this review really means I like the product!
