With recent firmware updates that are streamed from the phone to the device (the latest update at the time of writing was released in October 2016) has made the lock very reliable so disregard any reviews you may have read from a year or more ago.I've been using the lock for around a year now and haven't had any issues. I have auto-lock and auto-unlock enabled, so a minute after the lock is opened it will close by itself again. Obviously you don't want to close the door behind you if you don't have your phone/key as if you stay outside too long it will lock you out, but that isn't any fault of the lock as some doors will also lock behind you, so I am in the habit of keeping the door slightly ajar when going outside to check the mail.The auto-unlock feature will unlock the door when you come home and using geo-fencing, this works every time for me as well and I can arrive home and walk straight inside. Note that you will need to move at least 20m from the house before it will register as you being away and then auto unlock when you get back in range. If I come in through the garage door then the door will auto lock itself after a minute anyway.The unit itself is big but not overly large considering some electronic locks can be tall and skinny and take up a good chunk of the door. I like the fact that the exterior of the lock stays as the original that you currently have so the presence of device stays low key for those outside. It takes 4 AA batteries and they last forever (one set lasted me an entire year).The lock opens up a new world of freedom and lets you do things like- Walk straight out of the house with your phone and go for a run and then come back inside without needing to fumble with keys or locks as it does the locking and unlocking for you.- Peace of mind to know that if the door is shut then it's locked (handy for those that forget to lock the door at night)- Unlock the door for someone from the couch from your phone (provided the lock is in range)- Give someone guest access to lock and unlock the door from their phone.
