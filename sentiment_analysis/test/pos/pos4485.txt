I originally bought one of these from Amazon in October.  The TarDisk devices Amazon was selling back then couldn't be "peared" (which isn't the case now).  It added an additional 128GB of storage as a separate drive in addition to the 128GB internal SSD.  It fit perfectly and blended right in with the body of my MacBook Air, nothing sticking out or getting in the way.  Seems to work well.  Great customer service, too!
