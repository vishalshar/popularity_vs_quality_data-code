I got this a few days ago, and so far (when full) this cup will NEVER top over granted you don't purposely hit it hard enough. But, the straw it came with broke almost instantly. it's a cheap plastic straw, but otherwise this cup is amazing! I always tip over my glass or cup but not anymore with the genius suction cup idea.UPDATE: do not dish wash! It isn't good for the design. Also, I don't understand the problems with the people who have it 1 star. I got the vortex purple and it works fine. THIS REVIEW IS LEGIT I DID NOT GET A DISCOUNTED PRICE I am a human being also.
