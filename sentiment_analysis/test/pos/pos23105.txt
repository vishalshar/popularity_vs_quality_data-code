When upgrading your phone you often forget that you will also have to upgrade its accessories - not the case with this car mount. I have a Nexus 6p and this holds my phone perfectly without pressing any buttons. I live in Florida and we can hit 105f here in the Summer so there is always a concern about these holders melting on the dash - this guy has withstood the hottest July on record and is still kicking strong.
