The hubby travels a lot for business - which means lots of hotel stays throughout the year.  This was the perfect solution to the trouble in eating in the hotel room!  When you travel a lot, you don't want to have to go out for two or three meals a day.  Often he purchases snacks and things for breakfast for the week and keeps them in the mini fridge.  This is just the right thing for that cup of yogurt or microwave meal without the need for finding or buying disposable utensils.  It's easy to keep packed and there whenever you need it.
