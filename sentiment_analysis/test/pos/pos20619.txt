I just Love it, accurate Tones or as close as you can get, then tweak to your liking, way to easy now!!! and the ipad Android interface is just way to cool, play you own music thru it then play guitar along!! Plus you can slow down the track and still be in key to catch those tricky riffs! I owned about every new and old amp out there and I can say this is the best and a keeper! And yeh it made out of plastic, maybe not good for gigging, but be careful with it and so what...put it in your own car and be careful is all. beautiful in the home also! looks like furniture or an awesome bluetooth speaker, music played thru it is superb!
