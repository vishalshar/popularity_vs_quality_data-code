Toughest phone, solid features, sharp as a KNIFE beautiful camera quality, and a fraction of the price of the big names.  On my second one and only because I dropped the first in a gutter of water in February... and it kept chugging until August, with the only defect from that drop being no one could hear me speak on the phone itself, i had to have on a bluetooth for them to hear me.  But considering other phones would have been totally unusable or glitching madly after that, that is amazing!  I tried to buy a temporary Blue Studio phone and the camer sucked, was chunky whereas this is large and slim profile without being flimsy.  Comes with a protective case which i find thoughtful.  Love love love this phone.  AND it's dual sim so people like me who are from outside the country and travel to one or two certain ones very often, don't have to lose contact with home based folks when gone, and don't have to keep track of who has the foreign number or not.  It's great stuff.
