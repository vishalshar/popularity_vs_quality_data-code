If you are serious about your brushes lasting a long, long time - you need to spend the $6 on these.  I teetered on if it was required, but they're making a huge difference in the shape of my brushes. I am someone who tends to use a heavy hand with some of my brushes, and using the brush guards after cleansing makes them look BRAND new again... back to that perfect tapered end. The shipper notified me of when they'd be arriving and I love them! I may even purchase a 2nd variety pack soon!
