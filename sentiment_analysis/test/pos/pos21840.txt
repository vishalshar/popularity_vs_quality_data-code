I put this on as soon as I got them. I want to cry. For a bit now I have been suffering from peripheral edema. It makes my feet swell terribly. Bit I can't like a lot of people stay off my feet. These hickies allow more circulation and actually feel like I am wearing slippers. Now my footwear feels comfortable to me. But them. I know I will be buying more for sure...
