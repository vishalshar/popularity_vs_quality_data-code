OK, I have mixed feelings about this cut-in pail after using it extensively during a whole house repaint.First, the good stuff;It seems to be nearly indestructible, being made of a very sturdy plastic.The magnet holds firmly to the ferrule of any brush that I tried it with.If you wrap your hand around it, and let the handle drape over the back of your hand, its very comfortable to hold, even for a long time.It is, as claimed, virtually dripless.The pour spout is handy when you are done, to pour unused paint back out.Now, some things Im not completely thrilled about;Its harder to clean than most of my paint tools. Paint dries up under the lips of the dripless flanges and is hard to get to when cleaning up. Also, the plastic this bucket is made of is not as smooth and shiny as my plastic roller tray for instance. Dried on latex all surface primer sticks to the matte surface of this bucket and requires more scrubbing to get off, whereas it just pops and peels off the smooth shiny vinyl of my paint tray.The narrow bottom of this bucket makes it very tippy when it is low on paint, especially if you have a brush stuck onto the magnet. So, when you set it down to refill it while working it is really easy to tip over as the paint is poured in unless you very carefully pour dead center. I will admit that the narrower bottom makes a smaller amount of paint still sit up high enough to give good brush loading though, so perhaps thats the design intent.With no wiping lip directly across from the handle, you have to turn your hand every time after you load the brush to wipe it. The natural motion is to pull the brush out of the front of the bucket while painting. The picture on the Amazon description page even shows a painter holding it this exact way, but with no lip there, its less comfortable for the long job to turn your hand every time to wipe the brush.So, after a lot of use, I give it 4 stars. Super good quality, very well made, and very comfortable to hold while paining. It is, indeed, virtually dripless.  In any case, I found it way better than the typical cheap cut-in buckets from the big box store.
