Most interesting use is cooking on my electric stove top, and having gee-whiz moments seeing how hot appliances are, the heat escaping from blankets, from the garage, and just seeing footprints. Constantly amazes people that see it. I thought I could use it to find poor insulation spots. I envisaged seeing the framing of the structure behind the wall, but the reality is that an interior wall spreads out the heat pretty well and instead only shows "this corner is 1 degree colder than this corner" so it is good info, just not very impressive.
