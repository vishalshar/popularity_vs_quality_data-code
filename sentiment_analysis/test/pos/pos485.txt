We have three cats and two ScoopFree Ultra Litterboxes, and they require litter crystals.  We generally get either these ScoopFree two-packs, or Just the Crystals two-packs depending on which is less expensive.  They really do help with the smell and hygiene, and I prefer them to traditional clay litter.
