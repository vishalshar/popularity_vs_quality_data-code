I LOVE my new remodeez! They absorb odors and moisture brilliantly. My teenage son has many stinky sneakers and now I can enter my mudroom without being assaulted by their smell. If you have teenager or athletes or any other family member with shoes that are less than pleasantly scented these are the product for you! I also placed them in my front loading washing machine since a stale odor can build in there and overnight it was dry and neutral scented. LOVE this product!!
