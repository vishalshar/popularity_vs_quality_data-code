I own both the IllumiBowl and the GlowBowl.  The IllumiBowl hooks on the bowl with suction cups and they tend to not stay put no matter how clean the bowl is.  The GlowBowl simply hooks over the rim with a stiff wire hooked to the LED light and is a much more efficiently installation.  As far as the lighting the IllumiBowl has a more subtle lighting program than the GlowBowl.  If I had to choose one or the other to repurchase I would have to go with the GlowBowl.
