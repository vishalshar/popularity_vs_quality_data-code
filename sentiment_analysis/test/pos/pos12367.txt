I'd give the Conductive PLA 4.5 stars if I could.  It's a bit pricey, but I'm only using it for small limited prints. It worked perfectly for an adaptive stylus I printed: http://kfkdesigns.com/stylus/I followed the manufacturer's recommendations & cranked up the print temp (basically treated it like ABS) & it printed fine on my Simple Metal.  I also used a heated bed, just to prevent unwanted warping.I've noticed two downsides to the filament: (1) reduced layer adhesion (ever at the higher print temps) which results in parts a little more brittle than standard PLA, (2) when switching to a different filament, black residue remains in the hotend and discolors the new filament for about 30 minutes of print time, even after using a cleaning filament.However, I can easily overlook/work around these issues for the conductive benefit.
