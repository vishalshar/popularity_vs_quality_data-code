I bought this headset to replace my Turtle Beach 500 that broke. Surprise right? I bought these specifically because they were constructed with metal. I didn't want to have another set of headphones break and I was willing to pay a bit more for something that I hope will last for a long time.I have used these headphones for a couple of weeks now and I have not had any issues. I'm honestly a bit shocked that they aren't more expensive, but I guess since its amplified stereo instead of surround sound they couldn't justify pricing them higher. I have used the headset for playing games, streaming movies and tv show, and listening to music with no issues. They work amazingly well.The sound is pretty good (I'm not an audiophile), but the fit is what I'm loving the most. I've worn these headsets for hours at a time and they don't hurt or cause my ears to sweat. When I first saw the padding in person I thought that they would make my ears hurt after a bit but not at all. They seem to have to perfect amount of cushioning material on the cups for me. This is a bit plus for me because the 500s sucked after awhile. Especially after they broke.I would and have recommended this headset to my buddies. If these last for a good long while then this will be the only company I buy gaming headsets from as long as they are in business.
