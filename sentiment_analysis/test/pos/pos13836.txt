This tea is very aromatic, it's as if someone has steeped flowers  in a tea pot.  I like to have my tea with milk/creamer but have tried it both ways to compare. I normally use pre-bagged tea so it can steep in my tea the whole time for max infusion.  I paused to take a sip of my jasmine tea ( 1pack)to reflect on the taste. The tea really taste and smells like Jasmine... so much so that it reminds me of tree on the walk way. You def won't miss the taste even with one pack. I normally have two. It also has somewhat of a bitter taste to me, not in a bad way but kind of hard to describe. I don't mind it heck, I might even like it. Ohh maybe the taste is like... have you ever had one of those sugar substitute? Boom, There you go. It's easy for clean up just pour in mug and trash the packet. The tea crystals easily dissolve which is nice and leaves you with no messy dripping bag to toss. I wish it came in a jar and I could spoon out the crystals .  That would be a bit more eco-friendly than a bunch of packets and then you can measure your dosage out. I'm not sure if I would buy again but I did like. I have the multi/sampler/variety pack, whichever its was call. All of the teas have a present flavor.
