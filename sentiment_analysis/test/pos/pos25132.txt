The revues left previously by N. Wood and jwride pretty much sum up the "Good, Bad & Ugly" on this Rokform iPhone 6 case. The positives are obvious, so my revue will not be redundant in that regard but rather I'm only going to address the negative aspects which directly affect me and possibly others. First, be warned that this Rokform case is HEAVY! The Rokform website claims the weight is 2 oz... Au Contraire! The case in it's most minimal configuration without either insert installed weighs 2.5 oz. Add either insert (RMS or magnet only) with the magnet installed and it weighs 3.3 oz. The iPhone 6 plus itself weighs 6.1 oz. (6.07 oz. to be exact) so the total weight with the magnet and either insert is 9.4 oz. or a little over a half a pound! Until you heft a 1/2 lb. iPhone 6 plus you won't appreciate how heavy this really is. To be fair this is the price you pay for ultimate protection of the iPhone 6 plus which the Rokform case does deliver.My biggest complaint is the obvious lack of quality control exhibited by Rokform as evidenced by N. Woods experience and my own as well. When I first attempted to install the case on my iPhone 6 plus I couldn't believe how difficult it really was. The directions say to start by engaging the long edge of the case first, and continue from there to engaging the short side next. This was impossible for me and here's why: The milled slot on the long edge of the aluminum outer case was completely misaligned with the raised "tab" on the inner rubber case that is supposed to engage with the slot. I'm attaching a photo of this problem to show this.I'm assuming the rubber inner cases are all coming from the same mold and therefore are identical, so the problem as I see it is an error in the CNC machining of the aluminum case. It's highly doubtful that this error is a "one of" problem just seen in my case, I'm betting there is a bad batch of aluminum outer cases from a bad production run. I was finally able to install the case on my iPhone with great difficulty by starting with the short side first, and engaging the long side after that. However having done that the long edge of the aluminum case would not lay flush with inner rubber case because of improper engagement due to the interference fit due to the misalignment. This to me is NOT acceptable for a case costing $100.00!I haven't decided at this point how I'll be resolving this. I hate to have to deal with Rokform's customer service as evidenced by N. Woods experience that took weeks to resolve. I will call them to bring this to their attention, and If Rokform can resolve this in a timely manor to my satisfaction I'll keep the case. Otherwise I'll be returning my Rokform case to Amazon for a refund.==================================================UPDATE: 3/2/15First I have to say Rokforms customer service is first class! I contacted them via their website support ticket system on 2/25/15 (the same day I left my original Amazon revue), and received an email response about 4 hours later. After pointing them to my Amazon revue and discussing my problem with them via email they offered to send a replacement case which arrived today (3/2/15). Problem solved! They were even nice enough to throw in a few extra self adhesive mounting magnets as well! Also the carbon fiber insert is no longer held in by tape but rather is glued in which is an improvement. I have changed my original 3 Star revue to 5 Stars to reflect Rokforms excellent customer service, and also to express my satisfaction knowing I have a Bomb Proof iPhone 6 plus case to protect my iPhone from my active rough and tumble lifestyle. Thanks Rokform!
