I am a big fan of this cup, I have a couple of them. I love that it is an actual glass inside. It so easy to clean, doesn't have too many parts or holes where liquids can collect and grow mold. And eventually we won't use the top and it's an easy to hold glass. The aesthetics are great, it's fun, and it makes kids feel like a grown up.
