I primarily use this as a bluetooth speaker with my phone/laptop and was surprised at how loud it can get! Easily fills the room with music without any distortion (I'm picky about this). To switch to the record player mode all you have to do is flip a switch. I had never used one before and it was super easy to figure out. The modern look of it has received a lot compliments from my friends, its definitely a conversation piece.
