I'm one of the most clumsy people I've ever met. So, after many years of spilling my drinks repeatedly, my mom found this cup and blight it for me. The cup is great. It's well made and doesn't sweat. On smooth surfaces, it is very hard to tip over, but not impossible. An accidental bump, you're OK. Hitting it with your hands as your racing for something, you might have an issue, but it still works pretty well. It would be amazing if it worked on not smooth surfaces.
