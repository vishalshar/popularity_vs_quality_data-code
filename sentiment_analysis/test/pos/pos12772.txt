Great case so far. Best part is that it uses your original lightning cable so you don't need to find a micro USB like other battery cases. Looks just like a regular iPhone case but with the added benefit of the battery. Cant beat this battery case for the price. Head to the Thin Charge website before purchase to get an extra 15$ off on the black version.
