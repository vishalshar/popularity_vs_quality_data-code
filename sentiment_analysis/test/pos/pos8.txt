Makes excellent, consistent and tasty beer!  And it's just damn fun to use. I got it as a gift for my HusbandÂ’s birthday, He has already brewed two batches of beer with the Pico. It could not have been easier, 10 days from grain to glass! The beers have turned out excellent and he couldn't be happier. If you love beer in general I would recommend the Pico Brew as your next investment. It is easy to use and is ready for you to drink in at least 10 days. Want to entertain family and friends this product would be the perfect addition to any kitchen or home bar.The clean up is very easy as well :)
