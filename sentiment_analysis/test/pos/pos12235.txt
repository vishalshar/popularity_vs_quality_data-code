I bought the turkey instead of the chicken by mistake, but when it arrived I was hopeful my fussy cat would like it.  I don't use it as treats but crumble the pieces up to top off his Weruva Paw Licking Chicken.  He never knew the difference.  I like the turkey better because it crumbles easily.  I crumble up a container full to have as topping for his wet food (can't eat any kibbles). I call it "frosting" & he expects his turkey frosting on his food.  Just a pinch or two on top of his food satisfies him.  I would not try to break up the pieces as small treats because they crumble too easily.  For a dog, breaking the pieces in two would be doable but not for cats.
