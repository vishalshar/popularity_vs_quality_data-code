My Android phone is a little old and I had to upgrade the OS to run it, but having done this it works just fine.  A little hard to use at close range, but it just takes a little getting used to.  Nice features in the app including side-by-side visible/IR images, POI temp readout, and probably many more that I haven't needed yet.  I like this product very much, and would certainly recommend it.  It's not a toy.  It appears to be technically very sound.  We now use it for analytical thermography,  Depending on the color palette used, a display of the color vs temperature would be nice.  Incredible value for money.  Specs far exceed FLIR, which cannot register the higher temperatures that we need to measure.
