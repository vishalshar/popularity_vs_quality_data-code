I had an eyn iPhone case for my 5s. I loved it! Then I upgraded my phone so of course I had to have another eyn phone case. The only difference I've found is this case is extremely slick. My last one had a rubber coating that kept it from sliding out of my hand. This one does not. I just assumed it would. That's my fault, not the company's. I didn't see anywhere the outside material would come in different textures. Oh well. I'll just have to be more careful! Love this case anyway!!
