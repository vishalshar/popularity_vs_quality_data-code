Sphero 2.0 is amazing! I'm a 27 year old elementary school gym teacher, and I take Sphero to work almost every day. I use him as a reward incentive for the kids, who absolutely love him. They treat him as if he were alive, too, and not just a toy. They know that they can't control him until they earn it but they ask me if they can play with the physical ball, itself. I told them, "Sure but it doesn't really roll like a regular ball." They didn't care. They took Sphero and ran along the playground handing him off & sliding down the slide with him on their lap. My neices (3 & 6) at home also thoroughly enjoy him; they think he's alive and always ask me if they can play with "my friend" when they come over. They know when his light goes off he's asleep & they try to be very quiet around him and lift and move him slowly onto a couch pillow. Sphero can really take a beating, too. When I first got Sphero, I was worried about scratches and falls thinking that even if no physical damage occurs, surely his insides would be damaged with all the shaking and jostling. Not true. Sphero has been thrown (underhanded, of course), inadvertently kicked and has even taken a fall from almost 3 feet up onto hardwood flooring and still kept right on rolling without skipping a beat. He's scuffed halfway to hell but I really don't mind anymore. That being said, one thing Sphero cannot endure is mistreatment. Just yesterday, my students were playing with Sphero on the gym floor when a herd of 5th graders came running in and swarming the place. Poor Sphero got trampled and now his shell is cracked open a good halfway around. Sphero still turns on and all of his mechanics work just fine, a true testament to his durability, but I know he can no longer take a good fall & I can forget about his waterproof feature, which the kids thought was amazing (they enjoyed watching him swim through deep puddles). I ordered another Sphero without hesitation, as I have no doubt of the quality of this product. The kids are also very excited to meet Sphero's cousin Ollie next week. :)R.I.P.
