First things first, because they don't exactly advertise this THE FREE SERVICE SUCKS. It's not even really an option at all. So the camera itself is great, I love it. Looks fantastic, the video is sharp and has sound, it's just spectacular. But here is the gotchaya, they say that they offer paid and free service... the paid service is pretty reasonable, something like $60 a year if you pay in full for 15 days worth of recordings and they have more expensive ones too if you want. But the free one is only 2 hours--- not two hours worth of saved video, but just 2 hours worth of recording. So if somebody steals a package off your doorstep at 1pm and you don't realize it was stolen until you get home from work at 6pm, you're sht out of luck. But aside from that little bit of false advertising, I still give this 5 stars.
