This is my first experience using avocado oil for cooking and eating. This brand was of a good quality and tasted great. I use it mostly as an ingredient in baking, lightly sauteing greens and fresh veggies, and in salads. I will definitely consider buying more of this oil for the same uses. I did have to be more careful as it did cook a little hotter than the olive oil I was accustomed to using for sauteing. It cooked a bit more quickly. I purchased this to increase my intake of a variety of healthy oils and fats in my plant-based diet.
