I was intrigued by the Starling after I listened to a Freakonomics podcast about the importance of children hearing thirty million words by age 3.  It was basically explaining that no amount of pre-K education or remedial training is going to make up for the critical years from 0-3 that a child must be engaged with.  It seems obvious, but like speed walking, you gotta really push yourself or you can become complacent.  Especially when were all tired from a full day of work.  I wish I had this device the day my daughter was born.  The setup couldnt be easier.  I put the Starling in the charger and waited for the red light to turn green. Meanwhile, I downloaded the Starling app and set up a profile pic.  One of the things I really like about the app is the built-in chat feature that makes you feel connected to the designers.  It reminds me of the Amazon Mayday button.  After that, everything is pretty automatic. The first 3 days, the Starling was learning how we interacted with our daughter. And then it suggested our word goal.  Our mission is to crush the word goal every day.  The product advises that you connect the Starling to the app every few days to download the data but its not an issue.  Youll find yourself checking your word count every day.We attach the Starling to her teddy bear which is only separated from her at nap time at pre-school.  This device is also great because we can see how many words shes exposed to during the 8 hours shes at school, 2 of which are napping.  Shes getting about 15-20K words each day at school.  On a side note, Ive been meaning to charge it since 7 days ago but it slips my mind.  As far as the battery icon shows in the app, its still at about half a charge remaining after a week.
