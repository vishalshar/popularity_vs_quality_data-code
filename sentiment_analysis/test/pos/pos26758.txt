I confess, it was the Danish design aesthetic that first attracted me to the zipp, but I would never hang onto audio equipment based on visual appeal. Fact is the sound is as good as- better than, actually -the look. I was once given a small cylindrical speaker before, but it was intended to be set down horizontally-- a total fail if the idea was (as it should be) to project sound 360 degrees and fill a room. zipp does just that--deep bass and crisp high notes that sound like they're truly ambient, not coming at you from the speaker. The link w my iTunes and home Nuvo system is seamless-- no glitches or breakup at all. And the mute feature is great when I get a call when playing music in my home office.
