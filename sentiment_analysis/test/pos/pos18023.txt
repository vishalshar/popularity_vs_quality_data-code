Unlike most of the reviewers, I didn't order this product for the ease of changing the sheets. I've never found it to be particularly difficult to change a crib sheet. I can only imagine many of these reviewers have bumpers on their cribs and I've seen a few who say that the crib mattress is really heavy. I've never used a bumper and the crib mattresses I've owned were the cheapest we could find and were very lightweight, so changing crib sheets has never struck me as any sort of chore. I'm on my second kid and never gave crib sheets any second thought until my little one decided that the second she gets in the crib she wants to take the crib sheet off. Every. Single. Time. I was worried about it being a strangulation hazard and she would wake up all sweaty from laying against the plastic mattress. I needed a sheet that would completely zip around the mattress and stay on despite her trying to pull it off.The reason I bring this up is that if you are a new mom and trying to figure out what products to buy for your baby, I'd start out with a basic sheet and see how much it bugs you to change them. You can find decent fitted sheets a lot cheaper than this and it may not be worth the price. Do I find it easier to change this sheet than a regular sheet? No. But it might be if you use a bumper.Having said all that, I really do like these sheets. They are very soft and solidly constructed. The price is high for a crib sheet, but they are very nice sheets. The bottom piece was way too big when I first put it on but it shrunk to the perfect size after the first wash.Overall I'm happy with this product. I suggest the mink sheets to go along with this. Very soft!
