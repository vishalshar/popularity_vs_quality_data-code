Bought the first one because I read the review. Loved it when it came in the mail.Since my first purchase I have added several more to my home and I've purchased a few for my friends who love new fancy technology.The update process out of the box was extremely painful, it would lose connection several times, and I could never tell if it was actually working. I downloaded the update app to install from my PC over the wifi and it worked the first time.We use it to dim the lights when relaxing and watching movies. The app is very simple to use, and you can save an unlimited number of preset moods. There are some party settings that will coordinate random colors throughout the house.Works with Nest support is is the main reason I bought LIFX instead of Phllips Hue (at the time Hue did not have Nest support. These lights are awesome.I can turn off all the lights in the house once I get in bed each night knowing that I didn't forget one of them.One feature I look forward to using when we are away on vacation it simulates someone being home by turning lights on and off. Brightness is good too.I bought the white version too. It blends in with the light fixtures.
