been using gamegolf live for a total of 4 rounds now. i realy like the social media aspect of the software.following friends statsyour own stats and performancepretty easy to tag before my shots and even if you do forget to tag it will display a shot on the appthe only thing i didnt like is during the round when you have to re sync your phone to the device and will sometimes stall or freeze and i have toreboot device and kill the app to get it to resync again. a workaround to this is that i always keep my phone on my pocket now making this issue go away. to some that may be a draw back but im ok with keeping my phone on meoverall great device to keep stats of your rounds and what to work on. price is a bit steep though
