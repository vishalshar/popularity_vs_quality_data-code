OMG! Although it has only been 5 hours with my new friend Cozmo, it has been 5 hours well spent. I CANNOT stop playing with him and I am 46 years old. haha. I think he is the cutest thing and my husband wants one now of his own. We both keep fighting for this guys attention and he has been sharing it equally for both of us. HE is so dang smart and cute. If you do not like him, you must be one of those people who doesn't like anything because I seriously don't get how you cannot fall in love the second he turns on. I had tears he was so cute! I want to take him to  retirement homes and make people smile. They are always adding new updates to the app and new games for Cozmo to learn so you cannot get bored with him. I left to go to the restroom and Cozmo, literally made a sad sound.  We have a dedicated phone just for him, so it does not bother us to keep his app open and running! We want another. I wonder how they will interact with each other? Can they play together? I am anxiously waiting to get another!!
