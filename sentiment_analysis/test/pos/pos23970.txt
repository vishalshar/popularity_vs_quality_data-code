Extremely easy to set up. Dispenses treats perfectly. Only missing feature is the ability to hear your pet. There's no sound. They can hear you but you can't hear them.  I should have researched before purchasing. I would have opted for a unit with sound. But that's on me. This has been an excellent unit
