Cats are strictly carnivores, they're not meant to eat a grain based diet, yet that is primarily what the mainstream cat food manufacturers make their dry cat food with. It causes all sorts of issues with allergies, poor skin and coat condition, and digestive upsets. I have a couple of cats who have a gluten allergy to corn and wheat, any time they eat any dry food containing those they would bloat up and have horrendous bloody diarrhea. One even got a skin allergy and would get an eczema-type condition and scratch bald spots on himself from the itching.My vet recommended this food and it does great for my cats. It's easily digested, high quality protein, and with the "Yucca Schidigera Extract", the litter box smell is reduced greatly. The price on Amazon, even with shipping, beats the one local store that sells it. And the best part is, my cats actually like it day in and day out. My cats no longer have skin allergies or digestive upsets, which makes everyone happier.
