I bought these for my 5 year old, as we have been trying different healthy alternatives to the trash vitamins (flintstones and such) in the grocery stores.  He LOVES these!!  We had previously taken Nature's Plus and we were happy with them also, but opted to try another vitamin with a good reputation.  These gummies are covered in a light organic cane sugar and are very very tasty with no aftertaste.  My little guy loves to take them.  I would highly recommend this company.  Another thing, I had written the company after reading another mom's review and they offered to send me samples so my child could try them before I bought them.  And BOY did they send samples.  We got a small box filled with Adult vitamin packs, children's vitamin packs and prenatal packs too.  They were all wonderful and what a wonderful gesture by the company.. I have found our new favorite  :)
