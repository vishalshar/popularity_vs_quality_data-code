I love this water bottle! It's your standard water bottle. Holds water, fits into all your standard cup holders. But it also has a lot of well designed features that make it THE BEST ONE I'VE EVER OWNED.  Let's start with the obvious; it's square! The square shape looks awesome, and it keeps it from rolling away.  Small perk, yeah! But also, a really solid one. Also, the bottom of the bottle comes off, which makes it super easy to clean.  No more water bottle smell! Lastly, the handle of the water bottle is big, making it easy to hold from the top.
