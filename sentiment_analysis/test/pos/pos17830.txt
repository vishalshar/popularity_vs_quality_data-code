Very convenient and functional.  Used it to replace the carbiner on my key ring.  Easy access anywhere.  Only con is due to the bulk of the caribiner itself it can be awkward to use in tighter spaces.  There is a small bridge on the back that holds the cable in place... if this had a slot to allow the ribbon cable to be removed and used separately; it would receive 5 stars... I modified mine with a dremel.
