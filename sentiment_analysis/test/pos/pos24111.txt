I love my Shine 2! Now that the band issue has been fixed, it has all of the features I wanted. I considered the FitBit Charge and a few others, but they're all built in to irreplaceable bands, so when the band goes, the whole thing goes. That's a deal-breaker. I particularly love the look of the Shine as well, and get compliments on it daily, and it's slim, so dress shirt cuffs slide right over it. That sounds small, but it's a really big deal to me! No charging is a huge plus, as is being completely waterproof. I don't ever take it off. The clock is also a nice feature.Several people have mentioned that it still pops out with the new band. I haven't had that happen at all. I can see how it might happen if you try really hard, but for me, it's a non-issue.There are a few things that could be better. The app is good but not great; it's pretty limited in its reporting. I have had to force close a couple of times when it wouldn't sync, but when I reopen it, everything is back to normal. I love the vibration feature for incoming calls and texts, but as others have noted, it's not very strong. I would have liked to be able to make it stronger.All in all, I really love this thing. It has everything I wanted, and the down-sides are very minor. Misfit really nailed it with the Shine 2!Pros:- Looks great- Waterproof- No charging- New band is greatCons:- Some syncing issues- App is good, not great- Vibration isn't very strong
