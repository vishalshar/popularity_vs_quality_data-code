I've been using this watch for several months and I want to love it more than I actually do. I enjoy it and I find it motivating, but I'm not sure I would replace it if this one got hit by a bus.The absolute best thing about this is the battery running off a normal watch battery - thank you!!! Having to constantly charge my fitbit was the worst.A word of caution - don't get it if you have Android and aren't super tech savvy, at least savvy enough to understand which Android systems will work with the app. It worked great the first few weeks I had it, then Android did some sort of update that messed with my bluetooth which made it stop syncing. Boooooo. This isn't Withings' fault although it would've been great if they found a workaround. Everything on this watch runs off of Bluetooth, it can't use a wi-fi signal or a direct connection of any kind as an alternate route. Which means that the alarm (it will vibrate at the time you set - hugely helpful for someone who has trouble getting up like me) and the time of day have to be set via bluetooth.I kept wearing it for a while because it will still manually count your steps and you can go off the watch face. Eventually, I got assigned an iPhone at work and I'm enjoying using the app again. I don't think the app is as "fun" as the Fitbit one, but it does have the ability to track activity and sleep as well as (if you manually enter them) food, weight, blood pressure, and heart rate. I do like that it tired to work cross-platform by allowing you to import MyFitnessPal info or have step challenges with anyone using Google Fit on their phone. I don't know anyone doing the latter, so not sure how useful that is.I love how attractive it is, and how I don't get random questions about my lifestyle or fitness routine because it doesn't look like a conversation starter. I wear it with jeans and with suits and it works fine. It's also easy to switch out the band for pretty much any watch band, if you want to get a nice leather band or have another little way to express yourself. I'm glad I didn't grab the nicer version of this which is quite a bit more expensive, because this really suits most situations just fine.It's sleep tracking is pretty good. If you lie down and zone out while you watch a movie on a quiet day it might count that as a nap, but overall it seems pretty accurate. Also would suggest buying the little transparent covers you can get for the watch face - it you're going to spend this much money on a watch, the extra protection will come in handy for sure. I've knocked it on everything from door frames to heavy furniture and the little cover has kept the face looking pristine.
