I had an older Withings scale and was eager to try this one. Out of the box it's even sleeker and more space age looking than my older Withings scale. Set up was a snap -- I opened the app and it immediately found the scale, downloaded an update to the scale, and the scale began working. Unfortunately the scale had some bad news to give me so I can see I'm going to need to use this scale more frequently. First it gives the weight, then fat composition then water composition. I'm not sure what to do with the latter measurement but I guess this is for tracking when you've put on water weight. Minutes later the data appeared in the app and I was able to update my goal.... for losing 10 pounds!Highly recommended and I'll be interested to see how this helps on my weight loss journey.Hope this helps and good luck everyone!
