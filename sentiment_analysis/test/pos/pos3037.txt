This product was nice me creamy and felt velvety on my skin.  It dried pretty quickly and it was easy to apply makeup over.  The first 2 weeks of using I wound up having a few pimples, which I have not had in years.  However, this side effect has now subsided after using a while.  I am not sure if it has done anything for wrinkles or to make my skin brighter, but I do like the moisturizing it provides
