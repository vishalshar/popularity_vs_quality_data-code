Very comfortable light weight summer sock. BE ADVISED as I was by other reviewers, the manufacturer understands BIG feet. I wear either 11 or 12 in a shoe (depending on where it is made) and the MEDIUM fits perfectly. Without the other reviews I'd have gone for large and been wrong.These come up just to the top of my ankle - again exactly what I wanted and again just what the product listing describes. If you want the "no see ums" you'll want to try the low cut version.As the manufacturer states, "Cotton is King" and in the summer I'm a big fan (I go for wool in the Northern Vermont winters). Still the spandex blend is really welcome - better fit, no sweat.And at about 15 bucks for three pair this is a very good price point.Recommend to a friend? Yep.
