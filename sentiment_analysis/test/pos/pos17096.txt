I have become a HUGE fan of Solid Gold's wet cat food products since discovering them earlier this year. These products are made of actual meat, with no byproducts or fillers, and my cat really enjoys it. The gravy that's included with the meat seems to be very flavorful, and the protein is so filling that my cat only eats about a tablespoon of this at a time, a few times a day, and seems totally satisfied. Apart from this, I had reason to contact Solid Gold because I had some questions about the product. The product manager got back to me right away and followed up with me to make sure that all of my questions and concerns were addressed. I love a company that stands by its product, and also commits to continuous improvement. I will be buying Solid Gold wet cat food until my cat decides that she doesn't like it anymore (which we cat owners know that our cats are wont to do, eventually).
