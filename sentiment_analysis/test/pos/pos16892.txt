This Thermal Camera works great to find where the cold is leaking in on a cold Wisconsin Winter's day.  I have been thinking of spending thousands for a real camera.  So happy I found this at less than 1/10th the price.  There are some funny circles on the screen/camera so it is not perfect.  For me, this does the job.  I plugged a lot of heat leaks around my house and showed my wife why we need to add some additional windows as a buffer to keep out the cold.  I can also see how my LED lights are running so much cooler than the incandescent lights.  Focus is a little difficult if you are trying to get a sharp picture of something.  Since you are basically taking a picture of heat, I believe it will always look a little fuzzy.  Lots of fun.  The software installed and worked great.  The different modes allow you to see issues real clearly.  I like the mode where it shows the hot-spot and the cold-spot in the frame.
