Got this as an extra gift for my nephew who loves dinosaurs! I was lucky to come across it when it was on sale for like $9! It's a bargain! The trex is pretty big, it's a loop that does come to an end, but also keep in mind children have a big imagination, my nephew decided to add cars, little people, and other dinosaurs to it. It's a fun thing for them to have in their room!
