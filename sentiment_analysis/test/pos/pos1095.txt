excellent producti use this with a samsung s6 phone. it takes a little practice to get the focus right but this camera works very well. This was purchased for use with out VFD for search and rescue and hot spot detection. while not as good as a dedicated flir or bullard thermal unit this unit is certainly perfectly functional for our needs in detecting hot spots or spotting heat signatures outdoors.i bought the XR version as i wanted to use te camera outdoors for game spotting as well. I am easily able to spot dogs in a filed or treeline at 300 yards. i have no doubt it would work much further. beyond about 200 yards i can't identify "what" is moving but i can most certainly "see" it.indoors at room distances this camera is still very functional. While it does have a narrow FOV due to the magnification it still works very well at identifying hot spots. i have used it effectively at distance around 6-8' from the target. closer than that it still works fine you just have to spend more time searching with the camera movement.the only negative i have found is the XR seems to be a bit more sensitive to ambient temps than the standard camera. i put this next to a friends standard unit. during the day with ambient air temps in the 90's his camera did have a slightly better detectable image of a man sized target at 50 yards. i suspect this is again due to the extra magnification on the XR's lens focusing the heat. it wasn't enough to hide a target from view but it was a perceptible difference.after using this camera for a bit i am very happy with it. i don;t think you can go wrong with either model. if your main use is indoors or working inside 1-200 yards the standard camera is great as well.excellent product
