I converted to the LEAF from a Fitbit, and I LOVE it.The main reason that I decided to try this out is because I wanted something more fashionable and discreet. I love to wear a lot of jewelry, silver or gold, and I found that the white ash and silver color blends well with both. Also, I am a nurse, and I love being able to wear it around my neck or clip it to my shirt (I prefer to wear nothing that can get contaminated on my arms and hands). I have found that, as long as you change the placement settings in the app, it will pick up data accurately no matter where you wear it. It's so versatile- you can discreetly clip it, or you can wear it as a pretty bracelet on your wrist. I've even worn it at the same time as my Fitbit to compare, and they definitely stack up against each other in accuracy. It is a BIG bonus for me that I don't have to charge this. Also, it saves data even if you don't sync it every day.Honestly, it seems so corny to say, but the LEAF appeals so much to me because it's a device made BY women, FOR women. This is not your typical tracker that gives you stats about your heart rate and a fancy display. The period tracking is great, and I don't have to use an extra app. The whole layout of the app is so encouraging versus competitive (like the red for failures and green for success in the Fitbit app). There is tidbits of trivia, questions about your sleep, and meditation exercises. It encourages you to be present and tuned into your body. In addition, the customer service is wonderful. I had questions about the bracelet band when I purchased mine, and they responded right away. The Bellabeat team is open to questions and feedback, and they're continuously developing the product. Seriously ladies, you gotta try this.
