I put these on my daughters gym shoes she she wouldn't trip in class and they work amazing! She really likes them, it saves time for her not to have to stop to tie shoes all the time during gym and it allows her to focus on class without worrying about tripping on a shoe lace.  Yes she can lace up her tennis shoes.. but these made one task in her day easier for her.
