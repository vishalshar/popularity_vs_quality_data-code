Everything you want in a activity tracker, steps, time, HR, water resistant, call notice... but for a third of the price or better.  The best feature and surprise is the battery goes 3-4 weeks on one charge.  It advertises 3 weeks but I was skeptical and then surprised when it went 4 weeks.  Smart design also...quality material, minimal size and able to hold up to aggressive activities.  Can't say enough about it.
