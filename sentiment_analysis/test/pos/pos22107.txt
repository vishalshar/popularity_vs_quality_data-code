I love my Moov NOW.  I started looking for a fitness tracker to motivate me to exercise after taking a new job with a longer commute.  I wasn't doing anything and figured it was time.  The features of the Moov attracted me and they have proved extremely motivational.  I started with the 7 minute workout and have continued doing it regularly.  I grabbed a second Moov device and fell in love with the cardio boxing.  Now that it is spring, I'm ready to run, walk and bike.  I love that the coach is there with you throughout the workout and keeps you going.  My body is thanking me everyday for buying the moov now.
