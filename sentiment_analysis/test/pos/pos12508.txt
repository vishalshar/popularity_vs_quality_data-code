Cozzoni Compact Storage Container Set, Lunch Boxes, Freezer-Dishwasher-Microwave Safe, 16 PieceThese containers are great; I was happy to throw out the messy disorganized ones that took up too much space in my kitchen cabinets.  They are compact, colorful, very good quality, and the lids have tabs which make them easy to pull off.  I especially like the way the lids nest so that it's easy to find the size you need.  Recently I saw a similar set in Crate and Barrel for $34.95 so I was happy to find these for a third of the price.
