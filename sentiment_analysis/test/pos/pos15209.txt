My Kuna light has completely exceeded my expectations.  Starting with the easy installation I was delighted to see the product shipped with a couple  of metal rods to make installation idiot proof.  One rod was to calibrate the screw depth and the other was to hold the fixture while securing the wires.  if you've never installed lighting fixtures this may seem trivial but take it from someone who's cursed at his share of lighting fixtures - these little tools are great.The software install via the iPhone app was so fast and easy I frankly don't remember it well except to note it did a great job of detecting my wifi which was a concern due to the distance to the transmitter.Functionality is great. The adjustable motion detection works fine as does the dusk to dawn feature which can be disabled if you prefer.  The units speaker is loud and clear and the microphone picks up sound well.  I like the canned visitor responses and the siren sound.The ability to store video clips and download them FOR FREE is a feature many similar products fail to provide and really sold me on the Kuna (Who wants to pay a monthly fee for a light fixture).
