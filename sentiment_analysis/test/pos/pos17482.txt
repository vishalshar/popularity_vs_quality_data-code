My application is working perfectly after a device failure.  I initially purchased the gLink in December 2015.  Setup was straightforward and the app immediately located the device.  Unfortunately it stopped working in July 2016.  I contacted (Hank) at gLink support.  Hank replied back within an hour of my initial email with suggestions to get the device back up and running.  He also provided a direct phone number to call.  After a few tries by email support I contacted Hank directly and it was determined that the unit should be sent back.  I returned the gLink for $6 although I could have sent it back for less than $3 at USPS.  Hank shipped a brand new gLink.  The second unit has worked without incident.Here are some specifics of my install:Location - 10' inside my garage 12' off the floorDoor opener - Genie Pro - Screw DriveWiring - Spliced into the existing door button wire  (red to red , white to white)Phone - Samsung Galaxy 6 - Android Ver 6App - (Android)  Devicelinked v1.30.12Set up of my wife's Samsung 6 took less than one minute.  My phone created a QR code that the DeivceLinked app on her phone scanned.  It was connected immediately with the gLink in our garage.  Note:  After the initial app install my wife's phone would get a message that the DeviceLink app had failed every few hours.  I uninstalled then reinstalled the same app and re-scanned the QR code.  That corrected the problem with no notifications since that time (two weeks as of 8/3/16).I also checked connection distance from outside the garage.  This was done line of sight through a closed wooden garage door on a brick rancher.Minimum:  I never needed to be closer than 35" to make contact with the receiverMaximum - I have been able to routinely connect from 100' to open or close the doorFinal thought.  I was going to rate this a 3 or 4 due to the failure of the first device.  However customer support was fantastic.  After problem solving was unsuccessful a new unit was sent out that put my door back in service.  I would recommend this to a friend or family.
