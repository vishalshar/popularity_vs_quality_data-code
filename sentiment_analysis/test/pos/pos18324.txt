I have been using this product for several months and it seems to help my dog's tummy. My dog has been diagnosed with irritable bowel due to unknown cause (could be allergies, bacteria, etc.).  I cannot give this 5 stars because my dog still needs medication to control the inflammation, but I think she needs less of the medications using this product.  She also likes the taste and I have seen no side effects.  Note, my dog is allergic to many items (rice, potatoes, pork and more) so it is nice to find a product that she can consume without having loud stomach gurgling and the vomiting and pain that follows.  I give her 1/8 teaspoon twice a day with her meals.  She is around 20 pounds.
