Good and warm - warmer than other tog 2.5 sleeping bags (like woolino, merino kids, slumbersafe bag)! But not long enough. My kid was 14 month when I got it, I think he was at 32 inches or slightly taller. This bag fits him well but doesn't have much room to grow. It has like two inches at the bottom so it was roomy at the time but won't last long. So I returned it. Really wish they make it bigger or make another size up.
