The more I use this chair, the better I like it - Ferrino by Rapid X.  With a great selection of colors, I finally chose black on black (although I almost bought the blue accent chair.)  I like the quality of the chair, from the construction to the style and clean stitching. After adjusting the height and how much I wanted the back to tilt, I found that it is both comfortable to use and supportive of my bottom and back.  Most chairs I have tried don't feel great after hours of use.  I think it was smart to have the hard plastic arm rests that can be adjusted in several ways for support.  The arm rests on my old chairs show a lot of wear (chipped rubber, shaggy, etc.) just from regular use. It also comes with two adjustable pillows that can be attached/taken off the chair for back support and neck support.  I don't use them but I like having the option. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.
