I've bought this brand of freeze dried chicken in various sizes from various places over the years.  My most recent purchase is the large 21 oz bag which I got here at Amazon.  The pieces in this bag are mostly flat, averaging 1/4" thick.  The color is light tan.  The previous bag I got (same size) from another vendor in July had large pieces that were 3/4" to 1" thick and the shapes were irregular, not almost perfect rectangles like the current bag.  The color was also much lighter and the pieces were flaky and easy to break up.My cats do seem to prefer the bigger, chunkier, lighter & flakier pieces but they're also happy to eat the darker, flatter ones as well.  One cat will sometimes not be interested in the flatter, darker pieces but will eat them at other times.I've bought the smaller bags in local stores and you can see the product inside through the bag and they have always been the nicer, lighter chunkier pieces.I give 5 stars for when I get the nicer product, 3.5 - 4 stars for bags like the one that was delivered today from Amazon.
