I really like this item. In order to determine whether or not you will like it as well you must first determine the function that you expect it to perform. My expectations were for the item to be a learning device; to teach my fingers muscle memory in fingering various chords and strings. It does this very well. After having it for three days I just can't get enough. I am having fun learning which means that I am motivated to learn more. The skills seem to transfer to the real deal as well. After practicing with the jamstick, I practice what I learned with the acoustic and I am happy to say that I am improving..... just very slowly. Keep in mind that I'm a super noob beginner and have no idea wether or not this would be of any use to a more advanced player.If you needs and expectations are similar to mine than it is likely that you will like it.The only reason that I withheld a star in my rating is the price. 300 is a little steep, but it is worth it for me. I have wanted to learn forever and this is appears to be a great way to do it.
