Ill start out by saying, believe me. I really want to give this product a five star review. These wheels are perfect for parks or rough streets where you will usually find small rocks and nuts that will normally stop your board. These will roll right over them with ease. Also, because of the smaller surface area as compared to a standard longboard wheel, there is a noticeable amount of reduced grip which is better in my opinion. It gives out just a little every time you swerve back and forth but not enough to spin you out. As I mentioned though, there is a drawback to these and that is the fact that they don't supply bearings with them. For this price, I would have expected at least a $20-worth set of bearings. Because of this though, I just went ahead and bought $50 Bones Swiss brand set so that I can make the most of my new wheels. Also, you will notice the odd rolling pattern through the board. It's not bad but it's just a slight pulsing that you will notice when on smooth ground.All in all, if you ride in rough terrain like i do, you're okay with the attention they bring, and you have the money for these wheels and quality set of bearings, I would highly suggest them. They are sooo cool!
