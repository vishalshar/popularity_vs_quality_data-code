I purchased this item 2 weeks ago as a last resort. It was either pay for a dog sitter or doggy day care! now I don't have to do either. This item worked far better than I had hoped. It is also extremely simple to connect with your home wifi. As I work a lot and live alone, this feeder allows me the peace of mind knowing that I can watch my dog eat and verify he has been fed. by far the greatest purchase I have made in quite a while.  as for me, I am able to load each of the 6 containers slots with slightly more then a cup of dry food.
