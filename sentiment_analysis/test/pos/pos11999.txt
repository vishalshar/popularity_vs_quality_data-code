I received this product at the airport as a promotional giveaway, had a 17 hr flight, took about half the bottle just to try, slept very well. Lost the the little bottle along the way. Months later saw in an Albertsons, bought a couple, took half again, worked like a charm, since then I've had friends and family try and they really like it and it does seem to work. It is pricey tho.
