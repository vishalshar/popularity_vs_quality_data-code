My 10 year old bought this for himself after learning about circuits at school.  This is a great set.  He has really enjoyed going through the workbook that comes with it and creating the circuits with all the various components.  The only negative I would say, was that it was a bit of a shock (to both of us) how small this package is when it arrives.  The images are very deceiving and for the price, we expected a much bigger package.  Also, wish it had the motor component, which we'll have to buy separately.
