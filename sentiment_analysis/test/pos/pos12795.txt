I was pleasantly surprised when i used this for the first time. I have to admit, i was skeptical as to what the quality of this thing was going to be.But I hooked it up to a hose and got my motorcycle out and with the help of a little wheel cleaner, this thing worked great!!I thought for sure that the spinning brush would stop spinning when you try to have this thing get in tight spots, like in between all the spokes of a motorcycle wheel. But I put it to the test and really tried to put it in a spot that would stop the brush from spinning and it took more force then what "normal" use of the brush would take.Being that it only uses the force of the water to make the brush spin, i was weary of how well it would spin when applying pressure to clean wheels that haven't been cleaned in years.But the brush did great!!! Its pretty good quality plastic....feels strong and sturdy and did the job it was supposed to do to 2 cars and a motorcycle.Cant wait to try it on other things around the yard.I have one little complaint, I had to use both rubber washers inside the brush handle.(It comes with one already inside and an extra one in the bag)  When there was only one in there, it leaked water like crazy, no matter how tight I connected the hose, it still leaked, one I used the second rubber washer it stopped leaking.
