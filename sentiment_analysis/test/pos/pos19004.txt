The company did come through and sent me a new plane. It arrived today and all is working now. It did take a while to get this addressed but I am happy with the end result.----------------------Awful customer service! The plane I got stopped working after a couple of flights.Customer service asked me to create a video showing defect (rudder not working) but never followed through. I contacted them several times after that but they never returned my e-mails.Followed all instructions and plane flew on an open field.The plane is too fragile and the company does not stand behind their products. I can't recommend a product that lasted maybe a total of 10 minutes of flight. The company could had made it right but they didn't make any effort to do so. At $50 this is an expensive 10 minutes.
