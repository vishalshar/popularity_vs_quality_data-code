I recently bought this for my daughter's 13th birthday.  She is very artistic with all mediums and has very good motor skills so I figured it would be okay for her even though it's recommended for 14+.  I was right.  She LOVES it and has had no problem learning to use it.  You just have to be careful of the hot tip of the pen. It has very clear instructions and trouble shooting tips.  There is a learning curve but it didn't take long at all to figure out some techniques that help the building process.  She is already making Christmas tree ornaments and gifts for her her friends.  I got to try it out as well and I didn't want to stop.  I can tell already that we're going to need more re-fills so you might just want to include that in your original order.
