The easy walk harness is the simplest way to get your dog to walk nicely on a leash.  Our rescue lab just couldn't learn to leash walk despite our best efforts.  With the easy walk harness she doesn't pull or lunge at all.  Getting it adjusted is a bit fussy and may take a little patience, but once it's fitted properly, you never have to do that again.  It's simple enough to do, it just takes some trial and error, and putting the harness on and taking it off.  Having a pocket full of tiny treats at your disposal should help though.  ;)
