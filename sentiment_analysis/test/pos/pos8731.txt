Love this product.  The drive is great - tiny, quick, and holds an extremely large amount of data.  I use it as a monster hard drive for my Android tablet (in my case, a Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, as a USB OTG drive.  This drive helps me use the tablet as a "(much) better iPod than the iPod" on the go music player. (The iPod Classic 160 GB is decade-old technology; with this drive, I have an incomparably better music player front-end, and with 3 times the capacity.)  Also, I keep a ton of books on this, and use Android e-reader apps...  and keep a photo collection on it as well.  This combination - the drive, a tablet, and the Lava charging adapter (which lets you charge the tablet and access the drive at the same time), is great.  But even without the charging adapter, my tablet as a music player, using this solid state drive, will last all day.
