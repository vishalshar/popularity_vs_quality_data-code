I purchased this on our shared account, so in case you are wondering the writer is a male of medium well done years. If you want the bottom line just skip to the bottom line.My new Vurtego V4 Pro (medium) in toxic green arrived at my home Friday 8 January 2016. I unboxed it but didn't go jumping that day. There was ice on the ground and I was at work until dark.On Saturday I got a helmet and gloves on and took my stick outside around noon. I was a bit intimidated. After all I'm 63 years old and have done nothing for fitness for the last twenty years. As a computer programmer my fingers get their most rigorous workouts sitting at a desk typing all day.Well, 51 years ago (from the time of this review), on Christmas day I received my first pogo stick. I wore it out that very day, but I remember I had a lot of fun then. Now that I am older and slightly more careful I figured my odds of survival were better than even.So I put my left foot on the left platform and dang, my foot was above my knees! "Is this really how you get on this thing?" I thought to myself. Of course, being older and wiser, I did watch every training video Vurtego had before today. So yes, this really is the way to get on.So I stepped up, and... got off. Well, sorta tipped sideways. The secret is if you feel you are going to be unbalanced, well, just get off! I prefer to avoid abrasions, contusions and other bodily injury."I know I can do this," I told myself once again. So up I went and got maybe two hops, and safely exited the careening vehicle. That wasn't totally terrifying, just pretty spooky. I was able to move despite my rather strong concern.I tried again, four hops. Got off. Or sorta launched sideways. The training videos don't mention that newbies tend to go off on tangents. Remarkably strong tangents at times. So, note to self. Get feet between butt and ground when involuntarily launched.Again, two hops. Not strictly a linear progression. In the course of my attempts I noticed my helmet was moving all over. "I'll fix that later" I told myself.Well, after trying for about three minutes total, including time on the ground (which was still, miraculously, in the upright vertical position) I was completely knackered. I was puffing and my heart rate was up. There was another big change. I had this huge grin on my face.For me, exercise has to be enjoyable or I am not likely to continue. With the sizeable investment I've made in my new jungle gym (a.k.a. Vurtego V4) I am delighted to report that the objective is doable and exciting.If you have not been very active, listen to a survivor. When your legs turn to rubber it's time for a break. I took the rest of the day off.The next day, Sunday, we had a light snowfall where I live so I rushed out earlier in the day to scrape off the snow from my sidewalk and a portion of the cul-de-sac where I live. At noon I went out again. This time I had my helmet strap shortened to keep my lid in place, but still, not too tight.Same gloves, and just a light longsleeve shirt. Sure it was freezing out, but there was a bit of sunshine which removed the ice and moisture from where I cleared the snow. No wind to speak of. I knew I wasn't staying out long. I'm too outta-shape to expect otherwise.I went for it again. I lasted about five minutes. Probably half that time was standing, not pogoing. But... I hit forty hops, once. Then I was descending the bell curve. Again, I quit with much huffing and puffing, but I did go longer. I also felt that it was getting easier. At my age the speed of molasses is something to be admired.So, I didn't freeze, break, or pull anything out of shape. The exercise kept me warm, and I got to wave at some new people watching the crazy old man try to kill himself. Since I successfully converted my legs to rubber (the soft non-supporting variety) I again took the remainder of the day off.Let me say that the ride of my Vurtego V4 is brilliantly smooth. As a child on a conventional spring type pogo, I frequently bottomed out, slamming into the ground. Since I was much more resilient then it didn't bother me. But I do remember that.The Vurtego is nothing like that. With a very long and smooth action the ebb and flow of the compression and decompression of the air is absolutely brilliant. And I am not bottoming out. Nor am I being annoyed by the screeching of wobbling springs and banging metal stops. The Vurtego is remarkably quieter than a regular pogo stick. Actually comparing a Vurtego to a spring or rubber powered pogo is like comparing the space shuttle to a piper cub. They both fly, but one goes way farther than the other.Well, Monday arrived. No new snow, but cooler temperatures. High of 28 degrees. Again, no wind, so at lunchtime I again went for it in the rather cool but bright sunshine. I'd estimate I lasted about eight minutes today, with a max count of 59 continuous hops. I started getting a little altitude and directional control.I can see that sometime in the not real far future this old man is going for some tricks!This is so freaking fun! Yes I'm still huffing and puffing. But each day I'm getting a little more skillful, and the longer I go the better a workout I get! This is totally a win win! I'm grinning now just thinking about how much fun I'm having. Color me one very happy toxic green consumer!
