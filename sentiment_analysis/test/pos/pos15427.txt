I love this stuff so much I find myself making up excuses to use it. I go around asking my family if they need anything fixed. I take pictures of my repairs and beam with pride. I prefer the black and the white colors as they blend best with most of my repairs. Ideal for fixing frayed cords on Apple products, or reinforcing new ones. Kind of expensive, and often out of stock in stores. This stuff is a life hackers dream clay.
