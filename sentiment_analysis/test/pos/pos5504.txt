9 Zone programmable, Internet weather optional, network accessible. I use my ipad to adjust, program or turn on or off my sprinkler system. I can now leave home and know that my yard is being properly watered and if necessary I can VPN a connection to check the system status from afar. The best available sprinkler system controller I could find.I hope in the future they create an app for anywhere access.
