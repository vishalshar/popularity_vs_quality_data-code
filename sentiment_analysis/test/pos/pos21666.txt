Good for daily useI got it for a few days and have been using it everyday for music, alarm and nightlight.Pros:-All in one with alarm, speaker, and night light.  Save some space for my nightstand.-Nice minimal design-White light at the back serves as night light (I am not using it as wake-up light but brightness is just right for me)-Customer service was prompt. I was having issues switching off the back light when alarm was off. They sent me instructions in email within half a day.Cons:-Not enough instructions in app-Speaker not portable-Need to update firmware to solve my connection issue
