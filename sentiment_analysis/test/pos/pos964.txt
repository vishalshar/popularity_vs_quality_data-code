I think some people haven't realized it has a focus ring. This allows you to get a nice crisp picture, but if you don't adjust the image will be blurry just like an out of focus camera and it will seem very pixelated and/or grainy. I can't stress enough to ADJUST THE FOCUS RING!!!This is awesome. I've got a 130 year old house that I'm trying to seal up so I'm not spending money warming up the outside during the winter.We had the energy people come in and show us with their very expensive FLIR camera where the leaks are, but they were horribly expensive if you wanted them to do the work.So I'm undertaking the sealing and insulation myself and this is a great tool. I can already see a huge difference in areas where I've added insulation but haven't dry walled yet. I can see some of the small places that need my attention. And on walls where I haven't insulated you can see the difference between insulated/uninsulated pockets.
