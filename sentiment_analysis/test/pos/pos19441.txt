Just a few days ago, my cursor was hovering over this product as I debated whether to buy it or not. I give my former self the same advice as I give the reader of this review - do it! Not only has it already dramatically improved my experience when using balls for self-massage and relaxation, my husband loves using it just as much as I do, if not more. This product is definitely worth the money! Five stars.
