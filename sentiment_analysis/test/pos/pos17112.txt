Overall a good product for the garage. Worth the price. I wasn't able to try the fm out much as the aluminum siding on my house makes it bad. Nice sound I can max out the volume and it doesn't seem to loud. I had my propane heater running with it maxed out and it was good. Could be a bit louder but it's ok. The original speaker wires are really really short. I went and hooked up some longer ones I had and that worked fine. It also helped with the sound in the larger garage.  The remote works well if the unit is farther away from you. While this system won't blow you away it is good if you need something decent for the garage.
