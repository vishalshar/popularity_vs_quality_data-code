Finally a flash drive that does what it's supposed to do and that's be a flash drive. Insert the drive and it's ready to use. This product has a lot going for it.  No more having to insert your flash drive and have a company install a program on every computer you visit and waste your time.  Next, the drive does not have a seperate cap. The cap for this one is built in so you wont lose it and it gives the drive USB port very good protection.  Finally what I like the most is the hearty key ring holder.  It's built solidly, no more little wire rings that get snagged on your pants pockets and get unravelled. This little device lives up to expectations.
