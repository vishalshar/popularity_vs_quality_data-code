I bought this mouse pad to go along with a Mionix Naos 8200 mouse about 1 month ago. I wanted to wait on a review until I gave it a really good workout. The mouse is working out pretty good, although it does feel quite a bit looser than when it was new. The Mionix Propus mouse pad is somewhat of a let down to be honest. My biggest issue is that the mouse almost feels like it is sitting on something tacky when I make small movements.After a month the glide pads on the mouse are fully broke in and should slide very easily after that, but not with this combination. I think it has something to do with the texture of the mouse pad and what happens to it when the very top layer gets slightly worn. Out of the box it wasn't really what I consider a "rough" texture, more like a somewhat bumpy plastic. The best way I can describe it is like putting a piece of cling wrap over sandpaper. I know that sounds weird, but to me that's exactly what it feels like.As far as tracking goes, the pad has been flawless. The non-slip rubber base does just that, even after 10 hour grind sessions it is exactly in the same place it was when I started. For those reasons I gave it a 4 star rating, but I feel more like giving it a 3.5 because of the surface issues.
