This camera has worked out really well for us. We set it up before we left out of town for a week, and it stayed connected with no problems while we were gone. We had a painter come while we were gone, and the Canary consistently alerted us to when he came and left. For some reason, when we set it up, the Canary wouldn't sync with my phone, but it did work with my husband's, and my phone was easily added after that. The auto arm/disarm doesn't seem to work, but it isn't a big deal to us to click that on and off ourselves. This met our needs and we've been pleased with it!
