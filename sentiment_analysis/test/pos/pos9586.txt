Our cats were indoor/outdoor cats their entire lives until we moved and our new neighbor decided that she had a problem with our cats being on her property. We worried that the fence might affect the cats attitudes toward being outside. However, the fence works great and it took about two weeks for the cats to figure out the boundaries (on 3+ acres). We didn't do any formal training, except for taking the cats to the line on a leash the first day and pulling them back into the yard when they crossed the perimeter. We did not bury the wire as it would have taken much too long (nearly 2,000 feet of wire). We zip tied it to our chain link and farm fencing and it works great! Also, with doing it this way we were able to get the fence up in about 3 hours. Another good feature is that the control box will alarm you if the fence is down. Our dog, who does not have an electric collar chewed through a portion of the wire and we were alerted by the control box immediately (high pitch beeping). All in all, this system is much more affordable than other systems that I researched and it has exceeded my expectations.
