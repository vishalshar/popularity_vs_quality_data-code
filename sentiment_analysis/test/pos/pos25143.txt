If you want a basic tracking device hidden inside a beautiful watch (even more in person than what you see through pictures), this is the one for you.This device wants to disappear in your wrist, doesn't want to call the attention except when you need to know what time it is, or when you want to follow the progress of the goal you have set for the day. The silicone strap is really comfortable, and you can get any 18mm leather strap from a different brand if you want to substitute it. The app does what it has to do tracking your everyday activity and sleep, and it syncs with the watch easily.I bought it for my husband as a present, but after wearing it for a week he decided he was not ready to give up using his regular watch.
