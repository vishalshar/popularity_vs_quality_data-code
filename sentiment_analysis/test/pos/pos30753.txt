A great product to check your pups urine.  It will give you a idea of how their Blood, Nitrite, Protein and Glucose is between vet visits.  THIS PRODUCT IN NO WAY REPLACES A VETERINARY VISIT! It comes with two sticks to check, and the cup holder is log enough that you don't get peed on by a large dog like my saint.  It is well worth the $12 bucks to have peace of mind when your a worry wart like me.
