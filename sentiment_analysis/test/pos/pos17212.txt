I really want to like this product. I thought it was such a great idea especially my LO loves to play Minecraft. What it failed to mentioned on the description is that you NEED to purchase the PC or MAC version of the Minecraft game before you can play using this gameband to its fullest potential. The fact that I already owned the mobile version AND the xbox ONE version of Minecraft, I don't really want to spend more money on another PC version. I'm disappointed that it didn't work out for us but the product itself was nicely built, would definitely recommend to someone who already purchased the PC/MAC version of the game.
