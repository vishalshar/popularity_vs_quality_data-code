I think this is a unique personal safety device. It's got a nice form factor and a clever pull pin design. My issue is that while the alarm is 120 dB, its loudness rating isn't very high. I think it would startle a would be assailant so it scares them off. But if you were hoping that it is loud enough to alert people far away, it's not very loud. If you are 30 yards+ away, it just sounds like a small bike alarm/horn going off. That might make some people turn heads but in NYC that's kind of just white noise.Overall I think it's better than nothing.
