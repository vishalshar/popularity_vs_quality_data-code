I frequently backpack and have been using Esbit solid cubes to start my twig stove.  I am not a huge fan of the Esbit.  You have to shave them to start them, they are expensive at $1 per cube, and they get all beat up in my backpack (the foil backing is weak).I used the InstaFire this trip.  It started easily and got the job done.  I only started two fires and have a lot left in the bag (probably will get four fires out of each bag), so it is very economical and the bag is pretty durable.
