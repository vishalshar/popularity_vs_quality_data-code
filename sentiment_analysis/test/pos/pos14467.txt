Pros:1. Feels great to hold and has a natural grip. I got the brown wood so it weighs less in my hand2. I enjoy the dynamics of the pressure sensitive settings it has compared to other stylus's. It's great to tilt the pencil fully to the side to do large and flat coverage and I still get different levels of opacity depending on how hard or light I press the stylus against the screen3. Is pretty fun to write notes with!4. Good for doodles5. It has a blur function where you use your finger to blur/blend your digital mediums. It's an interesting concept.Now the cons...1. In regards to doodles, the dynamics are great until you try to get thin wisps or strokes... It won't draw it easily. It only gets so small before the pressure settings start to get confused and will draw a thicker line then I intend. Also, when I fully tilt it to do large flats of color, it will get confused and the program will believe I'm trying to blur/blend my digital mediums instead.2. The eraser is the same if not worse. They have an eraser tool in the program besides the one on the end of the pencil andit works better but it doesn't have any opacity settings. It's either all or nothing.3. It claims to have palm rejection but I have issues with it moving the canvas if I dare rest my hand against the screen while drawing4. It only seems to have all the great features listed above for their paper app only. I tried to use it with the Adobe apps and it lacks the pressure settings that I highly value it for when I use it in paper.Overall:I do like the pencil a lot but I think I'll get the Wacom creative stylus to compliment my array of tools later on as well.Conclusion:It's not a one stop shop.I attached a doodle as a example of what I did with the pencil :)
