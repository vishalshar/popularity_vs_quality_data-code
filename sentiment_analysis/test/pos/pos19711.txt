I ordered this Lash Masque primarily for my brows.  I read where it tames them and gives them a finished look.  It does, and I love it for that.  It also is a good tint and conditioner and primer for mascara.  I have not seen results yet on the improvement of the condition of y lashes; because I just got it; but it does work well under mascara. It seems to make my mascara a little more dramatic  As I said,  It also works well as a brow groomer; filling in sparse brows; or gray brow hairs.  I would have given it 5 stars, but it is a bit dark for my dark blonde brows and so have to use a very light hand.  I wish it came in a lighter color.
