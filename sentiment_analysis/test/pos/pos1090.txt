Works as good as I expected.  I have a little experience with some of the lower end FLIR cameras and this thing will get close to what they can do.  Not quite as good of resolution but it all depends on what you are trying to see.  I am hoping to use this to find missing livestock at night.  I haven't had to use it for that yet but have used it for several other things.  It can easily find cold air leaks in the house around doors and windows and I have used it to find energized wiring in an enclosure.  I've had it about 3 months and have no complaints.
