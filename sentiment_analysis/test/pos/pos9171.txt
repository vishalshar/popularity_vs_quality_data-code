Cool gift for the price! Was on sale for a lot cheaper than when I almost bought it for my son for Christmas. He likes to wear it as a watch and is still learning the hacks. Have to say he doesn't use it as much as I hoped, but I bought it so he could take his game and all his mods while he's at his weekends with his dad. At around $30 it's not really a big deal.
