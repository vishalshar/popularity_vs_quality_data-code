These things are pretty cool! They really are smart and if you link them together to lift a platform they watch each other and slow down if one of them sees more weight than it's neighbors to keep the platform level. I grabbed a corner of the platform to test it and sure enough, the others slowed down like magic! They are pretty easy to install if you have a drill and it comes with the drill bit you need to put them in your garage ceiling. Would recommend to others!
