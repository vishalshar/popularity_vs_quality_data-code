I followed the simple directions and within 5 days there were pin heads peaking up. After afew more days (4 or 5), There was a flush of mabe 20 on one side and a small flush just across the "window". It was looking very good and getting misted twice a day. On about the seventh day the growth stopped, the caps on the larger ones, about 1" diameter, began to crack around the margins. The entire flush became hard. I cut the large and small flush off, started again soaking it in water overnight to try for a second flush. This is not my first kit and I had a couple of good flushes from that first  one. I will updade my review after this second try at getting a flush of Oysters from this box.After the failure of the first flush, I let the box rest for about 10 days. I followed directions again soaking overnight, cutting the slits on the opposite side and began spraying twice a day. There were pinheads after the 4th day. The shrooms grow quickly and within few more days there was a small but nice flush of Oysters. My wife and I sauted them and they were delecious. The bulk of the bag is now broken into smaller pieces and blended into our compost of leaves grass and straw. Hope the mycelium gets established in the compost.I revised  the three stars to 4 stars, based on the second flush. I believe the failure of the first flush was mostly failure on my part and not the product. The mushrooms are fun to grow and educational for young and old. I plan on ordering more kits as Christmas presents.
