Stalking animals/pets has become much easier now that I can see them in the dark.  My skills as a hunter are increasing to the point that I will soon be able to live off the grid...Seriously, though, this thing is awesome merely from the fact that you can actually see cold air coming into your room from a vent.  No other i* accessory is going to let you do that.  I used it to watch an SD card try to bake itself when copying 12GB of data, took photos of people who want to have their photos taken merely to see how they look in thermal vision.I have gotten a lot of joy out of this thing.
