Getting a thermal Camera for this price is awesome. The construction of this device is quite sturdy, it is made of metal of some type and is quite light and sturdy.The lens focus mechanism really needs something done to it to tighten it up. The threads are just too loose in this version. I was surprised to discover that the lens does focus, as I had read that was a feature of the more expensive version. I spent the first few days with this camera wishing the image was a little crisper... Now that I can focus the lens, the image is much improved.I compared the image quality of this device to another thermal camera we use at the fire department... The fire department camera wins by a large margin. But, that is not too surprising as it costs ~100 times more. The comparison also showed that each device detects the same warm and cool spots. So while the resolution is not there, this Seek camera sees the same information.I bought this device to locate cold spots around the house to reduce air (heat) leakage. Once those are taken care of, the device will have paid for itself in energy savingsWhen looking for cold spots in your house, you'll really need to do it where there is a large temperature difference between inside and outside. Our house is usually about 65Â°F, and recently the weather has been in the 60's instead of the 20's and 30's, so I really have not been able to find much.The camera comes with an excellent fitted storage case. This is perfect for taking the camera with you. The camera is quite small and lightweight so keeping it with you each day is not difficult.In the attached images you'll see my front door with and without weather stripping at its base. The "before" image is also taken before I knew I could focus the lens, so it is blurry. The hot water heater is also included, I figured it was a little more interesting to see than all of the pet photos people are posting.
