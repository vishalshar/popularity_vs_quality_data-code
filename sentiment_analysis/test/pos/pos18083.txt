Fast, solid, and light. Amazing that the technology has developed now to the point that one can buy a 512 gb SSD drive for such a modest price. Love the fact that is a real drive with a trash bin, unlike the regular flash drives. As for speed, I do not have the equipment the manufacturer specifies for the phenomenally fast transfers it cites, but with my average dated laptop's 3.0 port, transferring a single large file, it was doing about 60 mb per second---no complaints! Also very happy that it is supplied NTFS. One tiny quibble: It would be nice if a soft slipcover were included.
