I have a 2016 Honda Forza 300 and wanted a way to check/monitor tire pressure.  I researched several options and decided on FOBO Bike.  FOBO TPMS sensors replaces the valve stem cap and uses Bluetooth to send tire pressure and temperature measurements to the FOBO app on my iPhone, regardless of whether my bike is stationary or moving.  Another product I was considering requires the bike to be traveling at least 20kph before measurements are sent from the sensors.  I decided it was important for me to know the tire pressure before starting out for a ride, so I went with the FOBO.  I didn't want to discover I needed to add air to my tires after I've already left my garage.  The other product also requires a receiver that relays the tire pressure measurement to your phone.  FOBO doesn't need a separate receiver.  I've also compared the PSI reading with a high-quality tire pressure gauge and found the FOBO Bike TPMS to be very accurate.When I replaced my valve stem cap with the FOBO TPMS on my rear tire, I checked the clearance and discovered it comes too close to the transmission housing at one point in the tire rotation.  I contacted FOBO and they were fantastic to work with.  They suggested I try their T-valves and offered them risk free.  I'm very impressed with the quality of the T-valves.  My dealership installed the T-valves so they face outward and away from the transmission.  They face the right side of the bike, which provides plenty of clearance.  I WOULD NOT INSTALL FOBO BIKE TPMS SENSORS ON THE HONDA FORZA WITHOUT T-VALVES.  The T-valves also offer two additional benefits.  First, they are metal valves, so they are stronger and don't wobble with bike vibration.  Second, I have the FOBO TPMS sensors locked onto the right-angle valve and don't need to remove them to add air.  I can leave the sensors locked in place and remove the straight valve cap to add air.  The included photos show the FOBO sensor on my original rubber valve stem (notice how close it comes to the transmission housing) and the FOBO sensor on my new T-valves.I am thrilled with the quality, accuracy, convenience, and safety of knowing my tire pressure at all times.  I highly recommend FOBO.
