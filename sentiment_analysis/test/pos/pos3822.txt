It doesn't get better ...yet.  Love, love, love it!  Even in the winter...indoors...it charges!  Great for the fly-in fishing trips to northern Canada!We can even  play horseshoes at night with the Kalipak lights!  No more gas generators.  Can power my sirus xm radio and speakers, and every possible item I would need.  Get one!
