My brushes are in better shape because of these brush guards than they were when I first bought them.  I have a range of brushes, from cheap Elf brushes to more expensive ones.  These brush guards have made my Elf brushes as good, if not better, than the high-end versions because they pack the bristles closer together and make the brushes more dense and more shapely than they have ever been.  LOVE this!
