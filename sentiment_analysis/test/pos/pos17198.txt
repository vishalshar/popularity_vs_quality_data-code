I ordered the G2 to use on a trip to Germany where I will be staying in an apartment without internet service. The G2 arrived promptly and I am quite happy with how user friendly it is. The instructions and display are clear and easy to follow. No problems setting up the account and getting the wifi set up. It is also nice that one can use PayPal to pay for topping off the account as needed. I haven't used the device in Germany yet, as my trip is scheduled for next week, that is the only reason I am only giving 4 stars at this point. I fully expect the device will work fine once I get there.
