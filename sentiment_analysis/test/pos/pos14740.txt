WAY BETTER than we could have ever imagined.  We brought these on our recent trip to the BWCA.  Not only are they extremely reliable, they are packaged for backpacking, and that helps a lot when every ounce of gear counts!  We will for sure by buying these again.  10x's better than just using a match and sticks.
