I bought the cinnamon apple and thought it was the cinnamon I enjoyed so much, until I bought the plain Fuji Apple and Granny Smith.  The plan apples are absolutely amazing.  I like to buy the bigger bag also as there seem to be bigger apple pieces in them.  I never have a problem with them going stale since they have a zip lock bag on top and I normally eat an entire bag in 2-3 weeks.
