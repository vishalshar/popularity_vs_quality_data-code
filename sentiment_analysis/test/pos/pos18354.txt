I brought this YOXO kit to my work at a daycare, and the children LOVED it! I like how easily it stimulates the child's mind. It's a great way for the children to use their imagination, improve fine motor skills, and create fun structures! It is also a great way for the children to learn how to reuse things, and create structures with what they have rather than use a tablet or smart phone. Personally, I love how durable this product is too! I will definitely purchase another kit, and give it to my niece!
