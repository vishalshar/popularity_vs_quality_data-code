I really like this phone. It doesn't come with any of the bloatware that is on other cell phones. The battery last me all day with about 30% left. I am a moderate to high phone usage person. It is fast apps open almost instantaneously. The screen is crisp and clear. I would recommend this phone to anyone that doesn't have a lot to spend but would like a great phone.
