I just received my new X-Star. Set up went smoothly. I've been reviewing this product for about a month before making the purchase and reading the online user manual so I was ready when it arrived. Firmware updates were smooth. I was impressed by how solid the drone feels, as well as the controller. When reviewing videos on the auto take off and landing, I noticed that the drone skipped on the ground a little and some had reported this caused it to overturn. So I opted to try the emergency shut down (both sticks 'toe-in') when the drone was hovering about 6 inches above ground. The first time it almost flipped, but stabilized after I released the sticks. The next time I received an error message on the controller that the command was not recognized. I found that the most successful landings, and my current standard operating procedure now for landing is to hover about 6 inches, then slowly decent. Once on the ground, hold the stick down and the motors go into shut down mode. I found this to be the smoothest landing procedure. I reviewed the DJI Phantom 3 as well. I went with the X-Star because of the ease of removing the camera and the case. Also, my climb from 10 to 400 feet took about 30 seconds. This is a vast improvement from my Parrot Bebop. Glad I went with the Autel.
