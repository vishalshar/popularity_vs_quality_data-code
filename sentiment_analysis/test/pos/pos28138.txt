I loved this product.  I have insomnia and have done everything to sleep. I use to take Lunesta, Due to insurance problems i can no longer get.  I then went to Benydrayl . Then to top it off i then started drinking wine to sleep and i have never been a drinker.  When you cannot sleep you'll try most anything.  Then i came across Dream water sleep aid that is all natural,  I prefer natural products anyway.  This product works  so wonderful.  I take about a hour before bed. I do not fell doopy or anything.  I just start to feel tired like i probably should naturally. It is nice because it does not knock me out. Feels like a natural sleep. Thank you sleep water i can not stop looking for something to help me. My hat off to you.
