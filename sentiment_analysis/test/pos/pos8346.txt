This watch is so amazing! I am in love with the design. It works perfectly in terms of estimating steps. It's very comfortable to wear that sometimes I forget it's on my hand. I started to become more aware of my progress, just by simply looking at it. I adore the simplicity. There are no menus, buttons or hassle. No notifications are any of that, which I actually don't like. I am enough bombarded with the notifications on my phone. It is so great that I don't need to charge it. ( I hated charging my jawbone when I had one every few days ugh...)The downsides for me are the sleep track is sometimes off in terms of estimate, but mostly gives an idea, so it's not very accurate. The other downside it that, for me I find the watch hard to read, especially the lines for the clock. It takes also a little time sync, its not very immediate. Overall, I it's one the best products I ever bought! I also sometimes which it had light.
