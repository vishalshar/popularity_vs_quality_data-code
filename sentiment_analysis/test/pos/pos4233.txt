Definitely the best tracker for my needs.  I've had the Samsung Gear and multiple different FitBit products.  This one beats them all hands down.  I got tired of having to charge my tracker all the time.  Battery life is phenomenal on this.  I don't need a HR monitor and all that extra nonsense....I just want to count my steps, and this does it well.  Classy look.  I also have the Withings Scale and everything works flawlessly together with MyFitnessPal.
