This peanut butter is quite tasty.  The raisins with just a hint of cinnamon are a good combination.  Like all natural nut butters, it is best to keep this refrigerated.  It does make it a little more difficult to spread.  However, if you leave it out for just a little while, it makes it easier to spread.  Try it on plain bagels, celery, apples--basically anything you usually use with peanut butter.  Great new product.  Also try the nut butter with pretzels and honey.
