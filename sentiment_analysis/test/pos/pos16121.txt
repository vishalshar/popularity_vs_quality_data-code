We bought this game for our son for Christmas and it has been a big hit with the whole family. Our youngest is 5, yet advanced and loves math. Our 11 year old hates math and was very reluctant to play. We were hoping it would help him  with his basic multiplication skills. Both have requested to play every night. It has been a fun, engaging addition to our family game night.
