5 stars, but.... I have bought two of these so far, at around $80 each. They are incredible. I love them! That being said, I think the price should be more around $50. But with the free software and the potential for artists, it is still an ok deal. It will allow anyone with patience and decent hand/eye coordination to draw like a professional. My 6 year old has drawn pictures using it that are incredible. My 3 year old loves the word games, and they both enjoy the shape puzzles. For a designer, artist, teacher, cartoonist, this is an amazing tool. I just think $80 is a tad high for what is in the box.
