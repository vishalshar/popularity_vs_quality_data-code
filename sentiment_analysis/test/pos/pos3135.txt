I was looking forward to receiving this item for my morning smoothie, which I make at home and take to work in a Mason jar.  This product works pretty well and is *almost* great.  The flip top comes off too easily, and the jar did still leak when it was shaken vigorously.  Also, the lid is very difficult to remove if any smoothie dries under the lid.  Overall, though, I am still happy with the lid.  It is a lot easier than the old system.  EDIT:  Upon further use, I discovered that easily removing the flip top is a good thing, because otherwise, the smoothie drips all over the place.  Just be sure you don't lose the tiny part.
