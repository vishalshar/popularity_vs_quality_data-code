This is my second POSH and my second smartphone.  I upgraded because I wanted GPS.  My sister is going to take my old Pegasus which is still functioning fine.  I love my Titan, definately a crisper display and camera, but most of all it is super fast.  I have to get my data working on it though.  I don't think it is the phone, I think it is something with configuring and setting it up.  Had to do something special with the pegasus too to get it set up.  Chatting now with my carrier to see if they can help me.  It is a very large screen, so I am going to gift my ASUS tablet to someone as I really don't need it anymore.  This phone is faster than my tablet.
