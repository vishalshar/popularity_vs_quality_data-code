I purchased this for my 7 yr old son for christmas, and he loves it! It came quickly and was exactly as described. It works perfectly, and after playing with it with my husband they've figured out all of the tricks and commands. My 2 yr old also loves this (especially when he dances) and calls him Baymax :).  This is a quality toy that anyone will get hours of entertainment from!
