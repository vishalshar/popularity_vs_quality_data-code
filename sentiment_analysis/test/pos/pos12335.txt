I'm tech-oriented and this product was mildly easy to set up. The instructions were spot on; however, if you travel often or do not have a basic understanding of wifi and internet connections, you might get caught up. The customer support is awesome so do not fear! Performs as stated and can be modified. Pretty cool device for the price.
