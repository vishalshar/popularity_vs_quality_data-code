NOT METAL! I debated between giving this a 1 or a 5 star because, after reading the description and reviews more carefully, I should have realized that they're not actual metal. However, I settled on 4 stars because the description should have been more explicit and I don't know how or why any deck of cards would be worth $30 if they're not metal or some other material (I realize they're a "higher quality" card stock).Other than that, had I not been so incompetent and read the description more carefully (I can admit when I'm wrong), I'd say they're a solid deck of cards (you get 2) that look great and come in an awesome tin. Again though, I'm not sure why you would spend $30 on playing cards but I'm not an avid poker player or anything of sort, just your casual card player who neglects to thoroughly read product descriptions.
