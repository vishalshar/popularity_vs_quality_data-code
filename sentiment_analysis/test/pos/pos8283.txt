The watch is great! I haven't had any issues syncing it to Android Lollipop with the HealthMate app. The provided band was a little uncomfortable (it's silicone), but it was easily changed to a 8mm leather one. I also wish that it pulled activity information from endomondo, for things like cycling. However, given those, it's definitely been a great choice for a watch/activity tracker that doesn't look like an activity tracker.
