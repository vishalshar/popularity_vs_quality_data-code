A few months in and i am happy much firmer than anticipated. i am only 160LB might be a little softer for larger people that being said it is still very comfortable. I had really bad back pains from a previous mattress that was worn out and the first few nights it was still really bad. After sticking with it for a week i felt much better and i haven't had any back pains since. Only complaint would be a little softer but that might be why i don't have back pain in the morning and i am used to it now. Would buy again
