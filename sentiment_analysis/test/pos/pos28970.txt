Hey, Lemme tell you how I love this Charcoal Soap Bar. First of all all the ingredients used are natural ingredients, now that adds to my love for this soap. I had gotten real bad chemical reaction/ burns from using lemon juice on my face , I mean real dark scaly skin burns, thought the lemon juice would lighten the scars on my face. I applied the lemon juice and left it on for like 3 minutes, on washing my face i felt this sting , I thought Ok the lemon juice might be helping in clearing my skin only to realize 30minutes later it did worse than that, looked in the mirror and couldn't recognize my face, face was dark, skin was burnt like inflamed and scaly. My cheeks were much darker than the center of my face. I was so sad that I couldn't even leave the house for a week hoping my face would come back to normal within that time frame. Man, who was I kidding , my face was still as it was even after two weeks then I found out about this SAPO BAMBOO CHARCOAL SOAP. I just bought it to try as I was so desperate.Now that is the one of the best decisions I ever made. I'm glad I bought this soap, I've just been using it for two weeks now, just two weeks!!, day and night and I can see some dramatic improvements. I mean real difference from how my skin was. Clearer skin, bringing my skin tone back to normal and I am so happy. It lathers up nicely , cleans my skin and leaves me feeling fresh and my skin is so soft. Am really happy, can't wait to see what its gonna do in a month. Will be ordering more soon.
