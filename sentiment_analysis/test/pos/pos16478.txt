Quality better than expected. Lots of compliments. Looks very nice. I was a little skeptical at first, but after using it a few days I am a believer. In my type of work I move around, not a lot but when I go I need my "stuff".This works great. Largest item I pack is a Mac air 13". Not a problem.I have always been a bag guy, but never found the right size and convenience. One suggestion and I have seen others mention it also. How about a handle on top for a quick grab and go, like from your backseat.I'm going to have one added. Buy it,  you'll like it.
