First, I want to say that this has so far been my best purchase on Amazon! I am very picky, it took a long time for me to select this projector after looking at 100 others. It has been six months since I purchased this projector and it still works perfect. I really love this tiny cutie pie. I got this on a deal for 234$!POSITIVES This projector is tiny, you can literally put it in your pocket.  It has got 90 minutes battery so it's portable, thus very helpful if you wanna use it for camping or outings. Also, you can use it while it's charging! You can basically project the screen on any plain wall or area, don't need to worry about buying projector screens. It came with all the required accessories. So you need to worry about buying anything extra. The stand that comes worth this projector is very flexible. You can hang it on to anything! It has a memory card slot if you want to view any preloaded files! Forget not to mention, the design of this projector of great. The color looks ravishing and style is beautiful.NEGATIVES Even though it's mentioned that it an project upto 120 inches, for best results you need to project it under 80 inches. The clarity of the image cannot exceed 720P. Even if you try to project 1080p, the clarity of the projected image will only be 720p. The sound from the projector is very low. Therefore, an external speaker is a must have. There is no option of Bluetooth, thus to connect the speaker to the projector you must deal with the Aux wire.Overall, I think it's a great purchase for the money you spend. It has got a reasonable price. I would totally encourage you to buy it if you wanna have some great theatrical experience in your own house.
