Bought this for my 3 yr old granddaughter. She was immediately immersed in building her structure. Of course I wanted to build too but she kept taking my pieces in order to make hers bigger. At first her "house" was four walls and the roof but then she realized the walls could stand on their own with only 2 sides. From there she experimented -- which is the beauty of imagination. Love this product and will be buying more of the sets.
