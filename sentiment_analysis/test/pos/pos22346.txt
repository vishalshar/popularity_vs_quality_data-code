The new sensors are lighter, smaller, and detect shots better. What more can I ask of a golf tracking system that was already really good?!Some thoughts:-The new pairing flow is sexy! Just remember that these new sensors don't have a button like the old ones. I think they use some sound magic to pair the sensors to your phone, which is pretty cool.-Customer service is second to none! I was having some issues with shots getting missed and was told that the phone needs to be in your front pocket. No missed shots since then!-They are constantly improving the app. There have been cases where I think "why does the app do this?" and then they fix it or improve it shortly after that. Nice to know they are actively working at improving my experience.-The Apple Watch provides club suggestions before each shot. I would like to see that in the main app, but other than that I am a happy camper.
