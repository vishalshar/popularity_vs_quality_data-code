Works like a charm, easy to install and smart way to confirm the WiFi network..  Nice app!Two negative comments, pricing and unable to schedule 2 sessions in one task.- I could not config 2 sessions in one day from a single Watering Schedule.  I have to create a 2nd schedule for the evening session.  As the result, the calendar indicated I water everyday once.
