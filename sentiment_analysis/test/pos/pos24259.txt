Excellent product.  I've unfortunately had to buy 4 replacement screens for my wife's iPhone 6.  2 of them have been iCracked.  The other 2 were a waste.  The 6 is probably the easiest of the iPhones I've done yet (4/4s/5/5s).  This product was a great package.  A little more expensive then some others but I wanted quality and ease.  All you need to install is right in the box including instructions.  More tools then you actually need.  Plus, was impressed that there is a nice screen protector already installed on the phone.  I recommend printing out pictures of the actual insides of your phone (or take the pictures after you open the phone), as then you can punch little holes in the picture and set the screws in the exact location they go after removing them from phone.  There are only a 1/3 of screws removed compared to previous iPhone models, but you will be glad you did this on the end.  This type of repair is not for the novice.  If you never have done something like this take extra care and watch plenty of videos ahead of time.  Be prepared to fail.  If you have to redo the repair its still cheaper to buy another screen and try again.  Never try to only replace the glass.  Very few remotely succeed trying to save a buck by trying to peel off the digitizer.  I watched several videos and decided the extra $100-150+ for whole is well worth it.Warning, it is apparent to me, regardless of who you buy from, if it isn't Apple, the screen will eventually pull apart from the frame.  If you have some good precision with super glue, just handle it.  iCracked ones do it too, but just not as quick as the ones half this price.  But the cheaper ones are super cheap and not worth it.
