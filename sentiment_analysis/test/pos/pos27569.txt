Practice definitely makes perfect with this product! It took me a while to get the hang of it but now I don't leave home without it. I have an enlarged pore on my forehead and use Dermaflage to lightly patch it up. Once the product leaves the dispenser, you have about a minute or so to get it on before it sets. I apply the gel with the tip of the wand they provided, smooth it out with the other end and then lightly dab my finger on it once it's semi-dry. Lightly dabbing your finger on the mixture helps the surface set, without the slight skin imprint from your finger, the dried result can be shiny or silicon looking. I also prefer to use a ratio 2 parts skin color product to one part of the clear product because it gives me slightly more control during the drying process. It stays on for 2 days, sometimes longer and it's waterproof.I've found that applying makeup over it after it's set is a big mistake. It draws more attention to the product and looks fake. Instead, I lightly dust it with face powder using a large brush so it's distributed lightly and evenly. This keeps oils away from the gel and makes it last longer.Since this is for scars and everyones are different, it might take some practice but in my opinion, it was well worth it. I'm no longer self conscious about my enlarged pore.
