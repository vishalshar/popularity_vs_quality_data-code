We saw this at store while shopping for purifiers. I could not believe how small this is that can purify and so many more stuff. The speakers are ok, though, not as good as some other ones out there. The temperature and humidity are sometimes way off but for us that is not a big deal. We mainly use it for purification and we are happy with it. The smell of the ions is also not very strong so it is very comfortable to keep it on.
