I love these socks!!! seriously, these are soft, comfy and well made and are the perfect height, exactly what i wanted in a low cut sock (higher than and ankle sock and lower than a quarter sock). I should add that they have very little lint when washing or when wearing. WAY better out of the box than may big name socks.. I am super happy i got these and even came back a week later and got more!One last thing - I paid full price for them, more than once. Thank you Galiva
