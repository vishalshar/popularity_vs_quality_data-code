Such a great-looking and great-sounding amp! A bit tricky to download the app for Android. Had to use my son's iPhone first to update the software in the amp, then download the Android app. Wierd, and not too much trouble, but just a few extra steps. Once that was done, we rocked out. Totally worth every penny!
