These bags were a hostess gift at my Christmas party last year. (Many thanks to whoever brought them - there was no tag).  They are amazing.  They keep the large blocks of cheese that we buy at Costco fresh until they're gone.  No more plastic wrap, or cheesecloth, or paper towels, etc.  I recently bought my second box and will never be without them again.  No more furry green cheese in my house!
