A great little product. Bought initially as a present for a family member, but ended up opening it and using it with my son. Now ordering more for presents.As an experienced guitarist I expected it to feel cheap and tacky like a toy,but I was really impressed with the build quality and feel. Very responsive - no noticable lag, I had expected latency issues but it's very responsive. A great little product for teaching.
