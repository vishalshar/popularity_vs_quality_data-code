It comes with all the mounting hardware you need to either lift in 50LB configuration (dead lift), or 100LB if you use the included pulley. The kit also included an extension cord in case you have an extra long distance to cover. I wanted to lift several bikes with one myLIFTER, so I weighed my bikes and built a 3 bike holder since each of my bikes weighed 30 LBS. I also purchased the extra lifting hook kit. I used the extra lifting hook to connect to both sides of my bike lifting frame. Worked like a charm. The device was very easy to pair to, just tap on the pairing button, then push the button on the side of the myLIFTER. Bam. Paired. The app is pretty slick, you manually lower the cable out and connect the carabiner and hooks to your item you want to lift, then manually raise/lower the device until it is where you want it to come down to and set a "Smart Point". Do the same thing for the raised position. Now, every time I want to get my bikes down, just one button press to go to the smart lower position, and my bikes come perfectly down to the ground. Every time. This is really helping me to declutter my garage. I think I'm going to have to buy a couple more of these to help finish decluttering the garage. As far as the build quality goes, all the parts are injection molded plastic, stamped sheet metal and what looks like machined steel. Very high quality manufacturing. From my experience using the app and pairing over bluetooth, the hardware and electronics seem to function very well. I didn't run into any bugs or snags that prevented me from doing what I wanted. Overall, I'd say the myLIFTER team hit the nail on the head with this one. Great product, excellent execution and packaging. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone.
