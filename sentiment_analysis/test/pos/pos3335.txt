The previous reviews I read indicated that the band should run 5 days after a full charge. I found this is not true. I got my band last Thursday and I have had to charge it 3 times now in less than a week. Also the time did not change on the band after day lights savings, even after I synced it several times. One of the other things I noticed and have not been able to figure out is how the hydration works, nothing is registering.Over all the band is OK, I guess you get what you pay for but I will buying the FitBit next.
