I have known for a long time that my daughter struggled with attention problems and hyperactivity. She would continuously have trouble in school owing to her behavior and it was difficult for me as a parent to have to discipline her constantly. I would get phone calls almost every day and parent/teacher conferences were a nightmare. After tons of research and reading hundreds of reviews on different vitamins, I settled on Focus Factor for Kids in conjunction with Smarty Pants Gummy Vitamins. The difference has been astounding. It wasn't an immediate effect and took a few weeks but it really did help. I will say that I don't think the vitamin is as effective without the Smarty Pants and the Smarty Pants are not as effective without Focus Factor but together.... they are awesome! It has been a couple years and recently, I decided to take her off because her behavior has been so great that I figured she may have outgrown the issue. Needless to say, we are currently back on our previous regimen.
