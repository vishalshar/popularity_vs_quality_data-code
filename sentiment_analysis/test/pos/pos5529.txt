Loved it for months despite it's flaws (need to have the remote, audio sucks, hard to get clear focus) however just recently it decided to stop connecting with my Macbook Pro entirely out of nowhere. I tried contacting the RIF6 team but have yet to hear back. We think it -may- have to do with the HDMI cable getting old but, seriously consider shipping better cables with your products guys. Really sucks to have a date night movie ruined*** EDIT ***RIF6 customer support was extremely responsive and sent replacement parts as soon as I asked for them. The cube is an amazing device that turns any wall into your new home theater. I travel full  time so having this in my backpack as has been a revelation!
