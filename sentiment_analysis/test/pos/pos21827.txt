Decent product. It has been around for a while so I will keep my review short. This is for the HomeKit Enabled version. The intentions behind adding HomeKit were noble and appreciated... but in all honesty, HomeKit does not work great (painful lot of latency, especially if AppleTV is located further away from the front door & unit. As a matter of fact, HomeKit was so bad and unreliable, that I decided to splurge further and invested into the very pricey August Connect wifi enabler.. Which works definitely better than Apple's HomeKit. I am not super excited about August Smart Lock but it works. Wish it did more for the price of $230 at the time of purchase... $310 total with the Connect add-on. It is pricey, dude. I have many doors at home so if I have to buy August for all of them, I will go broke.. Why don't you offer some discount bundles on Amazon?Regarding the industrial design: no doubt the Behar-infused form & CMF are iconic / flaunt worthy. Better than most other smart locks out there, as I write this.. The Schlage locks feel so retrograde compared to the simple idea behind this one.
