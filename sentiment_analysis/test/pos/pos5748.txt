There are a ton of hardcore longboarders out there that are not going to even give these a try because they consider themselves TOO "hardcore". Phat Deans, Rainskates, abec 11, Never Summer. They're great, but this is some next level sh*t. I don't ride on main roads where I live because of the level of traffic. Neighbor roads are rough and not paved as well. I can roll over cracks and gravel without a worry. I have them on all of my boards. I can't skate anything else now.
