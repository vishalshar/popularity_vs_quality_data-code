I'm giving these sheets four stars for innovation. So far I've only had to zip the sheet off once, because I spilled water all over it (oops), but it was super easy to do!My only complaint is that the edges of the top sheet (outside the zipper) get wrinkly when washed, so they don't really lay flat and look nice in the crib. No, I'm not ironing my baby's sheets.
