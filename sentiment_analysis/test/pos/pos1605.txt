Nicely constructed and simply elegant looking.  I installed this on my Buell XB12.  Note that you may have some clearance issues if your plate is located near the frame or seat since the Vololight is wider than a normal plate/bracket.  I ended up using some spacers to bring my license plate mount down about an inch to give it enough clearance under my seat.  Wiring was pretty straightforward (one black and one red wire that you splice onto the license plate light wires).  Make sure to read the instructions regarding calibrating the unit and various modes of operation.
