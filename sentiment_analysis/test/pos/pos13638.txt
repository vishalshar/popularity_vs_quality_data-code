this is my 9th notebook from code&quill and i LOVE them. they're perfect. the paper quality is top notch, i love the dot grid pages, and the size is perfect - especially if you travel for work or school. i do not have a bad word to say about them, and i'll continue to buy them until i no longer need a notebook. puts the other brands to  shame.**i paid full price for this, am in no way affiliated with the company. i just really like their stuff**
