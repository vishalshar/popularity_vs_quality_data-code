I have owned a vibrating alert device before. I wore it for about a day. I'm sure I will be wearing this one a lot longer. I work road construction. Lots of noise. I also wear noise reduction headphones, so I would miss a call or two or three. Nothing important that couldn't be returned. Sorry hon. But then my Mother got sick and every call became one I didn't want to miss .  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a smart watch all I wanted was to be notified of calls and texts. The ditto does all this and more. I'm not going to go into all of its functions, you can read that in the description. One thing I love is, NO CHARGING. Runs on a simple watch battery. I'm tired of charging everything. Its a simple device solving a simple problem, with a simple solution.
