I really like these puffs they are on the smaller side but that's okay. I love the fact that they are made with antibacterial microfiber and you can flip them inside out for another texture if you aren't into the scrunchy shower thing. I'm hoping they will hold up in time. I never had a problem with my shower scrunchies getting that dirty because I soaked them in 10% bleach and hot water solution every other week. But that does make them fall apart quicker. So I'm hoping these will hold up.
