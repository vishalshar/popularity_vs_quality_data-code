We already owned several bulbs that we bought earlier this year and have them all in groups, on schedules and synced to our Nest thermostat so they can turn on and off when auto away is activated, but really started to appreciate more of fun features of these bulbs this Halloween. We had the Halloween theme turned on and added effects like Spooky and Candle Flicker and it transformed the house! We had so many comments from neighbors that loved the effects. I purchased this bulb ahead of the Holidays to check out the advances in the new generation and light up and additional areas of the house. Setup was easy as the app found the bulb right away and then transitioned easily to the wireless network. I have found in the past that sometimes a reboot of the router is necessary to get everything setup but that was not the case this time. I also always reenter the wifi password when I add the bulb to the wireless network rather than relying on the saved password. The bulb works great and I am looking forward to what we can come up with for our Holiday lighting!
