I didn't think anything would get me to leave my trusty Fido jars for fermenting, but after trying a set of these out on half-gallon masons jars they are just too easy to deal with not to use. So I just ordered a larger set of them to move all my fermenting over to them.The pros:- They are vastly easier to clean then the normal water airlocks.- For feeding cultures like ginger bugs they are a lot nicer as well since they are easier to remove and put back on frequently.- If you are storing active ferments in your refrigerator you really can't be how low profile they are.No cons thus far, be sure that if I find one I'll be updating this review though.
