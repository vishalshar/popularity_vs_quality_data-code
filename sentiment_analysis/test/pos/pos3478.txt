I was introduced to these at a Rock n Roll Marathon.  They are light on the stomach and seem to bring the energy I need.  The box arrived and I opened it with many of the gels leaking, VERY slowly at the top seam. So slow that it isn't noticeable until several days after rinsing them off.  I thought it was only one or two at first,, turns out all  but a  few  were this way. Would have returned them but Prime returns are no longer free.  Just ordered another box, fingers crossed.
