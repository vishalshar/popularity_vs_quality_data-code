It takes a bit of adapting but I've yet to find a better way to cook jerk chicken breasts, t-bone/strip steaks or meatloaf. I cooked 8 jerk chicken breasts served with a side of 21 Seasoned potato wedges I baked and some garlic-spinach. The potatoes were more of an issue than the chicken. Ninety minutes in the water-bath, remove the bags, finish the breasts in a cast iron pan (not really necessary but it cooks off the oil). After that I just resealed the bags and tossed them in the trash. NO MESS!!! :)The meatloaf I made (first time via sous-vide) came out perfect...except for the shape. It was a bit curved but the flavor, the texture was PERFECT***NOTE: Vinegar marinated meats don't fare well. It seems the vinegar's acidity is enhanced with heat. I tried some chkn w/ balsam-vin, paprika, rosemary etc. It comes out GREAT in my toaster-oven. Cooking it with the sous-vide immersion cooker turned it into MUSH. Tasty mush but still mush :/
