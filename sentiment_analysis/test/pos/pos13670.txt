Love how seamless my Eight is. I donÂ’t look at the app everyday but I get my weekly email with all the metrics. Pretty awesome because in the past I had to open Sleep Cycle app every night. My partner is a big heating user while I like cold things and we enjoy the splitting side to warm only one side of the bed.  I had some issues during the pairing to find my wifi but they helped me to solve it and since then everything has been smooth.
