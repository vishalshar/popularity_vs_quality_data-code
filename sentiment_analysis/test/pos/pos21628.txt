Needed a affordable but reliable pack for OCR racing, and so far this has done well.  Took it through a 14 mile Spartan Beast and for a few laps (15 out of 25 miles) during a Battlefrog Xtreme.  Fits tight, no extra bounces, and so far hasn't fallen apart anywhere even if wet and caked with mud.  Only downside is lack of places to store nutrients if needed, but its sole purpose is hydration and it does that well!
