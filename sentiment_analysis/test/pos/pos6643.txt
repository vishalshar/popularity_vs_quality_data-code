I had received a free sample of this cat food from Petco.  One of my cats has a sensitive stomach and is only really good with Iams Sensitive Stomach.  Any other brand of dry cat food purchased in supermarkets and she'd throw up daily.  I gave this a try, a little bit at a time, and she really loved it, and didn't end up throwing it up.  Even after a few feedings.  It's pretty expensive, so I ordered it from Amazon, and Delilah is a happy kitty.  I did notice a change in her behavior, she's even friendlier than usual, and I noticed her coat is silkier and she feels a bit chubbier, healthier, she was kind of on the boney side.  Not anymore.  I am very happy to have found a cat food that she really likes, enjoys, and seems to thrive on.  Granted, she still occasionally throws up, but no more than when she was strictly eating the Iams SS.There was another variety of this food given as a sample that she didn't like; I don't recall which one it was.I wish it had a recloseable seal; bag is oddly shaped and a pain to clip.
