Okay - so I am updating my review based on a simply outstanding response by the company's support team.  So to help organize my review I have done a simple pros and cons...Pros:1)Delivered very quickly and the actual design (look and feel) seems a nice quality.2)Instructions included were clear and easy to follow - as long as you have basic technical abilities with a lap-top.3)Added 128 GB of memory to my 256 GB 13 inch Mac Air hard drive through the Pear 2.0 software included with the disk.4)Cheaper and much easier than ordering a new SSD with more memory and opening up my lap-top to install - kind of a no brainer.5)Chat customer service on their site - has got to be some of the best I have experienced (and I have been working in professional services firms for 20+ years).6)Technical Support was responsive, courteous, very efficient and super proactive. Again - I was very impressed.Con's1) You need to have at least 10% free of your existing hardware - which may not be an issue for some, but I would think most people who are looking for extra memory (like me) are close to maxing out.  This was not a show stopper - but it caused me to have to move a good deal of files over to an external hard drive and then delete them off of my Macbook Air's are drive.  Not ideal - the whole thing took about 20 extra minutes.2) Somehow Tardisk failed to install the Pear 2.0 software (which merges the memory of the disk with your hard drive - a.k.a. the whole reason people are buying this product), was not included on the disk (even though it should have been). I went back online and chatted with their customer support, and found out that some disks (if sold by third parties) do not come with the software.  However, my disk was fulfilled by Tardisk, so it should have had it.  Chat support told me to email Tech Support.  Tech Support then told me that if I sent my Mac's serial number they would send me the software via email.  Okay - fine, I got it, and followed all instructions again, and got further - but still no success.  As I was trying - the software asked if it could send an error diagnostic report to Tardisk, so I figured - it couldn't hurt and sent it.  This is where their tech support kicked in.  THEY took the initiative to proactively reach out right away to help - without me going back to them.  They quickly set up a "Join.me" meeting and I granted them access to my mac - and within 5 minutes we were all fixed.In conclusion - while I had a glitch getting everything set up - I could not recommend this product more - not only is it a great idea, their support team is simply top notch.
