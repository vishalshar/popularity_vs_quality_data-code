Best remote controlled robotic toy of all time!  My kids are still barely scratching the surface of all of the activities they can do with this!  There are games, there are missions, there are multiple (free) apps, there is a dose of silliness as well.  My kids (9 & 14) can't stop playing with this.  Works great on our older Apple and Kendle devices.
