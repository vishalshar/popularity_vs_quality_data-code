I've gone through a box of these now, and am impressed with the results. Previously I've used zip lock bags (useless), vacuum sealing (big mistake - cheese gets watery/greasy), and parchment paper (comes unwrapped too easily). These cheese storage bags really do keep cheese fresh and flavorful.I'll typically have cheese last in the fridge for 6-8 weeks max (before I eat it all). Personally, I have had zero mold in this time period. Obviously, your results may vary given what kind of cheese you're storing, for how long, and given the conditions of your fridge.The only negative is that the seams on the bags come apart pretty easily. Just fold the bag over if that happens - it's not supposed to be airtight anyway.
