The SOLO rocks! I have to be candid, at first I was totally not into the idea of getting a Personal Sound Amplifier, but my son and daughter URGED me to do something about the fact that I could not hear 75% of what they were saying over kitchen clamor at a recent family gathering. I really only struggle in these sorts of scenarios, so I was hesitant, but they really pleaded and they said theyd make sure I got the best of the best. WELL, I researched myself, and found elsewhere on the web that Audicus has a pretty solid reputation, so I decided to give their amplifier a try after I found it on Amazon. It is wonderful and seems to be just as advanced as any digital hearing helper on the market.The packaging was nice and everything was presented in a straightforward way. The battery was easy to put into the device, and it was pretty easy to get the hearing amplifier over and into my ear. The only difficulty I faced was with putting the round plastic dome in my ear at first. I shoved it in my ear right out of the package and the device seemed to be processing the air around the dome and in my ear and produced a sort of hissing noise. After a quick read of the manual they provided, though, I realized all I had to do was change the dome to a bigger one (they provide different sizes of these domes in the package), and then my ear canal was sealed as they say in their documentation. My daughter is getting married in September, so I used it at two parties last week with a large number of guests, and I was able to have conversations, without having asked anyone to repeat a single thing. A welcome change, if you ask me. Through using it a few times, I also got more comfortable with the volume/program changes. You can press the button to get into volume programs that are louder, softer, and/or specialized for use with speech. I like that you can control it a little bit, because sometimes I found myself needing it a little louder.  I AM NOW A BELIEVER AND HIGHLY WOULD RECOMMEND!!!
