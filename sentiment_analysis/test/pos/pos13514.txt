I bought this to use with a quart-size regular-mouth Ball mason jar. It was a perfect fit! You do have to cut the straw to the length appropriate for the jar/bottle, but I found that to be a good thing because it's pretty much universal. I took all my Febreze bottles and poured them into the mason jar. No more ugly, cheap-looking plastic; I can leave this sitting out and it looks nice. I plan to buy at least two more in the future.
