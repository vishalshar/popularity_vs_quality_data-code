Well designed and engineered product:1) Sturdy material2) Screw threads that don't bind3) No-drip spout4) Replaceable sealing gasket keeps liquids from leaking around the rim of the jarOne could quibble about the price until I consider the quality and the fact that I'll always have Mason jars available and this spout won't soon wear out.  There might be cheaper spouts available but this product should last for years - unless it melts!
