I'm a 64 year old part-time nurse.  We work all shifts...day, evening, and the ever-lovin nights. Going back and forth I believe has totally screwed up any sort of sleep routine and more than likely, actually shrunk my brain over 40 years. When younger, this was not a big deal but now sleep comes only a couple hours at a time.  I've done everything from melatonin, Ambien, beer =], exercise.  Aside from getting plenty of outdoor exercise, the Dream Water seems the most effective and least 'confused thinking' making.  I only use something to sleep once a week or less.  It doesn't let/make me sleep for more than 4 hours, but then if something did that, it would most likely be habit forming or really bad for you.  If this stuff knocked me out  for at least 6 hours WITHOUT being habit forming, it would be 5 stars but that is waaay too much to ask so I'm glad to settle for 4.
