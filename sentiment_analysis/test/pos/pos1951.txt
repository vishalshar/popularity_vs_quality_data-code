Truly loving the minipresso so much so that I've bought two of them. One for work and another for home. So far I've put about two pound of locally roasted coffee and it hasn't given me any problems.Only con is that it takes about 4 minutes to make each shot so if you're a six shot person like me it takes some time to make lolThis a great Christmas or birthday gift I would recommend it to anybody.
