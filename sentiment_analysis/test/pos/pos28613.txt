I received mine recently.  It was so easy to set up! I followed the directions.  I downloaded the app onto my iphone 6.  I plugged in the camera, chose my wifi and put in my wifi password. I calibrated it and edited some of the settings.My cat Misty loves it! I can talk to her from work and when traveling and play the laser game with her. I set it up in my bedroom upstairs. (My wifi is downstairs in an office.)  Usually Misty hangs out in my office downstairs until I get home from work, but since I got the Petcube Play, she has been hanging out in my bedroom upstairs waiting for me to get on the app and play with her. :-)I travel a lot so this will be a great comfort to me. I worry about her when I'm gone even though when i travel I have a pet sitter!This is working wonderfully! So easy and so many features! I have the motion detection and autoplay on with the Care Plan and love to go back and watch the videos of my cat playing while I'm gone.  The Autoplay at startup feature option has it use the laser to play with my cat once motion has been detected.  My cat loves it!I have the Care Plan so videos are saved to that.  I can then save the videos to my phone or computer.  I can also take photos that are automatically saved to my phone.  I have only taken photos in the dark so far.  It's fantastic that it has nightvision like that.  Sometimes the photos can be grainy due the to poor wifi problems I've been having since TWC switched me to their modem/router/Arias.  I need to geek on that a bit and may go back to my Netgear Nighthawk which had exceptional wifi range and strength.I have attached photos taken in the dark with the nightvision.  I have also attached a bit of a video to show you how that looks.I can't wait to get the Petcube Bites now.Update:  11/10/11 - I notice when I'm talking to my cat through the petcube, she goes up to it looking for me.  The only change I would like to see with it is the addition of a tiny phone sized screen that lets her see my face too.  She seems to look for me in the front of the petcube.Update 12/13/16 - Misty the Cat loves this!  She uses it to "call" me every day at lunch while I'm at work.  lol.  It notifies me of movement, so I go to the app, and there she is.  I then talk to her a bit and play the laser game.  It's great!
