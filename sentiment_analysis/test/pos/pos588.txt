I replaced my laces on my rugby shoes with these hickies because the bow would get caught in other people's cleats which is very dangerous. My boyfriend and I played a whole game of high contact, constant running, and tackling with these in our shoes. They feel comfortable, snug and held up great during our game. My boyfriend and I never even worried about our hickies snapping or coming undone. I love these and I'm buying more for the rest of my other shoes.
