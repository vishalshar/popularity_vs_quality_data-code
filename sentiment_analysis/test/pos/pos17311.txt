I waited a whole week to use this phone after receiving it and I can honestly tell you, based on cost, functionality and quality, this is by far one of the best phones out there now.Coming from everything Samsung, especially the Galaxy series, I had high hopes for Note 7, so I skipped note 5. My Note 4 was so erratic as anyone using all these phones know that you can hardly get anything great after over one year of good usage. My Note was slow in everything and I was contemplating waiting it out for Galaxy 8 edge or even Note 8.I then decided to give "middle entry or very low cost phones" a try.To be honest. Nextbit beat my imagination and performed beyond my expectations.Unlike many phones, this is one great superb gadget. It was not loaded with many bloatware, boots promptly and neatly, runs very smoothly. I think the 3G ram is way more than enough for running everything - and I literarily run everything on my phones. Schedules, Movies, Sound, whatsapp, video calls and lots more.With 32GB and 100GB cloud storage (though I would prefer a SD slot too), I don't see how you can go wrong for a device running stock android seamlessly for about $150.I was shocked to read some negative reviews. I concluded some who wrote anything funny about this phone got a defective gadget.If you're lucky as I a few days ago, and you just to stumbled on this phone, and you're reading this right now, I advise you to just buy this phone. I told my wife that I am sure the cost will go way high when many people discover Nexbit Robin.Downside; I have some problem with the name - name of the phone and company. You tell people, it is Nexbit Robin, and everyone asks what!?, but for functionality and satisfaction, who cares about the name.
