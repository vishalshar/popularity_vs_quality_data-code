Wow, what a cleverly designed bag. I've used it at home to pre-soak a few items. It's convenient and leaves my sink free for other uses. I plan to use it at the beach to carry valuables. I put my iPhone in the Laundreez and unscrew the cap to connect my earphones. Also, a great way to rinse salt and sand from swimsuits at the end of the day. And if the suits are still damp when it time to pack, I'll leave them in the Laundreez and throw in my suitcase.Laundreez Portable Clothes Washer
