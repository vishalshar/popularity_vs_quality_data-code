This is nearly perfect. It is the perfect size to clip to my bra 99.9% of the time. It step count closely accurate to my phone, to about the same degree that my Gear Fit was. I like that I can keep it under my clothes and also wear it as an accessory! It reminds me to be mindful. It has helped continue active movement habits and helped develop a quiet time/meditation habit. The stress information intrigues me. I enjoy that I don't have to charge it. I like that I can also clip it to my nightgown. I am more aware of my sleep habits and see the need to improve there. Recently it has taken it's time and multiple attempt to get it to sync. It shows it still has a full battery and it does sync, it just takes it a couple more tries. I really enjoy it and recommend it to others looking for this type of product.
