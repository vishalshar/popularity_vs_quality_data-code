I was hesitant to buy the three pack set because..... silly reason... I hate the colors. Yuck. But I'm glad I did get them. I put one in my purse, one on my key chain, and one on my iPod. Since I put these things on and making sure that I bring up the app every time I leave the house, restaurant, whatever to log location, I've only misplaced my keys once in my house. Does that sound confusing? My point is that I've adjusted the way I do things to where I don't have to have them. But if I didn't have them... I'd still be a ditz.So down to the things that people want to know about. Yes, they work just fine. I have tested the devices to fifty feet and they work. I can hear the sound they emit but I really have to listen for it and be in the same room. The application helps monitor battery state and after one month, the batteries I put in the devices are still going strong. (The batteries that came installed were dead on arrival.) I get the blister pack 2032 batteries from Amazon at a very attractive price.  The devices can ring my phone which helps find the phone but I'm still working with the new to me Android phone to figure out how to turn off the ringer. ;) The biggest issue I had with these things was figuring out how they popped apart to install the batteries and exactly how the buttons functioned (since they don't seem to bend and my initial dead batteries confused this issue.) All in all, I like these. I need these things. Now...  if I can only figure out how to find my tape measures when I leave them in my purse or refrigerator.
