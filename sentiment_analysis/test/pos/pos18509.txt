Last night I was out driving when the alarm for "Pressure too low" on my front passenger tire came on.  The other 3 tires were at 36PSI, this one was at 31PSI.  I immediately pulled into the next gas station a drove by to put some air and I immediately saw the head of a screw in my tire.  I have a 2012 Toyota Venza and the car's TPMS never came on.  Having Fobo Tire installed allowed me to find out about the problem right away.  So I was able to get home, install the spare tire, and will be taking the damaged tire for repair this morning.I've had Fobo Tire installed for 6 months now and I have not had any issues with the device.  They recently upgraded the app so you can monitor additional sensors.  So now I have one on my spare tire (so the spare was ready to go when needed), and I have them on my small 4x6 trailer.  After last night's early warning I purchased an additional Fobo Tire for my wife's car and will be getting an additional sensor for her spare tire (can be purchased directly from Fobo - FoboXtra).  And because you can monitor a number of vehicles with your app, I will be able to add her sensors to my phone.  I will update this review once I have the additional FoboTire installed.UPDATE:  Yesterday I received the Fobo Tire Plus purchased through the Amazon Marketplace.  Immediately installed it on the Mazda CX-7.  The Plus is not needed for the CX-7.  But the price was right, so I went ahead with it.  One of the features I really like is that Fobo allows you to share up to 20 vehicles in one application.  So on my phone I can see both mine and my wife's car tire pressure.  I have uploaded some additional screen shots.  Knowing the tire pressure of all our tires has never been easier.  This takes away the "guessing game" trying to find out which tire is low.Next I will be getting the T-Valves for my car to test out.  In theory, with the T-Valves I should be able to pump air into the tires without having to remove the Fobo sensor.  With the phone on my hand I will be able to see the tire pressure as I am filling it.  Will update once I get them and I find out how they work in combination with Fobo.
