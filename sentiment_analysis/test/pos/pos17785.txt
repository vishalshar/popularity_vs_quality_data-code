We've been using the Feed and Go for noon time feedings for our cocker.  She needs to have small meals each day, so this works perfectly.  I get an email notification that she will be eating soon so I can watch her on the Feed and Go app on my phone.  The picture is not perfectly sharp, but it gets the job done.  I know she has eaten!
