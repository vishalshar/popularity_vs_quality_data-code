So far so good after three days. It was initially difficult to figure out how to track hydration levels and weight until I realized I was trying to configure the last days levels. I do wish it also tracked heart rate, but for $15 I am more than okay with that. I have learned so much about my sleeping habits, and now I am actually more mindful of how much sleep I get.Overall, this is a great product that was a fantastic investment in my health tracking.
