This watch is absolutely amazing. Here are some features:1. You can change the bands easily, and customize the watch faces and the order of the applications2. There are TONS of applications. On mine, I have "Tiny Birds" which is basically "Flappy Birds," old Atari-like games, an app that lets me pay for Starbucks using my watch alone, and a personal assistant app that will set alarms, timers, tell me the weather and even set reminders throughout the day.3. It syncs flawlessly with an iPhone or Android: I have never lost connection even when my phone is on the other side of the house. My text messages come up just as fast if not faster than they do on my phone, and you can set your other application to send you updates via your watch as well!4. Fitness, fitness, fitness: This accurately tracks your steps (though it will count aggressive arm-flailing as a step occasionally), and it monitors your sleep using a movement algorithm that adjusts to your personal movements and seems to be quite accurate for me! It even tells you when you're in deep, REM sleep.5. It's water resistant, though not waterproof: Yes, you're not supposed to submerge this in the sink while washing dishes. Yes, I've submerged this in the sink while washing dishes. Yes, it still works.6. It's gorgeous and I've gotten a million and one compliments on how elegant the pebble round looks (most people don't even realize it's a smart watch).7. The battery lasts two full days straight and charges from 0-100 in around 30 minutes (so I charge it while it's off and I'm in the shower every day and never think twice about the battery).8. You can set reoccurring alarms... so as a college student, my watch wakes me up every Tuesday and Thursday by 9:30 AM without fail (and I never have to reset after the alarm goes off, the alarm will go off twice a week indefinitely until I purposefully delete it), which is great for people like me who always forget to set alarms.9. The vibrate is strong, and unlike people with Fitbits who say they no longer feel the vibrate, I've been using my pebble for two months and I still wake each morning the minute the vibrating alarm goes off.10. It's just a good life decision, okay?
