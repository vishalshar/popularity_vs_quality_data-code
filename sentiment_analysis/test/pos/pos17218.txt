I have two computers - a PC, and a Mac - and I wanted to play the same Minecraft world no matter what computer I was using, without running/paying for a realm/server.This does it!Pros:Runs a cross-platform game of Minecraft.Cons:Runs hot!  A bit slow at times - worlds can be choppy.  Bracelet is a bit bulky.
