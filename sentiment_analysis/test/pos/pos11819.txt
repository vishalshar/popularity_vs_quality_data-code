We have added this to our homeschooling rotation. It is fantastic for the kids to get a little coding in between all the boring hum-drum lessons of the day! I have incorporated each of the osmo sets into our 5 days of "school."With "coding" they use the tiles to make the monster on the screen do what he needs to do to progress.  They earn prizes, points, or game monies? I am not sure, but they love it.  We alternate this during regular school days with other osmo activities. But they also do lessons on tynker website for real coding practice.
