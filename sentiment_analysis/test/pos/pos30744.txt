Sugru is bang-on great.  Just make sure you don't try shortcuts like skipping over ensuring surfaces are clean and oil-free, or not kneading the  Sugru for a while to make sure it's fully consistent.I've used Sugru on my car's gas cap to keep the metal from hurting my fingers when I turn it.  I've used it on pot lids.  I've installed a bathroom fixture with it instead of using screws.  I've made little dots on all my USB and other cords so I can feel without looking which side is 'up'.  I've coded house keys, made drawer and door bumpers, and more. This stuff isn't cheap so plan ahead, think about how you can use leftover since you only have about half an hour at most to fiddle with it once it's exposed to air.  I keep mine in the refrigerator with a 'use by' date on it of 18 months beyond purchase.
