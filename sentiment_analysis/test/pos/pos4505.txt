My dog Murphy is a Vizsla.  The word Vizsla must be Hungarian for "Limitless Energy".  Murphy is a little over a year and we can never exhaust him.  We have been doing all that we can to "wear him out", but felt guilty that we were not doing enough.  Since Jan. 1st I started wearing a FitBit and it has made a huge difference in my training.  Wanting to measure our efforts to exercise Murphy, we saw that RubyTheTrail - World Famous Instagram Vizsla, endorsed FitBark.  That was all it took for me to pick one up for Muphy.  It has given me such peace of mind to know that despite me and my wife working full time jobs we are actually taking care of Murphy's exercise needs.  (We walk him 3.5 miles before sunrise and spend all free time playing with him when we get home). Today my trusty Fitbark app sent me a message that told me, and I quote... "At 15,916 BarkPoints per day on average, he was more active than: -96% of large sized dogs of adult age, -76% of all Vizslas, -93% of all FitBark dogs."  Whew!  That made my month!  So, daily we track Murphy's Playtime, Active-Time, Rest Time, and FitBark converts it to points.  Our daily goal for Murphy is 13,100 points.  We do not go to bed until he hits that goal.The most amazing thing about FitBark is that it requires me to help Murphy meet his goals and my FitBit totals are on the rise.  It is a win - win invention.  Get one for your best friend, and yourself.You can check out Murphy on Instagram... follow "MURPH_THE_VIZSLA" ... Also follow FitBark's best spokesdog ...
