I find STD testing to be a pretty personal thing that Id rather do privately.  I love that the kit is sent to me and all I have to do is send it back to the lab and Im done.I'm a very busy person who doesn't have time to take off from work to go to a drs office on a regular basis to get tested, however, I'm not willing to risk my health (or my partners' health) by not getting tested at all. I already do most of my shopping done online, why wouldn't i choose this option as well?The package arrives discreet which is also important to me.  I don't need my postman all in my business!
