Travel Size Foam Roller for Use as Pillow with the Body Track, MEDIUM DensityThis foam roller definitely fills the need for a pillow that rolls as you use the Massage Track. It's small enough to keep with the rest of the Massage Track and travel with if necessary. An ordinary pillow doesn't work well, so this is a very welcome addition. I'm glad that tennis balls in socks are now a thing of the past!
