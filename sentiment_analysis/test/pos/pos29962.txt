Bought as a gift for 10 year old boy and he has loved it! His older brother 12 years old didn't even open his as he thinks he's too old to play with it. Granted, it does look like something for the 8-10 year range but had lots of options and would entertain older kids if they could get past the childish appearance. The adults have certainly been entertained by the silly antics of the robot as we watch the ten year old attempt to master the controls and features. Not a bad bot for that age range!
