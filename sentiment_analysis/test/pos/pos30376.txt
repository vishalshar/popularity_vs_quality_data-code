Very nice product. Easy to setup and it's working as expected. However, I think they still need to improve on their app. When I manually run the sprinkler on each zones, the screen kept showing it's running even though it's already done. Also, the timing on the smart watering feature isn't that accurate; sometimes it shows 40 minutes for each zones which I believe it's unnecessary.
