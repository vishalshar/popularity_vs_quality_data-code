This is a great way to add security to your house or apartment. Very easy to setup and use via the app. For me, it took a little "trial and error" to get things configured correctly. I had to move the tag sensor to a different location on the front door to avoid false alarms from neighbors in the building slamming doors, etc. Once I did that, it's all working perfectly and reliably. It's a great way to monitor your place without the privacy issues of cameras. And it's very affordable compared to other options. I highly recommend this product.
