UPDATE 15 OCTOBERProblems solved.  And I love them.  The problem was completely on my side.  The Lifx support was great.  They replaced all 3 of my Lifx 800 bulbs with the Lifx 1000 (full color changing).  And did not require the return of the original 3.  Now I've got 6 working bulbs and they haven't disconnected since solving my problem.THE SOLUTION - An issue wth the proliferation of WiFi enabled devices is how many devices your router can support.  Most can do up to 16, but some less.  I have an Arris Surfboard gateway router and it seems to be less.  The difficulty in troubleshooting was that the bulbs were the first to get kicked off, not my phone, tablet, tv etc.  So I was pretty sure it was the bulb.I was so determined to like these that I added a slave router, Linksys E1200 which was recommended on the Lifx site and can handle up to 48 WiFi devices.  I found a refurbished one on Amazon for under $30.  Googled how to set this as a slave router and PROBLEM SOLVED.I set all my smart devices to that router SSID and Alexa and haven't had a problem yet now about 3 weeks into it.  I test them often.This requires a little bit of knowledge on your router, and how to access and change settings.  May not be for everyone, but if you can do it, it's probably worthwhile.  Only more WiFi devices coming along.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I really wanted to like this product.  I love the features.  But . . .I have 3 bulbs.  The first one worked well until I added others.  Now, none stay connected reliably to the wifi.  I've tried all the solutions offered by Lifx support with no improvement in results. Lifx blamed my router - an Arris Surfboard.  I've also tried assigning static IP addresses with no change in behavior.  However, I've got smart switches from TP-Link which have never disconnected from the wifi.  I'm going to try on of their bulbs.UPDATE - 9/6/16  Lifx offered to replace all 3 bulbs.  I'll give them credit for that.  I'll update this when I can try out new ones.
