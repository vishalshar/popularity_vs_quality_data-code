Yay. I had no idea that some bananas were tossed out instead of being used; I'm really impressed that a company is upcycling "bad" bananas. I thought they were a little expensive, but I was willing to try something new as a snack  for my son, 2 years old and of course, he loves them. So, I'll keep buying them as a treat because of the price. Regarding the flavor, it's pretty simple: peanut butter and banana. Usually peanut butter snacks have a fake peanut butter taste, but not these. I actually swiped a few from my son; not my finer moment, but it's because they're yummy.
