Am pretty impressed really. Damn useful. Easy install. Perhaps a little large and looks somewhat cumbersome,  but very good, very accurate. Trouble is now that I see the accurate pressures every day, it reminds me every day how lucky I have been not to have been killed already on my bike. This thing shows me that the tyres made locally here must be porous or riddled with holes. Losing 10lbs pressure a day, even brand spanking new, couple with the fact that driving skills here are also non-existent (you would think that drivers here have heads as hole-riddled as the tyres must be).....OMG.....hahaha.....but I love Fobobike.
