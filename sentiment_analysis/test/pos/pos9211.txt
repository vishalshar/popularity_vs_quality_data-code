This product is OUTSTANDING. My daughter's 4 month old Dobermann had a very bad case of wart virus (warts all over his gums, lips, tongue and body). It meant we couldn't let him play with other young dogs, his breath was horrendous and his saliva made everything smell bad, they looked terrible, and looked as though they may progress and affect his eating etc. He had already had one surgery for a big one - which grew back and the vet said there weren't many other options. The warts were only getting bigger and spreading. We researched and got this product sent to us all the way to little old New Zealand! We gave him a double dose (4 scoops for his size - 20kg) mixed in some wet food (to hide the powder - he didn't mind it like this) once a day for 3-4 weeks. ALL of his warts have completely gone... We are now giving him a maintenance dose of one scoop a day, and the warts are not coming back (he is now 7 months old). I recommend this product hugely for the Canine Wart Virus. There are not many cures for this - and this product has really worked.
