This turned out to be a really fun and smart device.  I used Mevo to shoot my kids' school performance, and it was incredibly easy to track their movements, pan and zoom in.  Amazing that this little product has so much intelligence built into it.  I am not an expert videographer, but Mevo enabled me to product something that looked pretty professional.It takes a little bit of tinkering with the app to figure out how to take full advantage of the features, but it's pretty intuitive overall.A great holiday gift!
