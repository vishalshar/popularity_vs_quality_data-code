Had it 4 days so far. I think this is the best phone I've owned at this price point. Of course, the last phone I owned was a Sony Xperia which cost me $500 and was a total piece of garbage (not to mention that their customer service was worse than garbage) so arguably my bar is low. But still - love it.
