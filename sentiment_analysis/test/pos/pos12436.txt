I was pleasantly surprised.  I was unsure as to how well this would hold up and how much I would be able to hold.  I don't use a mirror much and didn't need this one, but I can hold four cards/IDs plus a reasonable amount of cash.  This has held up well and is easy to open but stays closed when it is supposed to.  It is bulky, unfortunately, but I knew it would be.  I have had it for a few months and I still feel it was a very good purchase to accommodate my needs.
