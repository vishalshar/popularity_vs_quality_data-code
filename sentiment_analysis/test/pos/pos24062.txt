This is my second UAG case and once again I'm extremely satisfied. Their cases are lightweight and sleek while still offering excellent protection and grip. The first thing you'll notice about this case is that it fits the phone like a glove. The holes are precision cut and there is no "wiggle room" for the phone. Because I had one for my galaxy S3 I can assure you that the case will not stretch out so you'll retain that tight fit forever. Get a UAG case and a tempered glass screen protector and never look back
