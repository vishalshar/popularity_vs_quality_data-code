When I first opened Chip's box I was relieved to find him in one piece since I hate screwing things together! The instructions were much less intimidating than I was anticipating. My son downloaded the app onto my phone with ease and got playing with Chip right away. Chips listens to instructions but like most dogs seems to have a mind of his own! There's also a feature that has Chip dancing and playing music. My son loves that feature but it's loud! It takes a little while to figure out all the features but overall it's pretty comprehensive. Chip is a well made, high quality toy that'll keep your child occupied and entertained.
