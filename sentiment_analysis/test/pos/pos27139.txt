I love my new smartwatch! I have previously owned the Pebble Time and I sold it because I didn't like the look of it. It looked a little too cartoony for me with the enormous bezel, and it was very easy to scratch plastic. But I have been missing having a pebble on my wrist. I checked the pebble website and noticed the Pebble 2 SE - only $99! I was excited to find that this device did NOT have a heart rate monitor. To me, that is completely overkill for my smartwatch and I am thrilled that Pebble has offered a HR-free option at a cheaper price. I just want something that gives me seamless notifications at a glance and tells the time. I'm happy that Pebble still provides an option for people like me!As far as the pebble 2 itself goes, I am pleased with the design. it is slimmer and sleeker than previous models. I also like that there is no gap where the buttons are, so dust can't get stuck in between the button and the casing. The plastic on this case doesn't seem like it is going to show scratches nearly as much as the Pebble Time did.I'm super happy with it! I love the Timeline interface, the subtle notifications, and the fun watchfaces. I don't mind that this watch does not have a color display - it's highly visible in all conditions. It's pretty much my idea of a perfect smartwatch.
