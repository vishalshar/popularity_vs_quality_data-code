I've been playing with this for a few months now and so far, it has performed exactly as expected. It looks great on my dresser, the wood looks beautiful. I tested out every feature, and so far the only thing I'm not happy with is the radio reception, it definitely works but it's easy to lose the signal and sounds fuzzy sometimes. But I didn't buy this for the radio so in no way does it affect my use of this machine. Records sound great on it, and I was pleasantly surprised by the speaker quality. They're pretty nice for something in the $100-$200 range. Not extraordinary by any means, But I'm not spending $2,000 now, am I? This would be a very good player for beginners and for someone who wants to appreciate their collection while on a tighter budget. The instructions are incredibly easy, and the player comes all in one piece. Mine came with a remote control, which works okay and only controls volume and the ability to skip songs on CD's. I absolutely love the bluetooth feature, I connect it to my phone all the time to play the music I don't have physical copies of.
