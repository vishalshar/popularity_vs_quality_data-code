So amazing for baking bread and pizza.  I have a Breville oven and use that most often, unless I need the larger oven for something.  So when I decided to get a baking steel, I wanted one to fit the Breville.  This does that perfectly.  And the first time I used the steel for homemade pizza, I knew I would never have to get pizza from a pizzeria again!  It was marvelous.  I then used it to bake one of my artisan loaves and it was equally glorious.  I am so delighted that I purchased this.  Yes, it is pricey but the end products made with the steel make it very much worth it.  I bake all of my own bread that was good before.  Now it is great.
