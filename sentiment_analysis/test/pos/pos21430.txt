I was searching for the perfect apple chip to add to salads. "Bare fruit"  produces a delicious, crisp, sweet, chip. I add them to salad, cereal, and eat them out of the bag. So good and as a bonus, low calorie and healthy. I recommend these to everyone. Salad eating will become an incredible treat.
