Resolution could be better, but by far the best IR solution I've found for price. Very useful for a dozen different things (many of which didn't plan to have it for, but then realized it would be useful... such as finding lost pets in the dark.Typical search time for pet: 2 hours. New search time for pet: 85 seconds. (HEY, There's a glowing cat in that bush over there!)
