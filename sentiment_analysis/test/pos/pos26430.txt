So this soap.....  Recommended to me from a friend who spoke of the magical qualities of this soap.  I have been using it regularly for weeks now and I have noticed a significant difference in my facial complexion.  I can't use this soap on my body, as it is very harsh and I can't use other soaps like Dial or Irish springs, but I use it only on my face and neck.  IT IS AMAZING!!!  My complexion is remarkably different and I love it.  The smell of the soap is very industrial to me.... like dirt from a steel mill.  The bar itself is brown and in the lather you can see the specks of coffee that the soap is made of.  It will leave a brown residue on white or light colored tile but as it is soap, it washes off.  However, being a normal human, I don't clean my bathroom everyday, so seeing a little puddle of brown goo around the soap is a little yuck... Still the results are worth it...Hope the results are from the soap and not just from the fact that I am finally washing my face regularly.  We will see how long this fad stays in place.
