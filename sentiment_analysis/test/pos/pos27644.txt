First of all, the most important part of the headphones (the speakers) work great.  The sound quality is nice, the fit is very comfortable, the cord is plenty long.  As a pair of functioning headphones the quality on these is very good.  Additionally, my son had a blast decorating them.  I was surprised the provided markers drew so well on plastic (and dried hard and permanently).  He didn't use the spray paint provided, but my daughter did on a piece of paper.  She had fun and made a cool little piece of art.  After her 7 year old experimentation without my knowledge, I will provide you with the following advice: USE A DISPOSABLE TABLE CLOTH WITH THE SPRAY PAINT.  It squirts out of a pump bottle, and there was definitely some paint speckles on my table and chairs.  I caught it fast enough to clean it up.  Thought I would give you fair warning.  The markers and paint are really good quality (this is from an art teacher) and work well with the plastics of the headphones.  I would definitely recommend this!
