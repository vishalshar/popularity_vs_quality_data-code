Wow!  If you have baby fine hair, this product will wake your hair up!  Seriously, this product was used on me by my stylist.  I am not too  good at re-creating what she can do so effortlessly with product (I usually use too much or too little and never the same result).  This stuff gives lift to my hair like no other product I've used.  Only drawback - use VERY LITTLE or you will have extremely stiff hair that is difficult to style.  Just a smidge throughout your roots will give great results.  You also will need to shampoo out the next day in order to not have hair feel "caked on."
