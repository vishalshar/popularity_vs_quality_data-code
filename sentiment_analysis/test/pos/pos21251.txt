I've had the Turtle Shell 2.0 for around a month now and have absolutely no complaints whatsoever.Comes in a cool drawstring pouch that will fit the speaker as well as its charger and aux cord with plenty of room to spare. The sound quality is truly amazing, and the 360 degree projection is no joke- you can hear it clearly from any perspective. If you're at all hesitant about it being waterproof, don't be. I use it in the shower and rain regularly. The 16 hour battery life actually seems like conservative estimate- I've accidentally left it playing all night/all day and had it keep going strong for the next few days after still. It also charges from 0-100% in less than an hour which is absolutely awesome. It stays connected at over 30 feet ever with multiple walls in the way. With all its features, and no glitches, the Turtle Shell 2.0 is a total steal for anything less than 150$. Plus it comes with stickers. Who doesn't love a good sticker.Both the unique shape, as well as all the color options it comes are sure to help you stand out. Everyone who sees it cant help but say they love it. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself one of these guys, and go check out the rest of Outdoor Tech's awesome stuff.
