Crunchy and tasty, sometimes a little overwhelming with the caramel taste and twang of the apple. I probably should have sampled a bag before buying a box, they sounded good; but sometimes too much of a good thing. I still have multiple bagsafter a couple months, because they are good , not great. My taste not necessarily yours, you may love them. In my house if food items lounge around, it means they are okay, if gone quickly then they are great.
