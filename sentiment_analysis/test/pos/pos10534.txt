This is absolutely THE VERY BEST paleo bread I have ever tried.For a diabetic who chooses to address this disease with a paleo lifestyle, the nutritional content is flawless. Only 100 calories and 11 grams of carbs per serving, with 5 grams of protein and 6 grams of "good fat". It is gluten free, soy free, grain free, dairy free and low carb. And for Paleo People who do not fear fat, this is a dream come true.But the nutrition facts don't mean a thing if it isn't tasty and satisfying, and that is where this product really shines. It is so yummy that I cannot believe it is made up of short, simple list of ingredients that fully comply with the demanding restrictions of "paleo". The secret ingredient is Apple Cider Vinegar, which is added to the mix along with eggs and oil. This gives Artisan Bread a distinct flavor of old fashioned sourdough bread. I love, love, love it!What is more, this bread actually competes with mainstream, grain based bread enough to interest my husband who is not Paleo and has no health issues that would require him to restrict his diet. He absolutely raves about this and I end up making it quite often because it gets eaten pretty fast around our house.I have type 2 diabetes, Celiac Disease, and numerous food sensitivities, and I know the frustration of a restricted diet that leaves me feeling unsatisfied. Finding something that falls well within the parameters of my dietary demands, that doesn't make me sick and that is also yummy and filling is a real find. I'll never be without this again!
