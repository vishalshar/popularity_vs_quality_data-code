This is truly an amazing piece of tech.  I was looking at the UE boom, which in itself is not a bad speaker and has some great features such as the software equaliser, the ability to use in stereo, the built in tripod mount and its very stylish looks.  However, i saw a review on a US web site that compared the UE Boom to the Fugoo and I was intrigued straight away.  You cannot buy the Fugoo in the UK so I contacted Fugoo who responded immediately and suggested that I purchase from Amazon.  So I took a punt based upon the Fugoo web site and some of the reviews, as well as the plethora of YouTube "non-commercial" reviews.  Amazon did a great job, and the Fugoo was with me in 7 days with just the normal postage and package options.When it arriver, I was marginally disappointed with the packaging as it didn't seem as "apple-esque" as the UE Boom.  However once unpacked, the firmware flashed to allow the switching to loud mode, I was no longer disappointed.  What a great device with a really rich and clear sound.  I was able to connect to three devices very quickly with no issues.  I also tried it as a speaker phone with my iPhone 5S and this worked a treat.I was also able to compare side by side with my friend's UE boom and I am so pleased that I purchased the Fugoo.  The Fugoo looks and is rugged, I have soaked mine, thrown it across a room, dropped it on a rocky beach, used it in the shower and it looks as new.  The sound is so much brighter then the Boom - the boom made acoustic guitar sound dull and very muffled, and although the bass on the boom seemed to have more thump, overall the Fugoo sounds more natural. The Fugoo has much better capability with mid range, treble and is much clearer on the vocals.  We tried a number of tunes from Metal, acoustic, some classical and vocal stuff and the Fugoo wins out.So - in summary, the Fugoo is a grey little speaker, its tough, waterproof and has a battery that lasts forever.  I have still to charge mine, from the first charge on purchase.  I use it all the time as a conference facility for the phone, and it works well with Siri.  OK there isn't the software to control it, and you need to buy an accessory to tripod mount it, BUT, these are small considerations when its high quality sound you are looking for in a package that will survive with you on trips in the great outdoors,Well done to Fugoo - and lets hope they continue with their innovation.
