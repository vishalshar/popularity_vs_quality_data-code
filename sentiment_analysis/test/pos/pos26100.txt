My name is Courtney and I am now 4 weeks along after taking premamma for 2 months. My husband Travis and I have been TTC for almost a year. I'm 25 and he's 44, so we were so worried that the age difference would be an issue. After trying up until just recently, I began taking this every day. I bought my first box on Aug. 1st and found out that we are 4 weeks in on Oct. 1st. ^_^ we are so excited. I honestly believe this drink mix is what helped push us there!!
