I didn't realize this when purchasing, our grill has only 3 burners and this would need a normal sized grill with 4 burners.  This was my error, but don't let it be yours.I've been sitting on the review forever because I haven't been able to use the Pizza Oven.  It looks great, it's exceedingly heavy and seems durable.  It has a protective bag, and I'd really love to use it BUT... it doesn't fit on our grill.  I'm rating it based on the perceived quality.
