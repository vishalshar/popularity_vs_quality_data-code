I bought this product as a gift for someone who is part of a soccer supporter group called the Viking Army.  So it was perfect.  When it arrived I checked to see the quality of the item and it is surprisingly well made.  The plastic of the cup is much thicker and sturdier then I thought it would be. I also love the neck strap.  The part that does around the horn is rubber so you do not have to worry about it slipping out easily.  The only negative I have is that the stand feels a little flimsy but it is not a deal breaker.  When I showed my husband the drinking vessel he fell in love and so I had to buy two.
