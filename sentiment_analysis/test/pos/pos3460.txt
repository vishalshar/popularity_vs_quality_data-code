Excellent, quality and signal strength are outstanding. Especially in my bedroom, it performs 10 times much better than the previous antenna (from another brand, same price) I had before. This one is much more reliableI would definitely recommend it.By the way, now I'm thinking to change the antenna from the TV in my living room for this one; despite, that antenna performs alright the signal strength is not so strong and I have to play with the channels every time I turn on the TV in order to get reliable signal strength, with this one stays strong as soon as I turn on the TV.
