Excellent and innovative product!!!!! I've always charted my rounds by hand writing them out. But this does all the work for me now. I love that it gives you exact distances. It analyzes your game statically and shows you where you're losing shots. It shows your weaknesses and where you should spend time practicing. This product is great now in the early stages....Its going to just get better and better as they develop new ways to analyzes your game! If your a serious golfer who spends a lot of time on your game then  is a great product for you.....
