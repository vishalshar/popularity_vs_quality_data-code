I live in a small apartment with no room for a TV and for the past 6 months I have been searching high and low for an awesome projector---and then I found the Rif6 Cube. The product came in a slick black box including many accessories--4 cables, charger, remote, tripod mount, and tripod. The Cube itself fits in the palm of your hand and reminds me of a GoPro. The item feels high quality and is very easy to get setup with your phone, computer, gaming device, etc. Given the size of this item, I am impressed with how outstanding the resolution is. While the audio could be improved, for a small device like this the volume is what you would expect. For maximum sound quality,  you can just hook up a blue tooth speaker or headphones. My favorite part about this item is the flexible tripod stand which you can bend to wrap around almost anything. For example, in my bedroom, it fits perfectly on the back of my bed frame to project on the wall in front of me and in my basement, wraps around my ceiling fan or I set it on a table. The cube really is as versatile as it gets, not to mention that you can bring it anywhere because of its size or carry it in your pocket. All in all, I am nothing but happy about this purchase. There are few good options out there and this item definitely deserves a 5 star rating. I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for a projector and wants something with a great design, high quality and resolution, portable, small, and versatile. I really think this item is the next big thing so definitely don't pass up on the opportunity to buy this great product.
