I have been looking for something to replace my scrub that has synthetic beads and Thrive turned out to be a wonderful replacement. It has a refreshing earthy (coffee like) smell and the scrub turned out to be a very deep clean. I am going to try to face wash now. It is also convenient to be able to order from Amazon.
