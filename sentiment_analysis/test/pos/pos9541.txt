Love this mouse.  I had been using a Logitech G302 for about a year and a half before this and it was an extremely fluid transition.  I use somewhere in between a palm and finger tip grip and it's extremely comfortable for me.  Great grip, feel, build, style and precision.  Only flaw I can see is that I don't think the RGB the LED lighting colors are 100% correct.  This doesn't change how good of a mouse this is though.  I bought this mouse for CSGO and it has met all my needs.My hands size are pretty average. 19 cm base to tip and 9 cm from thumb to knuckle.I recommend this mouse if you don't want a very large mouse.
