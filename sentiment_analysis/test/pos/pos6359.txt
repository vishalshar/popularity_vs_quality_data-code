As a comic illustrator, this ruler is pretty handy for creating circular objects like balls, planets, lights, radial construction lines, even explosions. I like that I can use my drawing hand to control the pressure of the line as I draw it, unlike a compass. Also, no holes left in my paper is cool too. I just wish that they made a smaller version for around 1" - 3" circles.
