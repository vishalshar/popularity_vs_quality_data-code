The new Canary Flex is a great upgrade from the original Canary.  Packaging is sleek and very easy to unbox. Set Up took 6 minutes (literally).The camera quality is awesome, especially in dark light. The smaller design is perfect for concealing in a book shelf, corner of a wall or next to components near my TV.I'm looking forward to playing around with locations and mounting one in my garage.
