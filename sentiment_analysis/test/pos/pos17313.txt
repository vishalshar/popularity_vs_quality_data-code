The Robin has a quality feel and quite unique appearance. Performs all tasks well for me as a moderate user of a phone.I would give 5 stars on bang for buck alone and am very pleased in most aspects and would surely buy it agin if it were lost or stolen.There are 2 things that keep me from 5 stars however:Its a bit bigger in my hand than I expected and I already have big hands - I come from a Nexus 5 and like that size.It seems to me that this is quite a brittle phone and I fear the day I drop it or have it in the back pocket of a tight pair of jeans(its Xmas - my jeans are tighter)I am awaiting my Dbrand skins so feel that this may add a little sturdiness. I don't like clunky cases so won't be getting one which may negate this phone's achilles heel.
