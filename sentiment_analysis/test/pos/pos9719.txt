ok im not going to write a lot about this, because not too much needs to be said. it works exactly like advertised, and is quite possibly the best invention and most amazing accessory for a macbook that I've ever seen.Its seamless, you literally can't tell that anything is there, it doesn't stick out AT ALL. It has a tiny little notch so it is easy to remove (remember to safely remove your disc!) And there are AMAZING prices for micro SD cards available on sale everywhere, even here on amazon! I bought 2 128 gb cards, and I am planning on buying a 200 gb sandisk card. Supposedly, there will be a 512 gb card coming out later this year. That will literally give me more hard drive space than my macbook air originally came with. Amazing.
