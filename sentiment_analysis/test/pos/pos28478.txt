Awesome device,  it connected in 4G in Miami and in Colombia,  South America within  a few minutes.  I tried calls over whatsapp and they were crystal clear in both countries. Data usage was as expected,  and it is very cheap and convenient compared to using sim card from other countries.  It also connects to wifi for updates and has 2 extra sim  card slots in case you need them.  Great device.
