I received a voucher to try this product. I will update the review once I have had the device for a bit longer.I was interested in the product as I sometimes have a hard time finding my keys or wallet after a night of drinking ( this is insurance against myself). The product is packaged in a minimalist package. The set manual is provided and setting up consist of downloading the TrackR app.The product itself is about the size of a quarter and is by far the lightest keychain I have on my key ring ( this is ideal for slipping in your your SO's belonging without them noticing). The product itself is intuitive. There is a button on the keychain that will set off your phone. The phone app has a button that will set off the keychain. I tested the range, bluetooth capability, and finding my phone while the phone is in silent mode.I was worried that turning off bluetooth would cause the device to be re-synced. That is not the case. The device automatically reconnects.The device will not be on the phone's bluetooth connectivity list (great feature so people don't know you are tracking them if they view your bluetooth list.)I put my phone on silent mode to test if the keychain will still allow me to find my phone. The phone still rang while in silent mode (great feature if you want to drive your SO crazy in the middle of the night. You can hold the find button and make your SO question your relationship, even if you are sleeping on the couch and in the other room).I tested the bluetooth range. I was able to walk across 3 rooms and still use the ringer function. It does seem to have trouble the more walls there are between the phone and the keychain (perfect for annoying people across the room).I tried using the functionality of the GPS locator. The phone had a hard time connecting to the device even if I was next to it. I would think that this device is most useful in a situation where you lost your keys in your room or house (I was sad that I could not track a person or item actively). If you are in a busy and loud environment, this would make finding your belongings a bit trickier.TL;DR- great present for people who lose their things in their house or car. I have already gifted one to a relative. This device would be great to annoy your SO.Note: reviewer does not have an SO.
