Have been using the phone for about a week and I love it, It took me a bit to get use to it but now I almost have it all figured out, The one thing that I am not to crazy about is that the phones casing is not too sturdy. So if anyone is planning to buy this phone I suggest that you buy a phone case and screen before using it .
