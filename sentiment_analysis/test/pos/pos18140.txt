Really like the convienience of the keypad.  Pushing the August logo once we've closed the door, locks the August Smart Lock.  Great for the kids for coming and going to the park.  Wish the batteries lasted longer.  We have had to change the batteries in the main door unit already and it's only been just over a month.
