I love my phone, I have had it for a while now and I don't know if it's because I was using a Windows phone for so long but it's just night and day better than any phone I've had previously. I have noticed some issues but they are minor, my self facing camera seems to have developed some weird white spots and I've attempted to clean the lens but they remain, they are not always noticeable though so I am not bothered. The fingerprint reader is terrible but not something I bother with anyway so again for me it was no big deal, I got it to work a few times but most of the time it took more time to unlock through that method than the PIN.
