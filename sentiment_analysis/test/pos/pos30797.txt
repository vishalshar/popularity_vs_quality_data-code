They work as long as your body temperature comes back down to normal, and you allow your body to dry. Otherwise your sweat mess will make you think these are sticky, but they're not, you're the slimy one.  A buddy of mine uses body sprays before working out, and claimed these wipes didn't work well, but the reason it failed for him was because of that perfumed nonsense he used before working out, and the bacteria that collected since on top of that perfumed junk. Don't put on other products then put this on, this neutralizes many tough smells, by itself, perfumed products makes smells worse, especially when combined with this. I'd like to see a version of these with anti-staph, anti-ringworm, anti-shingles, etc formulas for post-martial arts use that doesn't smell as harsh as some of the other products I use (heavy Tea Tree Oil). Getting on the train, going home smelling homeless is not a good thing.Being individually wrapped is a big plus. You can throw one in your pants pocket and do a big hike, wipe up and be off, no need to carry a huge, resealable pack around everywhere when you're not carrying a gym bag.
