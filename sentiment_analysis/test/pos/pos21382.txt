I hate carrying around a purse, and am always looking for a better alterbative that I can just stick in my pocket.  For the past couple of years, I have been using phone cases with wallets attached, and this has solved my conundrum.  However, I have fine hair and it always needs to be brushed, and I googled this product thinking maybe I would invent it if it didnt exist.. and what do you know.. it actually did exist! It was a little pricy for a piece of metal, but the use and convenience I get out of it is priceless. It stays in my phone wallet case, in my pocket at all times and is just prfect for business events, meetings, travelling, or anywhere I go where I don't want to have to carry a bag into the bathroom constantly. It is very high quality and thick metal, too. Highly recommend
