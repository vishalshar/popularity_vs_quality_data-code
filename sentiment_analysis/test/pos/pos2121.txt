This is my second of these cases. The first was for an iPhone 6, which is now my work phone. For my personal phone, I got my husband's iPhone 6+ when he upgraded. I didn't even consider any other cases for it! That said, I'm expecting the grippy rubbery coating to wear of where the car holder grabs it, like the other did. And the detents which hold the case open as a tripod for the phone will wear out over time, too. Still the best case I've used.
