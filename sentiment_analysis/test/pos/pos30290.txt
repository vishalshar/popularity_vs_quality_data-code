This has been an awesome find for us! We really love our Yumbox and we still use it, but my 2 year old is definitely a hot food kinda guy. Now, I can pack his morning snack, lunch and afternoon snack all in 1 container. The top is very easy for little hands to turn & open. Elementary-aged child will have no problem opening this in the cafeteria, where help may not be available. The cold food compartments are pretty deep. You can get a good amount of food in there with no problem! We love taking our OmieBox to school, the park, beach, poolside and even to restaurants! If you have a picky eater that will probably refuse the kid's meal you purchase, no need to waste that money anymore. Pack this OmieBox with food they WILL eat and you're all set! Everyone enjoys their time together.
