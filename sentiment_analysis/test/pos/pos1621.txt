Works great for our miniature dachshund, Miles! He learned how to use it in under a week. Balls are small and a little pricey to replace, but I think that trumps the use he gets out of it. We've had it for about a month and no issues yet.  I recommend the low setting for indoor use. A lot of fun for our dog and a lot of laughs for us.
