Was so happy to find this! My cats LOVE my laser pointer but I just don't have time to stand around doing it all day. This was the perfect solution. I noticed other reviewers complaining about it going up on the ceiling. Which is perfect for any lazy cat who just wants to lay back and watch the laser in action. However, I decided to wedge it in between some books so I could angle it and now it only goes on the floor and they are able to chase it. Now I just wish there was a setting option for longer than 15 min!
