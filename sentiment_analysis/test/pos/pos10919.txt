This is a fabulous product! Originally was purchased as a way to keep one of our cats, who was diabetic, on track eating his special low carb food. Sadly, he recently died of pancreatic cancer. We have discovered, however, that it's perfect for our two remaining cats, as well. We are out of town quite a bit and this is perfect for portion control and eliminates the need for our pet sitter when it's just a weekend away. Definitely beats just leaving out a huge bowl of dry food while we're gone. Also, it's really fun to see them on the webcam! Customer service has just been stellar. I've had a couple of questions and Alex, who Is the inventor/president, has responded right away with answers. Outstanding turn around time. Just can't say enough about the Feed and Go:)
