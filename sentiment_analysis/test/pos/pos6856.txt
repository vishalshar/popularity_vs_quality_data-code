Well made charging device, with 2 USB ports (2.4amps). Charges your phone and tablet VERY fast. This is the perfect device for a traveler. I travel all the time for work, and use it in airports and on the plane. For those extended flights, keeps the laptop topped off and ready when I deplane.  I really enjoy using this product and find it useful for charging all of my devices including my laptops, my phone, and my surface.
