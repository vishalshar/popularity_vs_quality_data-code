I used these for camping a few weeks ago and worked great. I got about 3 uses per individual package. When using in smaller then directed portions, it can be a challenge to get to light and stay lit. But once it gets going, it stays lit. It rained about everyday, but it worked as advertised on the wet wood. Just had to use a bit more. It should be known that the wood was pretty damp. As it had been raining off and on since mid June. About 2 months worth.
