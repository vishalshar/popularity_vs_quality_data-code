I purchased the Raticator after seeing a field rat next to my garage.  Following the instructions, I pre-baited the area one night and then placed and baited the Raticator.  Next morning, I had a rat in it, just as advertised.  The following morning, I had a mouse.  I haven't caught anything since.  Are there really no more out there???  I'll keep trying.  But it does seem to work as advertised!  Much cleaner than a traditional trap.
