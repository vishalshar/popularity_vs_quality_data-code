Very well made, but pricey.  Fit perfectly with fine smooth threads.  Really like the Gunmetal finish.  Appear to have high optical quality.  Easy install but be careful not to cross thread and take many turns on/off.  The factory snap on gimbal  lock will not fit with filter on.  Came in crumby little draw string bags, with extra strings serving no apparent use,  and very cheesy bubble pack.  At this price they could throw in a good quality padded case and little plastic boxes.  (Like every other decent quality camera lens filter ever sold)
