We loved it until it broke.....I believe I bought a damaged product. Two days after using it it completely died and wouldn't charge, nor would it connect to its own wi-fi.  I called Anki and they are replacing it at no cost. I was very pleased to hear that the company was willing to send us a new one, knowing we had bought it from Amazon. All is good, at least my son was able to open it for Christmas morning.
