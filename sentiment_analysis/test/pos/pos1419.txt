Edit (7/27/16): A customer service rep mentioned she thought the issue I was having was related to my Spire missing a rubber backer piece. After wearing for a couple weeks the new tracker Spire mailed me, I wanted to add in the review that she was absolutely correct. I've had zero issues with the tracker falling off while wearing it.Edit (7/13/16): I've upgraded my review to 4 stars after receiving customer service that went above and beyond what I see from other companies. Spire contacted me and have graciously provided a new tracker. Thank you for great customer service.______It's a great concept, and I like that it actually appears to do a good job tracking your breath. The big downside is it clips onto your belt. Multiple times over my two weeks of owning my Spire I had it fall off of my jeans during normal physical activity. Today it fell off somewhere in my travels and is now lost for good. This is an issue I've never had with the multiple Fitbits I've owned over the past 3+ years. Basically I feel as if I spent $100 for two weeks of pretty good data. If they find a way to ensure it won't fall off while doing something as simple as picking up a couple bags of mulch, I'll consider buying another one.
