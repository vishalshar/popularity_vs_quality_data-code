the neodymium magnet is very strong.  It's very handy as you can slap your phone up on any hunk of steel you can find.  The case is well-constructed & fits the iPhone very snug.  I really like how low profile the case is on the front.  The lip comes up slightly past the glass just enough to give full protection, but w/o interference to operation.I use this case on my work phone & have dropped it several dozen times.  Adds a great deal of protection w/o being bulky & cumbersome.  It's held up well & works as advertised.  Would certainly recommend.
