Not a terrible product, my wife seems to be enjoying it.  Her only grief is that it doesn't slughtly foam up as much as she would like (she isn't expecting it to be shaving cream, but it is a little difficult to tell where its been applied).  Great news is that even though it is a super tiny bottle, it goes a long way.  So when you open it up and can't believe you spent so much on so little, know that it lasts awhile.
