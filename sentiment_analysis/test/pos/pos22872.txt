I love this bell. It's not loudly obnoxious.  It's a nice light bling, bling.  I've been using it to commute daily and it serves the pedestrians well.  As much as I love sneaking up on peds...it's not the best idea for those folks that are older or mobility limited.  And then you have ppl with their phone distractions whilst on the shared bike/ped paths and it helps them not get run over by me also.I like the retro look to it also.  I placed it on the left side of my handlebars...close to the index shifter so it was easy to reach in time of need.
