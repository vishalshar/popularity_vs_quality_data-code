It really well considering it's not a medication. It definitely helps me fall asleep and feel relaxed. It is a little hard to get it in just the right spot on your forehead. If I could do it every time I would give it a 5. I also wish it came with a little better instructions or some better tips on the placement. Getting it in the right spot makes all the difference in the world! When it is in the right spot there are times you wish it would just keep going and never shut off. I have not used the energy yet but I'm hoping it will work as well as the calm.
