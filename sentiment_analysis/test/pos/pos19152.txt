Nice WATERPROOF case. I had been waiting since July for this band and received last week. Case is the style I expected from Lunatik. Though slightly bigger than my Catalyst case and taller on wrist I like the "Manly/ Bigger" look. I have not worn long enough to comment, but hoping with size difference case doesn't interfere / hit objects and I don't trigger the crown as I did with my past Epik case- So far 2 days & no issuesI really like the color... body is navy blue and red. Band is a little deceiving as it appeared to me 2 tones of grey on band, but it's actually white & grey. I reached out to Lunatik and they sent me a black band which is a better fit for me and my work ( won't show dirt/ discolor)Band feels great on arm and is soft. I have had no issue in the few hrs I have worn with crown not functioning correctly. I tested heart rate trouble free and no issues what so ever with any functions. Watch sits on my charger/ holder (aftermarket) with no trouble.Install takes minutes after water test. Nothing to report there, easy as can be. No pictures in directions, just steps/ words.I have included some pics for reference between Epik H20 & Catalyst ....If anything starts to go backwards or any issues I will Update review.Customer service was also Great @ Lunatik when I contacted them about band.Hope this review helped**Update** realized I was having charging issues and people couldn't hear me when I talked on watch (I only talk on watch once in a blue moon). I ended up going back to Catalyst to see if things changed. People can hear me fine and charging issues have gone away. I think the membrane used by Lunatik is slightly thicker causing a few issues? I like the look, but do to these few issues I went back to Cat case
