Complete listening system. Amp built in, speakers included, plays 33s, 45s, even 78s. Also has Bluetooth. Although 30ft bt range on this seems shorter than the 30ft range on other devices. Sound quality is adequate, if you want stellar sound you'd better get that stellar hifi component system complete with wires, knobs, and faders galore. This setup is elegant. It has great sound and is plenty loud. Got mine here on Amazon, while it wasn't prime, it was worth the wait. And at only $120 it was smoking deal.
