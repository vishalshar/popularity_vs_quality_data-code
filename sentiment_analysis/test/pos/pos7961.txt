You have to go on faith that the device is doing what it says.  It is easy to use, i.e. just close the lid.  It easily fits my large size phone.The device was shipped with nice foam padding so the unit would not get damaged.  You can definitely hear the phone ring or vibrate with the lid closed.The only minor annoyance is that after you clean the phone and close the lid (with nothing inside) it turns on for another cycle.  There is no way to prevent this. I guess they have to add a switch to manually shut this off and then you'd likely forget and leave the unit on anyway so I guess this is the best option.
