Not too long ago, I came across the Bluesmart, a travel-sized suitcase that connects to your smartphone. It alerts you when you get too far away from your suitcase with a nice little You left me behind :( message and also lets you know where its last location was. Besides alerting you to its location, Bluesmart also houses a 10,000 mAh battery so that you can recharge your devices from it while you are traveling. It is compatible with both iOS and Android devices. While the suitcase itself weighs a little over 9 pounds, it can accommodate clothes, shoes, and even up to a 15? laptop in its main compartment. Measuring in at 22? x 14? x 9?, Bluesmart meets the standard of a carry-on suitcase for most airlines. The case itself is hard shell (polycarbonate) and has rotating wheels for easy transport. Even without the brains of this smart device, its still a very nice suitcase.Why do you need a smart suitcase?Now, being that Im a technology reviewer with a particular interest in connected devices, my interest with piqued when I learned about Bluesmart. But, why would you ever need something like this? Well, let me tell you a quick story. Several years ago, Robyn was traveling for work from Orlando back to Indiana. The connecting flight was going through Atlanta. Unfortunately, the flight from Orlando experienced a landing delay due to a storm. Because of this, Robyn missed her connecting flight and the next one back to Indiana was not until the following morning. As a result, she ended up spending the night in the Atlanta airport. Sleep was somewhat elusive for her that night and by the time the airport was starting to populate with travelers the next morning, she was falling asleep at the gate for her next flight. This is where the Bluesmart comes in handy. If Robyn had a Bluesmart suitcase that morning, she would been able to snooze safely while she waited for her flight knowing that her belongings were protected. If someone tried to snatch n grab, her phone would have alerted her to the suitcase being separated from her. This type of situation is why Bluesmart is a great idea.Non-Traditional TestingIn January, I traveled to Las Vegas for CES. It would have been the perfect time for me to test a connected smart suitcase since I was flying there, but unfortunately things did not go as planned and I went on my trip with the old-fashioned dumb luggage. As luck would have it, Bluesmart arrived about a week after my return and Ive not had the pleasure of an air-bound trip since that time. With that said, I decided the best way to test it out would be to pretend like I was living out of Bluesmart like I would if I were out of town. I dont typically unpack like some people do. Im just overly concerned about leaving belongings behind. So, I live out of my suitcase. Over the past week, Ive been living out of Bluesmart. I loaded it up with what I would normally take on a trip and using it at home the same way I would while on the go. In addition to storing personal items inside the suitcase, we also tested out the battery by charging our devices from it almost exclusively.During my time testing, the suitcase did not stay stationary by any means. I packed it up with the same amount of belongings I would normally put in a carry-on sized suitcase. Once it was all packed up, I tested out the built-in scale (you need to calibrate it while its empty) against a hand-held luggage scale that I also have. I was surprised to find that the reading was nearly identical. I took it with me in the car as if I was going from place to place so I could get some real-world testing on it. I found that it was easy to pack and find items in and it transported very well. The wheels glide over most surfaces with ease. They pivot very, very well and I didnt have any problem with it tipping over while wheeling it around. I even took the suitcase to our local airport to test it out in that environment. It passed all the basic tests with flying colors. It has ample room for clothes, toiletries, and other personal items and I was notified immediately when I walked about 4 feet away from the bag. Bluesmart was doing its job flawlessly.Meeting the TSAWhile I was testing Bluesmart, I thought it would be a good idea to make an appointment with the TSA. After a few weird phone calls to our airport, I finally spoke with the airport administrator. Not really knowing what I wanted to say to him, I winged it and probably sounded like a nutcase seeing what I could get away with rather than a technology reviewer. After the first successful contact with the airport administrator, I decided to try again in a few days to make sure the guy really knew I was for real and not trying to gain info just to cause mass hysteria. This time I was a bit more prepared and had a better explanation to my story. I explained to the gentleman that I was sorry if I sounded crazy the first time and I was just excited to test the suitcase. He laughed and we had a better conversation then the first time. He explained that being in charge of the airport, he had no problem with my plans, but the TSA was not under his control and for me to have them look at the suitcase and give me their thoughts, I would have to reach out to the supervisor of that group. Needless to say, I never heard back from that gentleman and so I decided to make my own appointment by just showing up and seeing what would happen.I learned that walking into the TSA line when the gate is closed will cause a red light and siren to go off. It wasnt loud, but it did bring the agents to the area, which was great since I needed them pretty quickly. One younger gentleman did not look happy at all and to be honest, I think he wanted to make a scene, but there was an older gentleman who was calm and decided to hear me out before deciding if I should be arrested. When I explained what I was trying to do  that I was reviewing a suitcase and just wanted their thoughts on a smart suitcase with a USB port, internal battery, sensors, and wires  he sort of chuckled and had no problems giving me what I wanted as long as he wasnt in any of the photos.Yes! A win! I thought to myself as the younger guy stared with hate in his eyes. Robyn and I spoke with him for about 20 mintes or so and discussed how the TSA would handle something like this. He pointed out the sign on the case that says it was TSA approved and said becuse of that I shouldnt have many issues, but because of the battery and extra wiring, it would probably be scanned and until smart luggage becomes more common and used by more people, I might get a few extra looks depending on whos watching the scanners. He went on to say people have backpacks that charge device, which Im quite familiar with as I own a few. But, because of that comment, it made me feel that the TSA was not as stupid as I thought they would be about connected smart devices. This allowed me to rest more assured that taking a trip with the Bluesmart would not be a direct ticket to the broom closet and a handsy TSA agent who enjoys body cavity searches.The AppThe mobile app for iOS is pretty easy to use. Once you get through the pairing process, there is really our four main activities  Lock, Battery level, Weight (scale), and Location. You can also input your travel plans and have that information readily available through the Bluesmart app. I really appreciated how cleanly the app was laid out and the easy to understand interface. There wasnt a whole lot of fluff involved. The app is compatible with the Apple Watch and sends you a notification if you get separated from your bag.ConclusionsBluesmart is the first in its category, so you might expect to run into some sideways glances when traveling with it, but rest assured that its safe and it will keep your belongings secured. One thought I had while reviewing this travel-sized suitcase was, Why arent they creating this in a full size bag? The truth is, they might be. Im really not sure, but in my opinion, the reason they went with the carry-on first was because if youre going from point A to point B, your full size suitcase is checked and you dont have to keep track of it after that point. Your carry-on is your responsibility the entire time you travel. That being said, it would be really great to see some sort of GPS tracking outfitted for full sized suitcases so that you can work with airlines if your suitcase gets lost along the way.We actually did run into some issues with connection while we were testing the bag, but it wasnt enough to dissuade us from using it in the long-term.The day we visited the airport, Bluesmart was working famously, but the next day, I charged it up full and then the bag wouldnt connect to my phone. I tried doing the reset steps suggested by the Help center, but to no avail. Eventually, I toggled the Bluetooth on/off on my phone several times and it finally re-connected. This could be a little bit of an annoyance if you are traveling and you cant get your bag open from the automatic lock, but Bluesmart does include old-fashioned keys, which I would recommend that you carry with you.Because of our experience at home and our discussion with the TSA, this will be a permanent fixture whenever we take trips from now on. Im really looking forward to my next conference because I believe this will really help as Im traveling. The only critique I have is that because of the battery it takes up a little extra space that could be used for clothes.
