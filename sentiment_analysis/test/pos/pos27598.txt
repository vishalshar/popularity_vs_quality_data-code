I bought this laptop to do some astronomical image processing. This is a thin and light laptop that makes it portable and easy to work with. Having both Windows and Linux next to each other on the Solid State Drive helps to boot up the system super fast in a few seconds. Also when you are in Linux (Ubuntu in this case), you can also have access to where your Windows is installed. Therefore no space in going to be missed switching back and forth between different operating systems.On Windows, everything works perfectly on this laptop. Since all of my science is being done on Linux, first I tried Open-SUSE tumbleweed on this laptop. This OS cannot recognize and install the necessary drivers for the Wifi and trackback out of the box. Since it needed some extra effort, I preferred to switch to Ubuntu, which I found that it usually better works on Laptops.It's a good laptop, however I could not still find a good stable Linux operating system for it. Right now I installed an Ubuntu 16.04 and it works just fine, however it does not recognize all of the drivers, and some features like track-pad does not work properly.  this is a software issue and I am sure that I would be able to resolve it in future.I also installed a 1TB hard drive (7200 RPM) for my daily work. It was super easy and the hard drive work very well in Ubuntu. There are 9 screws underneath the laptop, try to organize them in order not to forget their initial positions, since they are in different sizes. The installing part is so easy. Just remove the metal plate from the empty slot and put your hard drive. By closing the laptop, the hard drive would be fixed and secured. So no mounting plate is needed in this case.I've had this Laptop for 3 weeks and I am happy with it. I am not sure how good this would be for gamers, since I did not play a single game on it ...
