Works great for scheduled and on-demand feeding of dry food.  The camera is a bit dissapointing though, as it isn't angled to be very useful.  You can't see the food remaining in the dish and when your pet is eating they just completely block the camera.  It would be nice to be able to see how much food is in the bowl or be able to make sure that is food being dispensed at all.
