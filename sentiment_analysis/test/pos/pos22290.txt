This pasta is an absolute hit with the whole family.  I'm a bit obsessed with it.  It's amazingly filling and packs a ton of protein and fiber which normal pasta just doesn't have.  It has a nice flavor and consistency.  I've tried all of the alternative pastas and this is my favorite.  It's not as light as regular pasta but it has a nice texture and it doesn't fall apart like other gluten-free pastas.  I would highly recommend this and have, in fact, given a box to all of my friends because I love it so much!
