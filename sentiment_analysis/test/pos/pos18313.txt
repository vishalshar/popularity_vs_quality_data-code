Ok this is my new favorite game. IT's like C*** against H*** but with much more mind work.  From this deck of cards, choose two words. Everyone comes up with a definition for said word and then everyone uses that word in a sentence.  It's as clean, mature, immature, dirty as your audience wants it to be.  For example, when we played one of our phrases was "Dirty Butter".  One definition was: the crumbs left on the butter after buttering your toast / Damnit James, why do you always put the dirty butter back in the fridge.  Another definition of dirty butter.."a creamy s*x product used" / "Tommy always wanted add some spice to his s*x life with Gina and incorporate food into their lovemaking, so he decided to go to the local adult store and buy some dirty butter to spread on Gina's..."And as in C*** against h****y, whoever is voting that round, chooses the best answer.You'll love it.
