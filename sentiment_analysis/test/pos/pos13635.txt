This is an excellent notebook. It nails all the features you really need, without packing in any extraneous bells and whistles you don't. In particular, it lays flat and stays open on any page of the notebook. The paper is smooth and a pleasure to work with. The cover is both classy and rugged at the same time.A couple of nice-to-haves for the next edition...(1) Page numbers. It takes 10 minutes for me to number the pages myself, so it's not a big deal, but still.(2) I'd like the rows of dots on the dot-pattern to line up with the lines on the line-ruled page. Again, not a big deal -- it still works great. But it would make the user experience that little bit better for folks that mostly want to write on both pages, and sketch only occasionally (which I expect is a pretty big chunk of customers).
