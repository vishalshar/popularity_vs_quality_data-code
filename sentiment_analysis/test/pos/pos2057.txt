I fell in love with the switch witch doll when I saw it in a local store and knew I needed to buy it for my nephew.  Now that he has it,  I've gotten to read him the story and I love this product even more!  A perfect blend of fancy and good sense parenting.  There are more switch witches in our future!  Will be buying one for all the little guys in our family.
