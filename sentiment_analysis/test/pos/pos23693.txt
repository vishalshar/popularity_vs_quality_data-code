I bought this is a backup phone (to use it while my iPhone was being repaired) and I like its simplicity and the fact that the battery could get me through the day (I had to charge it every night, but it's OK).  It's not the fastest and most responsive phone in the world, but it does the job.  Plus, it comes with a soft gel case, a clear screen protector, and the headphones.
