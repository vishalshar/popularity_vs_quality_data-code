If you're here then this is probably what you're looking for. I bought the pro version and I'm very happy so far. This thing dominates brake dust and does a great job cleaning even the most intricate wheels. The brush didn't spin as fast as I thought it would but it has good torque so you can really lean on it for heavy scrubbing. The pro is well built, I didn't have a standard version for comparison but I'm confident that the extra money was well spent.
