Overall 4/5: Weve had the PetCube for almost a year now, and its a nice product, works great as a webcam with a wide view range, decent visibility, and convenient access anytime via a phone app. However, there's room to improve the sound quality and connectivity consistency. We've contacted the company a couple times and they are really responsive and easy to work with which is refreshing.Detailed review:1. Product delivery: Arrived on time - very fast delivery.2. Product set up: The wi-fi set up was simple, but took us a few tries before it worked. About 10 minutes and then worked fine.3. Product functionality:a. Visibility: 4/5. Camera has wide coverage which is helpful for monitoring an entire room. The picture quality is a bit granular if there's movement, but since we access the video stream from our phones with their relatively small screens, this isnt a big issue. Helpful tip: get a lamp timer if you plan to check the video stream when its dark.b. Streaming: 4/5. Very convenient - love that the whole family can check on the pets through each of our phones. We sometimes have connectivity issues, but that seems to have reduced. Also note - only 1 person can access the PetCube through the app at a time.c. Functionality: (Mic + Laser + Cube sharing): 3/5. Mic isnt very clear on either side and has quite a bit of white noise, causing both our dogs to go nuts if we even turn that feature on (before we can even say a word). We recommend testing that feature with your pets when youre close to home in case they dont respond well. Laser works fine and is a clever add-on. There is also an account sharing feature that lets you share your Petcube with other accounts (friends, family, etc), and you can customize which features are shared (example: video only without access to sound/laser).
