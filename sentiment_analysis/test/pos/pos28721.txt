As easy to carry as my water bottle and with enough BASS to vibrate the kitchen table. My Libratone TOO has outperformed the battery life and sound clarity of my previous JBL Flips (1/2), JBL Charge, and UE Booms. The 360-Degree sound delivers the pleasure of having a personal soundtrack whenever I'm out for a stroll around campus or in town :D Best value proposition for the money, operates with intuitive touch controls, and feels intentionally designed. So far the L2 has survived a trip to the beach and boosted the morale of a hike in light mountain rain. It has become one of my favorite daily tech tools for recreation, work, and around the home!
