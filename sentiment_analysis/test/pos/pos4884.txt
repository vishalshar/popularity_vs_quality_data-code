I can't imagine using anything else!  This makes collecting a clean urine sample a snap.  Cat was suspicious, and wouldn't use the litter box when I had moved it to a different location (so I could watch and see when she used it), but when I moved it back to its usual location, she jumped right in as if nothing was different.  I collected the urine, which had pooled beautifully along one edge, and off to the vet I went.  My vet was shocked that I was able to bring in such a large sample (I used a 4 oz.. collection cup, not the little tube included with the sand --Sterile Specimen Cups, Set of 3, Screw Cap, Tamper Evident, 4 oz.Â ).  I also used a regular veterinary syringe to pull up the urine out of the box, not the little pipette that was also included with the sand....that would have taken forever!  Other than those two adjustments, this product is perfect and I HIGHLY recommend it.  Just as a note, the vet did say that the smaller amount that the little tube would have held would have been sufficient.  I figure "the more the better",  just to be safe.
