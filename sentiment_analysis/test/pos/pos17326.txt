This is a fun product and works well.  Originally I bought it as more of a gag gift.  Because of the price I ended up keeping it for myself. I was afraid people would think I didn't spend the required $20 minimum on the gift exchange.  It's such a small package it just looks more like a $10-$15 gift.  After installing it my only complaint is it's not visually appealing being stuck on the side of the bowl and it doesnt stay suctioned that well. Other than that the family loves not having to turn the lights on in the bathroom during the middle of the night and it looks really cool.
