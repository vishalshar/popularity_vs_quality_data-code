This is a very high quality speaker.  The look of the speaker is great and it is durable. I like the fact that it can take some water making it very useful for the outdoors. Pairing is very easy and I like the voice comments that the speaker makes. The sound quality is better than expected. The battery life is very good and comes very close to the promised 14 hours.  I would recommend this speaker to anyone who wants a high quality Bluetooth speaker.
