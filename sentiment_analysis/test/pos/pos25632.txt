First of all, THIS. WORKS!!!!!!!!We are so excited to have found something that actually stops our 3 year old from waking up sometimes 5 times a night screaming from night terrors!The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I really wish the Lully would go off automatically, rather then me having to turn it on. I've forgotten a few night and been really sorry I did.
