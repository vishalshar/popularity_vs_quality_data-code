my kid loves these!  I an get her to eat all of her dinner if she gets a vitamin at the end!  We don't eat a lot of sugar and she gets no candy so she thinks these are delicious.  Really surprised some parents said their kids wouldn't eat them.  Seem like they are working too- she had a persistent cough that lasted 2 months- a couple days after starting these it finally went away... coincidence?!
