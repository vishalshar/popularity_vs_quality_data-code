This moisturizer is perfectly balanced - it is light yet completely hydrates my skin, without leaving any heavy or greasy feel.  I apply in the morning and evening every day and night one jar typically lasts for nice time.  As far as price is concerned, I find this product to be very reasonably priced.Great moisturizer, everything about it..the smell is perfect.  The feel.  The result...you will LOVE this moisturizer.
