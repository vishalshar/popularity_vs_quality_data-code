I bought this for my MacBook Pro 13" Retina Display (pre-2016) and it fit perfectly. It has a nice black matte color and the strap fit well over the sleeve. It has a very clean, minimalistic look to it, which is mostly why I bought it in the first place. I was worried that the laptop would fall out - considering how much is exposed at the top, but when I held it upside down it stayed snug in the case. There is considerable padding in the sleeve and it is perfect for putting into a large purse or backpack.The reason why I gave it four stars, instead of five, is because it has a funny smell to it. I imagine it will go away with use. I will have to update this review as I use it.
