One of my hopes in buying this was that I could use it as a stand to hold my phone hands-free at a convenient position. It is possible, but it takes some judicious positioning to get it to not droop over, since the cable isn't as stiff as I hoped.  Maybe a good thing; maybe not a requirement for you. I haven't beat on it or taken an axe to it or anything, but I feel sure it would be sturdy and protective. Works just fine. So far no problem with the connector bits being damaged from stress.
