the only wet food my cat will eat. One time I ate it by mistake becuase I thought it was the sardines from the night before (YAK! and LOL!) I kept the cat food in the same plastic container as the leftovers from another lunch for sardines. I did not even notice that it was cat food until I came home after work and saw the sardines still in their container in the fridge. I wanted to throw up!!!! I survived and was shocked that it tasted really good.
