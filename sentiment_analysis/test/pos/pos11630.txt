I have to say I cancelled this order because I read the reviews after I submitted my order. My cancellation didn't go through, and thought well let's try it. The main reason I got it was for my morning juice I take to work, I had the white lids that leak all the time, and I wanted something that didn't leak because I love using my mason jars. To my surprise, and this might be that I got lucky, but mind doesn't leak at all, especially when I drink from it, and I really hope it stays that way, it's been 2 weeks and so far so good... I love it!Note: my drink is always traveling up straight in my lunch bag.
