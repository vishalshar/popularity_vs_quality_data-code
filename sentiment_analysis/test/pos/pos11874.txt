This is my second smaller aquaponics setup. My first was one of those Little Tokyo systems that came out six years ago. I had to retire it after years of faithful service, it used wood for it's construction. Wood and water don't mix for long term applications and rot ensued.With this product, there is no wood. Plastic and metal should give many more years of use than my last system. It is light enough to slide the system out from the aquarium for easy access to the tank. The instructions were quite easy to follow and it was up and running in less than 30 minutes. One big bonus is the clay media is already provided. My last system came without and that made my previous system double the cost of this one. The built in light bar is a nice feature as well.The design is quite brilliant. The inner workings are concealed under the media and the housing. My Little Tokyo filled the media from a pvc pipe that rose above the clay and down into the tank, splashing and making noise. The AquaSprouts system fills under the clay media out of site and drains out of site as well. There is some trickle noise, so don't place it in your bedroom (unless you like fountain noise while you sleep).I give this five stars for it's function, low price, and great improvements over other aquaponic systems I have used and observed.
