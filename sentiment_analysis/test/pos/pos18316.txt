Bought this for my guy and his friends to play at their weekly game night. For the moment I am the favorite girlfriend. They could not stop laughing. I think I even heard some snorts when my guy called me on the phone to listen in to part of it. These guys would make some Marines proud with their creative dirty minds. It is definitely a game for adults...if you have teens and they find this you will get a call from the school they are going to want to show their friends and play at lunch. College kids would love this. This game has been added to the "must play" pile every time they get together.
