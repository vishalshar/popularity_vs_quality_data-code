I think these are great. I'm a skier and I hated grabbing my phone every time I go a text or a call.  I have an iPhone so I bought them because they support Siri. Now there are issues with Siri but assuming you have a network connection and Siri is working they're great. I touch the earflap on my helmet to activate Siri and just say 'Check messages' Siri then will read my text message  and ask if I want to reply. I can also call up play lists with Siri. The sound is much better than the one ear bluetooth unit I had and I never need to worry about batteries dying because it's -10 out there.
