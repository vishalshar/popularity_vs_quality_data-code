Because of Blepharitis, an eye disease that at times is not noticeable and a other times a real pain, manifesting in various odd ways over time, I gave up using mascara well over 10 years ago.  My lashes had become too dry and brittle, and my eyes too sensitive.  I'd tried various "clump resistant" mascaras, but they all got crusty and clumpy, a mess, on my lashes. You may be disappointed in this if you're used to wearing mascara, but I just wanted to be able to condition my lashes and emphasize my eyes a little while keeping a natural look and feel.  It's subtle, but my lashes now look and feel conditioned, smooth, and the product doesn't bother my sensitive eyes.
