Very nice feel in the hand, the pencil has a good weight to it and the brushed gold metal is classy. The nib rubber feels a bit delicate but is holding up well so far.  Sometimes the eraser end erases, sometimes it smudges and I can't figure out when it will happen, so I've just been using the pen end with the eraser brush instead of flipping it over.  I had a bit of trouble connecting to the app, but quickly figured out that the pen wasn't charged (I had it on the charger but hadnt inserted it far enough into the USB port to start the charging, so make sure you push it in until the light comes on). I've attached a super quick sketch i made with the pencil app within a few minutes of getting set up.
