Love this product. I have several pots & pans that do not have lids, like my cast iron skillet. This lid does a great job covering the item to facilitate boiling, reduce splatters, etc.Being silicon, you probably should not exceed 450* or so but, I have had no issues.These lids are floppy & being so they form a partial vacuum when used. This is great is making a soup stock that you want to coo down before skimming fat off of. Just pop the lid on while it's still at a boil & set outside, in an ice bath, in the fridge , etc. The contents will remain sterile.Great product.
