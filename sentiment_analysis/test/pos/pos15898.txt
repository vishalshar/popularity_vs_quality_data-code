This watch is awesome! I love watching the time automatically adjust when entering new time zones. The step tracker and sleep features are great! I may have misread the description, the but one drawback to this tracker is that it does not track heart rate. Instead to get readings you must use the included app. I also frequently get compliments on the styling.
