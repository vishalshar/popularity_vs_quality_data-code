Let me start of with the meat, in case you are not interested in the potatoes below.  This unit works great, right out of the box.  It took me perhaps a couple of hours to go from box to first print.  My first print was very nice -- I just used the default "Low" resolution settings for everything and the provided sample of PLA filament.  One of the very cool features of this latest model Robo (R1+) is Auto Bed Leveling Compensation - which basically means that the machine goes through a automated sequence prior to each print to determine the flatness of the print bed and then compensates for any deviation in software automatically.  Now, I thought this was pretty cool until I noticed that my X-Axis smooth rods were not very parallel to my print bed (one side was higher by about 3/4") and I had not noticed it for my first few prints.  It looked like either the x-end was not fully seated at the factory or had become dislodged during shipment.  The cool thing was it did not even matter, the printer had compensated for this fairly large offset and the parts that I had printed were all excellent quality - I literally could have left it as is and operated normally.  Well, it was an easy fix -- loosen one screw and push the x-end down further onto the z-axis lead-screw coupler.  I feel this is an excellent printer, especially for someone who may not be particularly inclined to have to do all of the tweaking and calibrating common to some of the lower end units or build-it-yourself kits.  If you do like to dig down into the "guts" of your stuff and tinker, like I do, its also a great unit, because everything is pretty much right there in front of you, just in a nice looking package.Switching filaments is easy - it has an all metal hot end, so printing ABS or PLA is not an issue, nor should some of the newer exotics.  I have yet to try Flexible filaments, but I did try wood.  The included software works fine, but this is an open-source unit, so you can easily use Cura, Pronterface or any other software.Potatoes--Although fairly new to the 3d printing community, I think I started off like many frugal engineers/tinkerers, lost of research to figure out how best to get the most bang out of my buck.  I was intrigued by being able to prototype stuff quickly, but i wasn't willing to drop $2k on a new hobby, that frankly might not be my thing; so I bought a used Prusa i3 RepRap (assembled from a kit) off of Craigslist for $200.  After some bit of tweaking and wiring fixes, this unit worked well, but I constantly had to manually tweak the bed level and extruder springs -it was really kind of a pain.  This unit was my step up, from kit to commercial unit, but did not require not a $2000 investment.  I am very glad that I did, for the $700 (on sale) price, I got a unit that is almost hands-off, plug-and-play printing.  In addition, it is open-source and uses a lot of the same electronics, extruders and  hot ends I am already familiar with.  I could not be happier with this unit.  There is also a large community of users that so far all seem to be good makers (willing to help others).I have contacted their customer service dept (via email) for some additional info and found them (shout out to Jerry) to be responsive and helpful.  If you want a great printer for a great price, you cannot go wrong with the Robo 3d R1+. HH
