What a comeback.  The Logitech Harmony One was awful.  But, this remote is AMAZING.  Very easy to program and everything just works.  It can even control devices that don't support IR, such as the Amazon Fire TV, newer Roku devices, and Google's line of Android TV devices.A couple of hints:1.  Logitech provides Android, iOS, and Windows software the program this remote.  The Windows software has many options that are missing from the Android and iOS apps, so just use the Windows software.2.  If you want to use this remote with a XBMC or Kodi machine that has a FLIRC device, Logitech has provided a default set of IR codes that work with the FLIRC's default IR set.  Just select manufacturer:  FLIRC and Model:  Kodi.
