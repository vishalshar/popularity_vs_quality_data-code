HIGHLY recommend! My 12 year old son is always running around with his laces dragging. I got tired of griping at him to stop and tie his shoes so I bought these. They work great! He's very active and I was concerned the shoes wouldn't be tight enough but they are. Will be buying a set for all of his shoes !
