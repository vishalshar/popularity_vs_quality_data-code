This pen is awesome! Easy to use too. I've been known to doodle in my day-I have close to 100 sketch pads in my closet- but when I found out about this, I had to get it. It's like a hi-tech glue gun for creating art. You load the plastic and hit a button. It's easy to create little projects. I've actually used it to teach my toddler the alphabet by making little "letter trinkets." It's educational and fun. Plus for $99, it's a relatively inexpensive way to expand your creativity. Highly recommend!
