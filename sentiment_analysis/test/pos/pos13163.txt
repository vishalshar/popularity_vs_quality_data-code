Excellent!  A lot of fun...and doubles as a security camera too!We have 2 dogs (beagle and beagle mix)...Beagle took to it right away...as soon as it chimes in he goes to the couch where the treats fall down (have it mounted about 7ft on corner shelf pointing slightly down)...the beagle mix is still a little confused but eventually sees it...great to be able to talk with them...only reason for a 4 vs 5 is that it would be perfect if I could hear them as well.As an added plus...I have a security system that alerts me when someone enters the house (Simplisafe) but it has no integrated cameras...I've tried some ip cameras with limited success the Petzi was easy to set up and haven't  had any problems viewing remotely...and I get the entire family room/kitchen with adequate quality and I can snap a picture... (god forbid I see an intruder but if I did I can spook him and warn him that the police are on the way..."So get out of my house!").But on the bright side I love this...use it almost everyday to check in with my dogs...well worth the price!
