I was so excited to receive this little cube in the mail! It was so nicely packaged and I really like the way all the components were organized in the box, and so well labeled. I let it charge and then played with it. I learned that since I have an iphone I needed an adapter (if you have an iphone, this is the one you too will need: Apple Lightning Digital AV Adapter for Select iPhone, iPad and iPod Models (MD826AM/A). Once I got that and set the cube up, it was AWESOME!!! You can stream anything from your phone, so easily! I watched some shorts from Youtube and was so impressed. It's so easy to set up and use and extremely convenient, you just need a blank wall or surface to view your material. I'm looking forward to using it on a camping trip to shine on the side of my tent. Such a great little gadget!
