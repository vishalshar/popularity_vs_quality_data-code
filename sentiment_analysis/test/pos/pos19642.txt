I did recieve it in perfect mint condition, and though I have not gotten to play it with anyone yet, I did very much enjoy the demo shown on Status Games' web site. It seems to be a nice simple family game or a great ice breaker game at a party or gaming group. I like the replayability to the game with different board set up configurations too.
