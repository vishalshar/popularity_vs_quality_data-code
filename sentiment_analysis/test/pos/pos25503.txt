Not a huge makeup addict, but I have my beauty enhancers and corresponding tools. IMHO this is a great invention and really complements brushes in general. Good for travelling, storage, drying your brushes upside down to preserve the glue holding the bristles together, or just for throwing your brush into your toiletries basket. Doesn't fall apart even after a year of use. Doesn't get warped out of shape.
