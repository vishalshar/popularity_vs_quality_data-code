This car is an additional car you can purchase to go on the aski overdrive tracks. It's faster & has weapons you can use on the app. We purchased this for my 8 year old son, however my husband LOVES it. This car is a very nice addition to the starter pack. My only complaint is that the rubber wheel coverings can come loose. You can easily slip them back on. Also, if dust gets on the vehicle, it will not drive straight. It "wiggles" Bach and forth. The solution is just to blow the air off of the car & goes back to driving straight.
