Really amazing quality for the price. The acetate has a really smooth and beautiful surface and the transparency is really nice and makes the sunglasses look really different than what you normally see out there. A little heat (blow dryer) made the frame soft enough to tweak the fit nicely. The lenses are super clear and the images crisp. They aren't very dark, which I like as it makes the glasses more versatile across a wider range of lighting conditions.
