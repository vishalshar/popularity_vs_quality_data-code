First off let me say that I was skeptical that these bars would work.  My girlfriend suffers from bad motion sickness in the car and on planes and I will occasionally get it on the water.  We didn't expect much, however these bars worked in all 3 scenarios.  Not only that, we didn't feel drowsy like we do with traditional motion sickness drugs.  They're also great for high-intensity workouts as a don't feel sick like I sometimes do after my more rigorous sessions.  Regarding the bars as a snack, what a pleasant surprise.  The blueberry flavor was great, they were filling, and my girlfriend (who's a registered dietitian) was a big fan of the nutritional value of the product.  These are perfect for someone on the go, I highly recommend them to anyone that suffers from nausea.  I'll be giving a couple to my relatives that suffer from medication side effects next, give these a shot and you won't be disappointed!
