I am an engineer so I tend to be highly analytical while having an above average attention to detail.  I do like this tape and it is the first time I have decided to switch from a standard old school rule.  It will be extremely helpful to me because while I am working on projects my attention floats around in a creative cloud which means I often find myself remeasuring, recutting and making calculations on the fly that I often forget after looking for the saw, the safety glasses and etc.  Having 2 built in memory options (it says three on the package I have but there are only 2 buttons, the other storage of the third memory would be your third measurement when you press the hold button).Pros: Comes reading to go and includes 2032 Battery 3 memory Storages The tape I got does in fact have CM and Inches marked on it plus digital display Automatic shutoff after 3 minutes or so Midpoint calculation with press of a button Both inside and outside measurements (i.e. include length of tape dispenser at 3")Cons: I have a solid feeling that the first time I drop this on the concrete it will be a standard dumb measure. I would have been willing to pay much more to have a durable, droppable device.  This is not it. On mine, the second memory button requires pressing in just the right place and multiple times to switch to M2 Tape Lock is a bit stiff, requires a strong hand, a younger or older adult/child would have a bit of troubleFor the price and for my first electronic tape, I like it.  But I have a feeling that I will be searching for a more durable solution after I drop this or leave it in a hot garage too long.  I plan to store it inside because I am sure they did not put this through environmental tests other than ones needed by FCC.
