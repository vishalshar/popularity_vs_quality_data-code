I was a little worried about this purchase based on some of the reviews.  I have had the lock and keypad for two months and so far no issues.  I was having trouble for the first week but I eventually replaced the battery and the keypad has functioned correctly every time since the battery change.  I initially just had the lock installed for about day without the keypad and I agree with some of the other reviewers that this should just come with the lock by default in particular if you have auto-lock enabled.  I like that feature and I hate to turn it off and on so when I'm just stepping out forms few minutes not carrying my phone or wearing my smart watch the keypad is a must have.
