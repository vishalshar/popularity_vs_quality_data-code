Solid little unit.  Tough.  I left it outside overnight in the rain - no problems.  Battery life is excellent.  4 stars because the sound quality not as good as the comparable JBL units you see in the stores, but this speaker makes up for it in durability.  It's a little on the heavy side (weight) though.Also worth noting - while it comes with it's own custom shaped bike carrying cage, it fits pretty much perfectly in a standard water bottle cage so you can easily snap it into any bikes and go.Wish the remote control was wireless.  I don't see me ever taking the time to wire up the remote before heading out each time.
