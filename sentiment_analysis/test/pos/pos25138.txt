I absolutely love the gun-blue color of my case! It looks great, is solid, and I have gotten more complements than I imagined (including three people in the past two weeks immediately pulling the website up on their phone to look into buying it later).The sleep/wake button can be a little difficult to find if you're holding it at an odd angle and not going purely by muscle memory.The adhesive tape for the magnetic mount, however, didn't hold up well on my car's dash with the combination of the summer heat and the strength of the magnet. Within two weeks it peeled off my dash. Do yourself a favor and get rid of the adhesive tape already on there and just use superglue.Oh and did I mention that the magnet is epic?? It is so strong that I haven't used the quarter-turn, snap-into-place clip, as there is no need. I have gotten used to just casually tossing my phone within an inch or two of the magnet, and it is instantly sucked into place and stays. I mounted the small magnet such that the phone is completely vertical and relies 100% on the magnet to keep from falling. I honestly feel that the phone is more securely held in place being suspended vertically by this little magnet than it is resting in a cup holder.In short: BUY THIS CASE!
