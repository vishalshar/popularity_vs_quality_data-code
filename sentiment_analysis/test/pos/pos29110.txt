I live in a big house with a few roommates; we're all young professionals. Despite trying to keep the place clean and organized, things just tend to go missing. Thats where the TrackR bravo comes in so handy: we're now using them to keep on top of the things that aren't in their usual places. At first, we hoped that this would solve the issue and point out who was to blame for moving common items. But, it turns out our house is just haunted.
