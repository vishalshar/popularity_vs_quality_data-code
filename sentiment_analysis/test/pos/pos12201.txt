I watched the youtube video about the brush guard made by michelle phan and since it is pretty cheap, i ordered them.The brush guards fit really well on all of my mac brushes except kabuki - it is slightly long.i cut the length and applied a thin coat of clear nail polish and it still works fine. i re-ordered couple more sine i have a lot of brushes!
