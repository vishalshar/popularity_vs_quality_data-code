I love this product. I use it to seal the air out of my cats food bag. I feel that this allows my pet to have fresher food for a longer period of time, which is good because he requires an expensive and special type of dry food due to his health condition.The handle is a great bonus. The product feels extremely stable and well-made and I'm sure it would work for much heavier bags as well.
