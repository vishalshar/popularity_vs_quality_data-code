Even before I entered my 70s, I was continually frustrated by the amount of time I spent looking for my small, essential, traveling possessions. Several years ago I began to see advance ads for TrackRs' competitor, Tile, and thought I would have to get those when they were released.I forgot about this approach for several years until I acquired Amazon's Echo, and began to review all the products that were compatible with it. TrackR popped up, and comparison reviews between it and Tile established for me its superiority - even if it weren't the one linked to Echo.TrackR works fine without Echo; your smartphone with the TrackR app will locate any of your lost objects quickly. I am a bit deaf and need to make sure my hearing aids are turned to maximum volume or I might not hear the sounds the device is making. If your object has been left in an unusual room in your house, it will take a bit longer before the app begins to lets you know that you are getting warmer. But with some perseverance I have been able to find anything my wife has hidden.I am very excited about the TrackR Bridge, which will supposedly be released in 2017. These wall-socket plug-ins will truly link my TrackRs to my Echo. I will be able to say, "Alexa, where is the Leaf key," and my Echo will reply, "Your Leaf key is in the upstairs bedroom." That will cut a lot of time off the warmer/colder search. It will be expensive ($200, I think, for a really good mapping of the house, but I have spent so much time looking for keys, pocket knife, etc., that I am willing to pay this.We have four items we now track, but I anticipate that the number will increase.
