Drinking beer from Das Horn is only the beginning, as I'm about to explain. So, I was sitting around waiting on my Das Horn, when it finally showed up. I opened the box, and man what a beauty this horn is. I thought about how fortuitous it was that I had this horn to drink out of. Little did I know, my world was about to change.It was a quiet night, a lot like this, when I poured my first beer into Das Horn. I took a few sips, and man the beer tastes WAYYYYY better in this horn. However, all of the sudden, I heard a bunch of pounding on my front door. So, of course I opened it and there were a ton of beautiful women at my door waiting for me. They had heard about me and my horn and wished to drink from the horn of glory. Being the gentleman I am, I let them in out of the cold and they began taking turns drinking from my illustrious horn. However, this was soon interrupted by another knock at the door. I honestly thought it was the cops since we were being so loud, but instead it was DJ Khaled! Man, I was so surprised that he too had heard about me and he had brought additional women to party with me, and he would supply the music. Of course, all are welcome at the keg of glory that is my place, so I let them in. We were partying it up, drinking from Das Horn, and listening to some sick beats from DJ Khaled. But of course that got interrupted by another knock at my door. THIS TIME, it was the cops. However, they weren't here to arrest me, they were here to sweep the area, as Barack Obama himself heard there was a Das Horn owner around and he wanted to challenge me in a chugging contest. Who am I to decline the President in a Das Horn chugging contest? So Obama and the Secret Service came right in. We poured the finest Natty Ice in our horns and proceeded to chug, but the President got a five second heads start because the Secret Service blocked me. However, I raced back from behind and beat Barack by 2 ounces! What a finish! I almost got arrested by the Secret Service for beating a sitting President, but B.O. gave me a pardon on the spot. What a great night, and I owe it all to Das Horn!
