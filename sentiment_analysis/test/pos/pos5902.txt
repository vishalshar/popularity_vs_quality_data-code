I purchased qty 2, for two small dogs, and they work just fine. I use the collars every day with the batteries constantly on. It's been 10 weeks (and counting) without a battery change yet. The collars are taken off the dogs at night to give their throats a rest from the probes (collars still turned on).  The dogs could care less either way. They would wear them 24/7.  They do know their boundaries because of these collars and the in-ground fence.
