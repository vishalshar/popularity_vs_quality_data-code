This is my first purchase from AIO, and it all went smoothly. I was at first skeptical of this filament, seeing as the price was rather cheap(less than $13) and I thought, if its junk than its only a .5 roll of filament. Now that I have used it, I wish it was a full sized roll of filament. I didnt really have to adjust any of my settings from when I use other filaments which I have used other brands before where it was a print a test piece and mess with settings.
