The setup for this product was extremely easy!  Plugged it in and added sensor on the hub! Done!  It even remembered the sensor once we relocated it to another outlet.  The manual button on the plug is also an excellent option.  I love these products from Securifi and we have adopted this new technology in our home, without any headaches!
