I bought the Petzi treat cam after my 12 year old cat was diagnosed with cancer. I wanted to be able to check in on him when I wasn't able to be home. We have since lost him but we still love using the Petzi to check in on our other cats when we are away.  They learned to come to the camera very quickly and love to get treats when we aren't home. I love the night vision feature. I also love the social media style feed in the Petzi app. The only feature I'd like to see in future versions of the Petzi is the ability to record video in addition to still photos.
