I've really been enjoying my Lumo Lift! It definitely took some getting used to to remember how to turn on/off the coaching mode, but once I got it down, it's been pretty simple. I grab it in the mornings, put it on, calibrate, and am all set. The magnets are really discrete and I usually use the bra clip, which keeps it completely hidden from view. I usually forget I'm wearing it until I trigger the buzz from slouching--it definitely does it's job and does it well.I see complaints in other reviews about not understanding how the device works, but I think it's a bit unfair to knock it unless you put in the time to figure out how it functions. It's really not that difficult, you just need to have a little bit of patience at the beginning when you're setting it up.Most importantly, my posture has improved SIGNIFICANTLY since I've been wearing the device. It's a solid way to remind you to sit up straight when you're slouching.
