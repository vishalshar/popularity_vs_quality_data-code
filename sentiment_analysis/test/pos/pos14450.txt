Recommend this product - makes phone & tablet screens shiny again. Less is more with the polish stick so follow the directions - just make a simple "X" with the polish on the screen, then rub it around the screen with fingertip, let sit for a bit and polish it off with the little cloth they provide. I leave the polish sit a bit longer on my tablet screen for its disinfecting properties. For my phone I use the polish mainly for screen polishing since I have the PhoneSoap Charger that uses UV light to sanitize my whole phone in less than 5 min. When traveling, I take the PhoneSoap polish with me to sanitize all my devices.
