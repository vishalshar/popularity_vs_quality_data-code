Buy it.  It's incredible.  It has so much space, runs smoothly, and great for those who travel!  I particularly love the switch on the side where you can choose what notifications come through (all, priority, none).  It's one of my favorite features because sometimes I''m working and only need to know when emails come in.  So, I set it as emails are priority and then I'm left undistracted. I only wish they had more cute phone cases.  I found some on amazon but I'd like more ;)
