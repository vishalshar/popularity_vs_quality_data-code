Works really well with the use of a suction-cup system on the bottom.My only warning is, before buying them, make absolutely sure that the typical surfaces you will be using them on are completely flat/smooth.These do not work on natural wood (the grain of the wood allows air to get under the cup) so I bought them to stop kicking over my.plastic/metal/vinyl surfaces are what would work best.
