These wheels are a bit on the small side for longboard wheels, but they improve the overall quality of the ride so much! They are smooth over cracks and bumps, and they are much quicker with fewer pushes, and my longboard is 41" long so it's not a board. They're good for carving, and I personally really like the look. Worth the price in my book, although I might get the larger set (70mm) of Sharkwheels next time :)Looks 5/5Speed 4.5/5 (on a longboard, on a penny board it'd be even better)Carving 5/5Value 4/5 they're expensive, but worth the price
