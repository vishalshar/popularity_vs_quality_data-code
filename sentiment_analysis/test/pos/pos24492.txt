The quality, features and the customer support are excellent. We really like the ability to listen in to video footage, capture to the cloud at a reasonable cost < $4.00/ month and how the camera's night vision and resolution perform. I looked at the top cameras that most reviewers look at and glad i steered away from the herd in this instance. The support is excellent too as when i called up and did not leave a message, someone called right back. After a couple of back and forth emails calls, we were able to customize this to our situation.
