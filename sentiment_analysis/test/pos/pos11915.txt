This is the best cell phone case ever. I can fit my credit card, license, health insurance card, and money in here and I'm good to go without hauling out my entire purse for lunch with the co-workers, or other short trips. Try not to drop repeatedly, eventually the hinge broke on mine - but that took a LONG time and several drops - and I was able to repair with crazy glue and it kept on ticking!
