I purchased this PICC line cover for my husband and he found it to be comfortable, breathable and effective. It did not irritate his skin or make him sweat. The sleeve didn't crawl, sag or roll up. The only downside, the sleeve fades and bleeds black on his bandages which makes them look dirty. However, in time, after several washes, I assume this would not be an issue.
