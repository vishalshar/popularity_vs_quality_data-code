Bravo!  Brilliant invention and surprised this isn't more mainstream because the results are amazing.  I love that I can give myself a glamorous salon quality blowout at home and simply, whenever I want.  I bought the medium size brushes since my hair is layered and slightly longer than my shoulders.  After my first blowout, I purchased the add-on pack in medium and have since also purchased the large size add-on.  I am blessed with thick hair and needed the extra rollers to give me better options to control how much curl or volume I want to add.  While these brushes have been working well for me, they do not feel as sturdy as my traditional higher-quality brushes and would like to see a better, maybe a more higher-end quality, version of these brushes.  I do not have any regrets about this purchase, especially since I bought two add-on sets but if a better quality or professional version was available, I would pay extra for it because when you pay for quality, you only cry once.
