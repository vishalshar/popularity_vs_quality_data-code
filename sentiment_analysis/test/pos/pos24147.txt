This thing is awesome - and a great idea. Minus one star only for a few features I feel like it could have easily added:- Control angle of camera with app, to pan around the room- Ability to activate and use the microphone on your phone without the loud sound notification going off. Sometimes we check in to see if she is sleeping, and forget to turn the volume down fast enough (it's on a second screen on the app), and the connecting sound wakes her up- Two-way microphone to listen to pet (the current setup uses your phone as a mic, and only a speaker is on the Petzi itself)Otherwise, awesome product, and the treat dispenser is money. This Thanksgiving we left the pup at home and shot kibble out for her several times over a few hours so she didn't go hungry while we were away. It wasn't quite turkey and gravy, but it worked out great - and the kids got a kick out of watching her eat the food and walk around. Video quality isn't bad! Nice product.
