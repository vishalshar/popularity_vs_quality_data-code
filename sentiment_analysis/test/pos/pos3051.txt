I puchased this towel for my 14 year old son to take on a week long backpacking trip. While I have an idea he didn't use it as often as his mom (me) would like, he did use it and was very happy with it. It is so much softer than the other backpacking towels we've had! It's a good size too. Other backpacking towels we've had would shrink when washed & come back in rough shape - this did not shrink & came back in very good shape!
