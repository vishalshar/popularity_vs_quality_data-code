These beef sticks are perfect for my husband's long motorcycle trips! They have none of the harmful chemicals/additives and all of the flavor & protein needed for a quick road snack. Small but mighty addition to the healthy saddlebag snack quandary! I keep these on hand in the pantry, glad to have a healthy alternative that actually Tastes Good!
