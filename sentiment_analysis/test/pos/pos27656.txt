Two part review...I just tried the Coravin with the faster pour needle and the cork did not reseal - much to my disappointment (read instructions multiple times and watched website video). I love the idea of this and will try again with the standard needle on a new bottle this weekend. Follow-up review pending...hoping for a result that will enable me to keep the Coravin (and faith in the earlier reviews).2nd attempt - worked as expected. Just needed to let the cork climatize. Happy customer.
