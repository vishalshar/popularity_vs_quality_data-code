I've been using this lid for several months and so far so good. A couple of points on it when using it are:1. Make sure the seal is in tight. I find if I press with my nail along the outer edge it gets all the way in. If its not your jar will leak.2. I am constantly getting powder (I use this for protein shakes) in the cap. I usually let the lid with cap in place soak to make sure there is nothing stuck to it.3. The cap will poke you in the face if you are using this to drink out of, I usually snap it off. When using to pour, its easier to pour if you remove the cap.4. Sometimes it seals up too tight to remove the cap. It usually happens when I have different temperatures in the jar and either had stored the jar in the freezer or freshly washed with warm water. Basically, heat related expansion or shrinkage will affect your ability to take off the whole lid.
