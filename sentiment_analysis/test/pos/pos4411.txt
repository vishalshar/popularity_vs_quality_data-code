For a parent with a young, new driver, this has been great. Real-time updates, immediate location for assisting when a wrong turn has been made, and the security of knowing that in the event of a serious crash we will be notified.Pairing was simple, and only once in the month of use has there been a delay of reporting a drive (which it caught up with an hour later).
