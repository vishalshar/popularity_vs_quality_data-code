The gaming system is as described.  My 5yo loves it, and it's challenging enough to where he needs some help.  But after he figures it out, he's so happy about his accomplishment.  The drawing part takes some getting used to, but he also enjoyed it.  It's definitely something you can play with the family.  Technology is amazing.
