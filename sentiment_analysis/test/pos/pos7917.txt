We have three English labs and have used many kibbles over the years to feed the best I can get for them. Using DogFoodAdvisor has helped me steer towards the better quality foods. We have gone from BB, Canidae, Orijen, Acana, and TOTW to SportDogFood. Ingredients are top notch and their Elite line along with this Performance line have done very well for our babies, two of which are almost 8 and one is two. Their energy levels are good, coats are soft and beautiful, breath is fine and no foul odors at all. Cost per pound with the quality makes this food a no-brainer if your pup likes it.
