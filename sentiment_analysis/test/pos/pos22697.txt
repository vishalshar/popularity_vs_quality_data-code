Excellent product.  Works like a charm!  It was super easy to install after watching the numerous online videos.  I love the fact that you can program multiple stops, high, low settings on it.  I hooked it up so it can support up to 100 pounds.  I have used it quite a bit to hoist stuff up from my garage floor to the loft that I finished building. Very quiet. I love showing it off to family and everyone always gets a chuckle out of how cool this device operates. Make sure you follow the directions and mount it into wall studs so it can securely hoist without being pulled out of the ceiling or wall.
