I've received so many complements on my new "watch" and love telling people it's actually an activity tracker. No one believes me! While the look of the Activit√© is what sold me, I really like the functionality. The app is easy to use, has a cool heart rate monitor feature and syncs with MyFitnessPal (which in turn syncs with MapMyRun, so bike rides and such are counted). I hope future iterations of this model include the ability to track other activities, such as yoga, which is what I do most frequently.
