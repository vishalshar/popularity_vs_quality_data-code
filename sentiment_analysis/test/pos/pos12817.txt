It's official... I love Hickies! It seems athletic shoes all come with extra long laces. I like the laces on my barefoot Merrells because they match the shoe but they just get in the way because they're too long. So I ordered these silver & neon yellow Hickies. They come nicely packaged. The instructions, which are only a few tiny illustrations, are on the inside of the paper insert. I actually went to the hickies.com website for clarification. It took me about 15 minutes to get the first shoe laced because I had to play with the tightness of the Hickies. Once I had the first shoe figured out, the second one only took a couple of minutes. They look great and they keep my shoes comfortably snug. It does seems like shoving my heel into an "laced" shoe may wear out the back of my shoes in time. It might be wise to undo the top Hickie to allow a little more room for my foot to slide in... at least with these Merrells. I plan to replace the laces in my other athletic shoes with Hickies!
