Very simple to install and use.  Not sure if this ACTUALLY will automatically call 911 if/when the car has a crash (and not interested in testing that...)read a review of the product in the WSJ - they raved about this as passive safety measure.Right out of the box, easy to install - just look under/by steering column for plug recepticle.  Then use your smartphone to go through simple set up...takes about 10mins - including a text message from the company/device to phone.It allows you to pick 3 recipients for alerts, it allows you to track car.would be useful for teen, or if you didn't trust teen...spouse ;)
