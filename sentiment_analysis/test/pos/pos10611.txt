The only real reason it didn't earn 5 stars is the high cost! Cost of manufacturing on this stuff is probably next to nothing. The adhesive mount is 3M VHB which means it isn't coming off. The bike mount is well built and swapping it between my bikes hasn't been an issue. The rubber straps are holding up well. Ideally I'd like a second set for my other bike so I can zip tie them on and never worry about the rubber straps wearing out. The including adhesive mount was put on my Otterbox case and didn't add any noticeable bulk. The adapters are very low profile. The flexibility with the variety of components makes the design of the system a win but the cost is a detractor.
