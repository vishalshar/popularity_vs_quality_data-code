Great box however only one USB seems to work at a time, I have my amazon Alexa plugged into it, but it won't charge my cell phone when plugged in. Also it would be amazing if it had gps tracking technology built in, the alarm is cool to stop kids from messing with it, but it can easily be removed from the home for those criminals who know what it is.
