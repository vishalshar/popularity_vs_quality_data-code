Solid charger. Super slim, can't feel it on nor does it looks bulky like other cases. Great customer service. The top piece does slip off time to time in pockets. Had a small issue and they took care of it within a day (not charger related). Only reason for 4/5 star is because like other phone cases where you get a nice little raise along brim of screen, this cover is flush with the screen which makes it not very protective on a frontal drop. And if you put glass cover on top, now you're higher than the cover. In terms of charging, awesome, double battery
