I bought this phone for two main reasons: 1. I needed a dual-SIM that didn't suck because carrying two phones looked odd, and 2. I wanted to play Pokemon Go with minimal crashes. The One Plus Two has managed both tasks beautifully. The ability to set up different users on the same phone has been very useful to keep my work and personal accounts separate (something that worried my boss about switching to a dual SIM), and I'm constantly running several apps without problems.So far I've run into very few problems, it rarely freezes (way less than my previous Galaxy S5), the Audio Tuner equalizer makes a very big difference, and the movement sensors work well with my fitness apps. The camera takes beautiful pics, although I would like to see its layout improved - it was rather hard at first to figure out where the flash on/off button was, and its settings in general could be made more intuituve. I recommend this for anyone who wants to get as much as possible on a mid-range budget.
