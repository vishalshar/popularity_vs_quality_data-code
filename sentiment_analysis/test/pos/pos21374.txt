In out of the wind.  Just before "The Interview."  Fresh off the plane.  During intermission.  The last thing you do before she opens the door.  Go-comb is the perfect ally for that last-minute grooming improvement.  And it doesn't add pocket baggage.  Invisible in your wallet or checkbook case until you need it, you'll be glad to have it.  Great product.
