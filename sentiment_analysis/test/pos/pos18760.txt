After using an iOttie suction mount in the car and being very satisfied, I decided to grab one of these bike mounts a few months ago when there was only 1 review. I've been thoroughly satisfied with this product. Mounts easily, and keeps my iPhone 6 secured. Even received a phone call from iOttie a month after purchase calling to see how the product was doing & if I had any questions. Keep it up iOttie!
