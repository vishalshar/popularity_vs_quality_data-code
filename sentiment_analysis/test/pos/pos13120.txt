The URB-E does what it intends extremely well. It is relatively light, it is fast and responsive, and it's ability to collapse with minimal effort is beyond amazing. The main downside is that the tires are solid and relatively small. Every road imperfection is transmitted to the rider -  much more than on a bicycle or a 50cc motor scooter. When I ride, people on the sidewalk or even in cars stop me and want to know more about it. Definitely high on the cool meter.
