WOW, it's better then I thought. This is no Mickey Mouse wire.  I've read a post where someone broke the top that plugs into the iPhone.When you plug it in your iPhone, then try to manipulate the wire. I can see where it would break the tip. That tip is not the wires fault. This thing is built like a tank and even a tank has its week spots. I've started using it today. I can't believe how fast my iPhone 6 Plus charges. Even plugged in with my regular lighting wire. It would train fast. If I were surfing Facebook. I could see my battery levels falling like a rock. So I decided to try it with my new Titan lighting cable. I was at 20%, fine. Continued with Facebook for a few minutes expecting it to read about 17% or 18%. Instead it read 22%, a few minutes more and it read 24%. Now that put an unexpected smile on my face. Is this product worth buying. ABSOLUTLY YES. The rumors are true. This wire will not break. An upgrade to Titan lighting cable would be that new magnetic tip I've seen on the market. That for sure would decrease any weak points in the Titan cable even further. Just a thought Titan Tech Team. Fantastic job.
