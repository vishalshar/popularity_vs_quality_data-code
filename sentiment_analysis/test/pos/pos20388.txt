These German built steak knives are extremely high quality. They are definitely built to last and I have no doubt they will indeed last a very long time. I'm very pleased with my purchase and may order more in the near future. The knives feel very sturdy and have a very rich appearance. The blades are very sharp and the handle has a great ergonomic grip.***** This item was purchased with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.
