Reviewing: DCS-935L  (Amazon, fix your review system, you slam reviews for different models together)I had some old cameras and I did look at many cameras including the over priced security camera's.  Based on my budget, these were a great option.  I didn't care for PTZ camera's, so these are fine.Subtracted one star because the set up didn't work (scan cards or WPS).  Not that big of a deal to get around, it should just work.Got what I expected based on reading reviews. There are multiple options for viewing the camera, direct with browser, some free (and paid for) apps on Apples app store and several others (ie: spyconnect.com) on the web as well as some D-Link apps on app store.Pro's:Zero light in the basement, can see very well easily 15 feet to the door.  Could do further, I'd say 20 feet would be around max.Crisp view and colors when well lit.  For medium light, it seems to revert to a semi-gray scale... whatever, not a big deal.Easy setup (when you don't use the scan card), takes a few minutes but worksCon's:Hard to recognize faces in the dark, kind of expected but wanted to list it just in case.Scan card set up is garbage, neat idea, poor execution, didn't work for either of my two camera's multiple timesAmazon doesn't price match these.  Got them for 89 and two days later bestbuy has them for 69 (might do the refund process, not sure)Doesn't do video recording based on motion, but makes sense.  Lot's of free software on the web for that.Steps to set them up without scan card.Plug in, turn on where you have decent WiFi receptionConnect to it's WiFi (as listed on bottom of camera). After SID, password and it connects, it should open a browser to it automatically.WPS did not work multiple times, so I said "no" to WPS and did my home WiFi SID and password manually.Select your house WiFi.  After you fill out the home WiFi stuff settings, here is what I think happens.1) The camera reboots2) Your phone is showing a waiting kind of icon because it lost connection to the camera WiFi3) After a certain amount of time, your phone doesn't see the camera WiFi SID anymore so it reverts back to your default (probably home) wifi4) It then connects to the home wifiBy the time this is done, the camera has probably rebooted and connected to your wifi.  You can then go to your home router and figure out the IP address.  You can open your browser directly to the camera to do any other settings and see the live feed.Screen shots below, taken through ispyconnect.com application.  pretty sure any other way would yield same results.Camera 1: Absolute zero light in basement.  Camera sitting on top of a speaker, over looking air hockey table, towards pool table and double doors.Camera 2: Sitting on fridge, wife paying bills  LOL (Don't tell, she'll be pissed)
