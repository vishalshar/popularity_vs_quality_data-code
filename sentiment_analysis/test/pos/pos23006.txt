I luv my hickies.  I will not go back to laces. This brand is very simple.  I bought a few for my elderly mother.  She tried others and they were very difficult for her to use our broke trying to set them up.  I like that i can modify the fit for my shoe based on how i loop the hickies. After my initial purchase,  i bought more to change out all my shoe laces. Now we just have to test durability over time
