This is a great case. I had the iPhone 5 case and this is a much more elegant design while maintaining compatibility with all the accessories. This feels much nicer in the hand. It would be five stars but, in my opinion, it has a design flaw. Mine has cracked near the camera aperture as has my colleague's and others according to the reviews. Amazon customer service have been fantastic though, processing a refund within 2 hours and offering free delivery on a replacement, should I wish one.Hopefully, Rokform will get this issue resolved soon. The damage seems to occur when removing or inserting the phone. This is made necessary on a more frequent basis as Rokform have, for reasons known only to them, chosen not to provide access to the sim tray as they did with previous models. Therefore the case needs to be removed to get access to the sim. Another design flaw?
