I had this device setup and running in 15 minutes. Works very well on our 70" Vizio TV. The best part is that it connects to our enterprise wireless network with ease. There is a slight lag and I find it easier to look at your laptop and not the TV when moving your cursor. I had 7 people install the software at once in our conference room. I had each individual connect for a minute  then disconnect. We went around the entire table and it performed as described. Impressed with this product. Curious to see if an ethernet adapter would help with the lag.
