It really is great on, well.. everything. Brussels sprouts? Yep. Eggs? You betcha. Steaks, green beans, roasts, carrots.. you really can't go wrong. It's like when you try a recipe, and think, "Huh. Never would have thought to add that, but it's good!" except you can do that without even thinking about it and all it takes is a pinch. I keep mine in a Chef'n Dash Salt Cellar with Flip Top Cover, Coconut and my kitchen has been a very happy place since the two have met.Basically, I can't remember the last time I used a salt shaker or grinder since purchasing this, and I'm completely okay with that.
