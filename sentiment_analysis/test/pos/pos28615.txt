Very happy with this device. Setup was easy, I just plugged it in and followed the instructions in the app from your phone.The laser sucks, even calibrated it a few times, but maybe it's because I'm having the camera pointed from a corner of a large room and it's harder to interpret from 2D screen into a 3D world. Laser also seems limited to a large grid, making it's movements blocky, instead of smooth. But that's not why I got it. The camera looks great and is good quality, also at night, the night vision is great. I remote into the camera from my office and even from the road over LTE, without problems. Doing it from home to test over the same WIFI may put a strain on the connection because now you're uploading and downloading over the same WIFI.Anyway, I'm very happy with this, even after reading so many negative reviews, I'm glad I got it for those moment's I'm not at home to see what my dog is up to.
