I have had this radio for a few months now.  I use it every weekend around a bonfire, or when I work in the garage and yard.  I took it up to my cabin up north where my brother and his buddy ended up getting one of their own because they were so impressed.  I used to use one of those large Milwaukee Tools radios everywhere I go, but that is big and bulky.  This one is not.  I haven't tested the full 16 hour battery life, but I've gotten close.  Yes, when your phone is on full volume and this radio is on full volume, you might hear slight distortion on only a few songs.  I found the lower quality MP3 songs on my phone were the culprits.  The sound quality is crisp, the size it perfect, and everyone who sees it comments on how cool it is.  It's not a room, blaster, but it's got enough sound to play around the party of people.  I also like the camera threads on back.  We've mounted this thing on a golf cart, Kawasaki Mule, and even on a boat.  I now wish I didn't replace my marine FM radio last year.  I could have easily have just used this.
