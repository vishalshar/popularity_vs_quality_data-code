Oh my gosh, these are so addictingly delicious!I've always been a popcorn lover.  It's my favorite food ever, and I love it in just about every form.  All my life, I've always loved the bottom of the popcorn bowl with the kernels.  I know they're not great for your teeth, but that never stopped me from eating them.These Kernel Season's Crunchin' Popcorn are NOT hard like the kernels in the bottom of a popcorn bowl.  They are much, much softer and easier on the teeth.  I'm not really sure how they did it, but they made these things perfectly.  There are other products on the market that are "partially popped popcorn kernels" and I sure love those too, but they are definitely hard on the teeth.  I think I'll stick with these Kernel Seasons brand, because they are just as delicious but much softer.  I have only tried the ranch flavor so far, but I'm anxious to try the other flavors too.I'll definitely be reordering, but I need to be careful because they are truly addicting!  So delicious!
