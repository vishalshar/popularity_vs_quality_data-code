My Cane Corso puppy and two adult pugs love this food. For my giant breed puppy it also has the perfect amount of protein(30%) and calcium(1.4%). Calcium/phosphorus ratio is good too(1.4/1.0). A lot of people don't realize how important this is for the larger breeds. You do NOT want the larger breeds to grow too fast. This is terrible for their joints and increases their chance of developing hip dysplasia or elbow problems. You want a steady, sustained growth for these big guys(and gals). I know some of you want them to be as big as possible, but don't worry, they will get as big as they can regardless of the rate of growth. The most important thing is that, when they do reach their full size, they are able to enjoy their life happily and pain free. I had a Rottie in the 90s that was severely dysplastic and, trust me, you don't want to see your dog suffer like that. Yes, this was before I knew about the importance of growth rate. Anyway, point is, this is the perfect dog food for you large/giant breed owners.  Another plus is his poop is much more solid and consistent(pugs too)...pretty smelly, though...lol. I had them on Taste of the Wild before this and their poop was much softer(and still smelly anyway). That food also had good nutrient levels, but this seems to be better for my dogs digestion. Dog food advisor enthusiastically recommends this good and so do I.
