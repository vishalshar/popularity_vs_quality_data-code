I love this product! I've tried other mushrooms before but never Cordyceps. I got interested as I read that it helps with adrenal fatigue which I've been suffering. I've been now using 10 packs of it and I feel a huge difference. My energy levels are up plus I don't feel the downs I felt just one week ago.This stuff is dual extracted and has 1500 mg of the real thing, Cordyceps mushroom, per packet. What I've read and compared, it's crazy high amount. It has nice but not too sweet taste to it because of stevia. I don't want to use complicated products and I can just carry these packs in my pocket or bag wherever I go. I usually mix this to my morning smoothie or when I want to get more taste to hot water as company suggests.Highly, highly recommended!!!
