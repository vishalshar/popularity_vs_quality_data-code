As one of the people who suffered from all sorts of nasal-related illnesses, I was one of the first ones to buy this device. Although skeptical at first, I quickly realized what this devices allows me to do. Awair allows me to actively battle the chronic conditions - the conditions that made me go through many surgeries and hospital visits in my earlier days.Unlike how modern medicine deals with chronic conditions such as sinusitis (which are mainly surgical procedures and pills - things that help me for the time being but don't change how I live during normal days), Awair almost forces me to look at the environment of a place I spent most of my time in. For my fellow sinusitis patients (and many others who care for air quality for various reasons) it's easy to forget that improving air quality in our own home is one of the easiest (and most effective) treatments we can give/receive.Awair is simple; it has 5 air-quality-measuring metrics, a qualitative score (in number and from the color of the dot next to the number) resulting from those metrics, and a clock. Day 1, I ignored most of the signals it tried to alert me with. It's been almost a month, and those signals are what I look at the first and the last thing of my day. In a sense Awair is like my mother's nagging voice - I vacuum more frequently, understand how VOCs and CO2 levels affect my health (I mean, to begin with, teaching me what VOC even is), and monitor the dust level so I can get a better sleep after the crazy day. And it doesn't stop there; Awair goes on and tells me all these health advices from the app. Did you know that having a plant in your room isn't a bad idea, but it could cause a over-humid atmosphere due to the wet soil, and rocks/stone over the soil solves this problem?Ovevall, Awair has been changing how I would think to deal with these conditions day-to-day. It's not just an air-quality monitor - it's a health teacher, a source-of-truth with a vast depth of knowledge all condensed in a small wooden device.Oh, almost forgot... and it looks amazingly beautiful on your shelves.
