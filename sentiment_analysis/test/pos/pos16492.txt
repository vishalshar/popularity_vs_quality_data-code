My son and I are simple people ... we just like to turn it on and pretend it's chasing us ... which it does when we make noise, which is cool. My son was sort of scared of it at first, but still loved to run from it. Now he pats it and tells the dinosaur, "Hey dinosaur, come look at this!" - so overall it's great, we have a ton of fun with it, and we aren't even using all of it's functions.We have hardwood floors on our bottom floor and that's the only surface that we've tried it on, and it works great. Also, I put cheap batteries in there, assuming that once they ran out I would have to get rechargable, high-powered ones, and that hasn't been the case ... we have used this thing since Christmas (plus I played with it a lot prior), and I mean all the time, like it's on throughout the day, and the batteries are finally dying ... so a month of solid use from cheap batteries.Overall I'm very happy I purchased this.
