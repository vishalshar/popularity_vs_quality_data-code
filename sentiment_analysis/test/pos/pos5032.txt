I really enjoy using my Lumo Run to help coach me during my runs and to help remind me of my form and posture as I am running especially when I start getting tired.  I unfortunately lost my tracker last weekend as I forgot to take it off when I was done running and ended up sitting and doing a bunch of stuff after my workout and it fell off.  So one word of advise is to make sure and take it off when done running to avoid losing the tracker.  I am purchasing a second one and will make sure to take better care of it!
