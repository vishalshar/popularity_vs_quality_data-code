I had been looking for a higher end speaker for all the various devices in the home. My old stereo set up lives in the TV room so I was looking to get better sound quality around the house. Ive tried a few of the usual brick style bluetooth speakers. While fine for listening to a podcast most music sounds dreadful.After trying out the ZIPP speaker for a couple weeks I have to say it is a great sounding portable speaker.The soundFor a modest sized device the Zipp packs a punch. Surprised that the speaker can deliver so much bass considering the size. Not boomy but clear and well defined. Mids and highs are crisp and not sharp or shrill. Even at high volume there was no distortion. Half of full volume is enough to fill a generous sized room. It is also fun to try different locations in a room to find what works best. Regardless of location it is room filling sound. Even outdoors the sound is impressive.Features/connectivityI was shocked at how easily all my devices were able to connect. Fast setup for iPhone, iPad, laptop and even Apple TV. There was no problem for wifi or bluetooth. The iOS app is great for changing preferences and radio stations. The Spotify Connect feature is a huge bonus. Being able to stream directly on wifi is great if you need your device for other uses aside from music. You can even cycle through songs and playlists from the speaker itself if you wish. Another cool features is the hush function which will silence the speaker when you place your hand over it. The speaker is also easy on the eyes. It just looks cool and is a good conversation starter.Overall very satisfied with the ZIPP speaker. I highly recommend it.
