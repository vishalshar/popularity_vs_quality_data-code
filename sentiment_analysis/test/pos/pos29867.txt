I'm pretty stoked on the TrackR Bravo especially as a guy who constantly doesn't remember where his phone or keys are. It great that I can find one if I have the other with the TrackR bravo. I didn't even think about putting it on a pet that's an awesome idea! Cool little tracking device, I like it a lot.
