I was extremely excited to order these bars after reading about the health benefits of chia seeds - the Health Warrior bars looked great.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find how small each bar is - maybe I should have looked at the product details more closely, but it turns out that each bar is VERY small (think about half the size of a luna bar) which was disappointing.  Luckily, at only 100 calories each, the small size was not a huge deal, I just found that I wasn't entirely satisfied after just eating 1.  The taste was great, but I'm a health nut and some people might find that the Health Warrior bars are not as sweet as traditional granola bars.  I will happily eat the rest of the box but will reconsider before buying again, especially considering the price.
