I love this more than I thought I would.  It lets out a nice, warm light that is also still very bright. Unlike many energy saving bulbs, it also illuminates at full capacity immediately, rather than warming up to max brightness.My kitchen has an overhead exposed pendant lighting up the entire room, so for brightness I bought the type comparable to 60W.  It works beautifully, and the design is complementary (and far more attractive than other energy saving bulbs).Yes, its a bit pricey, but very worth it IMO.
