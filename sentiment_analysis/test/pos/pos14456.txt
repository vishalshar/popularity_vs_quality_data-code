I like cables, but I hate cable clutter. These days there are at least three different styles of the same cable and I like to have one of each. Because, well, you never know what youre going to need when. So, the inevitable question is, how do you keep all your lovely cables organized when they reside in the bottom of your laptop bag? The answer is simple. You need a cable tie. There are a lot of different styles out there. Everything from a rubber band to tape to extravagant Velcro wraps can be found online when you search for cable ties. Ive actually be exposed to them all given my experience with video production. So, when I fell into these tiny little magnetic cable ties, I really wasnt sure what to think. I quickly became a fan of Cloop.Cloop is a tiny magnetic cable tie that really gained some traction on Kickstarter in 2015. Their project launched in April and in just a few short weeks, they met their goal. When you get your hands on the product its easy to see why. When the ends of Cloop are connected, it forms a loop. In each of the ends there is a neodymium magnet that makes it easy to open and close the loop. Cloop has a cut out in its silicone wrap that allows you to slip the end of a cable though it. This keeps Cloop close to your cable and you dont have to worry about losing it.I will admit that I had my doubts about Cloop at first. After all, how could such a tiny wrap hold a cable together. Very quickly after opening the package, I discovered that good things really do come in small packages and that they were plenty strong to hold a cable together. That being said, the Cloop does have its limits. There are currently two sizes of cable  small and large  and the Cloop designers give a guide on the website so that users can match their cable needs to the correct size. Just a note, if you try to use a cable that is too small for the Cloop you have, it wont close properly.The small Cloop is ideal for small cables, such as earbuds, USB cables, smartphone chargers, headphone cables, iPad & tablet chargers, iPod chargers and Kindle chargers. While the large Cloop is perfect for desk organization and traveling. According to their website, they will soon have an XL version of Cloop for sale, which will measure 57% bigger than the large version.Cloop is really a remarkable accessory. It has a function and sleek form, plus it is affordable. Ive found that they work really well, even if you are just wrapping up a cable and tossing it in a bag. The only time Ive found that they dont hold together is when Im trying to tie up a cable that is just too big for the Cloop size I am using. Thats operator error though and not a fault of the product.
