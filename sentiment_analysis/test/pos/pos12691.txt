This is good filament made on a quite precise manufacturing process. Filament diameter is consistent and the filament on a test print seemed to be really consistent from a compositional standpoint as well. Contrary to opinions expressed here, it is very possible to print with this filament successfully without a heated bed - raise temp to 225-230C and print with a raft. Easy. Parts are strong and light - just what I was hoping to achieve.
