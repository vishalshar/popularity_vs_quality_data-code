This is an excellent product. I don't wear makeup, but I have very thin eyelashes that frequently fall out, and wanted something to help bring them out. I've been using this in combination with castor oil and growth serum, and lash masque makes lashes look thicker and longer without looking clumpy like mascara. Just one layer gives the lashes a very natural look, it doesn't look like you're wearing any makeup. If you have long eyelashes but they are mostly blond or have clear tips, this will work wonderfully for you and give your tips color.If you want a thick mascara look, you will probably have to put mascara on top of it, but I've read that it makes a good base coat for mascara (haven't tried myself.) If you don't want to wear mascara but want natural looking lashes, this is for you. I hate the feeling of makeup, but this doesn't feel like wearing makeup at all.It does come off with water, but won't smear everywhere if it gets wet, it'll just come off. I love that it's so lightweight that there isn't really a reason to take it off at night, I just sleep with it and reapply the next day.
