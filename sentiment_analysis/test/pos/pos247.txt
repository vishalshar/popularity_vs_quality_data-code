I purchased this shaving oil recently as I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the Somerset oil I had purchased previously.  This Thrive Natural Shave oil was cheaper and came in a slightly larger bottle making it a very good value.In comparing it to the Somerset oil, this one is a little thinner, which I actually like. (The Somerset oil would clog my Triple Blade razors easily.).The Thrive Natural oil has that nice Moroccan Argan Oil scent which my girlfriend really likes, giving it an extra bonus point! :).Unfortunately, this oil also stings my skin a bit, especially if I get it on my lips, which happens like ALL the time when I'm shaving.  It feels like a very strong cinnamon (but tastes more like peppermint) when I get it on my lips.  I have really sensitive skin, so I thought it was just me, so I had others try it and they gave me the same feedback.  That said, it's not enough of a tingle / sting for me to stop using it, but I can imagine it might be for some with super sensitive skin.After my purchase, I received the following email from the vendor, which made me feel extra good about my purchase: "Your Thrive purchase directly supports rural farming families and talented female entrepreneurs in Costa Rica. In partnership with them, we grow the unique plant ingredients in your Thrive in a way that restores degraded landscapes. We think its the future of business: going beyond "sustainable" to leave things better than we found them."So, if your skin is not super sensitive (or if you like that Noxema tingle) I say go ahead and give this product a shot! :)
