From the perspective of a health nut, outdoorsman, military member these energy tabs are a lifesaver! The taste may put off some but they taste great to me and I don't have to worry about any unnecessary, unnatural, artificial flavoring. Whenever I take one (usually after lunch when I begin to drag), I feel invigorated and focused without that jittery, skin crawling sensation I get with energy drinks and pre-workouts. Sometimes I actually use this in place of my pre-workout for runs and hikes without worrying about my heart exploding!  If you are an health conscious individual who is searching for an alternative to energy drinks, pre-workouts, or sugary coffee then I highly recommend you try a tin of Voke Tabs!
