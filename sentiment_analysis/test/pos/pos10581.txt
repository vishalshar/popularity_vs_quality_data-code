Pros:Sounds great.I like the form factor, it stands up on end or on its side and the buttons are easily identifiable by feel.Cons:It does not play WMAs at all which stinks because most of my collection is in WMA.  However the JRiver based PonoMusicPlayer does auto convert to mp3, flac, or alac.Battery lasts at most 8 hours while playing.There is no hibernate function, so either the battery drains (slowly) or it shuts down entirely which requires a slow library scan and loses your place in the playlist.
