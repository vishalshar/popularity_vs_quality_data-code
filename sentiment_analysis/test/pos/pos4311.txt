They are exactly what I wanted. They make running so much easier. The only down side is that I've had about 3  of them snap when I was running. The picture I added is my shoes now and you can see I'm missing one of them in the front. They are over all really nice and I love that I don't have to worry about shoe laces anymore. Just a little sad that some broke, I've used up all the extra ones that it came with.
