Im always losing my stuff.  It drives me bananas.  I was given this TrackR for free by Deal Smart, and while I was waiting for it to arrive I lost my keys. The same day I lost my spare keys.  Fortunately I had SPARE spare keys and I immediately attached the TrackR to them when it arrived.The few times I have needed to use the TrackR to find my keys in the few weeks I have had it brought immense relief.  I was so grateful to be able to use the TrackR app to make the TrackR Bravo ring (for some reason I really like the sound).  I found my keys in seconds instead of spending 15 minutes making a complete mess of my room and my mood trying to find them.If your bluetooth is on and you walk too far away from your device, your phone will send you a notification and a map with its last known locationHowever I wish there was a way to find your TrackR without having to use bluetooth.  Your app wont be able to locate your item if it is out of bluetooth range. Their solution (called Crowd GPS) is that if someone with the TrackR app who is nearby your TrackR has their bluetooth on your app will be able to locate the device.I havent needed to use that yet because when I lose my keys I cant drive anywhere so usually they are somewhere close by.  But if you are putting your device in your wallet or attaching it to something else you dont want to lose this may present a problem.One of the FAQs they list is Can this device be used on humans?  They say they dont recommend anything.  That doesnt affect my rating at all, I just found it amusing :)  And perhaps disconcerting.Anyways, as much as I need one of these and am grateful for it, I probably wouldnt buy one on my own.  However I think it works really well and if you want one youll be happy you have one.
