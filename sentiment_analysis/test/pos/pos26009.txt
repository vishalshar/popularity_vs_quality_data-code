I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it! It puts out incredible sound and it is certainly water proof! Definitely worth the money!I did my research before buying a waterproof, bluetooth speaker because I wanted to make sure I got a good one! The price is so worth it! This is a product that you don't want to skimp on! She uses it at a dance studio and it puts out plenty of sound for her classes to be able to hear and she also likes to use it in the shower even when people are sleeping and she and I can both hear it just fine! Very good quality sound as well!Like I said, DONT SKIMP! Spend the money and you will NOT regret it!
