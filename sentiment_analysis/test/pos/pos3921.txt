Before this I was an avid Blue Buffalo purchaser. I want the best for my fur babies and I did my research and this seems to be a good quality food and is not super expensive like others I have purchased. My dogs eat it, but are not very crazy for it. I am have been purchasing different  flavors to see if maybe they prefer another best.
