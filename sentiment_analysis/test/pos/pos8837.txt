I love traveling with this cord because it's so small and eliminates the annoyance of wrapping long cords. The plastic on the USB portion split on the first NomadKey I received. I couldn't find a customer service email address so I sent a note with a photo to them on Facebook. I received a response from a rep within an hour and received a replacement free of charge within a few days. Super fantastic customer service! I highly recommend this product.
