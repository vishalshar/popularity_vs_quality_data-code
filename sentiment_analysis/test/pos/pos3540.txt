I was slightly skeptical when I ordered these, but I have to say that they turned out to be an excellent purchase.The molding process is very simple, although I amit I had my husband help me get a perfect fit. Once that is done the's puppies are almost perfect isolat ion headphones, and I have good reason to use them.I have yet to use the reminding feature, but it is comforting knowing that the feature exists in case I melt my headphones in the car or just want to refit them. As far as I know this is the only brand that allows for reminding.
