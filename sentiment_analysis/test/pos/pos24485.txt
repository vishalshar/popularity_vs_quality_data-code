I bought my first Remocam from Indiegogo and it was my second purchase.The security camera system that I originally had broke last year. It was raining hard one day, and the water somehow got into the security camera system and fried it including several cameras.. well, thats what I was told. Anyway, I remember that the estimate for fixing it was over $2,000 including labor.I wanted to fix it right away but it never reached the top on my to do list.. until I saw Remocam on Indiegogo(I waited 3 months for the early bird special price). I installed the first one at the loading dock so that I can see whats coming in and going out (and hear whats going on when I want to).Using the app that I installed on my phone, I can turn the camera to see other parts of the warehouse. Before, I had several fixed cameras covering different areas but it wasnt necessary anymore.The second camera I bought from Amazon is now covering the entrance and its been working great. I can talk to the person who is waiting at the lobby using the mic/speaker installed on Remocam.I see that the camera has other functions that I havent tried, but to see/hear/talk/tilt/turn were all I needed and Im giving 5 stars for that functions.
