I know it says they are 25grams each, so you assume they are small - but they REALLY are small! I was actually surprised when I opened the box to see how tiny they were. Although they were better then expected, I'm on the fence on whether I would buy again after considering the price per bar. Honestly, I did not realize that they are around $1.45 a bar until writing this review... unfortunately, that lowers the chances of me re-buying these in the future, but here are some of my thoughts after eating them:First, it's probably best you if you've had experience eating chia seeds before - if not, go try a single bar before you commit to the box because they have a distinct texture/taste that you have to get used too. I like coconut but mixed with the chia seeds the taste got old very quickly, which is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.Second, I used these for when I was going to the gym after work to help suppress my appetite before dinner. These tiny bars actually did help, and if your really hungry you could always eat two!  (usually if I did this, I got tired of the taste, which made me feel full, so I guess it still worked, haha)Lastly, I think the best way to use these bars would be to buy two flavors at a time or maybe a different brands "healthy" bar and switch them up, so you don't get tired of constantly having the same taste/texture.
