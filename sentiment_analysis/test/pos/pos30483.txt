Oh boy, is this GOOD coffee!!!  I am super picky about my coffee.  I first tried cold brewed coffee at my local Seattle's Best in the late 1990s and I was hooked!  Since they closed most of their locations, I have been looking for another source.  I have tried making it myself, but I was disappointed withe the results.  I have tried other brands that my grocery store recently began carrying and all but one brand was terrible.  I saw the reviews here and this brand had the most positive reviews.  Now I am addicted to this!  If you love cold brewed coffee, buy this!
