LOVE! I just started fermenting veggies, and these helped a great deal. I put veggies in my wide-mouth mason jar, stamped them down, poured in brine (except w/shredded, salted cabbage, that created enough juice on it's own), topped with big cabbage leaf, weights, pickle pipe, screwed on jar lid ring. One week later I started eating AWESOME fermented veggies! WONDERFUL and EASY!
