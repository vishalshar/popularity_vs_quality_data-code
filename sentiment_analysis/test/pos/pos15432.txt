This rubber is simple to use and is really strong! There are so many things you can fix/repair with this rubber. All you have to do is get creative.Here is a list of a few things I have used Sugru for:-Added higher nose pads to my glasses so they fit better and no longer slide down-The attachment to my gas cap broke so I repaired it and attached it back on -- works perfectly now!-Part of the plastic to my laundry machine handle broke off so I secured it back on with Sugru-Repaired my iPhone charger cables-Made tiny hooks on my bathroom mirror to hang necklaces
