Love it. I've got two of these. One on the roadie and one on my grocery getter. I absolutely love this system.Just to test it out I threw it on my mountain bike and went for an hour ride on some local single track (not fire roads, real trails). My phone never fell off no matter how many bumps there were! I even took a spill and it was still there. I won't try this again on rough trails though because that much vibration is probably going to kill my phone.I've got the wall mount to and use it in my car for GPS viewing on my phone.
