I've had the Rif6 Cube for about 2 weeks now, and I'm so happy with my decision. I can't get over how much power this little guy drives from such a small footprint. So - here's the thing - it's not HD. But when you point it up to your wall (or in my case, ceiling), hook it up to a power source, a wireless HDMI input (in my case, Chromecast) and a wireless audio output, the convenience of the solution will make the lack of pixels irrelevant. I've used a bunch of projectors before and I've always had issues with (lack of) focus, (too much) heat, (too little) brightness and (too much) noise. None of those were issues I faced with the RIf6.You get a lot in the box, my favourite of which is the super-sturdy and flexible tripod stand. I wouldn't count too much on the little guy's speakers, so I connected it to a BlueTooth audio transmitter. I do wish they had included an HDMI to mini-HDMI converter instead of the extra micro-USB cable, but I found a $6 accessory that did the trick. Considering you're basically getting a 120-inch TV for under $300, that also you can put into your pocket and take anywhere, the Rif6 is a steal.Tip: I created a mini-shopping list of items that go well with the Rif6 to create your ultimate low-footprint home entertainment solution: http://a.co/1nrQJcv
