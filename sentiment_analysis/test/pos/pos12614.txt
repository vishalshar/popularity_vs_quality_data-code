For safety reasons, we have been taking our garage remotes inside, and it's just one more thing to remember! I knew there must be something out there to enable our smart phones to open/close our garage. I found several options, most came with semi-complex configurations and extra power adapter requirements.When I came across gLink, I was impressed by the simplicity and previous customer reviews, so I placed my order.My gLInk arrived yesterday and I had it working in less than 5 minutes. I tested all the features and everything worked as advertised. I even tested the gesture functionality (which is in beta); knocking three times with the phone on the lock screen - and it worked too.gLink, you have a super happy customer in me - and I plan on telling people about your wonderfully functional and super-simple-to-set-up product.
