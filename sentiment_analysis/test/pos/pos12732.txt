I've got a unique pen hold when I write, and it gives me a very heavy palm-on-page.  This has always been a problem with iPad styli in programs that use some sort of palm rejection.  I tried the Evernote Jot stylus for penultimate, but I had accuracy problems.  It didn't record ~1/10 letters correctly (admittedly, this was months ago).  So I'm very cautious about buying expensive bluetooth styli.  Pencil really works great (I've only used its active features in the Paper app).  Even though I dearly want FiftyThree to give me lined and gridded page layouts, and ink widths for the tools to give me the total note-taking experience, I can totally use Paper as a functional electronic hand-written note platform using it.  I actually haven't found a problem with it, yet, and I've used it on and off for the past 72 hours.
