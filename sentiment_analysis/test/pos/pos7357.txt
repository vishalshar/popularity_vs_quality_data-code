These socks are great. I'm a woman who has searched for several years for no-show socks that actually stay on my feet. Seems like all the pairs I have slip off once my shoes are on and I'm walking. Not so with these. The cotton is super comfy, and the grippy thing in the back ensures that the sock stays where it should. I haven't had any slipping problems at all. I wear size 9-9.5 and ordered the small.
