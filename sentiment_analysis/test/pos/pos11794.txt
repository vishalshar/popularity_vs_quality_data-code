Since placing both of my children in these seats , I have gotten judgemental glances and  have even been ostracized by law enforcement. Because the children ride much lower in the vehicle and because they use the car's safety belt, people assume that they are not in car seats. I feel that those exact reasons are much safer. I am just sick of the looks. Maybe the company should include a window cling that says mind your own business, my child is in a mifold booster seat!
