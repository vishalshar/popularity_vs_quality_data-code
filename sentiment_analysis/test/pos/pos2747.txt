Omgsh I was waiting for months for them to restock once they send me an email I went straight and bought my sons bike whom he loves it!!! I am so happy! I was the last person to get the green in 18"  it is a very nice bike indeed! If you follow the instructions you'll be good with the bike I had a lil help from my brother but because I am not a fan of building things lol but over all the bike is awesome always getting compliments and my son just loves riding it ?
