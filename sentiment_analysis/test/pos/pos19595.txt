My kids really like this vitamin.  I like that there are no crazy fillers or HFCS.  HOWEVER, (and this is why I gave it 3 stars) if you require Methylated B12 (like my family does), you also MUST take methylated B9 (which is called methyfolate) due to the methylation issues.  This vitamin contains FOLIC ACID.  At the very least, not usable by individuals needing methylated forms...but it is also the most unusable form by any body and people should not be intaking folic acid, but folate.So, while I love that my kids love this vitamin and that there is no fight to take them every morning, I will not buy these vitamins until they are produced using 1) folate and 2) hopefully methylfolate.Edited to update: this product is now fully methylated.  I purchased a new bottle and the kids still love it, so just ordered a 3 pack.  Yes, it gets expensive (I have 5 kids) but knowing that they'll take these every day without fighting and whining...it is worth the cost to me.  I completely recommend this product.  The best kids vitamins out there now.
