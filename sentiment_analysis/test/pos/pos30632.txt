I've bought many Logitech Harmony remotes for myself and family members over the past 6 or 7 years.  This one tops them all.  In my case, the only reason I upgraded originally was because I wanted a remote that could pair with our Amazon Fire TV which doesn't support IR remotes.  Despite some misleading comments on reviews and forums, it does this beautifully!  The addition of the hub to the mix has been a nice touch that makes a difference.Also, for those of us who are turning to home automation, this remote has you covered for manual control!  I've got it issuing commands to my Samsung SmartThings hub as well as our Honeywell Thermostats.  My favorite is the "Bed Time" activity I created which automatically turns off the lights in the house, adjusts the thermostats, and shuts down the entertainment center.  I've got it scheduled to happen at 11:45 in case we fall asleep with it on, but it's nice for the many nights we crash earlier than that and trigger the activity manually.
