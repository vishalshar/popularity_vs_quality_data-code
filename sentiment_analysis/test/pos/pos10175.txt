Love the idea, love the look, needs some improvements. The step tracking does not seem to be highly accurate (it's ballpark close, so good enough for me but I'm sure that others would mind), no altimeter for stair climbing, and you cannot add your own meditation sessions in. That, for me, is the biggest problem. I meditate, I would love to track that, but in order to track it on the LEAF you need to do their own, recorded, guided meditations which honestly are not very good and none of them are the recommended 20 minutes (thought I'd just silence it and use it as a tracker).Very stylish though, and I love that I have 3 ways to wear it. Im sure that they will continue to improve.
