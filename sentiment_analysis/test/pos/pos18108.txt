After a year of debating and researching mattresses, along with over two years of sore backs and necks, my husband and I decided to take the plunge and order the Ghost bed. We researched all kinds of mattresses, but since we are on a budget, we were debating between GhostBed and Purple. We went with GhostBed because it was cheaper and the reviews of the mattress seemed to be what we were looking for.The first night sleeping on it, I tossed and turned. My back was so so sore the next day. The next night was close to the same, and same for my husband. But the third night was heaven. Neither of us woke up hardly at all. We love this mattress because the motion doesn't transfer as much, so we do not wake each other up as often when we move in our sleep (we both move a lot in our sleep)! After about a week, we finally fully adjusted to sleeping on a memory foam mattress. I'm even convinced that our Dachshund sleeps better on this mattress. It is also a very cool mattress. Unlike most reviews on Amazon, we received NOTHING for this review, and it is totally unbiased.
