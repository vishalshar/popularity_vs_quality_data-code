I don't like wearing mascara.  I wear very little makeup.  When Neutrogena Clean Lash Tint was discontinued, I was very disappointed.  Another review mentions this as a good replacement.  I think it's even better! The natural ingredients seem to nourish my lashes and the black tint is very subtle.  This light formula picks up even my tiniest lashes, making the overall impression that I have fuller lashes, not in the way that mascara thickens and lengthens.  I have also applied to my brows and find the results better than using a pencil for filling (just be careful not to pick up the tiny hairs around the actual brow).I also have some problems with dry eyes.  When I use eyedrops or rub my eyes, there is no running, smudging or smearing.  And no flakes anywhere.  I've even left it on overnight and did not wake up with raccoon eyes.  My lashes feel softer and nourished, not brittle or stiff.  All of these are better than the results I had Neutrogena.  And while the price is more than Neutrogena was, I am more pleased... and it's certainly less expensive than my favorite "actual" mascara, Chanel.
