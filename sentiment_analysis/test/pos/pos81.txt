Love this dock! Heavy and secure so that I can pull my phone off without holding the dock down with my other hand. Easy set-up with my apple lightning cable and reaches the charging port even on my wife's phone with the slightly bulky Wydan Hybrid TUFF case. My only gripe was the price. Again, extremely happy with this, but can't help feeling like this was a little overpriced for what you get,
