Hubby absolutely loves these.  He asked me, "Where in the world did you find these?".  I just smiled.He wears dress shirts three times a week at a minimum.  He had a huge pile of stays in his drawer, and every morning he would rummage through that drawer looking for the correct set for that day's shirt.  Well, no more!  He packed away those stays for when those shirts get donated to Goodwill or whatever.These things add more weight than you'd expect though, I was surprised at how heavy they are.  Not too heavy, hubby doesn't seem to mind.  He did comment though - and this is a big deal for travelers - he will have to remember to take them out when going through security!  That thought never occurred to me.  Yes, they are metal.  Yes, they will set off the alarms.  He said that is worried that some over-zealous security agent at TSA might think that these are a weapon and his new beloved collar stays might be confiscated.
