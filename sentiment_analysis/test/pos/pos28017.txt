I knew that bettas need a heater, and intended on finding an appropriate one. The brochure that comes with the tank even recommends getting a heater, but there is no place to put one because of the lid design, and I wasn't comfortable putting a heater on a plastic tank. I opted for an exterior grow light, and with the tank's warm spot in the house, the water temperature is 78-80. I used my own rocks, because the included gravel had SO much dust and sediment in it, even when rinsed. The tank itself was gritty, more than just dusty from shelf life, and felt used. The grow media was chalky, too, but was easily rinsed clean. The lid is difficult to work with: if you have to get into the tank for any reason, you have to unplug the pump, drain the tray, pull everything off, then reassemble. I used an alternate brand of water conditioner, got some pH up/down, and I added a java fern and crypto plant. The pump works perfectly, it just doesn't like to stay in place: it doesn't come off, it just slides around.I added the fish a few days ago and he is doing well! The tank is surprisingly spacious for a betta, even with the rocks, logs, plants and decorations I threw in. I'm considering adding a nerite snail.The seeds... What a mess. I totally recommend just rinsing the dirt off a rooted plant and adding it to a basket. The included seeds (wheatgrass and radish sprouts), even if you let them germinate, will slip through the slots in the baskets and get into the water tray, occasionally getting down into the aquarium. I pulled some sage from the garden and put it in one basket, and though I tried the included seeds in three other baskets, I am seeking already-rooted alternatives.If you are expecting to buy this ~$55 tank and have literally everything you need, ready to go, you are mistaken. I've already spent about $100 on this fish. However, as for the tank/pump alone and nothing else, this is a nice little set up for counter-top aquaponics. I think this should be treated as just the tank, without the expectation of it having everything you need keep plants/fish. Because there are several other things you need to accompany it (pH treatment, blood worms, hidey holes, more gravel, live aquarium plants, a heater and/or grow light, and your own herbs with roots on them). I'm having fun with it.
