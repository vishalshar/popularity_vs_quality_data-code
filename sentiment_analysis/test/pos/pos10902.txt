Great mug, keeps drinks cold for a decent period of time,  main reason for the purchase of this mug was due to a boat trip and this thing never let me down.  Thru rough waters this cup was still standing...  Its not a yeti mug by no standards but it will get the job done and not fall over..  This is my current day to day cup.  Only reason I give it 4 stars is due to the suction cup bottom getting dirty it is more prone to tipping over.  So kinda got to be mindful where your setting it and how dirty the surface is.
