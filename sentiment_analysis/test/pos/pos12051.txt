After breaking far too many plastic "Light My Fire" brand sporks over the years, I got one of the titanium versions and really liked it. I was looking to purchase a second titanium spork when I chanced upon the humangear Gobites series of utensils and decided to give them a try. I have small hands, so I decided that the 3-pack of mini UNO sporks would be the most value for my money.I really like these little utentils. They have a little more give and feel less brittle than the plastic Light My Fire sporks, which means they are less likely to snap in half in my hiking backpack or work bag. They are just about as light as the titanium spork and cost less. It took me a while to get used to having the spoon and fork on the same side (versus the Light My Fire sporks which face opposite sides) - I think I like the opposite orientation better, though it was not a huge thing. The edge of the fork is stiff and angled enough to cut soft foods, though I imagine that would be easier on the full-sized gobites UNO - the minis have a smaller edge so they don't cut quite as well. It's still much better than the serrated edge on the Light My Fire sporks, which are 90% useless on the plastic version and 100% useless on the titanium version. I do think that the texture on the plastic of the gobites make it slightly harder to clean than the plastic Light My Fire sporks, but about on par with the titanium versions.(photo shows a gobites mini UNO beside my titanium Light My Fire spork. I believe the full-sized gobites UNO would be about the same size as the titanium spork)
