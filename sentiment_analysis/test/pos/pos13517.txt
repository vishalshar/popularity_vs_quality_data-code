This is seriously great... Ive now had two metal ones that I bought at stores and they just get rusty and stuck closed and don't look very nice when they're like that (in my kitchen and bathroom) .... this one fits perfectly on the standard mason jar i bought and the white is a perfect addition to any color jar (mine's green) and it works flawlessly!
