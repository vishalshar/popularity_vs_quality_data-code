I'm in absolute awe of this laptop. Beyond the fact that it's pretty beautiful and feels sturdy upon handling, the internal specs and actual performance of the laptop is really great for the price. You probably won't be using this to play serious games like Witcher 3 or anything, but for easier games like Overwatch and League of Legends this handles them easily. Even played Skyrim Special Edition on Ultra Settings with a ton of graphic mods installed with high framerates. Doesn't come with bloatware, which I'm grateful for.Internals have an extra ram slot and SATA for additional SSD, so I installed a 500gb SSD and 8gb RAM to bring everything up to 16gb of memory and 1TB of storage. For the price can't be beat. No issues yet with any fan noise or anything.
