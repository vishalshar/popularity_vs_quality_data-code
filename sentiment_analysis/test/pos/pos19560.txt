The memory foam pillow is very soft, feels great on my head and shoulders, and feels just right in terms of my head feeling not too high or not too low from laying on it. Being that I did not really know what to expect from getting this pillow and only knowing that it will be a soft pillow, I say that this pillow has exceeded my expectations.
