I got this to walk our 3 year old American Bulldog who is 80 pounds and our 4 month old Pit Bull puppy who is currently 30 pounds together. It has held up surprisingly well so far. We'll see how it does as our puppy continues to grow however am very pleased so far. I didn't realize this is only the part that attaches the two dogs to your leash that you already have. I thought it came with a leash so had to run out and buy one that was black to match since the other one I had was a pink camo and didn't look good with the black coupler. So far it's held up to them both going in different directions, one stopping to pee while the other tried to keep walking, the smaller one pulling and the other one trying to investigate another dog under a fence, you name it.
