A fantastic "Cards Against Humanity" style party game. The rules take no time to learn, and it comes with a few good suggestions for alternate game styles or extra rules. My only complaints are that the "bonus rounds" give extra points a little arbitrarily, which is a bit unbalanced (if you care at all about who wins). Also, surprisingly, despite the large number of cards in the box, you'll have little trouble going through all or at least most of them in a single given game. I definitely hope for some expansions on down the road. Still, it's an extremely good time.
