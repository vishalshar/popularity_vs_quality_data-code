I used these for a 7 day trek on Mt. Kilimanjaro. They were excellent! We had no access to showers so this is all we had. I felt clean and refreshed after using them. The wipes are a good size and 1 wipe can get the job done. They are excellent for sensitive skin and are moisturizing as well. I highly recommend.
