I tend not to write reviews on things, but this one seems like it needed one.I want to start off saying I am no where a "big guy", I am a tad on the larger side. My go to condoms are Trojan Magnum large or Magnum Bareskin. The LELO fit snug on me over the whole shaft, but was nice around the base. Almost all condoms I have used have been super tight around the base and cause pain, so this was a nice change. I also liked that the condoms did not smell like rubber, they do not leave that nasty stink on your skin that takes you two washing to get clean. I love the package, it is easy to open up but you do have to give it more force to get them open.My partner did say she felt a difference, I am not sure if I have or not. I would say you do need to use lube on the male side as there is all but none in it. I do not think the tip has enough room for the sperm and it seems to get pushed back to the shaft and I had it ooze on to me (which can be really bad.)I will use the rest of the 12 I have, but I will have to consider using these again. The length was good for me, but for a longer gentleman they might have some issues. If LELO were to make a "Large" version of these they might be new condom to use.Overall they were nice to try out, one of the better ones I have used, but they aren't for me (yet I hope).These are more suited for the "average" man.
