Here is what I think about Go Cubes' Taste, Performance, Convenience and Price:Taste - Honestly, at first, they tasted as good as my first sip of black coffee, not good.  But I decided that just like coffee, I would give it a few more times until I gave it up.  A few times later, I found myself actually craving these chewy cubes just as much as coffee! So please know that just because the first cube or two will taste strange and different, they do end up becoming an acquired taste! =DPerformance and Potency - These cubes (50mg of caffeine per cube which is roughly a half a cup of black coffee) are consistently potent.  I have gone through a trial 5pk (20cubes) and found that these are my go to convenient picker-uppers.  It is great to know that they are consistent in the amount of caffeine and that usually 2 cubes gets me through 3-4hrs of activity very nicely.Convenience - I work in an Emergency Department in a hospital.  I'm not allowed to eat or drink in patient care areas per policy, which makes keeping my energy up very hard to do and my blood sugar level tanks before lunch and before end of shift.  These cubes have revolutionized my energy level during work because they are just as convenient as gum is. I simply pop one in and the 50mg of caffeine and 6g of sugar are just enough to carry me to lunch or my end of shift. Just ridiculously convenient for a guy in my situation.Price - I find myself consistently spending AT LEAST $2-$4 a day on coffee/caffeinated products.  Buying this 20pk for $60 computes to $3 a pack (4 cubes) which is fair to me because of its convenience and I have about 4 cubes in an 8hr span.  Very worth the investment.Overall, these Go Cubes are tasty (after a few tries lol), consistently potent, highly convenient and fairly priced.  I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for convenient caffeine for a busy lifestyle.  Hope you like them as much as I do!
