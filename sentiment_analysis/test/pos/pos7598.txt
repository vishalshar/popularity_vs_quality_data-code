I received my first set as a baby shower gift. I loved it so much I bought this pink one for myself. I wanted another set with a base so that I can rotate and wash it. These quick zip sheets make life so much easier. It is very easy to zip sheets on and off. No more lifting mattress out of the crib to change sheets. Especially helpful for the night time accidents. Very easy and quick to change out the sheets and put baby back to sleep. This is definitely a must have for new moms.
