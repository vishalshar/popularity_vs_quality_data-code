It took me a little while to get started, but I love my projector.  i right my lesson plans in PowerPoint and then project everything on the wall for my students.  I have a small class (11 3rd grade boys) in a small room.  With my projected lesson plans I can get them to focus, do choral readings, and follow the lesson.  I'm a "traveling" teacher, and my camera easily comes along with me.
