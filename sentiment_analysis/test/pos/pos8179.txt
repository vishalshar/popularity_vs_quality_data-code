Works as expected. I only needed it to check my bicycle tire pressure before I went on a ride. I shut down app after I check because I don't need to monitor pressure during ride and don't want to continue using Bluetooth and draining phone and sensor batteries. Setup was easy and simple. I do have rubber valve stems but don't think it will be much of a problem with a bicycle. I see where the problem is because even though the sensors don't weigh much they will cause stems to flex as you ride and hit bumps. I put a tie wrap around stems and nearby spoke and now there is no flexing. The only minor complaint I have is that the reported temperature of the sensors can be as much as 4 degrees different from each other. This feature is not really needed by me.
