I purchased two, one for myself and one for a friend. I was sceptical at first about this product but one I received it I was very happy wit the decision. As you can see by the images attached it is very well made and packaged well. Set up was easy on my Apple iPhone 6s Plus. I downloaded the app and followed the video instructions included in the app for setup. I then proceeded to take my temperature... and then compared it to the regular glass and our ear thermometer! Accurate. Again very easy to use and set up. The included bubble popping in teh app while taking your temperature is a fun distraction for kids but.. I will admit.. I liked it as well. It is worth the price and the second unit I purchased will go to a friend who just had a child! I did purchase probe covers as this would be a great recommendation so that no germs are spread to others.
