4.5 stars.  These taste great and I do notice a difference in my alertness overall.  I wish I didn't have to take 6 though, 3 or 4 would suit my taste better.  I bought the children's version and decided to get the adult version so I could test the effect and see if it was upsetting to the stomach.  So far, I have had no negative side effects and it is very easy on the stomach.  I think these are a great bang for buck vitamin and the company seems to really care about the quality of ingredients.  Just started a subscribe and save with these and the kids version.
