Used this replaced the salt top and mason open lid most see on pinterest.  This works way better but I do which it closed better.  I have to make sure I snap it down.  I guess because it's plastic it feels more difficult to close.  And that's the other thing...I didn't realize it was plastic when I ordered it, but it still looks great on my blue ball mason jar.
