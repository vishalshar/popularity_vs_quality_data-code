Our son in law loves this machine! He keeps his on the counter ready to use. It takes up about as much space as a regular sized coffee maker but is attractive enough to leave out in the open. He won't drink a beer without running it through his Fizzics. It is easy to operate and consistently the beer is smooth and creamy, even the low calorie beer tastes better. For all the beer lovers out there, who doesn't want each glass to taste awesome? Better get out there and snag one, you won't regret it.
