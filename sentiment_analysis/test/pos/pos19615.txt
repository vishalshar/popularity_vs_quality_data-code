I would give this product and the exceptional customer service from Alex ten stars if that was an option!I had some very strange and long winded problems trying to get the feeder and my router to marry up and Alex was so very helpful and patient and we eventually got it sorted out, he really went out of his way to get to the bottom of the issues and it was very much appreciated.The best customer service I have ever experienced!The feeder has been fabulous so far, a great and much needed invention!
