Beautiful! Some of the most attractive headsets available! Excellent quality! I am a bit disheartened that the stereo adapter for the Xbox one controller substitutes for the headphones game and chat volume dials, but otherwise they're awesome! Super comfy too, no discomfort here. Hefty metal frame, durable and long lasting.
