I love this bulb and anyone I've shown it to has thought it was the best thing ever. On the new updates, there are no bugs. So worth it. The colors are vivid and there are different modes, like it can respond to music you play, and you can sync it with the app "IFF" and set up this like a wake up alarm, or the colors to flash a certain color if you get a facebook message. Very cool. Would buy more!
