I got it to work with hot air solar collectors, thought I could see the temperature of the absorber plate on the other side of the glass. On the product's web site, there was a video implying you could see problems behind a ceiling. Not true, only sees surface temperature. It does focus well, and found it could see foot print on a cement floor, where I had been standing base foot for a while. An unexpected find was that one of the GFI outlets in my kitchen was warm. It does use about 20% of my iPhone battery, in 10-15 minutes of use. I still like it, and found other ways of using it.
