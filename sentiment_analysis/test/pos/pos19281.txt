I love this fertility drink additive!!  I add it to my water and I can't tell that it's in there.  I have PCOS so my cycles are very irregular.  I've been using it for about 2 months and I got my first period since February this month!  We're taking a break from TTC and will start back up in the fall, I'm excited to see how this helps my body get ready for pregnancy!
