A very well made "Action Camera Mount"  I use the Yi 4K with the waterproof case and it fits with no issues.* Great versatility of the angle that the camera can be in* The mount takes all kind of action camera accessories* Back plate of the mount has loop holes for straps to be fed through for mounting* Release mechanism works well and I didn't have any issues with taking off the camera for quick shots and then replacing it on the mount** This mount will work for most backpacks out there but not for all.  I have a GORUCK and the straps have extra padding and this mount would not clamp on in the conventional way. I had to feed a strap though the loop holes and then feed that through the webbing on my pack. Just be careful and add yourself a tether cable for added security.
