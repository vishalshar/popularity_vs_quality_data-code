My dog LOVES this! Only complaint/suggestion I would have for iFetch would be to find another distributor for the iFetch balls. These fell apart after the first 2 uses with the machine. I can see this being a safety/choking hazard for small dogs.If it weren't for the poor/unsafe quality of the balls, I would give this product 5 stars
