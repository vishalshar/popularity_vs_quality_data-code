Does it work? YES.I used this with some very thick New York strip steak about 1.5 inches.Normally I use a timer based on thickness with variable results but I tried the SteakChamp and was very impressed.It's got an internal battery that is supposed to last 20 years (over 1000 steaks) although this would be hard to verify.You insert it into the middle of the steak and it flashes green for Medium Rare, yellow for Medium, and Red for Medium Well.So I put the steaks on the grill and ignored the time and waited for the yellow light. It does not tell you when to flip the steak so you have to do that on your own.The steaks came out perfect with a nice brown outside and juicy pink inside. My wife and sons were so impressed with the steaks and I have to agree. It takes all the guesswork out of cooking steak on the grill.You can even use this at night because the lights are very easy to see at night when it is dark.The thermometer has NO wires which I love and you can close the grill cover or use this in an oven in your house without messy wires.The thermometer is really geared to steak but I think you could use it for other meats like Lamb but I wouldn't.The only negative is the instructions are not the best. You must keep the plastic holder because that is what you use to store the thermometer and turn it on and you can use the end to pull the thermometer out of the steak.Make sure that you hand wash the thermometer and never put it in the dishwasher.Keep magnets away from the thermometer because that will make the battery drain faster. It will turn off by itself after around 30 minutes.Overall, fantastic product that really works even on challenging thick steaks. I wholly recommend this.
