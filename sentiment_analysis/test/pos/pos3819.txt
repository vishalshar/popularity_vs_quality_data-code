I love this little alarm.  It's really cute and works well.  It's loud enough to scare someone away but not loud enough to be obnoxious.  Since batteries can't be replaced, it has to be replaced every year, however, the device is cheap enough, that's not a big issue.  I saw it advertised as one that would be appropriate for a school child and I would agree due to it's small size.
