I have chronic uveitis and it has prevented me from wearing mascara for more than two years. Another patient in the waiting room at my doctors office recommended I try a lash tint. So I found this on a Google search and gave it a shot. I love it! Darkens my lashes yet it's lightweight and flexible and does not irritate my eyes whatsoever. 10 stars!
