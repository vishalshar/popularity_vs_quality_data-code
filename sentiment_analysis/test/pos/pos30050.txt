So it only took like 2 days to get here which I love, let's start with the protection of the case. I put the case on and I wish the boarder of the case was a little thicker but to my shock it work pretty well so the first thing I try to stick the case to was a wallpaper wall ( I was so excited I really wasn't thinking ) so it sticks for a good minute falls flat on the face not a scratch. Honestly this product is great after my phone failing a handful of times it proved its tough and the sticky back is perfect when I'm in the shower and to lazy to hold my phone lol. Now holding the phone really doesn't feel sticky more like those nail buffer kits it feels like the nail smoothing side.  Over I love the product I might even give out as gifts. Keep up the good work
