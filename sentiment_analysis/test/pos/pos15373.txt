I love these bars!  My husband travels a lot for business and has started packing Anchor Bars as a convenient and healthy alternative to airport food.  They are a great snack for trains, planes or long car trips -- nutritious and help avoid dreaded motion sickness and general travel queasiness.  I've also found that they make a nice breakfast when I wake up feeling a bit off (from a hangover or a big dinner or whatever).  The bars definitely help settle my stomach.I like the taste.  It is mild enough to be palatable when not feeling well, but tasty enough to enjoy as a snack.  It definitely isn't like eating a candy bar, but my preschooler and toddler both gobbled it down and asked for more.  My kids don't get carsick, but I would definitely give them Anchor Bars if they did.  I wish they had been around to help my morning sickness when I was pregnant!
