The Canary Flex is exactly what I need for my outdoor patio. Have the original Canary inside my house and was looking for a solution for the outside. The Canary Flex was a breeze to setup pairing seamlessly with my phone. The hardware is sleek and sturdy. The magnetic base is solid and secures the canary flex well. I ordered a secure mount as well since my canary flex is outside. I was really impressed with the video quality of the original Canary especially at night, and the canary flex does not disappoint! You do have to charge it for a few hours initially, but it can be used while it is charging. The power cable is conveniently long and the flex has easy access for the power connection. The packaging does do justice to the product. The versatility of the Canary flex with a small form factor and no wires really lets you place the flex anywhere inside or outside your house.
