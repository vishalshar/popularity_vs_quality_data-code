Sometimes I think my dogs like this and sometimes they seem a little iffy about it. But dogs need variety . I alternate this with nutri pro. My dogs pretty much dislike anything. I resorted to mixing a few teaspoons of dextrose in. Can't blame my dogs for liking things a little sweeter. That's how I like things. Like that one song "Put a little sugar in my bowl". That's the only sugar they get though.
