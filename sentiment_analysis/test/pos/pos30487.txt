If you're an obsessed iced coffee drinker - this stuff is perfect for you! I personally just mix with ice/water or take a quick shot for a pick me up at work or a pre-workout. It tastes smooth but has a serious caffeine kick! I've been trying to spend less on Starbucks and make coffee at home, but hot coffee just doesn't do it for me. And great packaging is always a plus for me.
