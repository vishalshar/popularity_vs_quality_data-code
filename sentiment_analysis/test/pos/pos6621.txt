My 11 year old son bought this with his own lawn mowing money from the summer.  He pumps it to make it go.  He had a motorized scooter last year -- the battery died, so he thought he'd get this instead of buying new batteries all the time.  Smart boy!  It looks cool enough where the neighbor kids want to try it.  It's a little tall looking, but, he has no issue with it.  It has a kick stand, and he has no balance issues with it.  Very happy.
