I can see: Finally a bright enough light. I've tried a few other brands and LifX nailed it. I had 6 Hue lights on and could barely see in the main room. Just 3 of these in the ceiling fan did the trick. That alone sold me.Colors: Previous lights just were NOT color correct. Blues & greens sucked. Apparenlty due to how the diods throw color. Cyan is near perfect. Blues are bright & deep. Greens are green. Purples are vivid. Also the 9000k Blue White is perfect for shooting video with.Price: A bit expensive if you look at it shortsighted but long term worth it.Updating: One major pain in the neck is updates, 9 out 10 times the lights won't respond post update and require a hard reset.Wifi Traffic: Seems to cause issues with wifi speeds while streaming/PS4. It's consistent enough that it's noticeable. If lots of our devices are on the wifi, using an app to see what's connected, it shows each light as a different device, so you easily end up maxed. The 3 lights I have plus my Hue lights take up 4 spots so other devices won't connect. In a house with PS4, apple tvs, smart tvs, laptops, ipads & iphones you need every available spot on your router. 1st world problems, I know, it's definitely not a terrible issue as it really has made quite a positive impact on the house =)All things aside, I can't recommend these enough. I do hope for other models as I have enclosed lights that I have HUE lights in since LifX says that is a big "no no." Hue is great but they are truly weak in the brightness department, even after the slight bump in the latest model.
