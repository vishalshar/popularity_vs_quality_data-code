My 10 year old loves this case, mostly because it is easy to tote around.  However, I like it because of the protection it provides the ipad :0)  The color pictured is completely accurate, so there were no surprises when the case arrived, and it slipped right on her ipad mini, yet feels very secure.  After several weeks of use, it is holding up well, though the pink is becoming a little dirty, which is completely understandable.  Overall, a great purchase!
