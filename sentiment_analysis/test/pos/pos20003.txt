This was just stupid easy to install, though I had a frustrating bluetooth problem.  I have replaced just about all the door knobs and locks in our home from remodeling, so obviously a bit easier for me, but it is very simple.  The only issue was the lack of detailed instructions in the box or online regarding the positioning of this little device that has to go on the existing lock hardware then fit into the August lock.  I kept winding up with the August lock in the wrong position until I realized that until you get everything on, the August lock rotates all around freely so I got that in position first.Once that was on, it would NOT connected to my iPhone 7, not at all.  I thought the batteries in the lock were dead so I changed those out a few times.  I finally called August about almost 7pm, pst, and the guy on the other line was happy to help.  For whatever reason, my iPhone 7 was not liking the bluetooth connection request of the August lock.  He had me simply turn off the bluetooth on my phone, restart my phone, then turn bluetooth back on.  For whatever reason, my phone and the August lock were now best friends, no issues at all.  I did get the home kit one and was hoping for control with home kit, but apparently there is a firmware update that is required and August's website says that is coming soon, or something like that.  But regardless, the lock performs as it should and I have the doorbell so I don't need the August Connect device to control the door, I can connect though the wifi doorbell.
