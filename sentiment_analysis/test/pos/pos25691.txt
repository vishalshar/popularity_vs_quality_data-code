I have been pleased with this tracker so far. You receive a alert about 5 to 10 minutes after you let has let the area. I have tested this many times so far. It is pretty accurate also. I figure if my dog gets out it will point me in the right direction to find him. It has a few other cool features also like tracking your dogs activities. The battery lasts for weeks also. I only charge mine about once a month. It's fits very well on my dogs collar also
