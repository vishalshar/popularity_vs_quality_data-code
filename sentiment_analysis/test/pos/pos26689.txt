Cute game.  I bought this to use in my classroom during work stations.  I haven't tried it with my students yet, but I played it with my kids and husband last night.  It's similar to scrabble but simpler in some ways because you are not building crosswords, just horizontal words where you only use the letters once.  The directions are pretty wordy, but the creators definitely have a sense of humor.  I found myself giggling while reading them.  At the end of the directions it has a bandit holding up his hands in exasperation with the quote, "Wow, that's a lot of information!" and then gives a link to watch a video to explain the game.  We really enjoyed the game.  I am a little worried it will be too difficult for early 3rd graders.  I will have to play it with them at my small group table a few times before I let them play on their own.  I also may simplify it in the beginning until they get the hang of it by eliminating the sneaky bandit tiles (devious plays you can make where you can do things like steal tiles from another players built words).  My youngest is 10 years and she had no problem playing the game.  Another thing to note is that it's made from very heavy cardboard.  I think the tiles will survive the classroom but I'll a little worried I've eventually have to tape the masks back together, but that won't be a big deal.
