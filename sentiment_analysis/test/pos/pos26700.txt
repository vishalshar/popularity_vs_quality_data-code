Stop looking elsewhere. Perfect size to not show. They are slightly thicker than a dress sock but just barely, so help with sweaty feet without making you worry if they will fit comfortably with your existing dress shoes. Also, the rubber grip on the back heal is far better than other socks I have used trying to do the same thing. It is a larger silicon patch than others, allowing it to have and keep a better grip.
