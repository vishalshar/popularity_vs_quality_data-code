The first one I ordered wouldn't work.  I called the company, while they were nice, it took 2 weeks to trouble shoot and they had me send pictures and documentation of the problems.  They needed me on the phone by the device while we spoke, even though their hours are inconvenient, never mind there are only two buttons on the thing so there isn't a lot to do.  You can press one or the other, you hold one or the other, or you can press or hold both.  That's all the options.Anyway, I returned it to amazon after the company took too long to resolve the issue.  Amazon shipped one the same day before returning the faulty one.  The new one arrived and worked right away.  I have since used it every day on my yellow lab.  We live on a lake, he swims in it, it runs through the woods with it, and it has held up fine.  Going on 1 week, so time will tell if it holds up long term.  He gets bored and goes to visit other people, and we live out of town so he can cover several miles.  Twice this week the device has notified me when he left the zone I set up, and I was able to get an accurate location on him.  It works well for what I want it for, which is the reason for 4 stars even with the wasted 2 weeks trying to get the first device to work.  I doesn't have a constant feed on his location, there is a 2-3 minute delay between updates which I understand is to conserve battery power.  You are able to force a more frequent update via the app, so the trade off is worth it to me to have the extra battery life.  So far I would buy it again, I'll update this if that changes.
