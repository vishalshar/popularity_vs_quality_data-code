I have had my Click & Grow Smart Herb Garden for a few months now. I have used it with their basil, busy lizzie, soon - their wild strawberries. I have in general had everything start sprouting within 5-6 days, with rapid growth. You can also use this to start seeds of your own, then transplant them into pots or into your own outdoor garden. You fill up the water opening, filling until the level is even with the lid, and that normally lasted me about two weeks. There is no need for constant attention because it does it all itself, with the owners occasional help with watering. My light bill hasn't went up at all. I cut down on use, and even with constantly having the Click & Grow on, the bill went down a good $50, so it doesn't effect it enough to really even notice it. This is the perfect way to involve the children and get them interested in learning where their food is grown, because unless you grow it yourself, you don't know whats on it, or where it came from.
