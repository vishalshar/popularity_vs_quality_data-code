10 yr. old boy's Christmas gift. This is our youngest of 5 children, so he's seen lots of toys and been exposed to all kinds of wonderful toys and games with the older kids. He loves this and continues to play with it constantly. The reviews of this, and other robots was extremely helpful in making a good buy. Amazon had the cheapest price around. Compared against Best Buy, Walmart, Toys R Us, etc.
