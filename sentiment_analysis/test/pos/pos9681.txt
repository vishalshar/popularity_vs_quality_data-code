If your looking for a real review, here ya go. I too have ordered other "solar" chargers and they were crap for quality. This is the real deal. High quality, well put together and packs nicely in my back pack. It's about the size of an iPad Air. Super happy with my purchase. 9to5 Mac also reviewed the Solartab on their site and praised the product, that was my motivation to purchase. Bonus was a discount code from 9to5 you type in at checkout with Amazon.
