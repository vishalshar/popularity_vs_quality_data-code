I LOVE these!!! I traveled through Eastern Europe and Russia for one month with these on my tennis shoes!! They are a MUST-HAVE! They allow give for your feet to swell yet you will still be able to kick off your shoes at the end of the day! Everyone in Russia kept asking me what they were and how to get them that I bought this second set for my dear friend.
