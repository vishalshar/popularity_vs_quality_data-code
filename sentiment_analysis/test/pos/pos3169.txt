A great learning tool for my eight-year-old son.  He loves learning how to code Pong, Snake, Minecraft and much more.  The more lines of code he does the more experience points he gets which really motivates him.  Unboxing it was very cool! Certainly a lot of thought was put into the packaging and Apple would be proud.  Putting it together is very easy. And a great learning tool for the kids as well.  The computer itself may seem a bit slow at times. But we are all used to fast iPads and iPhones and this is certainly slower, but is still a great product for the money spent.  I highly recommend the Kano Computer Kit!
