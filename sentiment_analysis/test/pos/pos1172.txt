This is the ONLY sippy cup I have found so far that does not have any plastic on it.  The spout works great, my one year old can drink from it easily, but it does not leak.  The sleeve is nicely grippable and protective.  It would be a bonus if the lid worked on other cups as well (it doesn't) and would love to see it in some cuter colors.
