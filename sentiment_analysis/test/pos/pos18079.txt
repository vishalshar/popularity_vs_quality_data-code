I bought this to act as a persistant boot disk for Linux distros and lots of small source code files. So the 4K transfer speeds for this were the most important thing for me. After running CrystalDiskMark, I found that while the sequential speeds for uncompressed files(worst case scenario) top out at 292.MB/s Read & 145MB/s Write, 4K goes to 23MB/s Read & 45MB/s Write. So while the large file size transfers were slower for the 64GB than the 256GB model, small files should read and write at a more brisk pace. I'm happy with the price and the capacity is enough for its intended purpose here.Edit: I can't get the computer to use this drive as a bootdisk. I have an ASUS X79-DELUXE motherboard. Fairly high-end with lots of options. I've tried different ports and disk formatting options to no avail. It's a great drive otherwise although I'll have to drop it a star as I was really looking forward to booting Linux distros off it.
