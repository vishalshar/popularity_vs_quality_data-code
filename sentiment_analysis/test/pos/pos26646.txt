We got a knock at our door today and it was a Switch Witch! My five year old absolutely loves her and can't wait to swap her Halloween candy for the witches gift. Woo Hoo! I can't wait to eat all her candy, guilt free, in exchange for a gift! I also love that the switch witch can "possibly" move unlike the Elf on the Shelf.One missed night of an unmoved Elf equals years of therapy whereas she'll be lucky if the Switch Witch moves. Awesome!
