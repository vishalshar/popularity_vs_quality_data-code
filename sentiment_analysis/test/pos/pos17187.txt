I recently tried MetaDerm Eczema cream and I am hooked.  Not only does it clear up my eczema but it moisturizes my skin and doesn't leave any residue.  It has no scent, so you can't tell that you have any "medicated lotion" on, and I actually use it even AFTER my eczema is gone.  The moisturizing portion of this cream is so luxurious that I use it after showers and it keeps my skin soft all day.  I highly recommend this.  It is also very affordable, which is rare for eczema creams.  I love MetaDerm!
