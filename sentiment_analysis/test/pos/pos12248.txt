Absolutely love this and so does my dog. The only thing keeping me from giving a five star rating is the balls. They are kind of cheap and don't last long. My dog is only 4 pounds and he kills the balls in less than a week. The replacement balls are very expensive 5 for $25. I did find that the Kong 1.5 inch squeaker balls work great and are WAY less expensive. All and all I highly recommend!!
