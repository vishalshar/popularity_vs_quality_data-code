This oatmeal squeeze is so good!  It is the marriage of cold oats and a fruit smoothie - and the ease and convenience of this product is fantastic!  But the taste is great - I love all three, with the raspberry/coconut as my favorite.  I would love to see other flavors, like peach-ginger or brown sugar vanilla!
