This Auto escape tool is very compact (quite a bit smaller than I expected), appears very sturdy, and has a good heft.  Fortunately, it has never actually been tested by me so I can not attest to its effectiveness. The tool is exactly as described, and is easy to store (in the included sturdy holster) on the sun visor.  I have had other auto escape tools with no cover.  Because of the sharp point (glass breaker) and the razor-type blade, these need to be kept in the glove compartment, which might jam in an accident, or be beyond your arm's reach.  Another brand has been velcroed to the firewall near my legs (which might injure my leg if I ram it.  It could also be jolted loose in a violent crash).  The ability of the sun visor to swing towards you may make the SuperVizor easier to reach if you end up in an awkward position after an accident. The sun visor storage seems to be the most convenient solution that I have come across.  I am pleased with the SuperVizor XT Auto Escape Tool.
