Got this to replace my old 2G flip phone which will stop working when 2G is phased out where I am soon. Did not need or want to carry around what's basically a $300 computer with a 5 inch screen. Nor do I want to pay for a data plan. This is WiFi enabled so I can still get online if my tablet isn't handy.Had to download a T9 keyboard. I was used to that format and the screen is too small to use the qwerty without a stylus. Texting at the same speed as my old flip.Others have noted that it needs an extended (8mm) tip micro usb cable.The sim size is MICRO. That's the middle size between nano and mini that are used in cell phones. I had to order an adapter. Seems crazy that the Poshmobile.com site lists the sim card size as "regular". Rather subjective....Not for surfing or gaming, but if you just want a PHONE that won't sag your pants or require a purse, this is it.
