As the others have said on this site, a little bit does go a long way. Took this stuff to practice and everyone used a bit on their gloves. They all noticed an immediate difference, their gloves were back to as close as they could get with the original tack. Good purchase, again use in small doses, you can always apply a few drops at a time to even it all out on your gloves.
