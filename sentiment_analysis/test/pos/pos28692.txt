great product. i am not a data head (yet) so i cannot say if all the data is useful, but some of it definitely is.  i have friends who have five of these attached to different shoes.  learning how to use it was not hard, main thing to remember is that the unit separates by rotation (like unscrewing a jar lid) and that the information is not real time - you upload the info after the run. you will not get a heart rate from the milestone.  to get a heart rate and real time info i  use my garmin 305 at the same time.
