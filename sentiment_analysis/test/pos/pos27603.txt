This laptop is great! I wanted to update my 4-year old 13-inch Macbook pro, and this looked promising. This thing is extremely lightweight for its size; it's just a touch lighter than ye ole Macbook. This was intended for both school and entertainment use and it does both well. The battery life is excellent; I can stream videos for around 8 hours. The SSD makes startup instantaneous. I can play some games I hadn't been able to before, and they look beautiful with these hardware specs. The laptop never gets uncomfortably hot on my lap, and the fan isn't intrusively loud either.My only complaints are with the trackpad and the screen. The trackpad feels a bit loose near the left- and right-click button sections. The colors on the screen lack brilliance and the viewing angles are poor--great for dissuading people from peeking over my shoulder at my screen, bad for when I'm watching a dimly-lit scene so must turn up the brightness way up.
