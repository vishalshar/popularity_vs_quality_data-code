I purchased this about a week ago, and so far it's been fantastic for my kids (6 and 9) and me.  My 9 year old especially likes the leaderboard in the app for the current 3000 shot challenge, he shot 1300 shots the first day just to up his ranking.  Previous to that, I don't think he'd taken 1300 shots in the previous 6 months, so you can see what kind of difference it makes when you have a goal to work towards.The app is great, it keeps track of stats, what your friends are doing, and has all kind of training drills for you to use.  It's a very polished product all around.  I'm using it on an iphone 5 and both the net sensor and wrist sensor hook right up without issue every time.  Charge on both sensors lasts a long time too, it's not something you'll have to charge for every use...the net sensor I have is still at 100% after a week, and the wrist sensor is still above 50%.At the current price it's a steal for all that it does.  Any kid whose going into basketball season will love it, it will totally change their motivation into trying to be the best online.  First thing I get asked when I get home is "What's my rank today Dad?" and then he goes out and shoots some more to get back up the leaderboard.
