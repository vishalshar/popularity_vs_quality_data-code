Very good for up close heat imaging.  Was able to find leaks around windows that we did not know was there. Someone had to explain to me that the readings of the windows themselves are misleading because of reflections. Helpful to tell if HVAC vents up high were blowing hot or cold air to prove suspicions of a broken heating system. Love that it has a solid case that protects it and allows me to carry it around in my purse for spur of the moment use.
