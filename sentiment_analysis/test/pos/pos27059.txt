I ordered two of these.  For the record, it doesn't appear that WIFI is public as is posted by some.  I have to supply a password.  Also from their web site:Do I have to share my wifi?Not at all! Gramofons no longer have Fon Service (broadcasting of public signal "Fon WiFi"). However, if you received your device as a pledge reward for being Kickstarter backer, or you purchased the device as a preorder, your Gramofon may still have Fon Service enabled and be sharing.OK, nuff of that.I bought two.  Setting them up took much longer than I thought it would, and I did have to google how to reset to factory default, and even doing that took a couple tries to get it right.  During setup, you will be on your WIFI, and then when you try to finish, you will end up on its WIFI.  Sometimes it fails to find the device, and fails to finish, so it's hard to know whether it worked.I prefer hard wire.OK, once it was setup, I have to say I am pleased with the extra convenience offered trying to listen to spotify.  We have a few peeps in my household, and it is really nice not having to log into a PC/MAC, start spotify, and have it connected to a home audio system--serious pain!  Plus, if another peep wants to play their playlist, they'd have to log into their own account.These always on, low powered devices, are incredibly convenience with Spotify Connect. Anyone connected to the interal WIFI network, vie phone tablet, whatever can switch to one of the Gramofons and immediately start playing music.  I've also been able to switch from one Gramofon to the other while playing a song on my device, and it's creepy hearing no skip in beat when the music plays from another location in our home.The only thing that would make the experience better is if Spotify offered the ability to stream local media to the connected device (Gramofon) for cases where a friend comes over and wants to play local songs they have on their phone--not within scope of a Gramofon, however.$50 is recommended!
