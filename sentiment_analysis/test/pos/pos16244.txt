Anyone who reads this should know I have replaced 4 iPhone 6 screens each bought from different sellers, and none of the previous screen replacements are this good.I can tell iCracked cares about the presentation and quality of their product. I ordered two replacement screens which came in very quality packaging, also they come with extras you might need like double stick 3M tape to hold floppy ribbons in their place...First of all the tools you get are magnetic, which are a must have. Also, the screen comes with protection and fits like new. I just returned a screen from another seller that separated from the phone on the 2nd day (don't be that person to save 5 or 10 bucks). I can't say enough to promote the quality and craftsmanship iCracked deserves. Thanks iCracked for your great product!
