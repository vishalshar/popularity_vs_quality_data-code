This is a very fun game, I'm really happy that I've heard about it. The game is easy to learn and the rules are not complicated. As a game the mechanics seen to work better with 3 or 4 players, with the wider variety of cards and more players for the interplay between the players. That said 2 players is still super fun and I'd recommend it for 2 anyways.
