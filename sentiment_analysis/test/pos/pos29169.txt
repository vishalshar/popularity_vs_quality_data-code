I carried one of these on a weekend backpacking trip through the Smokies to freshen up on Saturday night, but wound up saving it until we got back to the car as at some point we decided a stop Asheville for some refreshing beverages was going to be required.  Ideally, I should have packed one for the trail and left one in the car, lesson learned.After 17 miles of sweating, stench-inducing hiking, I opened this body wipe and admired the unisex fresh scent that greeted me.  I knew that the anti-bacterial agents would be welcome at this point.  Larger and somewhat thicker than a regular babywipe, I was able to wipe down my entire body from top to bottom (in that order) with just one wipe, occasionally folding it to get a clean patch.  After putting on a little deodorant and clean clothes that I had left in the car, I was really amazed at how good I smelled.  Probably better than many people in Asheville.When I got home, I could see my wife instinctively hold her nose as she is wont to do when I return from these jaunts, but I eventually convinced her to sniff me and she was amazed that I had not showered somewhere on the way home.  That little wipe really made me a believer.  I'll definitely take some next time I go car camping with my family so that I can wipe down my children in the tent.
