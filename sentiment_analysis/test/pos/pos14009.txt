Incredible!! This is one AMAZING toy!! We purchased it for our 7 year old son for Christmas and my husband and I had just as much fun as he did with it! I LOVE the sounds MIP makes, its as tho there is a real little robot running around our living room! Excellent when used with the APP, my son had a little trouble using the hand-motions to get MIP to move, but using the MIP app on his ipad made it much easier! Definitely recommend downloading the MIP app!! The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because MIP eats batteries!!! We went thru 2 sets of AAA just the first night of using him! We recommend HIGHLY that you invest in a set of 4 rechargeable AAA batteries to save money in the long run! We were very very disappointed that MIP did not come with a built in rechargeable battery with a USB port to charge on a computer etc...opening the back 3 screws proved very difficult as the screws were factory installed terribly tight so when we unscrewed them they almost stripped out...once open we always remembered to very gently tighten the screws back so they wouldnt completely strip out...this is the ONE huge complaint we had was battery life and a bad battery pack design!!!!! Otherwise, tho MIP is pricey $, we were VERY happy with it!!!
