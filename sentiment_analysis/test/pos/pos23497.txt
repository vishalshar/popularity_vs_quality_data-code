My experience with this item:I got this as a replacement for my SanDisk Extreme 32 GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive SDCZ80-032G-X46. I chose this instead of another SanDisk [128 GB] of the same price. I am very satisfied and found this item to be what was advertised and even more. My primary motivation for buying this was the SPEED of it because I run applications from it.I use this for many purposes. It is basically a reference library on the go. I have thousands of pdf books there for quick reference, store work file for working at home, a lot of mp3 and video files. I have installed and run different applications, like C compilers etc. I have a lot of instructional videos that I run from it and it is as if running from hard drive.As an engineer who needs to consult a lot of books for reference, this device is incredibly useful. It is incredibly fast, just like hard drive on my pc. To summarize, it has large capacity, is very portable, and very fast. I would highly recommend it. Even if it fails today, I will buy it again
