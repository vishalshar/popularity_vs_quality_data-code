Purchased:  Queen sized GhostBed. I ordered this Saturday night, it arrived by 11am on Wednesday - NICE!!  Even though it was listed as about 80 lbs, I was totally able to get it out of the box, drag it up my stairs by the plastic & up onto my box spring, by myself.  It's vacuum packed so it was compacted in the plastic & was very easily dragged.  Once I cut off the plastic, it started springing to life.  I was able to use it immediately.  Since this is a HUGE life decision, this review may be the longest one I've done yet....I LOVE LOVE this bed.  I planned on giving it about a week prior to reviewing, but after 2 nights, I'm stoked!  I've battled severe insomnia since I was in high school, I'm 45 now.  I've slept on many o mattresses over the years (vacations, friends/family homes, etc). Most all were too hard, too soft, or just flat out uncomfortable - sometimes I'd end up on the couch.  I've slept on Tempurpedics a few times and I do NOT like them at all!  Not only did they hold body heat, they are too foamy like, too squishy, too soft, and takes too long to remold once you move positions... I have 3 beds in my house and 2 couches... Bouncing back & forth hoping for a good nights sleep that night.Now, this GhostBed.  The first night, my dogs slept so deeply that it was hard for me to get the full effect of the bed, they didn't move!  LOL  They LOVE it too!  So... last night.  I made the dogs wait until I got comfy before letting them up.  I slept from 2am to 8am!  I have not slept longer than 2 hours in years!  That's 6 hours!  I woke up and felt ready to conquer the world today!  OMG, I can't stress enough how important & awesome this was for me!  Although a similar design to Tempurpedics... the GhostBed is not as squishy or foamy-like, my body did NOT sink as much as I thought it would (I'm a plus sized gal).  I had read that the GB was great for side sleepers... I TOTALLY agree!  I didn't even need to put a pillow between my legs, which I've done for years!!  The body alignment was so perfect, I didn't need it!!  I even went from using 2-3 pillows to one!!  I don't know about the remolding when you reposition, because I barely moved!  And usually I thrash about constantly to find that comfy position!  A few reviews mentioned the cooling factor... it's weird.  When I got up, the GB was very warm to the touch, my blankets were warm as well, but I did NOT feel heated at all, I'll tell you what!!!!!!!!!!!!!  it was so strange!  It's like the GB absorbes the heat & just keeps it from effecting you!  I also like that the sheet tends to stay more in place than it does on a smoother surfaced mattress.Overall so far, I am EXTREMELY happy with this bed!  It'll be interesting to see how long it will last, hopefully for a long while... although it's cheaper than a store bought mattress (for the most part), it would be just as expensive, if not more, if it's having to be replaced 2-3 times to one store bought mattress...it replaced one I've had for 7 years. so we'll see.Now ya'all just need to design the perfect pillow!
