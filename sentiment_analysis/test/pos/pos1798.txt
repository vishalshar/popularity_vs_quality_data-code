Generally speaking, it is a very good-looking wood wifi speaker. I was first attracted by its wooden appearance. I have my house designed with full of wooden furniture so this tiny speaker fits perfectly into my interior design. The one and only knob on the speaker makes it simple but cool.The touch-control mode also attracts me by providing more chances to interact directly with the speaker without using my phone. A touch on the top gives a pause/start to the music, and tilting to the left/right changes the songs it plays. This is whole new experience to me. All of the speaker I used to own are Bluetooth speaker and this is the first wi-fi speaker I have. It takes a minute or two to set up and to adjust but overall its friendly to people who do not have experience using wi-fi speaker. Just have to download music to the speaker in case there is no wi-fi network.The Cube has several built-in music platforms, such as BBC and Pandora. And I am surprised to see that it changes to a new packing (which is also awesome as the speaker) and supports Spotify connect now since I have watched unbox videos on UTB beforehand. Airplay is the function that I use the most. It is also quite a useful function that allows me stream music from my iphone easily.A notice for all of you who are interested in buying one, Cube can be only charged by its original charger, a quick 2.0 charger. I tried charging it with my cable and charger but failed. But the original charger of the speaker can charge my phone or other devices faster.Downloading music from phones and PC/Mac is easy and fast. But one thing I think needs improvement is there is no playlist, no sortation or search function, making it frustrating sometimes. I hope this will be improved in future updates.I am generally satisfied with the sound it delivers as it is such a tiny piece that can be easily taken everywhere I want. Its a little expensive but a worthy speaker.
