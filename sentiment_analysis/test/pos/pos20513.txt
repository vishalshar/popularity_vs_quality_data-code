If pointed directly at the sun and set to your skin type this product is great. I live in Florida and used to get sunburned on occasion since the UV changes based on the atmosphere and cloud cover. Not great for walking around, but when sitting in a chair and with the sensor aimed correctly, it is highly accurate. The negative reviews are from people who expect a miracle device or just don't understand how to set it correctly. For example, the guy who says its crap because he put it inside his car on the dashboard and it didn't register. Did he ever consider that the windshield blocks most if not all of the UV?
