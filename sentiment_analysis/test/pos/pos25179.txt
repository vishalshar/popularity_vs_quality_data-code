The bottle is easy to clean.  You have to be sure to get the top and bottom back on really tight to prevent leaks.  Also if the bottle sweats, water collects between the clear bottle and the base...so you get drips when you take your next drink. I like the bottle but if you only drink water, not sure it is worth the extra price over a regular water bottle.
