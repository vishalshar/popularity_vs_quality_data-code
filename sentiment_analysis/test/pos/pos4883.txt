At first I was very skeptical but this product does EVERYTHING it promises. Our cat has been diagnosed with diabetes at 16 and does not do well at the vet. Using this has allowed us to monitor him at home. It resembles regular litter  so he's been fine with it. One two pound bag works in our litter box and we have a big one. I 'm able to use it for two tests then I throw it out. It's also terrific it comes with the collection tools. I can not give this product enough GREAT reviews.
