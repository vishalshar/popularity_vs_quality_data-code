The permanent tray paid for itself within a month. Also, having plastic instead of laminated cardboard is invaluable when the cats' fascination with the new fountain means they are drinking a lot, or when your water heater leaks and leaves the tray sitting in water (the reason I bought the plastic tray...never. again.). Only gripe is the small size of the collection area--it could be bigger.
