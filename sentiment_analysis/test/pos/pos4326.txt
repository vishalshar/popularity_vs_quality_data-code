This light will work wonders at getting you noticed by drivers at night. Unlike with my normal LED lights, I find more drives pulling over to the next lane, giving me space. (almost as if to avoid a UFO)As this model has the battery in the light ring there is nothing installed on the hub or any ugly wires to see when parked in the day time. There are 2 small magnets you have to install on the frame of your bike and that's the only pull ties the entire installation has to use.It comes with the micro USB charging cable but you have to use your own charging brick or a PC to charge. The batteries are very easy to remove and install to the light ring and they do not project from the ring so you don't notice them when they are installed and turned off. However, when the battery is "on" there is a blue light that shines on the left side of your wheels as it revolves (similar to the light you get from a valve cap LED) that I didn't see in any of the videos before if got this.I was concerned as to how it would fit my front wheel as i have a Trek 2.1 2011 model and when i did the revolights dollar bill test, it was just about touching the inside of the fork. I contacted Revolights and was extremely pleased with their response time, customer service is very important to this company.  I was told that this model is slimmer / thinner  than older models and that it would fit.  I'm happy to say they were correct. It did fit with visible tolerance and the inner dimension of my fork at the critical location is exactly 40mm.  Also, they paid attention and quickly corrected an error in the product description regarding the battery type that I queried.I took one star away because i find the term "legal headlights" to be misleading. These lights will get you seen from really far away but by no means can they be used as your only source of light for you to see potholes on a street with no street laps.If you are accustom to 500 lumens LEDs, this is no where as bright. You will only see a pothole just before you fall into it, if you are riding 25kph or above.
