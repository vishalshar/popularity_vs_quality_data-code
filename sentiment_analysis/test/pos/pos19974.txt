These BIXBI "treats " are AMAZING.  I have three little Yorkies who are prone to luxating patella (sp) where the hind leg or legs slip out of the Knee socket and is very, very painful.I have tried EVERYTHING and I mean everything out there for the pickiest of these three, who is also in need of this supplement the very most.He will eat them!  All my other dogs LOVE them, and Sharkie will eat them when he is especially hungry or if I wrap them up in a bit of Cheese.My  14 lb, 11 year old rescue Yorkie is now Jumping off the floor onto the sofa, as is my 10-11 pound adopted yourkie who is 9!!!  I have never seen anything like this and they LOVE these...thinking they are Treats when they are actually Joint and Hip Supplements.My little Argentinian Yorkie, who has he biggest issue is improving and while I am still picking him up to come up steps, he did climb one today (has been on them four days), and he is happily running around in the yard without issue.I am so Grateful for these "treats"  Finally !!!  Something my Picky Yorkies will eat that is made in the USA and that is tremendously helping their JOINTS.They are my MIRACLE go to for my Dogs.  Important not to overfeed....I have one that would eat them all day if I would allow , but I do cheat some days and give him a tad more.  He is my oldest, and broke his leg when he was a puppy.He is the one jumping from the floor to the sofa....when he could never do this before.  I have tried everything from The Mising Link-Vermont Pet Naturals and covering up these little supplements in cheese or chicken and still they turn up their nose most of the time.Not with BIXBI!!!Yay
