Really happy with this phone mount, holds my iPhone 7 plus without an issue. The phone stays on the mount when going over bumps etc.I used the smaller phone mount with IP7+Works as a vent mount or can be attached or removed to your dash via a small bracketA word on the packaging, you can tell the guys at pearl worked at apple, the best, but you wonder how much cost this added to the unit cost
