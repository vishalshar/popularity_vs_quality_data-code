My little dog snarfs these treats down and asks for more.  Looking at the ingredients and no added preservatives I decided to see why my dog loves them and try them for myself.  They didn't have much taste but I am confident if an apocalypse comes we will both have treats to snack on.Unfortunately, Amazon dropped the ball on this delivery and added so many air filled pockets to the box that all ten bags were smashed into a fine powder.  I will not be able to use these treats on our walks and instead mix them into her kibble.
