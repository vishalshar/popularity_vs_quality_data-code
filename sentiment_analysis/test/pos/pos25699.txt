Snooze berry is my new go to night time friend.  Although I was skeptical, I gave it a try. My only comment is make sure that you have your alarm set. For the first time in my life, I overslept after taking a snoozeberry.  Rushing around in order not to be late for work was so worth it.  I got the best sleep I have had in years. I just reordered them. I wish they came in bigger boxes.  The sleep packets are also great for travel.
