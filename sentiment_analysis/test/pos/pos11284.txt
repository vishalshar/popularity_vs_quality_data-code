I love this product. It is so useful and has come in handy many times both in "adventure settings" and out of them. My only complaint, which is not enough to lower this to four stars, is that the cover that keeps the cord slots protected can flip off a little sometimes. It is rubber so there is no real way for it to snap in to place. I think this product could improve from having a stronger material for that part.
