Its awesome. It works. And feels durable. But the price could be better. Because as it is right now its too expensive for my taste. Its like a normal cup except for the bottom part where it sticks to flat surfaces. Normal cups are about $10 and this $35 make the math... your paying 25 more for that little bottom part.??? too much $$ but if you have money to burn then go ahead.
