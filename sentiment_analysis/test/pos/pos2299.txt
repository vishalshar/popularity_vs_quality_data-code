I've had Dyshidrotic Eczema for as long as I can remember. Symptoms (without getting too gross) are small itchy blisters followed by peeling skin.  In my case it's triggered by heat, so every summer it acts up and I get blisters followed by peeling skin followed by blisters, etc., until the weather cools down. Nothing has helped with the blisters, including this cream. Nothing helped much with the peeling skin either *until* this cream. This MetaDerm stuff has worked wonders for making the eczema *seem* to go away. I'm no longer embarrassed to shake hands with people or use my hands near them. Although it hasn't reduced the blisters at all from what I can tell, it has done an unbelievable job of keeping the peeling to a minimum. I don't know how it works. I just know it works and there is no discomfort. It feels like regular lotion at first and has as slightly greasy feel for only a few minutes after first applying it. I usually put it on twice a day.
