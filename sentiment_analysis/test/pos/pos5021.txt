I bought this knowing what it was: a poor (wo)man's follow-focus and as that, it passes the test. Could you make this yourself? Sure, but the way it is manufactured makes it look a little more professional than the ordinary DIY job. Mine came with black plastic clips, not small binder clips, which is an improvement over the item in the product photo. I like the idea of a dry eraser marker, but it would have been nice to find one on a lanyard for run and gun operation. It fits over my Canon 70-200mm f/2.8 IS USM II, which is probably one of the main lenses I will use it on. i was using the jar opener but really needed something a little easier to work with something that helped me mark my spot. This does the trick. I can leave this on my lens and go from photo to video in an instant.The handle is nicely constructed, so, though it is  glorified rubber band solution, I think the solid handle helps you get more exact movement. I think a $35 price point would sell a lot more of these.
