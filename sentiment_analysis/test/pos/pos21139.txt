We have been using these bags for a few weeks and I can honestly say that I love them! I've done about everything you can do with these bags. Refrigerator, Freezer, Lunches.... they work great for everything. The seal is a little snug but I prefer the peace of mind that nothing is going to leak. I don't love hand washing but that's a personal preference. A little water > a lot of plastic, ya know!
