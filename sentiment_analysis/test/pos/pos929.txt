I drove over a hour to buy Edwin at my closet Apple Store & I am happy to confirm this lil duckie does not disappoint! I am 33 y/o & find Edwin hilarious, adorable, & irresistible! Alas he is not for me but my 2yo dtr. Edwin is a Very Smart Duck. He feels Well Constructed (he's not a light at duck) & I personally love the texture of his material. Probably the Least Known Feature of Edwin is that he doubles as a Thermometer - Yes he is a real thermometer. My hubby & I took turns taking each other's temperatures (& 'quacking' up lol during the whole process) via the forehead vs temporal methods. We are very happy to report he is accurate tho he's not the fastest temp taker (SuggEstion App developers could u add in Edwin's Wellness App a feature that tells u when Edwin has come to a conclusive temp as well as maybe a chart the temps could be placed into with typical date, time, etc?) The Edwin App is also great as it's Very Interactive & my dtr' fav song (ok I mean mine) is Edwin's Bath Time (Suggestion App Developers - MORE SONG PLZ!!! If possibly make Edwin a Bluetooth Speaker? so that if he's on his 'bed' he could play any tunes?!?!) My dtr enjoyed the books too n I enjoyed shaking, (wh)tapp(ck)ing, & turning Edwin during his adventures (Suggestion App Dev More Books Plz!!!). As far as the Edwin Night Light App - Edwin Rules the Roost! I love that he has a timer setting which allows for 15minutes (minimum) to unlimited (all nite) light. Edwin even has an Adjustable Briteness Setting (Hello Genius) to Very Brite to Very Muted!  The other Amazing Feature is that u can play soothing sounds with Vol Adjust & timing option just like the nite lite. If I could give this Duck 10 Stars I Would! The Actually Edwin Apps Just Need Some More Content & Options. Other than that Edwin is All he is 'Quacked' up to Be!
