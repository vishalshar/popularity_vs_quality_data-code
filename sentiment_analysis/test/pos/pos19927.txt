This camera is revolutionary. It can be used by a novice or an expert and it is very easy to use. You must have a computer to upload the pictures. The ability to focus the camera and tilt shift AFTER you take the pictures is awesome!The battery life is excellent. After 40 plus pictures the battery was still over 90% charged.My wife shoots with 35mm, DSLR, and now she uses the LYTRO as well. She loves it.
