OMG  Where do i begin,  About a  month ago I was on my way to lunch with a friend in downtown Pasadena. Just before arriving to the bar and Grill I noticed the URB-E Store next door to where we were going . I took two steps back and popped into the URB-E store and met Simon who was very informative on the electric scooter.  I had caught a glimpse of one shooting through downtown LA one day a few months prior.  By the time I asked Simon a few questions I had pretty much made up my mind to get one.  I told Simon I will be back after lunch for further detail.  I returned back a few hours later to make my purchase, I find the URB-E a perfect fit in the trunk of my car.  it's perfect for rideing into conjested areas like the beach or Third Street Promanade Santa Monica or Down towne Pasadena. LA has so much Coast where you can ride the Urbe it's an endless adventure.  I have customized my to enclude a bluetooth speaker, head light wheel covers and also basket and head light. After riding my URB-E for several day's I returned to have the Animal style upgrade done for the extra take off power.  Well worth it in my opinion.  The three main assories would be the wheel covers and the head light and some protective head gear. I love my URB-E
