As an early adopter of the Bluesmart crowdfunding campaign, I was extremely happy to receive my luggage. Not only is it a beautifully sleek and modern looking carry-on, but it has all of the functions one could want in a smart suitcase.There are tons of useful features that are linked to the mobile app such as remote lock, built in digital scale, proximity sensor, etc. However, my favorite feature was the charging battery.As an avid traveler, I found myself constantly searching for outlets at airports, and sitting on the floor next to my charging phone more than I would've liked.Thanks to the Bluesmart, my charging stress is gone. I can comfortably wait for my flight and ensure my phone and electronics are charged without an issue, being connected to the luggage.The bag itself is perfect for a weekend trip, and did a great job holiding all of my carryon necessities. The front slot is a quick and convenient place to store my computer when going through security.I highly recommend this bag for anyone interested in the intersection of tech and sleekly designed  luggage.Plus, it's a great conversation starter as well.
