I love the compact and tough design. The touch areas are really responsive. Sometimes they aren't as precise as you need when making quick changes (that requires toggling "fine" mode which adds another step to the flow)Windows drivers and editing software was added shortly after I purchased which is a huge bonus.There is a trade-off for the compactness and unique design when compared to standard mixers. It takes more than one hand to get to parts of many features since they require holding the shift button. This makes the workflow slower than most mixers.I haven't used the control modes much yet, but they look like they will come in handy. Currently, it's one midi channel per control page. I'm hoping they allow channel assignment per control to make the pages more usable across multiple instruments/effects.
