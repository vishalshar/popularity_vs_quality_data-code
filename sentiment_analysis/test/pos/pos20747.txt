I've had the Sense with Sleep Pill for 5 days. So far I really like it, but there are some flaws:Positives:- I love the alarm that wakes me up during my lightest moment of sleep around by chosen wake-up time- The sleep sounds are relaxing- I like that the Sense monitors humidity, air quality, temperature, noise, and light throughout the day and night- The time I go to bed and fall asleep seem to be accurate, and are already giving me an insight into my sleep patternsNegatives:- I had to replace the Pill battery after 1 night...not sure if they just ship the Pills with super lousy batteries on purpose, or if the Pill just drains quickly. Since replacing, the battery level has been "good" so hopefully it'll last a while longer- The time that I wake up and get out of bed have been super inaccurate every morning so far, but hopefully it's just a matter of calibration and will become more accurate over timeSo far I've learned that the sole disrupter during my sleep is noise. I wish the Sense would record the noise overnight, and keep the recordings during any noise disturbances. Since I'm unaware of what these noise is (it doesn't fully wake me up, just pulls me out of deep sleep to light sleep) I don't know whether I need to close my window due to street noise, yell at my roommates for being loud, etc. I might try recording a full night's sleep on my phone one night, but I just wish the Sense had this feature.
