This product is awesome.  It really helps my two dogs that both have skin issues.  They break out in itchy scabs that turn into sores when the scab is removed.  They are half sisters.  The vet said it is skin allergies.  It has really helped them.  Wish it wasn't so expensive, but I guess you pay for what you get!!
