Let me straighten out a few issues.  I own a Bose Soundlink III, a mini, an IK I-loud (which is  excellent), Creative SoundBlaster, and SoundBlaster  II-(which is also  excellent).  I've read the reviews pertaining to bass, mids & highs, and/or lack thereof.  The Turbo X outshines everything with overall sound quality.  There is no coloration in the Turbo X, unlike other systems.  If there is limited bass in the content,  you will only hear limited bass.  In content where there is true heavy bass, you will hear it on the Turbo X, understanding that it's not going to thump you like a 500 watt subwoofer,  but it's there and it's prominent.  Mids and Highs are also well balanced, creating an overall excellent sound experience.
