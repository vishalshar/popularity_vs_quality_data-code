Update 11/10/15I'm on my second jar and I still love this stuff. It works through humidity, heat, busy work day and I even got my husband it try it. He liked it on but couldn't get past using a "pot" of deodorant.This has changed my outlook on natural deodorants without anti-perspirant ! I have tried Tom's and this large crystal thing without any stink-free luck.  I've have been trying to get away from harmful deodorants for a few years. I work long hours around people and I do sweat so I have always felt like I need some kind of underarm products.My sister-in-law introduced me to this and she did get a small rash a few weeks after using it everyday. She switched to every other and has had no further issues. I have had no issues, which really surprised me because I have incredibly sensitive skin since becoming pregnant. In fact, the skin in my armpits has never been more soft and smooth.  I put this on after getting out of the shower / shaving,  and I've never had any burning like I did with my previous deodorant.Application: It is different to dip your finger in a little jar of coconut oil consistency paste and gently smear it in your armpit. Remember coconut oil is liquid when warm/hot. I am careful when traveling in the summer or leaving my beauty items in a hot car while traveling. My sister-in-law was so excited when she received her pit paste ( mid-June in Michigan) opened the jar and it had liquified during delivery.I just bought one for my mother (8year BC survivor ) and mother-in-law. They both really enjoy their pit paste too. The lavender was a little strong ( my S-I-L favorite) so I took a gamble on the lemon grass and thyme. I am very pleased it isn't too strong or feminine. I hate overly potent deodorant, think teen spirit or anything with fresh or powder in the name.For men: my husband forgot his "regular" deodorant on a recent trip and was surprised how much he liked my pit paste. He has typical male armpit hair. The pit paste lasted through a hot day at the beach and until the next day. I could faintly smell it the next morning ( maybe keen pregnancy nose but I think this stuff lasts).There is interesting research regarding aluminum and the increased exposure with cosmetics, cookware, etc. I'm expecting my first child and I have become more aware of what I put on my skin. I will certainly repurchase this.
