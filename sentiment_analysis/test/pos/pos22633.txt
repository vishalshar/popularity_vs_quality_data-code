I order these all the time in bulk on Amazon because it's cheaper than the grocery store! This is an awesome healthy snack, Whole30 approved, paleo = no sugar, no grains, just banana and coconut! And it's great because they are using bananas that would otherwise be thrown away because the bananas are over-ripe. The snack is healthy and delicious - little cubes that taste like banana bread. Banana+Coconut is the best flavor they offer, way better than Banana alone. Totally love this product, I've almost saved enough "proof of purchases" to get the surprise free gift - you need to collect 50 pcs I think. Enjoy!
