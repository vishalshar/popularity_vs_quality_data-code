I tried this out, because it's one of the more affordable drones around. Looks like you're supposed to use it to learn to code, so it comes with a remote that you have to assemble.  You gotta go online to watch a tutorial, where it walks you through how to build it.  I got it flying in about 20 minutes while taking my time.It's pretty well built, super light, and it's a lot smaller than I expected, actually.  I've crashed it a bunch of times and dropped it from the sky, and it's been totally fine.  The flight is really stable, too.  I'd also recommend keeping it indoors.  It's really light, so wind affects its flight pretty easily.  I wish I had one of these as a kid! I would've been able to learn programming without realizing it.  I think if your kid is really into RC cars or drones, it's a pretty good way to get your kids learning how to code while having fun.
