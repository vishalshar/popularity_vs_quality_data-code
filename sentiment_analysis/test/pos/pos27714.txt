This is the 2nd case from Rokform I have owned. First being for the S5 this S7 version is just as great and I am very happy with it. I have it mounted to my Harley with the Rokform mount. Holds the phone securely have never had a problem with the phone coming off the mount. This clear version of the S7 works and looks great. Would buy another one with no hesitation.
