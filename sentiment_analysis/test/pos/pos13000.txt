So far so good,  it needs more apps for the international app center. Other than that, the battery life lasts much longer than a typical android watch. The only big problem I see is the lack of communication from the company and direct support.. What I mean by that is, if you submit a ticket to them don't expect a speedy reply.  They perform software updates on there own time frame and don't really care what anyone outside of China thinks.
