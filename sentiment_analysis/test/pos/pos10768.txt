I used this when I was away for a week to monitor my pet. It was great, in that it sends notifications to your phone letting you know when it detected movement. Somewhere it needs improvement is in face detection, as it would regularly notify me of a face detected when there was no one there.It does great in low light, and the video feed is very clear. Overall I am very impressed, given the price of other cameras, like nest. I would recommend this product!
