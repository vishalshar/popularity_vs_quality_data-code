This little thing is awesome!  It really is tiny, but the sound it puts out is loud, and when used as a bluetooth speaker, quite clear and generally good quality.  Someone else complained about the battery.  We haven't run into that issue yet, but of course we haven't used it all night yet either.  We'll do that when our baby arrives!  For now we've mainly used it as a bluetooth speaker.  Given that you can run it while it's being charged, I'm less concerned about the battery.  The size is perfect for travel.  I used to have another pair of small speakers that I would take with me when travelling.  I was annoyed that I can't currently find them, but this is a perfect replacement.
