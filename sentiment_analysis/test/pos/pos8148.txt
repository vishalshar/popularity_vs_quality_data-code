Absolutely AMAZING. I swear by this and have for almost 8 yrs now.Occasionally my corgi decides he wants to lick his paws raw and I mean....RAW. I should've taken a picture because you would just be astounded at the before and after.....anywho, as you can plainly see this item is extremely expensive and so I had stopped using it for a while, instead opting for fish oil and what not because who has that in their budget?? His dog food was already grain free/holistic and all that jazz but now tack on these pricy supplements? (not to mention the  glucosamine/chondroitin he already gets because he's a corgi)So the fish oil for the most part, kept his skin nice and normal....but then we got hit with some very dry weather here in SoCal and his paws just started to itch like crazy and then the obsessive licking started up (I also suspect it's because he's 8 now so he's just getting old man skin/coat LOL) anyway....put him back on this and I'm telling you, in a week, his paw fur was all back after having been licked raw and he is right as rain now. To save myself a little moola, I'm giving it to him every other day after the initial "starter dose" where you kind of pack it into their system...and now it's all about maintenance.Anywho, if you've tried everything else for your dogs itchy skin/dry coat etc....but not this? Give it a go. It's natural/organic and good for them.
