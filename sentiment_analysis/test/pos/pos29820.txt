I use these brush guards protect and shape my makeup brushes while they dry after being washed every week. It's a simple design but a very useful and easy way to keep your brushes looking nice for longer. Since buying the brush guards, I've noticed a difference in the number of hairs that have fallen out of my brush while I apply my makeup! No more tiny bristles falling out of my kabuki and getting matted into my mineral foundation, yay! The best part is seeing how shapely and new my brushes look after using these!I recommend this product to anyone who uses brushes for applying makeup. :)
