I've been looking for a bike mount for my iPhone 6 for a while, trying to find a balance between cost, quality and ease of use, and this product fits the bill. The mount was too big for my bike's stem but fit well on the inside of my handle bars (I ride a specialized AWOL with road handles). I'm using the rubber o-rings to hold the base on but probably will switch to the zip ties soon though I imagine the o-rings would last for a while. The phone case is low profile and for someone who is pretty picky about cases, I like the style and feel.ProsSimpleBase makes it easy to take phone on and off while still locking securelyPhone case looks and feels goodConsThe all weather cover fits well but not very sensitive so it's hard to control the iPhone when it's onThe weather cover also sticks to the phone if it's even the tiniest bit smudged and hard to get offOver all, I love this case and mount and just won't plan on using the all-weather cover much. Luckily I live in CA so not much weather!
