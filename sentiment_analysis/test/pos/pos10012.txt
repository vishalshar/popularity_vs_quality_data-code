It was bought as a christmas gift and I was there when they opened it at the Christmas party.  It was a hit and it worked fine! I think that more people will buy this thing because people liked it so much at the party!The directions were easy to follow, but it did take a few people to try and figure out how to open the battery case. The directions to do so was not as clear, but also we had a few cold ones before trying it out!At any rate, jokes aside, this thing is a nice gift for those beer enthusiasts!I think that I'll buy one for myself in the near future!
