By no means will these stop decay from happening but it slows down the appearance of mold on fruits and seems to keep our baby spinach fresh and crisp longer. I buy produce in bulk at Sams Club because they have some of the best tasting produce around town and at affordable prices. However, we are only a family of three and the produce will often start to show signs of decay before we can finish the container. These papers have made it so that we can finish off the food before it goes bad.
