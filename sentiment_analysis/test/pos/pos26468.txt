I ordered the starter with 3 basil cups. This is what it looked like within 4 days. The light is far brighter than I expected, so it kind of stands out in the corner of my kitchen, that's not a bad thing, just a thing. Looks really cool, can't wait to see how the plants turn out. Will update as they grow.
