First off, this is not a gummy vitamin that is like a gummy bear, the consistency is more like a fruit gel so it's easier to chew and swallow.  They taste great, but kinda disappointed that there is no iron in them, which I thought there was.  Other than that they are great, but I will be looking for a different vitamin, one that has iron and omega 3s.ETA: I cannot believe the CEO of the company would actually take the time to comment on my little review on Amazon.  It just goes to show how dedicated this company is to customer satisfaction.  We have been giving the Iron in the drops as suggested and so far it's working great.We actually tried one of the Kirkland gummies with DHA as a sample from the store... and I couldn't believe how fishy and hard to digest it was.  It was suprising!I change my rating to a perfect 5 stars b/c it truly is a superior product!
