I wish I could give this 4.5 stars, but since half stars aren't allowed, I'll have to do 4 because 5 means perfection and it's close but not quite there.I love all the features the Leaf does have, but I think it could be improved with a food/calorie tracking feature. What I love about the leaf is the increased focus on wellness, as opposed to just physical fitness. The incorporation of the meditation piece was most appealing to me and the variety of guided meditations is a great feature.  Everyone compliments the look of this tracker because it wears like jewelry. So comfortably light too! Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and hope that Bellabeat will consider updating the their app with the food/calorie/water features.
