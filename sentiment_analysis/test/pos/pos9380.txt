I love my pet cube!! I bought it for my boyfriend because we adopted sister puppies but since I'm a nurse & work long hours they stay at his house more often then mine. Anytime there is downtime at work I love getting to play with them. It's a fun pass time to show people too! I've already had my sister and a coworker buy one after showing them! I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for some compatibility issues my boyfriend was having in the beginning with his android phone when they were advertising it worked with both android & Apple. I believe that got resolved, but I still have some echoing issues with the sound that freaks out the dogs when I turn the sound on. Hopefully that can fully get resolved too, but I still love it for what it is! Makes me feel connected with my pups when I can't be there so it's great for that.
