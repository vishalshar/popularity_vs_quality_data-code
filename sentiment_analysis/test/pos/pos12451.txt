It did what it was supposed to do, and it is a cool tou to go on my ipad mini.  My only thing is the image is 30 degrees around where you are shooting, so you have to step back to get the whole picture.  But it flat out said this in the ad.  Software imaging is sometimes lagging time wise and sometimes it is hard to start up, but nothing that just unplugging it and plugging it back in would solve.  But for $ 300 or so getting a thermal camera that helps me diagnose leaks for my customers, is great.  I am a roofer, and I approve this product!  :)
