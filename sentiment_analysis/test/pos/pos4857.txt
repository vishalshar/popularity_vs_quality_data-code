Truly enjoyed. Thought he would dislike. Desk job. Stress job. He could tell it worked because he could achieve focus for the day well before lunch at work and barely hit in on the weekends. Opposite for calm. It reminded him to move from the death desk. I give it high praise. Barely tell its on. Charge us a breeze. Classy. Classy a+ from a man who sent an apple watch back! Wow.
