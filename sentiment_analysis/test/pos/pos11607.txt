It's a bit smaller than I expected, super cute!Only took me a min to set it up and based on the instructions, as the 2nd router and ranger extender for my home. Friends who visited me today all asked me what it was and they connected the to my wifi with a simple "kiss" with the router. Super cool!I would highly recommend this great product, if u r looking for a 2nd router/guest network for your lovely home.
