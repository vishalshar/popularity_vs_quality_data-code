I had a horrible back ache after moving and setting up new furniture, including this bed and mattress. I laid down on my back, closed my eyes, and asked the mattress to take my pain away. It did!  I am now a believer in the one true mattress. When something good happens in our life, my wife and I declare "Praise mattress!". .Â…no, seriously, we do this.
