This is an early review. I recently installed a 128 GB TarDisk in my 2012 13" Macbook Air. I had been considering getting a new Macbook only because my HD space was dwindling. But I came across the TarDisk and decided, after a fair amount of research, that it would be a better way to resolve my storage space issues.Unfortunately, as was mentioned in some other reviews here, the Pear Installer software was NOT included on the TarDisk as I had been led to believe. I went through the relatively simple process to prepare for the TarDisk installation, but was not able to complete the setup procedure. I had to contact TarDisk support via email. After several email exchanges with the TarDisk rep (Murilo) I was finally able to successfully install the TarDisk in my machine.I now have twice the storage that I previously had. There is no apparent detrimental effect on performance. Once I was able to register my computer and download the installer, the installation was reasonably quick and easy.
