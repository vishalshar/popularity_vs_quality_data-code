This is one of best smart locks I've seen. The little NFC fob is easy to use. The Android app to program the lock is not user friendly. The customer support needs some improvement, they don't answer their phone or call back when you leave a message. They will respond to emails, eventually. The little manual doesn't tell you how many different users can be programed to the lock. I had to send bunch emails to find out that you can program up to twenty users on a lock. I was able to get twenty epoxy encapsulated tags from Go To Tags and program them to the lock, which performed flawlessly. I plan on purchasing more locks in the future.
