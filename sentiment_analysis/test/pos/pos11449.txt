I've been using Arccos for about six months now.  Love it.  I purchased it because I got a new set of irons and needed to know how far I hit each club.  But wow, what I got far exceeded my expectations.  Know I not only know the max distance for each club, but I also know my percentage of greens in regulation for each club.  And putts per hole, and putts per hole that I reached in regulation. I know how my drives are also. How many I missed to the right really surprised me!  So it gave me something to work on....I have also tried to use another product that you have to "tag" before each shot.  Can't believe how many times I had to go back to the spot I last hit from and "tag"!!  Arccos, on the other hand is something you turn on at the beginning of the round, and forget about it if you wish.  Except when your on a blind approach shot...you can get this distance to the front, center, and back of the green from your current position.To be honest, this device has helped me to improve my game on so many levels.  Data that I hadn't considered before.And the customer support is unreal!  THEY texted ME when I was having a problem. They knew about it before me!  These guys are good and they really care about their product.Try this product, and your game will improve!
