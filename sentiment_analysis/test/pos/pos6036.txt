I loved the idea of the Bluesmart One, but I avoided getting one during the crowdfunding campaign because I wanted to hear the reviews first. The reviews are mixed, but I got one anyway.The biggest complaint I heard about the Bluesmart is that it's too small inside compared to a regular carryon.Well, after using it for 2 trips, I agree that it is smaller than a "dumb" suitcase, but it's not enough to warrant writing the suitcase off. If you use packing cubes you should be able to fit everything you need for short trips of 3-6 days.Pros:-As a suitcase, it's designed extremely well. There's actually 8 independent wheels that allow for extremely smooth rolling. The handle is nice and large, and it's very attractive.-The size is perfect, I didn't have any issues getting it to fit in the overhead bin of 4 planes. I was even able to fit it into the small compartment of a smaller propeller plane.-The expandable/lockable front pocket is great for holding your computer, but if you are forced to use skycheck, I don't think it's smart to have the computer on the outside of the bag like that ... so you will have to transfer it to your personal bag or risk it getting damaged.Cons:-The unique design the expandable/lockable electronics/valuables/frequently accessed pocket does eat into the top clamshell of the suitcase quite a bit.-If you pack the suitcase to capacity (who dosen't), it will also be tricky to store and access items in the middle of the front pocket, and it will be nearly impossible to retrieve anything at the bottom of the pocket.-The UX of the suitcase (lol) is clumsy.Overall:I'm happy with the suitcase, it does have some drawbacks - you lost about 20% of the interior space and you'll have to give up some items, or take a larger personal bag.I take the Minaal bag (another kickstarter project) as my personal item, so combined with the Bluesmart I am able to fit everything I need.This is the first suitcase that you need an app for, and while it is clumsy and not super intuitive, I can't be too critical because they are pioneering the "smart suitcase" experience and of course there will be a couple of hiccups.The GPS tracking seemed to work fine for me, however I did have a couple of issues with the proximity notifications, and some frustrations with locking/unlocking when the suitcase would disconnect from the phone.If you like the idea of a smart suitcase, then the Bluesmart is worth the price tag.I received this suitcase at a discount for review purposes.
