This game is a fun for people who like monopoly, and it also teaches some of the concepts of the financial markets and business management decisions in a way that kids don't really know they're learning.  It takes a little time to get the rhythm down the first time you play - to keep track of the rules - and my son (12) was very overwhelmed serving as banker because in some cases, he had to pay four people different amounts of money in the same turn. However, it's overall a fun, fast-paced game, and we're looking forward to playing it again. My son just said that he won't be banker next time!
