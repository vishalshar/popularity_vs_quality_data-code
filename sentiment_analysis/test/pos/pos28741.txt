This product is a life saver and so easy to use! I recently moved to Las Vegas and if you have ever visited here, you know how big the parking lots are i.e. the casinos! I love how simple it was to download the app to my iPhone and then connect the app to the ZUS. I actually put it to the test in one of the local casinos parking lot. Guess what? It took me straight to my car!! I also love that it has not one, but two USB ports to charge my devices. I put my iPhone in one and my Kindle in the other. The best part? You don't have to look at the end of your USB because it plugs in BOTH ways! One thing...it does not work in parking garages BUT it tells you that and asks if you want to take a picture to remember where you parked. Oh...and say you are parking on the street with a meter. It asks you if you want to set a parking timer on your phone so you make it back to your car before the meter runs out! How cool is that!! This would definitely make a great gift and is a must for every car owner out there. Plus, the cost is under $30.00! Give it a try! :-)Â Nonda ZUS Smart Car Locator & USB Car Charger, 24W 4.8A, 2 Ports - Black
