Looking for a solution to secure and protect your entire home without monthly contracts? How about a smart hub that provides seamless home automation to make your life easier? abode, a new home security and automation system, has you covered.Ive had abode installed for about a week now and couldn't be happier with the product. For those interested in what comes with the Starter Kit, Ive attached an unboxing video to this review. The quality of the product is top-notch, and for an industry plagued by unappealing aesthetics, abodes design looks like it could have come out of Cupertino. While the sensors blend in with your doors and windows, the gateway hub is something youd be proud to display in your home, rather than shove in a cabinet beside your cable modem.Installation could not have been simpler. Without any tools, I had the entire system (gateway, two door sensors, and the motion camera) setup in less than fifteen minutes using the easy to follow directions. As a renter, it was nice that each sensor had 3M sticky pads ready to go so I didnt need to put a bunch of holes in the doors and walls. When Im ready to move, I can simply pop the sensors off and take the whole system with me.Security: abode prides itself as a professional-grade security solution and so far, I agree. The gateway hub has a 12 hour battery life, keeping you secure, even if the power goes out. The 93-decibel siren is a strong deterrent (my ears were ringing for hours after my initial test of the alarm). Anytime theres an alert, you receive an update on your smartphone, allowing you to verify whether its an emergency or simply a false alarm. The system can be further customized through IFTTT and abodes built-in Quick Actions (for example, geo-location on your phone automatically locks your doors and arms the system when you leave). abode's Timeline feature, available on both the app and website portal, allows you to quickly review the day's events and make sure everything is as it should be.Home Automation: For those of you already invested in smart home products like Nest thermostats, Hue lights, and Amazon Echo, abode can serve as your central hub for managing those devices and making them work for you. With Z-wave and Zigbee support, you can connect up to 155 home automation devices. Soon Ill be able to return from work, my lights will turn on automatically, the doors will unlock themselves, and Spotify will sync to my Bose speaker and start my favorite playlist. The only thing missing from that scenario is a device to pour me a good scotch!Pros:- Beautiful, sturdy product design- No contracts, no required monthly fees- Optional, affordable, professional monitoring offered in 3-day, 7-day or 1-month periods- Add-on sensors let you upgrade with ease- Battery life: cameras (4-6 years), sensors (10 years)- Compatible with many existing smart devices- No holes to drill for installation- Great for renters, take the system with you when you moveCons:- Still some minor bugs with the app, but the team at abode has been fast to respond to my comments and issue fixes.- My abode Android app was slow to respond when attempting to disarm a test alarm. A recent software update took care of this problem.While this is my first foray into the world of home security, I cant imagine a more polished, professional system than abode. People who visit are constantly impressed by the look of the system and the cool factor of the automation. Highly recommended for anyone looking to secure their home and/or unify their various smart devices.
