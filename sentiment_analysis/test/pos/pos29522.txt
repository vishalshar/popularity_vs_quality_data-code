It has been WEEKS since I've worried about loosing our cat!!!!! I can leave the door open to the house and let her roam free while I'm outside. She is a more contented creature with her freedom, and my furniture will last longer. I NEVER leave her out while I'm away. And I don't trust it 100%. But it is an effective tool that allows us to worry less.We took the chance and it paid off! We are a two cat household, located in a densely packed residential area. One of our cats just isn't happy until she gets to go out and do a perimeter sweep. She is extremely territorial and likes to rush approaching animals to scare them off. Including the pit bulls being walked by their owners. Fearless little knuckle-head also decided that the neighbor's small greenhouse needed thorough inspection every time she managed to escape us. After one embarrassing episode of her dodging just out of my reach for a couple laps around the neighbor's yard and garden, that was enough!!! We watched the video and read all the cat & dog reviews, did a lot of talking about how humane it would be......Tried keeping her cooped up in the house.....but she was a VERY unhappy girl.TRAINING NOTES: It is my experience, when cats are startled the lunge forward. It's a hardwired survival reaction. Dogs on the other hand usually cower or withdraw backwards. So instead of putting my cat on a leash and clapping next to, or behind her when approaching the correction zone, I tied her to light (strong) piece of baling twine, anchored that to a heavy log and let her roam. I made the line long enough that she could get past the correction zone. Then I crossed the correction zone line and waited for her to try and come to me. When I heard the beeping for correction I rushed at her clapping and scolding.After the first correction she was DONE. She skulked into the garage and wouldn't come off the steps.Day 2: put collar on and tied her to rope again, she wouldn't roam far and I'm impatient, so I carried her near the line until it beeped. She walked the last couple steps and got the correction. DONE again. Wouldn't come out of the garage. Let a week pass, we're really lazy trainers.Day 3: Put collar on, refused to leave garage. Knows better than to let me pick her up with the collar on!!There have been some things to adjust to for me. Like most of the wire is above ground now because I will randomly sink a shovel into the ground while gardening and forget that there is a wire there. Oops. She's slipped the line a couple times and we've needed to make adjustments. Once she even hit the correction zone and it zapped her, she rolled across into the neighbor's yard, and her instinct was to head for safety (the garage) and to get there she had to cross that line again, which she did with a painfull determination.Still haven't tried it on the other cat. She isn't as inclined to go outside, she's older and a more delicate personality....not sure her emotions will take the stress.update 01/28/11 : The original cat this was purchsed for still uses it. She is a determined, problem solving personality, that tests boundaries constantly. More than once I've had our neighbors chuckle and tell us she's in the process of tight-rope walking the top edge of the fence to escape, while our backs are turned. I don't take this as a fault of the system, so much as a fault of installation. I have to tweak the way it's installed as she finds the weak points to exploit. I still worry less about her. My other older cat will get trained on it this coming spring. My biggest problem has been my shovel!!! I'm always digging somewhere, and I've cut the line many times.
