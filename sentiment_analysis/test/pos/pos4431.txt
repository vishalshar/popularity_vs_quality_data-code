Before I discovered Formaticum cheese bags, I used to keep my cheese in ziplock bags, or wrapped in plastic wrap. It seemed obvious to me that an airtight plastic environment would be best to keep my cheese fresh for as long as possible. And yet the mold still came, and our cheese never lasted long enough to be completely enjoyed.On one fateful afternoon, I discovered a box of Formaticum cheese bags in our drawer, right next to the ziplock bags our cheese usually inhabits. My sister had brought them home with her from Vermont, a place where I had to admit, they knew a thing or two about cheese. I was still skeptical (as I usually am) so I did some research, and the claims made by Formaticum seemed plausible.The short of it is, cheese does indeed stay fresher for longer in its new brown paper home. There's no going back to plastic bags or wrap for our cheese. I'm on my third box already.There is even a place to write what kind of cheese it is and what date it was purchased on, which is convenient to say the least. My only suggestion to other purchasers, would be to write this information on the bag before putting the cheese in it, as my pen sometimes pierces the bag otherwise. Felt tip pens probably are the best choice for the task.I just wish there were more bags per box.
