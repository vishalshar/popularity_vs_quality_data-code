This is one big phone. Not for those with small hands. It works great. It works just as well as name brand Android phones costing 4 times as much. I also use it as a tablet, mostly for internet or watching videos, or as a music player through the aux input on the car radio. I have not loaded it up with a huge number of apps, so I cannot say if it would be as fast. However, I detect no slowing at all. I am definitely recommending this brand to my family and friends.
