I have about 20 WeMo Light Switches in my house, and I've been using them for just over a year. I can't imagine life without them now, especially since Amazon Echo can also control them. Last year the software was super buggy, but they've cleaned it up a ton. Things are working smoothly now, and it's so cool to have control over my lights and fans from anywhere in the world.
