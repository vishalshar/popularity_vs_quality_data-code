This is the second unit that we have purchased, first unit stopped working 1 week after purchase when a spring from inside the unit expelled itself with the treats. We returned that one and ordered another unit, this one worked well for almost 2 months then the same issue with the spring detaching from the unit and the unit no longer ejects the treats. Sadly it appears that we are past the returns time limit for this one so will not be able to return, repair or refund.UPDATE 10/22/2015: Petzi reached out with great customer service and quickly resolved all my issues, so I am upgrading my review to reflect that. Thanks all!
