I was introduced to these caps by a friend.  She had one on a mason jar and was using it as a water bottle.  I thought it was the coolest idea ever.  There's lot of plastic water bottles out there, but they usually make my water taste like plastic.  Using this on a glass mason jar, I feel like I don't have to worry about BPA or other things leaching into my drink.  I also don't have to spend a lot to buy a glass bottle in the store, I can turn any cheap mason jar into a water bottle.  And if the jar breaks, I just get another cheap jar... and I can reuse my reCAP top on it.Sometimes I also don't like how hard other water bottles are to clean.  With this, it's easy to just throw the jar into the dishwasher or hand wash it, and grab another jar.I love the versatility of mason jars, and this is one of those accessories that allows you to do even more with them.
