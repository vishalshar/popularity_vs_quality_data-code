I own an embarrassing number of headphones and iem's priced from  $12.00 to  $700.00. Recently I purchased a pair of 1More's triple driver iem's and was amazed at how good they sounded for the money. So I tried their MK801'S and was once more impressed. Also their iBeFree bluetooth IEM'S are best in class.So here we are with the MK802's.These are well made and are quite impressive looking. The clamping force is quite strong but lessens over time or by putting them over an oversized pillow for a few days.Before listening to them I burned them in using the 1More app for these headphones.I have to say these sound great once again matching the sound of bluetooth headphones costing much more. I own 17 other bluetooth headphones and iem's and these match up well with my most costly pair of bluetooth headphones.These really blur the line with wired headphones almost matching their sound. These make it easier to choose going wireless without sacrificing much in sound quality.The bass on these is adjustable using a switch on the headphones. So you can find the sweet spot for you.Mid's are creamy smooth and lush with out being too forward.High's sing a beautiful song. They are not too hot or sibilant.Soundstage is good for closed headphones providing very nice instrument separation and placement. Soundstage depth and width is well done as well.I have been very impressed with these cans and they have become one of my go to bluetooth headphones.If I want to listen to bluetooth iem's 1More iBeFree are definitely my favorite.I didn't receive a discount or receive these for free. These headphones are really that good.
