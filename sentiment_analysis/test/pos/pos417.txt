My daughter who is an Integrative Physician told me about Spire so I could track my tension and learn when to breathe and relax. Wow, it's an amazingly simple device to use and does exactly what I want it to do. I'm amazed at how often I'm tense during the day. The Spire buzzes ( i wear it on my waist) as a gentle reminder to take it down a notch and breath.  It's helped me to learn to relax during times of tension and to be more calm throughout the day.  The truth is that I feel better wearing it - it's like a friend now. I felt a bit naked when I accidentally left it at home one day.It's really helped me a lot with stress management and I have high stress job. I figure it will literally help me add years to my life.
