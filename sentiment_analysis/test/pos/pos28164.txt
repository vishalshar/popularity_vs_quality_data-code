If you are a motorcyclist you know how important correct tire pressure is.  You also know how inconvenient it can be to get down and check the pressure.  Mind you, I'm not talking about laziness that prevents you from bending down, I'm talking about getting to the back tire valve stem when you have saddlebags.Coming home from work you roll the bike into the garage and come back later to check the cold tire air pressure.  You realize the back tire valve stem is behind the saddle bag or in a spot you can't easily get to.  Ok, now you have to roll the bike a few feet forward so you can get access to the valve.  Only problem is your 4 year old daughter's bicycle, a miter saw, air compressor, and other junk in the garage prevents you from moving the bike.  In frustration you plan to check the tire in the morning before going to work.  Morning comes and the weather is beautiful.  Looking forward to the ride you completely forget to check the tire pressure.  Realize this on the ride and think to yourself, I'll check when I get home...  same thing happens again.Ok, this isn't the biggest problem we face in life but this tire pressure monitoring system is a nice convenience.  Albeit a bit gimmicky, if you're into gadgets, this is a gadget that is actually useful.Installation was very simple, just follow the step by step directions.  I downloaded the iPhone app and connected both sensors in under 10 minutes.  The software lets you set upper and lower pressures for each tire and gives an alarm when you are outside that range.  I cannot comment on that functionality because I just turn the bluetooth on for a few minutes to check the pressure before I head out or to check the tire temperature.
