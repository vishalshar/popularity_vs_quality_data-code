Product quality is great. Packaging is great. Application is good. Couple of suggestions to the manufacture:1. This is probably not realistic to change, but I was very surprised the product is slightly too long to fit on an Ikea changing table. I can't imagine we are the only people who bought an Ikea changing table as a temporary feature of the house. It is only about 1 cm too long to fit.2. Please change the application to allow for multiple devices. This is crazy. Yes, I see the app is updating through the cloud, but surely we are not the only ones who have multiple people changing the baby. -Note to add: I suppose it depends on the role of the device in the functionality. If the only role is to configure the WiFi, then perhaps this could be mentioned in the instructions.Other than these two items, the product is great.
