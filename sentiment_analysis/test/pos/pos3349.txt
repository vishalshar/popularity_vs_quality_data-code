The Quad Lock system is just downright awesome. The mount is built solid and holds the Quad Lock case very securely. I have but one very minor issue, and that is with the bolt used to tighten the clam arrangement to the handlebars. It's an Allen key type bolt, but the appropriate Allen key does not fit well inside the bolt head. They could have used a better bolt that will allow for a tighter Allen key fit. Like I said, it's a minor issue that, in my opinion doesn't take away a 5 star rating.
