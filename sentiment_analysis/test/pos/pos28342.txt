Pretty cool idea, and looks great too.  The magnet is plenty strong enough to hold everything together, and will only slide out of position if snagged on something.  It won't damage a nice tie like tacks. I'd like a bigger one, with a little more weight, but don't have any complaints about this one.  I'll be buying more of these soon. I'm surprised these haven't been around for a long time.
