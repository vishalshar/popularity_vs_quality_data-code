Please forgive the essay that follows, but we're *that* delighted with our new Zipp WiFi+Bluetooth.We needed to drag our old Bose SoundDock I (circa the iPod days) into the 21st century and after buying and trying various patches, we stopped cold realizing that we were just throwing good money after bad, winding up with clunky, unreliable third party solutions. Being self-avowed sound snobs, it was time to scrap the old and look for a new speaker system to work with our Apple lifestyle. Though "you get what you pay for" is the best rule to follow, we weren't too keen on forking over more big Bose bucks and bought the Zipp.Here are some notes: Amazing sound for one speaker  it sounds like a two speaker system Natural surround sound  pleasant tone that surrounds the listener Non-directional with very pleasant bass / vocals are natural / stringed instruments have a sweet tonality. Easy to identify individual instruments in the soundstage WiFi capabilities allows for no wire tangles especially convenient for outdoor listening Application Interface is very intuitive. The in-app offerings of radio stations is amazing  being able to choose a wide variety of musical genres from around the world is fantastic! This is a portal to a universe of musical diversity. Room settings are very effective to maximize the timbre of the music Imaging of music remains very stable, even if you are walking around the room. The sweet spot moves with you vs. conventional two speaker systems that require sitting in one place in order to enjoy the listening experience. Indoor  sound is stunning  focused vocals with a soundstage that matches the genre of music being played. Strings are natural and sweet  midrange bass is full  vocals are clear and melodic  percussion instruments are clear and sharp. Outdoor  bass is amazing  the soundstage is narrower however there is a fullness to the sound that stand out against the background of outside sounds such as wind, street traffic, people talking. We live in New York City  so thats very impressive.Last but not least, I regretted not doing an "unboxing video" almost immediately after getting half-way through in that frenzied Christmas-Day-tear-the-box-open way. It was as good, if not better, than unboxing a new Apple gizmo. No kidding. Libratone's whimsical design sensibility starts the minute you take it out of the shipping box. For folks like us, design and quality count, and the Zipp delivers it all. Highly recommended!
