I was a little upset about it being the wrong size, however, that was an operator error. While it is the wrong size, it still fits perfectly, considering it hugs my wrist. I love it, and would recommend this for anyone whom plays MineCraft. The MineCraft Gameband is perfect for all ages, considering it being available in small, and large.
