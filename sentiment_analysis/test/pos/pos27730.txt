Do you still keep your cheese in plastic bags, Saran, or some other plastic-y thing?  Is it frequently wet when you take it out?  Do you find it gets moldy quickly?  Guess what?  These things fix all that!  Cheese needs to 'breathe', and has a tendancy to absorb flavors of whatever it's held in.  These are basically bags made of butcher paper/parchment paper, but man do they make a difference! I'm from Wisconsin, and at any given time I have at least 6 kinds of cheese in my fridge.  These bags make them last longer, taste fresher, and not have that nasty watery feel when I pull them out.  It's a little bit ridiculous, but they're completely re-usable, and I've found that they really do make the cheese last longer.  I've convinced a good number of my friends to try them, and have gotten positive feedback - so it's not just me.
