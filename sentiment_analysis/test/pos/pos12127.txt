I would easily give this product 5 stars if it arrived with a working battery. Luckily I purchased an extra battery with it that works. The battery that came with the drone is a dud and will not charge. The extra battery works.To make things easier on my wife, I put this drone on my Amazon wish list so my wife would know what to get me for my birthday. I let her know and she purchased it very soon after. I received the product over a month before my birthday, but the family sang to me as I was opening the box. The product was packaged in a standard Amazon shipping box with the scrunched up brown paper stuff as filler. The product came inside the case that looks pretty high quality.Inside the case was the drone with the dead battery already inserted as well as all sorts of other stuff. I also purchased extra propellers, a battery, propeller guards,  and landing gear so I would have parts on hand. I immediately took the charging cable and plugged in the controller and the spare battery as I started reading the directions on how to put the thing together.First I flipped the device over and took out the screws holding the LED covers and put on the propeller guards using the new screws provided. Then I put on the propellers. After this I put on the thread that holds the propeller guards together. It all worked pretty easily.At this time I pulled out the battery from the drone, stuck in the fully charged battery and walked through the procedures in the quick start guide. I utilized my iPad mini 4 as my device I hooked up to my controller. I utilized a cable I already had as the one it came with was a micro USB cable. Everything turned on perfectly and it told me that there was a firmware update that needed to be installed.It was at this point that I realized I didn't have a microSD card to SD card converter and my laptop only had a full size SD card slot so I decided to try it out without the firmware update before it got too dark to fly. The drone flew like a dream. My daughter and I had a blast flying it around the neighborhood trying out the various capabilities. When that battery was running low, it returned home.  Seeing as the batteries take about an hour to charge I prepared dinner and then went back to the drone. I put in the battery that came with the device, turned it on, and then proceeded to fly for about 15 seconds when the I get the message that the battery is critically low. I quickly land it as it says there is 0% battery remaining.It is at this point that I go and look at the other battery that I can see is charging, it has lights on the battery that are flashing as the battery charges, When I swap the batteries, I notice the dud doesn't turn lights on when charging, although the light on the charger does turn on.At this point I head to the store to get a microSD to SD card adapter. I download the firmware to the microSD card and then plug the good battery in and start the firmware upgrade. The firmware upgrade takes several minutes to complete, it shows the status on the remote controller's little LCD screen.I plugged in the dud battery to the charger hoping that it would somehow charge over night. I then in the morning tested it and it still had no charge. Having read the support was top notch, I opened a support ticket with Autel. On their website the chat was disabled (it was 1 am, so not too surprised). I opt to send them an email. Then I proceeded to register my device on their website. Apparently there support team closed shop early today because of the upcoming Independence day coming on Monday. I will gladly turn this review into a 5 star review if there support is able to help me out with fixing my battery or with replacing it.UPDATE 7/18/2016Well, after having a dud battery that wouldn't charge, I contacted the support team.  The support team was pretty good and they got a new battery shipped my way. Of course a few minutes after I contacted support, I was busy flying with my other battery.  By default at 25% the craft flies home. As it was auto flying home, all of a sudden the battery power drops quickly. About 5 to 10 feet from the ground the craft plunged to the ground. The propeller protectors broke into pieces and the camera came disconnected. From this point I reconnected the camera, but got an error saying it couldn't get video. Calling back to support, they explained some early models had a bug that if the camera disconnects while powered on it fries out the board. Long story short, I flew it for the rest of the day with no video. At this point I have returned my drone to them and they have shipped me a brand new one. I believe I ended up with an extra battery as they sent the replacement battery and then a complete replacement drone. I have also purchased several extra batteries.  The batteries start dropping in power quickly from about 35 to 40%. Set your return home to be no less than 40%. Also, if it says critical battery, set it down where it is at. Do not let it land itself, but just push down so that you can drop the altitude at the quickest pace possible before the battery fails and it comes to a crashing halt. I have taken several videos of my neighborhood, It flies great in a medium wind. Lots of fun, but don't risk the battery going low, just get lots of them.  I also got an extra charger.
