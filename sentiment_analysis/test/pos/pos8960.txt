Wow. Who knew. These bags are really cool. They keep the cheese from getting sweaty and it lasts much longer. I like them. You write the name of the type of cheese on the brown bag and just fold the bag over itself, no sealing or anything.  Classy. Different. Effective and better for  the environment than plastic baggies which I no longer use.
