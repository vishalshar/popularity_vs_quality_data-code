My little artist has been dying for a 3D pen and this is a perfect pen for a newbie or someone who knows 3D artwork. It comes with 50 various colored plastic strands ready to use. After plugging the pen in, insert a plastic stick, push onto a piece of paper and star your art. By pushing a button the plastic comes out and you can draw as easy as you would a pencil or pen. There is definitely a learning curve as we took about  two sticks of plastic to learn how to create a nice line and cut it off without creating a ball at the end.  This is heated plastic but the pen didn't burn me and unlike a glue gun this plastic instantly hardens so no burns or threads when you move the pen around (hooray).The instructions are very user friendly and right out of the box you can create.We are impressed with the art others have created using this pen and while we are still in the beginning stages have plans for a phone case and pendants.  In the photos you can see her start by making lines and balls, then circlesOur suggestions are to start by drawing small lines to learn the pen. Then build up. It is so much fun. We can't wait to get more plastic
