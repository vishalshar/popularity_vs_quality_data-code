Let me start by saying Im not a super-techno person. I dont have to have the latest gadget, but when I do get a new toy, Im a plug-and-pay kind of girl who likes to keep things simple. When Im listening to music on a device, I dont need a lot of bells and whistles  unless there are actual bells and whistles on the audio track  I just need it to sound good. Like, in the studio with the musicians surrounding me while theyre playing, good. Thats why I dig the Libratone ZIPP.It basically comes out of the box ready to rock and roll (or hiphop if you prefer). Plug it in, download the ap, follow a few set-up instructions and thats it. Admittedly, I encountered a few glitches in the process (anti-android conspiracy?) but your mileage will vary if youre a member of I-Phone nation. And as far as  interfacing with your puter goes, patience is key here if youre a PC person like me.Once you get that logistics out of the way, its all good. For a speaker of this size to give you such immersive sound is uber impressive. The fact that its omnidirectional means no matter where you place it  table, floor, shelf, etc. (all settings in the app, by the way)  its going to sound great. It not only fills the room, it fills the room next to the room as well. There are also settings for various genres of music  live concert, classical, jazz rock, easy listening, etc.  which you can set to fine tune the Libratones soundscape and suit your preference.The speaker being lightweight and totally portable is another plus. No more cranking up the stereo on the first floor so you dont miss the best part of your favorite song because you had to run up to the second floor. Just grab the speaker by the strap and take it wherever, including outside. I cant wait to make everybody on the beach jealous this summer (or, at the very least, I cant wait to stream reggae music  courtesy of Spotify, or one of the internet radio stations Ive already pre-set into the speaker - and pretend Im at the beach).This speaker makes me feel like one of the cool kids!
