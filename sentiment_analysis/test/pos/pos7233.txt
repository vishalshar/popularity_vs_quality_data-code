These things get the smallest splinters! They retain extremely well, I have them on my Lucky Line key ring which I sit on and they have never come loose like I thought they might. Tip is very precise, they appear to be manufactured by stamping, if you want these to be super ultra mega precise you can grind it on the edges of the tips.
