Arrived on time and probably the best product in the market. Three improvements would probably make it better.1) Putting the phone on the bike is super easy but taking it out requires a little struggle. You have to find the blue piece on the back and slide it down, at which point you can rotate the phone and take it off the fixture. Some kind of spring mechanism where you press the phone down and rotate to release would be very helpful. A small lever on the side that depresses the blue piece could also work2) With the poncho on, the phone's touch capability drops to like 5%. There is a grid of dots on the inside of the poncho. my guess is that they are to enable the touch through the poncho. Perhaps it can me improved further. I have noticed that when the plastic sticks the touch works very well.3) The rubber bands to fix on the band do a good job but could be a bit better.
