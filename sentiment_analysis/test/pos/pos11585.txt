I can't think of a more perfect gift for a tea lover! I bought this gift box for my roommate and loved how thoughtful and high quality everything about it wasÂ—the packaging was elegant, the wooden spoon is adorable, and the teas, MY GOODNESS, are simply divine! My roommate can be a tea snob sometimes, and even she loved the exotics teas that she had never tried before. Plus, as her roommie, I get to share in the delightful treasures as well. Win.
