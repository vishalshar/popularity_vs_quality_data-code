Charges everything fast. Our household has multiple electronic devices (2 tablets, 3 cellphones, Bluetooth mini speakers,  1 fit bit, portable chargers, the list goes on) and now we can charge everything in one safe location.Gone are the days of lost chargers and competing for electric outlets. No longer do we have devices charging in the bathroom or in the kitchen. Unsightly cables/chargers everywhere you look have disappeared.You have to provide your own  usb cables. It comes with one.  I bought a pack of the really short 12" cables and that keeps the hub looking nice and neat.
