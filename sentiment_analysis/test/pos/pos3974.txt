I like many others got really into Chia after reading Born to Run and I found these bars and decided to try them.  I think they are surprisingly delicious!  I recently just ran my first marathon and this was my go to pre-run snack during training.  They are small but surprisingly their size doesn't affect how full and satisfied I am after eating it.  In fact I've actually come to enjoy the smaller size as I'm trying to stay away from using the huge "Mom bags" and can keep one in my bag for a snack without it taking up much room.  I uploaded a photo to show the nutrition facts because this is really important to me while I train for different races and I think it's helpful to see before purchasing.  My only warning is be sure to check your smile in a mirror after eating ANY chia because it tends to get stuck in your teeth!
