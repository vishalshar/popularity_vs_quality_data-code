The iOttie is easy to operate and very stylish. The iPhone 4s fits nicely in its cradle but with the Otterbox case installed, the lower clamps are a little tight, although it holds the phone fine. Another issue I had was the handle bar clamp, the small bushing is too small and the larger bushing was too large. I was able to use the loop side of velcro tape and the smaller bushing to adequately hold the iOttie in place. I took the mountain bike on a pretty bad trail (bumpy) and the IOttie held the iPhone in place. Would I recommend the iOttie? Even though I only gave it a 4 star review, I believe that with the follow up after purchase, the developers want to get this right and with a 1 year warranty, they are in it for the long haul.Steve
