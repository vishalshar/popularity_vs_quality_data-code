My grandson really enjoyed this little robot.  On Christmas Day he had it delivering items like cookies and snacks around to people.  It was amazing how much it could carry for it's size.  For example, he "kidnapped" one of the younger children's small teddie bear and had the robot playing keep-away.  They had a ball with it.
