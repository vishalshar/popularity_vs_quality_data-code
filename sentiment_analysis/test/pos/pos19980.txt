LOVE THIS PRODUCT!My pups are spoiled rotten. They only eat homemade organic foods so it's difficult to get them to eat anything commercially produced. Getting supplements is hard to do when you make their foods.They love them. I'm satisfied.My 93 yr old grandmother ate a piece on accident and she is still feeling well!Human grade is a plus!
