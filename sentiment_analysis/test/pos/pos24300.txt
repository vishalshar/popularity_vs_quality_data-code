Best iPhone Case!  Now that the iPhone 7 is water resistant, I no longer have to put my iPhone in a waterproof case that blocks sound in both speakers and microphone, and has a crappy soft plastic screen cover that looks and works like crap. With the Rockform case, it feels great, doesn't block the awesome camera lense, doesn't block and mic or speakers, and still offers the great protection I like for a case. I was outside with some friends and it started to rain lightly, I set the iPhone on the table in the rain, kept playing music no problem. I like the magnetic mount vent mount for my wife's car and the twist lock mount for my truck. I also recommend getting the impact glass screen cover to use with it (I know people who saved their phone screen by having that installed).
