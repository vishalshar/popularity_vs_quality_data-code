Bought this for my daughters ground floor apartment and she loves it so far. She said it was very easy to set up and the customer support online has been helpful. I would recommend checking out the phone app that can control the system before purchasing the remotes. She uses this, instead of the remote, but acknowledged that having the extra remote will be good for guests or dog babysitters!
