I've been looking for this since iphone 6 came out. I almost bought galaxy note 7 for it's bigger battery but now I can go all day with heavy usage. very nice looking case but it's little bit heavy. I hope they can add automatic charge when the phone battery gets to 10%. by the way you dont have to remove the case for any reason other than removing the sim card.
