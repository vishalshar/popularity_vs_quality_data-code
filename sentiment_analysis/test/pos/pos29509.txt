I'm so disappointed that Pebble no longer exists and its software group has been acquired by Fitbit.  I've had two previous fitbit products and they are a joke compared to the Pebble 2.  The Pebble 2 is hands down the best smart watch I have seen.  I love that the screen is always on.  No more awkwardly flicking your wrist trying to see what time it is - just glance at your watch the way you've always been able to look at a watch.  Everything about this watch just works.  Very little configuration required.  Once you have the Pebble app on your phone and have synced the watch up with Bluetooth, you're off and running.  You can customize the watch facing and what alerts are received on your watch, but its super intuitive.  Alerts begin to show up on your watch as they're received on your phone.  If there's a notification you no longer want to receive, then just turn off notifications from that service from within the Pebble app.  Otherwise, you get all of your notifications right on your wrist - no hunting around - it just works.  Lots of apps to customize your watch as well.  Some folks have said that the heartrate is not accurate.  I haven't noticed it being off by much, but I didn't expect that much either.  I previously had a fitbit Charge HR and it is every bit as accurate as that was.  I really wasn't expecting that much.  But the pedometer works great and gives you helpful stats each day indicating whether you walked more or less than your average.  The Pebble Health app also offers great charts.  If you want to use the fitbit or Apple Health app, you can have it send data to those apps as well.  I truly hope that Fitbit leverages their new resources with this acquisition because the Pebble 2 is such a superior product to everything they offer.  As for now, this watch still works as designed.  Hopefully Fitbit will continue to keep the Pebble servers running and I will be able to wear this for years to come.
