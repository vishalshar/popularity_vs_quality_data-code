I have had great success with the original Canary and decided to give the Flex a try to increase coverage at my house.  I couldn't be happier with my decision.  The Flex comes in a very cool package, and the magnetic base is a winner.  Pairing the Flex on my app was a breeze.  After an update installed the Flex has been working flawlessly.
