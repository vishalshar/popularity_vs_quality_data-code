This is the second of these kits that I have purchased.  The first one gave me mushrooms 3 times, then I planted the substrate into coffee grounds for another 2 pickings.  This kit performed wonderfully well.  I soaked it overnight the first night I had it and it has been visibly growing each day since.  I have even better success this time around.  Will purchase more kits in the future for sure!
