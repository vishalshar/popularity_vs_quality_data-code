I love that this product is small and not bulky. Moreover, I love the price! It does everything that a fit bit will do but at a much more reasonable price. I also love that you can set up activity reminders which will help keep you moving and active throughout the day! I also really love the alarm setting on the bracelet! I tend to be a heavy sleeper and hate setting loud alarms due to the fact that I wake up my boyfriend since I get up so early in the day. Coupling the arm vibration with a traditional alarm has really eased both of our stress in the mornings!Also, you can do other things in the app with this bracelet besides tracking steps, alarms, and activity reminders. You can even calculate your hydration throughout the day and your quality of sleep.
