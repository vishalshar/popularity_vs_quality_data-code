This replaced my first-generation Pebble after the battery was nearly exhausted. Keeps its charge for about a week, tracks my steps and my workouts (via built-in apps as well as great third-party apps) and it's my silent alarm clock that wakes me every day with a vibration on my wrist. Sad that Pebble just got bought out by FitBit but hopefully they'll integrate some of the great Pebble features into future FitBit devices. At least I have this one to last me a couple more years!
