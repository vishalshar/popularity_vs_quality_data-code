Very quick delivery.  Assembly required but not too difficult with clear instructions.  Used on a 5 burner Broil King grill with good results.  Best used with heat deflectors removed from grill. Does take longer to heat up to desired temperatures unless you close the bbq lid for a few minutes (do not leave lid closed - it could damage pizza oven).  Good design with the pizza stone interior on all four sides and rear as opposed to other designs that don't have it.  Pizza cooks in 4 minutes with great results.  I am gluten sensitive so I am using GF pizza dough and still getting great results.  Would recommend.I have now used this for a couple of months now and it continues to make great pizza.  I raised my rating to 5 stars due to the customer service of this company.  I accidentally dropped my stove and cracked one of the stone inserts.  Ordered a replacement and when it arrived - I realized it was the wrong one (my fault, not theirs) - contacted the company who was local and because one of the guys lived in my area - he hand delivered it the next day.  I am hooked....
