I bought this as a gift for an 8 year old boy who loves science and building legos and lives on the other side of the country from us. We were able to be together when he opened it! What a hit! He had it together in 5 minutes, but was inspired by the idea of making a dragon on his own. We (as in the grownup and our 4 year old) got to help by saving toilet paper rolls and cutting out and decorating "fire" and "tail scales" and other dragon parts from old cardboard boxes. We sent those parts in the mail as a follow up gift for a different occasion and now he's working on a dragon of his own design. What a great way to encourage creativity and also a great way to participate in his imaginative play. The possibilities are endless and it is really affordable (essentially free) for us to send "accessories" to build on the gift we gave him and keep it fresh. Thanks for making such a child-centered activity!!!
