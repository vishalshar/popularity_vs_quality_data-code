This Lifx colored bulb works great w their app, with nifty effects such as Candle Flicker (flickering yellow) or Music Visualizer (lights change and beat in coordination w background sounds) as well as pre-set themes in shades such as "Mellow" or "Exciting". You can also customize and save favorite colors for easy access. The bulb itself was extremely easy to install: 1) screw in the light bulb; 2) download the LIFX app; and 3) follow the short directions to connect the bulb to your wifi network. If this is all you are planning to do, the light seems to work perfectly as intended within their app universe, which is actually amazing, and worthy of 5 stars easily.I deducted a star though, because I had really intended to use these smart devices w Amazon's Echo/ Alexa. The integration to voice control was less straightforward; it took turning my phone on and off to link the programs (error message) and even after linking and setting up zones, there were some irritating quirks. For example, there are specific "magic words" you have to play around with to make your bulb change colors. There is also a limit of some basic colors you can change via Alexa voice control, and you can't voice control the cool themes or effects, sadly. Also, the magic words are somewhat long, and entail you asking Alexa to "ask LIFX (life-x) to change (insert bulb/area name you setup in advance) to (color desired)."  As if that wasn't a long enough (very specific) mouthful, our Alexa will only change the color of our one LIFX bulb if I say "All lights" in the area name, vs. "Stairs" which I had set it up for (btw, I also set up a category called "All" in the Alexa app which includes every light in my home). I'm presently using Phillips Hues smart lights (non-color) for other areas of the house, so saying "All lights" is not a problem, since none of my other lights can change color. Perhaps if/when I get two colored bulbs, I will have to try to solve this issue. In comparison, you don't have to ask Alexa to ask Phillips Hues anything- you just say "Turn off Den"- WAY easier.After stepping back and reading my criticism, I'm going to give this Lifx 5 stars anyways... The difficulties in coordinating w Alexa may not be a problem w Lifx- maybe it's a problem w Alexa, or a combination of merging two separate devices/ programs. This Lifx bulb is really very good, and extremely easy to use, right out of the box. I'd just warn that you may find the Alexa voice control somewhat annoying.
