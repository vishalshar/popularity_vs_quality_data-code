This thing is nice. I accidentally left it outside one evening when it rained and it didn't phase it. Not overly loud, but for chillin' on the back deck or a decent jobsite speaker, it works great. It charges pretty quick and seems to last forever. I've had it run two solid days on the jobsite without flinching. The little "hook" for a carabiner is on the small side and might be difficult to get one to work, but I found a smaller one that did work and it hung great. Good buy!
