Its an excelent product! Easy to install, phone stays perfectly in place.....best phone mount i have tried, plus you can exchange your phone between mounts...like on your motorcycle! Snap on, snap off....super easy.So why didnt i give it 5 stars......the rain protection. Super easy to put on, not so much to take off. A bit of a hassle i think, probably it will strech or i need a tutorial on how to take it off.Also, i have a screen protector on my phone and with the rain hood on....well the tactil screen doesnt work that well....if at all.Now.....having said that, the cover DOES complete its pourpose which is...to protect the phone from the rain. Keep in mind it doesnt water proof it.Still think its the best system out there, just needs a few tweeks on the rain cover to make it perfect and get a 5 star rating.
