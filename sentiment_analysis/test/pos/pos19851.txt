I've been looking for a portable speaker and decided on the Fugoo. It was a toss up between the UK Boom and this.I took a chance and got the Fugoo Sport without hearing it perform. The delivery was very prompt.The unit came to me and pairing was easy on both my Mac and Samsung S6 Edge. It automatically connects to the device as well.Now, sound is import to me. It's true that bass is not as intensive like with Bose but I prefer clarity and brightness when it comes to mids and highs. (Like the Grado Headphones).What can I say,  I love the sound. And the battery life is amazing.
