get if you want your brush to keep its shape the way it was when you first bought it. I shampoo my brushes with dr. bronner's castile soap+olive oil then I squeeze the water out, shake em, put brush guards on and stick em  head down onto my brush tree. =perfection! brushes look and perform great. now I don't have crooked shape of the brush head or a few stubborn hairs sticking out the wrong way on my brushes and messing up my makeup application.
