I was worried before I received these after reading the reviews about them not working if you have wide feet.  I went on Hickies website and they give detailed descriptions AND videos on how to use this product with wide feet (for a looser fit) & for other types of situations.  I WILL be ordering more of these for other shoes and I have recommended these to friends, GREAT product
