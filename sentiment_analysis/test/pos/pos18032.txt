I was watching videos on proper brush cleaning and I found this...  I recently purchaced a large set of brushes and with the $$$ I spent, this is an excellent way to protect them and have them stay New.  I have used it a few times now and during the drying time, I was amazing on how well it did considering the weight of the wet brush.  It held it up perfectly.
