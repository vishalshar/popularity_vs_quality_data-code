Beautiful design. Very easy to follow directions to build functional robots - much like Lego instructions. My 7 year old and his friends have enjoyed experimenting with these - they have easily been able to make their own motorized creations without any help.The possibilities are really endless with this amazing product. It is more than just a toy. I hope the product catches on and they are able to lower costs somewhat to make the larger set more accessible.
