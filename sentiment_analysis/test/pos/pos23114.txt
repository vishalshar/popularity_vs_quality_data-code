Purchased this item for my husband, to counteract the guitar amplifier I purchased for my son.  It is a solid, well-made little speaker which works incredibly well, and I just ordered another one.  I looked at the larger model(s), and am glad I decided to go with the Micro version--It is absolutely perfect.
