I gave it four stars due to the sound quality is not as good as the Bose, or J-box Bluetooth speakers, but then again they aren't water resistant. This unit sounds very good, pairs easily with my I-pad, and can be taken in the shower without any worries. The charge lasts for hours with the rechargeable lithium battery. I would recommend this unit for anyone who wants a rugged outdoor speaker with very good sound, and needs weather proof options.
