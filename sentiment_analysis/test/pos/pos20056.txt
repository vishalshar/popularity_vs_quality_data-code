I lose everything. I mean everything. Of all the trackers this is the sharpest looking one.That said, I really wish I hadn't bought nine of them.After a year the batteries die and I cannot be replaced. Tile has a replacement program For about 50% off.I Understand that they need to have an income stream to keep the website up after year so I not against them do that in principal somehow it still bothers me.The other issues are more to do with their app. The app needs to be running at all times, I can't run in the background like some of the other Bluetooth trackers can. If I'm traveling and I'm separated from the tracker it doesn't give me any notification. This could be a big problem if I'm in an airport or caf√© since I can only use the Tracker after-the-fact if the app is running.It doesn't work with the Amazon echo.that's just silly. And also it's kind of a one trick pony meaning depressed tile and it rings your phone that is all.One last thing that is Iricksome that if you share it out with other members of the family if their phone connects to the tile you can't connect to the tile,  even if you using different accounts. So that means I have to find my wife's phone to locate my tile.Overall I like the category and it is saving me a lot of time, I just think this product needs a little more love in the R&D department
