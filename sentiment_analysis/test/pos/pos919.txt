This pack is very well though through. It has ample storage can easily handle a large laptop and 11x16 folders. It has several smaller pockets for a wide assortment of additional items you carry there so also a large zipped pocket on the backside that could even carry a legally concealed weapon or a wide variety of other things. The best thing about this pouch though is how is hugs your body. It is designed to hang close and it does exactly that. It is so versatile it can be swung aroundq while still being worn and accessed to acquire anything you are carrying. I bought the extra long version which is bigger than the regular size but no massive by any means. I am thinking seriously about acquiring the regular size as well.
