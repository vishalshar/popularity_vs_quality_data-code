This little comb really is awesome. This doesn't replace a comb to style one's hair but it is just fantastic for having out and about. It is really sturdy yet lightweight.  The teeth are long enough and wide enough to detangle long hair in a pinch. If one's hair is on the shorter side ( mine is right below my ears ) , this is all one needs for travel.  I have even used this at the beach on my teen aged daughter who has hair down past her shoulder blades. It was fantastic in detangling her hair in sections.My only regret is that I didn't get the one with the back mirror.  Then I could have ditched my purse mirror too. Though I will probably buy that one and keep this one in her travel cheerleading kit.Since some of these can be personalized, these would be amazing bridesmaid gifts or team gifts for cheerleading/dancing/gymnastics, etc.
