Holy cow, this thing is great! I purchased it because I'm moving towards using Carbon Fiber PLA as my main print material. It's super abrasive, and I've already worn through one brass nozzle. Someone on Reddit suggested this nozzle, and I am glad they did. Like the other reviewer, I've found that I am able to drop my temps by 5-10 degrees, and I'm also getting smoother prints with less artifacts. PETG used to be my nemesis, but after installing this nozzle I'm getting fantastic results. Five stars, for sure!
