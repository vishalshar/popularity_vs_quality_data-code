I bought this watch/tracker to replace my FitBit Flex after the second band cracked and needed to be replaced. I thought it would be good if I was going to wear a strap on my wrist that it tell the time. And since we enjoy snorkeling and were about to go on a trip where we needed to be back to the boat in a specified time this would be great, being water resistant to 50 meters. Yes, meters - not feet. And it looks stylish.Of course when I got it I had to wear both my FitBit and the Activite Steel to compare step counts. The Activite was counting significantly fewer steps than the FitBit over the course of a day. So I walked 1.5 miles around the neighborhood and counted my steps. Then I walked to the grocery and back, counting steps. The Activite was within one percent of my manual count. I think the FitBit counts more random movements as steps. This is not necessarily a bad thing, because it takes energy to fidget in your desk chair too. So should that be counted as steps? Should the calories burned reflect the number of steps only, or should other movements count too? Don't we get a base level of calories per day just for living? It's not a simple question to answer.So, my advice is don't wear two trackers! You will notice you are not getting your "normal" daily steps, but again this is neither good nor bad. It just is. After a month or so I accepted my new normal levels and all is well.A pleasant surprise was the Health Mate software. I like how it displays my periods of light and deep sleep. It seems to agree with how I feel upon waking up. It also tracks swimming and running, but within limits. Like you have to run for 5 minutes for it to agree that you were running. And counting swimming strokes doesn't work for me in our home pool because again, you have to do the stroke for enough time for it to believe you ae actually swimming. Unfortunately, it takes a 50 meter or 100 meter pool for it to count. Too many pauses to turn in out 10 meter pool I guess.
