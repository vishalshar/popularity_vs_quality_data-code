Recently Bought a pair sperry canvas sneakers and didn't want to go sockless as my feet sweat quite a bit. I gave these a try since they came in different sizes. I ordered size small for my size 9 feet and these fit me great. I only wish they were a bit thicker for better sweat absorption. I have had no problems with them sliding off my heels and they have held up well so far.
