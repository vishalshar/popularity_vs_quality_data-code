This mask is incredible. I will definitely be repurchasing! It feels great on my face, but it also produces visible results! The before and after pictures are taken about 25 minutes apart, under the same lighting, using the same camera, I tried to do the same angle and they have no editing whatsoever. In the top picture you can see my fine wrinkles, and in the bottom one - they are gone! I also have a lot less redness after the mask. I did notice that my skin will get the wrinkles back somewhat after a while, but I wonder whether these masks have long term effects, where each time the wrinkles become less. I guess we'll see :).
