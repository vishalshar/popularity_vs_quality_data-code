My husband can't swallow capsules or tablets so finding gummy vitamins for men was a dream come true! They're organic, with the right ingredients and daily % and don't taste bad either. Glad to have found them available on Amazon.Update: gummies in the last 2 bottles we've ordered have been very gooey. Not sure why. This hasn't affected the taste or quality but they leave your fingers sticky & hard to get out of the bottle! Maybe they changed the  formula.
