There are lots of these zappers on the market. This brand, USA made works for me. I like the fact it takes four D size batteries, so I don't need to worry as much with it going dead, and that little rodent getting a laugh out of this red box. I will buy again. Just remember keep the bait inside fairly fresh. And, watch out for the copies of this, coming from you know where.
