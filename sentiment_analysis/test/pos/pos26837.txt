So Happy to have found these chips!  I have several autoimmune diseases including AI Hepatitis and am just sick & tired of being sick & tired.  So comes in the Autoimmune Protocol diet.  Even though there are a lot of foods you can't have, I really have not felt "deprived" except for the fact that I am missing something crunchy & these chips really fit the bill for that.I like a thin chip like Lays yellow bag of chips & can say these are not those.  I would say these chips are more like a kettle cooked chip & you do have an almost greasy (coconut oil) taste to them.  I wasn't sure if I liked them on the first chip, but then had a couple more & they grew on me.  I could never eat a whole bag of these, like I could with Lays (lol) but now I don't feel deprived.I am EXTREMELY happy that there is a pre-packaged snack that fits into the autoimmune protocol!The only reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 was that almost $10 for a bag a chips is very expensive.
