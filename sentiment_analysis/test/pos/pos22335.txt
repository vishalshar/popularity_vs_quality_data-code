this device gives me peace of mind and keeps me motivated to get my dog enough exercise everyday.issue:there is a 3-5min delay in the notification when your dog leaves his/her zone and sometimes, when you KNOW they are gone, you try to track them and it still thinks the dog is in the zone, so it refused to track via gps.  these precious moments can be the difference between jumping in your car vs calling in the right direction.  my dog generally stays in the yard, so these occurrences are very rare, but can be frustrating when it happens.otherwise, very happy with the product and i signed up for 3yr plan for gps tracking.  the app has been updated since release, which is always a good sign..
