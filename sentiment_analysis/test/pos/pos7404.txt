I bought this toy for my children and they absolutely love it.  The first time they opened it, they both played with it for 2 hours!  They had their friends over and they loved it too.What they enjoy about it is they can follow the instructions to make the space gear or be creative and come up with their own idea.  The design of the product is colorful and appealing for both boys and girls.  It would make a perfect birthday gift for kids around age 6.I plan to buy more of these products in the future as they are really well made but more importantly, fun for the kids!
