This has worked great for my 18 # Coton de Tulear.  On the lowest setting he no longer ran out to the road to greet people walking by, but  he went through the boundary a couple times while chasing our cat.  Since adjusting it up a notch he quickly has learned to stop short of the boundary even  when in pursuit.
