Easy to attach, although directions are not very helpful. Come in a variety of colors. Makes any pair of tie shoes easy to slip on. I have been looking for some time to replace a pair of slip-on athletic shoes without success. The Hickies made it possible to get the slip-on ease I was looking for.  I definitely would recommend this product & plan to buy more.
