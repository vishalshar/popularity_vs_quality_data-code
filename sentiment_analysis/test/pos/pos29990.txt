LOVE these bulbs! There are a few issues here and there with the software turning the lights on or off on schedule, but overall these are great! Can set the mood to whatever is needed after a long day at work, and makes watching movies more enjoyable with the lower color lighting. Simply changing the color of your room and greatly improve your mood we have noticed.
