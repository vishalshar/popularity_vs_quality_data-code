Dear prospective buyer of these Gardens in a Can,With basic care and following the directions, they grow easily.  Wonderful results.  Also good to support something trying to grow (company and plants.)Two issues with these:- Seed packet isn't obvious... it is there buried in the soil.  I easily could have just watered it without realizing.- How do I replant these?  I need some tin-snips or something to cut down the sides of the cans?Love the idea, and they've been yielding dividends.TY- Phil
