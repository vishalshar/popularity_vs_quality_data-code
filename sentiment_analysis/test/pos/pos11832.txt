It took me some time to figure how how best to install it for my needs in my chevy truck... however, when I did, it fit perfect.  Love this thing... a little unstable but not aggravatingly so.  My line of work has me off road from time to time and doesnt seem to bother me doing so.  You wont be disappointed.
