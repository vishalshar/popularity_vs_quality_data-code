For the last 15 years I've been battling flake-like psoriasis on my arms and legs.  The symptoms weren't horrible -- just mildly embarrassing, sore elbows,  and lots of dead skin.  I tried steroid prescriptions, light therapy, and mosturizers and had limited success.  I started experimenting with various creams and tried MetaDerm after reading an Amazon review.I applied MetaDerm to my forearms after a morning shower and within a couple weeks something good was happening.  After about 60 days my skin is perfect -- not even a hint of psoriasis.  I look at my skin now in disbelief.Note:  At the same time I started taking Vitamin D each morning as well.  I don't know if there's a correlation -- don't care -- but thanks to MetaDerm the symptoms have vanished.
