I'm giving this product a 4 stars instead of 5 because I haven't been able to use and test the USB 3.0 claim. I don't have any computers or laptops with USB 3.0. I also don't have any peripherals with USB 3.0.I received the product January 11, 2016 and I've been using it for a bit over 2 weeks. The product charges devices as promised. I have 2 iPads, 1 iPhone 6, 1 Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, 1 JBL Charge Bluetooth speaker, 1 Plantronics BackBeat Go 2 Bluetooth headphones, and 1 Logitech Performance MX wireless mouse. With all these devices and the bricks they come with, you can imagine how the surge protector looks like... a big mess!For the testing,  I have a DROK digital ampere voltage multimeter dual USB 2.0 meter hub and a Jelly Comb universal USB power multimeter. I used both of them to check the voltage and amp draw from the original bricks from my electronic devices. Then I used them on the Skiva OctoFire. The voltage and amp draw from the OctoFire is a bit lower than the original bricks for all my devices but still reasonable. I wasn't able to check all the ports on the OctoFire because I have only 2 testers but with all devices plugged into the OctoFire, I didn't see a drop in voltage or amperage on the devices I had them connected to my testers. I made sure to switch up the different devices to see if different devices would drop the power output but I didn't see any drops. I only had 7 devices, if I had 8, I would assume it wouldn't have dropped either. I guess the real test would be to have 8 iPads connected to the OctoFire and test it that way but in the real world no one would need to charge 8 iPads at once unless you had 7 other family members, friends or co-workers connecting to the OctoFire.The photo was taken with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, which is why it's not in the picture. The picture consists of all the devices and as well as the bricks that comes with the device. With the OctoFire I was able to eliminate 6 bricks.All in all, this was a purchase I didn't regret buying. It cleared up my surge protector and it does a decent job of charging all my devices. I'll update this review once I'm able to test the USB 3.0 claims. For now I'm just using it as a charger. Now only if we can get rid of the wires....... hmm.........
