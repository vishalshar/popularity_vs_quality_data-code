I've been using this camera for 2 weeks. Installation went smooth without using any cable other than power cord. The night vision is really clear and I like using the 2-way audio to communicate with my kids while I'm at work. The Smart Home feature is very unique and convenient as well. I don't have to look for the TV remote as I can just use my iPhone. Browsing through the app and controlling the camera is also easy. It's a great camera!
