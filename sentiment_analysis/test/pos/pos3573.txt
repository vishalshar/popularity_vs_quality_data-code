I agree with the post  "By Jericho on August 5, 2016" and add the following points"What I dislike:------------------1- Luma does not currently support any functionality for the USB port unless it is for charging your phone - really!! I will likely recognize your memory stick but you'd not know it because you cannot access it2- If you deploy more than 1 Luma, and sit next to one, you're good. But if you move towards another, there is no clear and seamless handoff for 10-15 minutes. So your signal is 30% right beside the other Luma... they said they would fix this in the "near future" - So currently not a 'TRUE' mesh network3- Admin cannot disable internet for a single device. Only for a Person with all his devices but also a "future" firmware upgrade!4- The App says all secure, but where - I see no evidence of a firewall or DoS filter anywhere5- There is only 1 guest network available6- Secondary Lumas drop off and rejoin the collective once in a while - even though I have them well within the recommended 35 ft line of sight range6- No fine control of the primary Luma via and Admin page (zero visibility into what luma is doing)What I like (a little bit):1- pause internet - ok this is for everyone not just the kids2- AC wifi seemed fast and comparable to a reputable AC router3- Potential for future updates (this could be +/-)4- small and unobtrusive packageAmendment September 12, 2016:I am updating my review of Luma from 2 to 3.5 (but 1/2 is not available, so 4) for the following reasons:1- As I got another set of 3, and the updated Luma firmware (inluding: Static DHCP Lease, Port Forwarding, UPnP Toggling and IGMP Snooping)2- had long discussions with Luma engineers and expressed my concerns reg USB port and others and was assured that More meaningful functionality is coming soon -  * specifically, flash/drive mounting  * MAC address based internet suspension ...etc3- Luma can work seamlessly as a repeater without much intervention4- The connection Handover situation only limited to Android devices (even though I saw with Mac too) - but nonetheless will be addressed shortly5- I am still looking forward to the 'Admin' page of the Luma OpenWRT for more visibility into Luma functions and options
