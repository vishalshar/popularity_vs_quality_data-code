Some early remarks: Very excited to be able to remotely control my irrigation zones. Nice looking product that feels like high quality. Some bullet points:1) I mounted outdoors with the outdoor enclosure. Some recommendations: use the screwdriver to push the wire clips down; I tried for too long to use a fingernail. (Still a little confused about whether the wires should point into the device, or go in parallel to the front plate; no documentation or online tutorial made that clear...) Make sure you have enough wire...I had to remount the box twice as my existing fixed wires needed a few extra inches to get up to the Rachio's connections, compared to the Hunter iCore being replaced.2) Web interface is required for me as there is no app for my Windows Phone. The web interface is not quite as snazzy as the App, and has a bit of trouble over AT&T 4G as well as slow WIFI, but is workable. The web interface seems to work much better on my Win10 laptop with Edge than on my phone's browser (Edge mobile)3) Going to need some time to understand the soil settings and other settings that the device offers. I find myself second-guessing the smart features. That said, when Rachio turned off zones during a scorching week, I used two different moisture sensors to check the soil; Rachio appeared right, assuming the desired moisture before watering is just about dry. So I will leave the smart features on, and invest some time on choosing the correct per-zone settings, and verifying, but going to give it a shot.4) Did I say how awesome it was to remotely control the sprinklers?
