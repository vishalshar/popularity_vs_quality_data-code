I am not a professional painter, but I am currently in the process of painting my fourth home interior top to bottom. I have gotten good enough that the quality of tools and paint I use now make a marked difference in my finished product. Needless to say I was really excited to try the Buddy Bucket.  It feels good in my hand when painting. I love the magnet for my paint brush. I did find I wanted to wipe the brush where the pour spout is located but after painting for a bit I got used to side wiping the brush. It does not drip down the sides which is really nice and a problem I have when I use "icing tubs". My brush did fall down into the paint once when I put the bucket down too forcefully. I felt like the Buddy Bucket washed up nicely with a hose and brush. I have very tall ceilings and a vaulted living room that I was not looking forward to trimming out, now I am excited!
