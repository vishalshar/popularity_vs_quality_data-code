These are pretty nice in that they do not require that I tie my shoe.  I needed them to be a bit looser on the foot and after finally resorting to reading the directions, the manufacturer suggests a variety of ways to thread them to make them looser or tighter.  after reading the directions, I love them.  I can make them looser over the injured parts of my feet.
