The price for smart plugs has come down over the past 12 months. We primarily use dlink for home cameras and the quality is great. Their smart plugs are no different, they pair quickly with our home wifi, they update when necessary and they are reliable. They also work great with Alexa, no issues controlling them once they're added to the "app" with a name. Great product.
