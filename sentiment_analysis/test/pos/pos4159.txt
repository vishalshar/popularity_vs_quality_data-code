I've recently got Vector Luna, and at first I was very impressed - the watch looks great, and worked pretty well (although reacted on every email coming to my phone regardless of the notification for Outlook mail settings). At that time I would've given it 4-5 stars. However, after the new Windows 10 app arrived, and the watch firmware got updated to v1.1, the watch has become a real nuisance. The watch started freezing randomly, and stayed frozen for hours until I press all buttons in various combinations (still not clear what exact combination of buttons brings the watch back to life); every time after such freeze I have to correct the time setting manually. Even when the watch is not freezing, it can randomly lose the link to the phone until I reboot them both. The watch may randomly drop some notifications even with the active link and such. Oh, and the watch also tends to reboot by itself from time to time (which probably is a good thing with the unstable Bluetooth link but still very annoying).I rebooted the watch numerous times and even did factory reset once - nothing helped. All in all, with the new firmware and new Windows 10 app the watch is now just a good looking piece of junk. I cannot rely on it anymore because of the random freezing and dropping notifications. I understand that I am not alone - many people have the same problem since update. Unless the company takes care of the faulty software pretty soon, the watch goes back...UPDATE 1: Following the support's advice, I reinstalled the WP10 app, and ran the pairing process again. It helped a little. The recent update of the app helped a bit more - the watch seems more stable now. However, it still freezes from time to time, and if I go away from the phone and Bluetooth connection gets broken, it does not always restore by itself when I come closer to the phone - I have to reboot either the phone or the watch. Anyway, the watch got better but still has way to go. One more star...UPDATE 2: It took WP10 Anniversary Update + a number of the Vector Watch (W10) updates + a couple of factory resets to get rid of the freezing & reboot issue. With the Vector app v1.7.1 the watch finally works around the clock (no pun intended), notifications do not fall into cracks, etc. Add one more star; would've given all 5 stars if the watch works like this right out of the box...
