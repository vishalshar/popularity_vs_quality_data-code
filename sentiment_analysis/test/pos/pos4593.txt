I am giving this 4 stars because of the veratility of the drone itself. Building the remote was a easy, understanding the programming part took some practice, but there are a lot of tutorials to go with this product. The coding is in C++, luckily I adapted pretty easily to coding, but I have also taken college courses in C++. The tutorials are very good for people without a coding background (explained the subject better than my intro C++ instructor). You can also use the petrone app on your phone if you are impatient to understand the coding and want to start flying immediately. There are a lot of cool features that go with the app as well (follow me mode). The battery does not last long at all, which is probably the biggest downfall, definitely buy more batteries if you commit to this project, otherwise you will be writing commands you want to execute in flight mode but have to wait for another charge.The drone disassembles very easily, I think it is a pretty sturdy drone for the price, and there are features you can add down the road like a camera or even wheels. I wish there was more description to make the controller more comfortable to hold, or even if a case was designed to give it a finished look.Overall I would recommend this product if you are willing to commit to learning the code. I bought this to build a better understanding on how transmitters are programmed and feel like this little project helped with achieving my goal. This is good for any age person interested in the "guts" of programming transmitters. I live in Ohio and wish they offered classes out this way, if I was in CA I would definitely check the classes out.
