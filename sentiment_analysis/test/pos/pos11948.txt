Works great. Fits my Samsung SIII.By the nature of a heat IR sensor, it lags quite a lot.You can set it to tell you the hottest and coldest thing in the image, or identify the temperature of the center of the image. Very handy for looking for hotspots. Electronics, home insulation or window and door leaks, etc.Only problem is my Nexus tablet has the microUSB facing the other way, so you can only use the screen as a viewfinder if you are taking a selfie. So I bought a microUSB extension cable.
