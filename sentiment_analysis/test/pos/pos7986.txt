Great camera strap! We use it on the Nikon D610, and my wife loves it. She's petite and the camera with a long lens is way too heavy. But the bungee style strap is perfect for her as it "carries" most of the weight. It's a bit bulky and thick, and barely fits inside our camera case with the camera. But I wouldn't use any other camera strap, and would certainly buy another if we buy another DSLR.
