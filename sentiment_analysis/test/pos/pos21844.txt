Good things come to those who wait! This slow drip coffee is just that.  Yet, it makes the smoothest cold coffee I have ever had!  When making it with cold water and ice, don't put it in the fridge as the ice won't melt.  I suggest doing some web searches to catch some tips on cold brewing coffee for grinding and so forth.  I did notice the packaging and the directions did indicate two different amounts of coffee to use.  I like a nice dark cup of coffee, so I made sure to wet the grounds and use a filter.  I can say that this is the smoothest, and tastiest cold coffee I have ever had.  I am so glad that I picked up this cold brewer....I just wish I could brew a gallon at a time (but then I would never dink anything else).  As a homebrewer of beer, I look to use the cold brew coffee in some of my stouts.
