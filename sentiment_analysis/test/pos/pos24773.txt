My wife and I are new first time parents, and are as anxious as any new parents that we're going to do something that will either be bad for our son or miss doing something that could have really helped him long term.  I read this book by John Medina, Brain Rules for Baby, where he says that for optimal brain development your baby should hear (from a live person) 2,100 words per hour so when a friend of mine mentioned the starling I got pretty excited.  How else would I know how many words we're speaking to the kid?  Who knows how important this stuff really is, but I'm a pretty data driven guy and there's certainly no harm.  We check our word count every couple days...so far so good.  Great idea Starling
