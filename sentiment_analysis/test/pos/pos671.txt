Great product...with a small learning curve. For example, the weights vary if on carpet vs hard surface, with or without the attachable feet. I decided to take mine off the carpet and keep it on the tile, and keep the carpet feet on the unit. It will slide, so take a deliberate step on it to prevent a fall. Also, I don't need a clinician approved unit, I'm not at the doctor's office. But it is reliable, and fairly consistent even if I take 2 measurements back to back it's right on. There may be a discrepancy from time to time, but if trying to lose weight take the trends into account more so than each individual day to see progress.
