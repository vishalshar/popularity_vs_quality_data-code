We really enjoy the Morning Pep Xylitol as a sugar substitute.  We started off with small increments because so many people said they had stomach upsets at first, fortunately we didn't have that problem and are now up to full serving.  We have used this in cooking and coffee and tea and although it's not as sweet as sugar to us, it's still a good alternative.
