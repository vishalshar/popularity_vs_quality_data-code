This should be a 5 star review, but quite a few things aren't addressed in the directions and sales info. First, if you are even slightly above average in bone structure, the band is a tight fit. Most unisex watches have bands at least nine inches long; I wish this was longer.  Second, the 20 minute charge to set up with the app didn't completely charge the tracker.  The tracker is totally charged when the light on the charge base quits blinking.  I also would like to know if the length of the neck chain ( if I chose to wear it that way) needs to be a certain length.  The illustration show the tracker worn in the hollow of the neck. Is this where it has to be worn?  And I figured out the blue bar in the top right when viewing on the app is the battery level.  Good to know.On to the plus... After three Fitbits, this is so much prettier!  I'm hoping it lasts longer than the Fitbits, which were "dead" before the warranty was up.  I've tried everything this promises to do. It performs great.  Mine is paired with an iPhone 6.All-in-all, this provides me with what I needed. I would recommend this product to friends who, like me, need motivation to keep moving.
