I've had this laptop for over a month now.  Agreed with most of other reviewers.  Light weight 4.4 lbs,  backlit keyboard, aluminum finish on top cover, I7 CPU, 8GB of DDR4, 512 GB SSD.  Screen is not IPS but matted and 1080P.I already upgraded the bios twice.  Just follow the steps in eManual.  You can find the eManual under  Start, All Apps, ASUS, eManual.  If you are not comfortable with bios upgrade,  don't do it.  As you may turn your laptop into a brick.Battery life is good. I got on average 5 hours of watching Hulu or Netflix.  Surfing the web maybe 6 hours.  Based on some battery experts' discussions,  they suggest not to completely drain or fully charge lithium battery.  They said do it between 40% - 80% will prolong the life of lithium battery.  I've been trying to do this. Hope the practice will make the battery lasts for years.I confirm that this laptop came with 1 stick of 8GB DDR4 by running CPU-Z (a free software you can download to monitor and show PC hardware components).  As shown in the Before Upgrade picture below, it is a single 8 GB DDR4 and the motherboard is running Single Channel with 15-15-15.Since I will be doing video editing with this laptop,  I started researching if it is possible to get another brand of 8 GB DDR4 stick to make it 16GB and Dual Channel.  The answer was as long as the DDR4 stick has the same specs even if it is different brand,  the motherboard should run as dual channel.  Some discussions from Tomshardware say for some memory intensive programs,  Dual Channel can have up to 20% increase in performance.Found this crucial DDR4 8 GB stick on Amazon:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015HQ9TGW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1Received the ram yesterday.  Installation was easy. Remove the 10 bottom screws.  Put them on the desk in the same layout ( a rectangle ) as you remove them since the screws are in 3 different sizes.  Use finger nail to gently ply open a little from back of the cover. Then open the rest with an old credit card.  Gently open the silver metal box.  Insert the ram.  Put the cover and screws back.Once boot up,  the laptop will recognize the new ram automatically.  No need to do anything.  CPU-Z now shows the motherboard is running Dual Channel with 16GB of ram as shown below in the After Upgrade picture.
