The first thing I want to point out is that this bottle has taken abuse.  I used it for months almost every day.  I've dropped it, kicked it, accidentally ran over it, and washed it many many times.  The bottle still has it's form and works perfectly.This is a great water bottle.  It's easy to clean, doesn't leak, the opening device is convenient (you can open and close it with your teeth), and it looks cool (in my opinion).  It's also flexible so you can squeeze water out of it.There are only 2 cons that I've found so far.This is superficial, but the black part that says "Clean Bottle" with the little rays and whatnot starts to fall off at day 1.  I know for some this is important but it doesn't affect the functionality.The other complaint is user error.  I made the mistake of putting some homemade iced coffee in it and forgot to clean it out immediately after.  So the next few days of biking the water from the bottle tasted like crap.  But like I said, user error so I don't hold that against it.
