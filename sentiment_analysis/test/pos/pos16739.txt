With a 6" (diagonal) display, the Posh Mobile Titan Max HD E600 is either a big phone or a small tablet, call it what you will. With my smallish hands, it's not very comfortable to hold the phablet against my ear for very long, so for me it's more like a small tablet with 4G capability. Having said that, I like the size of the display, and the large virtual keyboard is very easy to type on even in a vehicle on a bumpy road.After charging the removable 3000mAh battery with the included AC adapter (5V/1.0A), I connected with my home wi-fi, went through the short setup process, and installed a few apps that I use to check out a new phone or tablet. The phone came with about two dozen preinstalled apps. The next thing I did was insert a prepaid micro-SIM (15mm x 12mm) in one of the two SIM slots. Phone reception and texting were excellent over the T-Mobile system. I did not have a data plan, however, so I was unable to test the GPS over a 4G connection.I also inserted a 32 GB micro-SD card in the provided slot. I then went to the settings and made the SD card the default write disk. Right out of the box, the phone had just under 6 GB of available memory. This would be enough storage capacity for most people, but adding the SD card greatly increases the capacity for storing apps, books, music, and video.The phone came with 32-bit Android 4.4.2 ("KitKat") installed. One of the things I really like about Android is that when I signed into my Google account, my phone contacts and Chrome bookmarks synced and were available almost immediately. The phone uses most of the Android conventions, such as the power/volume down buttons to take a screenshot.The screen display is 1280x720 (320 dpi). That's the same resolution as my old Moto X, which had an excellent display. I watched some sports and a few videos, and the images had good contrast with rich, saturated colors. The viewing angle was not critical - in both portrait and landscape orientation, I could move to either side and the image was still good. Although the newer high-end smartphones have higher resolution, the Titan Max E600 has a very good IPS display that looks great. Playing videos on it, I honestly couldn't see any difference from the 2560x1440 resolution of my Samsung Galaxy S7.With a 3000mAh battery powering the operating system, background services, and the 6" (diagonal) display, I didn't know what to expect for battery life. I tested the battery by streaming full-screen video with audio, and the battery lasted for 5:50. For typical mixed use of phone calls, web browsing, reading, music, and apps, the battery will likely last much longer than that. Note that by default, a CPU power saving mode which limits maximum CPU performance is turned on. Afterward, I recharged the battery using the Posh AC adapter.The audio from the single speaker on the back of the phone isn't high fidelity by any means, but it's okay. The maximum volume is pretty loud, but as with most phones and small tablets that I've used, you may want to have an auxiliary speaker handy if the ambient noise is high. A set of decent earphones is included with the phone.The phone has Bluetooth connectivity. The phone paired easily and worked well with one of my Bluetooth speakers and with a Bluetooth keyboard. For non-Bluetooth speakers and headphones, the phone has a 3.5mm audio jack.The phone has front and rear cameras. The rear camera is 13.3 MP (4864x2736). The front camera is 5.3 MP (3072x1728). Both cameras can shoot video as well as still photos. Video is 640x480 at 24 fps in MPEG-4 format. The camera has the typical Android camera controls, including autofocus, face detection, and 4X manual zoom. The image quality and detail are very good.I used the AnTuTu Benchmark app to see how the phablet compared to other Android devices, and it scored 28,153. That's actually higher than my Moto X's score of 27,898, and the Moto X (2013 model) was a highly rated phone just a couple of years ago.Some random comments:* Gestures are supported.* NFC (Near Field Communication) is not supported.* Wireless charging is not supported.* The phablet has a feature called "HotKnot," but there are no instructions on how it's used. I looked it up and learned that it's a data and file transfer system that utilizes the physics of a capacitive touch screen so that the transmitting grid in the screen of one phone can interact with the receiving grid in a second phone when they are in close proximity (less than one centimeter). I watched a very cool YouTube demonstration. I would love to try it, but I don't have another phone with HotKnot.The phone comes as part of a complete package which includes an AC power adapter and USB charging cable, a set of earphones with microphone for hands-free calling, a screen protector, and a silicone "jelly" case that gives a good gripping surface and provides some protection for the phablet. One complaint is with the mice type of the user guide - I needed a magnifying glass to read it. It doesn't matter too much, however, since the guide isn't really needed by anyone who's ever owned an Android device.The bottom line: I like the phablet. It's fast enough for most purposes, it has an excellent 6-inch display, its cameras are quite good, and the battery life is excellent. It's one of the better sub-$100 unlocked Android phones that I've seen. My biggest negative comment is the Android 4.4.2 operating system. Android 4.2.2 was released more than 2Àù years ago, and it's getting a bit stale by now, lacking a lot of improvements and security features that have come out since then. This is the primary reason I gave the Titan Max E600 4 stars instead of 5 stars.The phone was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.
