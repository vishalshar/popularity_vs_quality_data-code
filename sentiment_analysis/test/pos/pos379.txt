Working great for over a week.  My installation is a bit different.  I am using it to activate a WEMO switch to turn on 100+ feet of LED cafe lights outside.  I have these in weather proof/resistant enclosures and have good outside WIFI due to an access point I have outside.  I had to drill a 1/2" hole in the enclosure for the motion sensor to work.  It can not sense anything through plastic or glass.  A plastic bag was successful during testing, but not how I wanted to install it.  For additional weather proofing, I used silicon on areas prone to water intrusion.  To link the sensor to the WEMO switch, I just used IFTT(If this then that website)  and a simple rule mated them well.(If motion detected, then turn on wemo)Works super.  Turns on lights as desired and sends IFTT alerts as well(though this is hit or miss it seems).Also, this set up is working with Alexa(amazon echo) so I can say, "Alexa, turn off cafe lights" and she goes to work.As a WIFI sensing device, I suppose the price is as expected, though I feel its more of a 20 something dollar device.
