I had a few issues initially  but the customer  service through  Kuna was fantastic  with helping  me wirk through  it during the first week. The lamp itself is very well made and elegant. The camera views are very clear and microphone  works well. The app could  use a little  work, kind of basic, however  I do like that I am able to speak through  the mic, sound an alarm and turn  the light on and off. Overall  this is an excellent  product  and I would  recommend this to anyone.
