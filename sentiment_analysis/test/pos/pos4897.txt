This is an incredible value compared to an industrial FLIR unit. I could see entire issuing these as standard a standard equipment for maintenance or engineering groups at industrial facilities--even if the only use is to flag trouble areas for someone to come back out and inspect with the $10k thermal camera.I am using this with a Samsung Galaxy S5 and because of the waterproof flap on the USB port, I sometimes have connectivity issues. It would be nice if the plug was slightly longer to accommodate more phone cases.  One major thing missing from the software is the ability to  extract data from the image after the fact (as of date of this review).  The software that comes with professional thermal cameras allows you to check temperatures throughout an image after the fact. As far as I can tell, you can only get the temperature at one or two points at the time the image is taken.
