These bags are, as everyone says, fantastic. I bought one for a cheese aficionado friend and one box for myself. She loves them. Me too. The cheese lasts weeks. I put whole, sliced, shredded and ground cheese in the bags and they stayed fresh. The bags are reusable. Just fold over once. To date I have only used a 3-4 bags. They hold up very well. There are 15 in a box. Very cost effective. I did discard 1 bag after more than a month or so as there was the teeniest amount of mold. I'm a kitchen gadget lover and these bags are by far one of my very favorite kitchen tools. And this is from a person that has at least 6/7avocado and 4-5 olive devices. Very fast delivery. Packaged well. I would say I would buy them  again but  I stll have plenty. They last a long time. I bought the box in December 2015.
