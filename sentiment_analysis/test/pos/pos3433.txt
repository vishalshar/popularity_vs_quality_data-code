I use three different types of this in my dogs homemade food and I believe it has helped me maintain their good health.  Their coats are shiny, they are active and happy little mini dachshunds at 9 years and 7 years old. They act like puppies.  One of them had a serious back injury a year ago and had to have surgery so I added the joint Superfood and she acts like nothing ever happened to her.  The vet said she would never walk the same again but apparently he forgot to tell her that-she actually walks, runs, and leaps a little too well! We wish she would calm down! Maybe Superfoods needs to come out with some doggy downersÂ…..just kidding
