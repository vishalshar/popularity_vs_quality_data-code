This thing is surprisingly fun. Once we had it set up, my wife waved her hand and it just sounded like magic. That didn't seem like enough, so we grabbed a toy wand that and waved it around. M a g i c a l. It's a really neat way to encourage play and finding ways to use the different sound effects.50% of the cool feeling in cartoons and shows like power rangers is from the sound effects, so having a sort of flexible/interchangeable way to do it with the Moff Band is fantastic.I'm currently trying to convince my wife to take it to her classroom and integrate it somehow.Really fun, really great, and looking forward to future apps that interact with it.
