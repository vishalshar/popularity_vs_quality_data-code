This is especially effective on eyebrows as the brush raises the natural arch whilst imparting perfect natural lookng colour with only one sweep. Lashes reqiure two or three coats but noticeably enhance appearance & give the wow factor if followed by mascara but for a daytime natural look isn't necessary. Definitely one to keep on hand!
