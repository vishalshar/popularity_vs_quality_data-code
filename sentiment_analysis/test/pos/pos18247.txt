They weren't lying when its the best gaming mouse. It just feels soo well in your grip and soo ergonomically made its hard to go back to old mice. I have had the Corsair M60 Vengeance for a while and it was my 2nd one after RMA, but I was open to getting a new mouse instead. You can see the size comparison in my photos.Pros:+ Very ergonomically made and fantastic for my mid to small hands. I hold my mouse weirdly, guess I'm a Hybrid between a Claw and Palm gripper and this mouse works wonders. Its made for Claw and Palm grippers in mind so it was perfect match. Though I heard its hard to Claw grip it if you have very large hands.+ Build quality is phenomenal and by far has the best packaging opposed to the plastic jail cell containers usual mice come in. My Corsair M60 Vengeance had a broken middle mouse button twice and it was 2nd one RMA and so far this mice has no problems so far. Its surprisingly lighter than M60 even with their weights off and I love the rubber grips on the side of the mice for better control, better than a sandpaper grip that degrades over time. The back and forward buttons are perfection in placement and ease of use.+ RGB Lighting is sleek and not too flashy, just the way I like it.Cons:- Wish there was a DPI indicator of sorts on the mouse or at-least in their software.
