I am ashamed to admit that this kit sat untouched on my table for over a week.  When I did attend to it I followed the very easy instructions and was rewarded with a lovely flush of mushrooms in just about a week.  They were delicious and I very much looked forward to resoaking my block and enjoying them again but time got away from me again and it ended up sitting in my sunroom until it was fully dehydrated from the heat.  Another week went by with me planning to toss it and try again with another kit.  Today, almost a month later, with total neglect, I noticed five huge mushrooms sprouted from the other side of the block!  I could not be more thrilled!  Just imagine what the yield could have been had I followed the instructions!
