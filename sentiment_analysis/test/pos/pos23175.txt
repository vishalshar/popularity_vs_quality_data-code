I purchased this for my 11 year old daughter after researching the different options on the market. I must say that I am blown away (and so is my daughter) by this product. The program has several easy to follow drills with the added bonus of tracking your shots. This gives my daughter an easy way to see where she needs to work. In addition, their is a strong community of user on the app that provides you with data about how you stack up to others in your age group. The biggest advantage is that it provides my daughter with additional motivation (and fun) to practice on her game. Since we purchased this she is averaging just over 100 shots a day. In a few short weeks it has not only helped her shot, but also increased her confidence on the court. Great product Shot Tracker!
