The set up was fairly easy over the internet. From reading some of these older reviews they appear to have improved their website. It was easy to register this device and add my sister and brother as users/contacts as well. It took about 20 minutes to activate once the process was started. My box contained the Splash, the battery charger cradle, and a key chain clip. It did not contain a lanyard. During the registration process I also enabled the monthly monitoring that includes fall detection and full replacement costs. When you order fall protection monitoring, they will send you a special lanyard. The website information and the Google app work well. On their website you can enter medical information so if the 5star people call or if they are called they will have access to any special medical conditions you want to make them aware of. I was able to download the app and within seconds I was able to locate the device. The manufacturer says it automatically tracks the device several times per hour but if a fall is detected or if an emergency call is placed then the GPS tracking tracks the device every 10 seconds. You can also manually refresh the GPS location at anytime using the website or app. The manufacturer says to leave the device powered on 24/7 and simply place it in the charging cradle when not needed. The unit itself is very light. I think it would be best to use it with a lanyard. Overall, I am impressed so far. I will update this review should anything change.
