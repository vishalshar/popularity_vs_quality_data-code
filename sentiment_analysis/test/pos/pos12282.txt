Ah mercy, I got some of these on the vine program once and my husband loved them so much that I am now having to order him more. He has a problem with his circulation and wears these to bed every night, plus pajama bottoms, plus a tshirt while under a Sherpa lined blanket. In the meantime I am having hot and cold flashes like crazy. How anyone can be that hot natured I don't know. I'm talking about him, not me. I have some of these socks myself (worn in the daytime like a normal person would) and they are the softest things ever. There is no stitching inside to get caught in your toes and wad up to make you uncomfortable all day. They are easy to wash and come out of dryer as soft as they went in. We've been wearing these kind for months now and they are so durable and comfortable that we can never go back to wearing any other socks ever again.  They come in a nice gift box and trust me, someone on your gift list would love to have them.
