Very pleasantly surprised by this product. I was skeptical of these "smart bottles" as tracking what you drink shouldn't be a difficult thing to do. However, I'm a gadget geek and researched into about 5 different bottles, finally landing on this from reviews and fact that the device is really just a base scale that can actually work with other bottles as well.The software is nicely designed, pairing went well, and once calibrated, is really accurate. I find that I look forward to my first log of the day, and the product seems to be helping me be even more cognizant of my intake, and distribution over the day, than I was before.Time will tell if accuracy remains intact, how long battery lasts (it did come with a spare, which is a nice touch), and if they are able to keep me engaged on my hydration. Looking forward to the friend integration coming soon. Great initial product overall.
