Great all around fitness bag. I bought one after the Apera Duffel proved a little too large for the lockers at my YMCA. This one fits better and carries everything with ease. It looks, feels and is holding up like a quality product. I recommend Apera's products because the ones I own are excellent.Check the size you need as they have another bag that is somewhat bigger and may suit your needs better.
