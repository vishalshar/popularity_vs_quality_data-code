MOOV Now Review Things I LOVE - the coaching & data! Wowza, the feedback about swim stroke & run cadence/impact is terrific. I can see this helping a lot to improve performance & fitness. The boxing! I'm going to have to buy another so I can do this part correctly (it requires 1 on each wrist). Did I mention the data!!! This is totally a geeks device. :-)The activity tracking seems pretty accurate. It records active time v. steps/miles. Actually, this is evidence-based, so I'm okay with it. It seems accurate regarding sleep too. This will fall into the Things I LIKE category.Things I'll Tolerate - manual syncing. This is the same as my Misfit, but the misfit gave feedback on the pebble. No way to set goals, no huge biggie for me. Doesn't integrate with any other apps (like MFP, etc). Again, not a game changer..Now...Things I HATE - The strap. WTF? So far, in 3 days, the pebble has popped out twice. This needs to be rectified, it's a really bad design!I haven't done the guided bodyweight workout yet, but I heart good things about it.
