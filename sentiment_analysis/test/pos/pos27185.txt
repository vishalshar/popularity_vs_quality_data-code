This thing is effing awesome! I don't know why I read complaints that it was difficult to set up, or had delayed response. I pulled it out of the box, hunted for batteries, and had TV, Roku, DVD player, Sound bar, and a second sound receiver set up in 15 minutes. I spent another 45 minutes to an hour creating my own all-in-one remote with macros ... All of this with minimal instructions. I have an iPhone. The fianc√© has a Galaxy. He was a bit more frustrated, but that was created more by his Anymote app having ads and in-app purchases. When he tried to purchase the app ($6.99) he couldn't remember his password. All of that culminated in irritation. LOLI still have to record a remote for the window AC, but I have to locate the plastic remote to do it since there isn't a preset one in the app. Those instructions look relatively simple too though, so I'm confident I won't have too much trouble.
