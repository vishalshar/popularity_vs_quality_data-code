Over all a great blue tooth speaker, battery life is amazing and works great for when I'm kayaking. Haven't been able to buy any of the extras such a bike mounts or anything but does seem like a great idea. Item work well for me because I'm not a fan of headphones. Only draw back is the power cord, it's the android style power cord and it's only about a foot long. Other than that seems to be a great product, had it a couple months now.
