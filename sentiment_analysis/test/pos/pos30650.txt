I selected this vitamin because I wanted an omega 3/vitamin D supplement for my kids.  I wish the kids would take my DHA/EPA capsules with algae instead of fish oil, but they cannot take the taste.  I did some research and am satisfied with the source of the fish oil (as well as the form of vitamin D) included in this product.  The label states that the supplement is made in California in a GMP-certified facility - which reassures me on the manufacturing procedures followed to make these gummies.Regarding taste, these are very sweet.  For the full dose (4 gummies), there is 5 grams of sugar, which I guess I can live with.  The kids look forward to taking these gummies, and remind me about taking them, so at least it is not a battle.The cost is more than the vitamin gummies sold at local big box stores, I go through 240 capsules a month for 2 kids, which adds up fast.  I do feel I am getting a quality product for my kids, so I will continue to purchase it.
