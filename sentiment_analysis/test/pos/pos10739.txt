This game is NOT for the easily offended, but is for people like my insane group of friends.  After watching a demo of this game, I knew I had to add it to the repertoire of party activities.  I sprung it on my game group during a party, and the fun didn't stop for about two hours. Everyone loved it right away, and the laughs never stopped.  I will say it's easier if you have a little floor space so you can act out certain cards. Don't play near breakables.
