This really is a fun machine with literally infinite possibilities. It is fun to sit and explore the tones that so many other folks have uploaded to the cloud then tweak them and make them your own by saving them to your iPad or to the amp itself.  The literature is lacking.  It took two trouble calls to Line6 to discover that the app was called "spider remote".  Then a third call to learn that the amp interface is not compatible with any 30-pin device. (iPad or iPhone).  How hard can it be to add compatibility with devices that most of us already own?  If you don't own a "lightning" device, don't bother downloading the app.  It will not work.
