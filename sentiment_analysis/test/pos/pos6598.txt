I just received victor for my 13 week old GSD and he absolutely love it.  I had him on blue wilderness and constantly had diarrhea which caused him to be underweight. His trainer suggested that I give Victor a try and so far so good.  I hope he continues to love this product as he do today on into his future. I can't wait for his next vet appointment to see how much weight he has gain.
