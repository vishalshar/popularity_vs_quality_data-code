Bought these wheels as a Christmas gift.  My 6th grade son loves them.  They are much faster and easier to control than his stock wheels that came with the board.  When I say they are faster, they are much faster, so make sure your kid wears a helmet.  Great for cruising around the neighborhood or park.
