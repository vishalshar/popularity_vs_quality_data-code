The CleverFit adjustable collar stays are my new accessory when dressing up. I wear dress shirts fairly often when going into the office or meeting with clients. I've found that the plastic ones included with my dress shirts tend to get lost in the laundry, are mismatched sizes and bend over time. In fact, I tested this today by buying a new shirt and the plastic collar stays were already slightly bent!I wanted to put the CleverFit metal collar stays to the test since they made the claim of being sturdy and adjustable.They come in a nicely made black plastic case with a snap closure and a contrasting blue inner holder for the 4 individual collar stays. The case keeps them securely in place for travel and this would easily pop in a suit pocket or luggage.I have dress shirts from various makers such as Brooks Brothers, J. Crew, Calvin Klein, Kirkland (Costco), etc... and they all seem to have different size collar stays. I've got spread collars, button down collars and forward point collars which add to the wide range of sizes necessary to wear my shirts properly. With this adjustable set of collar stays, now I don't have to worry about trying to pick through my ever-growing mismatched collection.These collar stays are great! They come well packaged, appear to be very durable, save a ton of time from having to sort through a myriad of collar stays and are easy to travel with. I highly recommend picking up a set of these if you wear dress shirts often.Video Review from my youtube channel: MiscTech
