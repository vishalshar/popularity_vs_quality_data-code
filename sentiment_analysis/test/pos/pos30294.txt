I am completely chuffed with this find. Appears very durable and robust: good quality. There is nothing else out there like this - I had it shipped to UK and it is worth every penny. Bought for our 1.5 year old when we had to move nursery (due to house move) and the new place doesn't provide lunch. I believe that it's really important for children, especially little ones, to have their main meal in the middle of the day so this is marvellous. Our son loves it and the staff were amazed by it. Thanks so very much to Omie and also to the Kickstarter people.  You've made me much happier with the lunch situation!
