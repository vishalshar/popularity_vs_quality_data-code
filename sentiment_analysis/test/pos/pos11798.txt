I've watched this on indigogo; the video, the testimonials and reviews from beta users (isn't that what you call test users??).  I have been very excited about it for a couple of reasons. Primarily, space saving.  Last year we went from being a suburban owner to sedan owner and the loss of space was sorely noticed when we tried to add an adult passenger to the backseat with our two kids, 13 and 8.  The enormous booster seat for our (very small) 8 year old was a space hog.  I was just about to order it from indigogo, and wait weeks for shipping when I saw it here on Amazon.  I don't know why, and I don't care, I'm just super glad it was.I have researched and I feel very confident that it meets all the safety requirements it boasts.Pros:~ It is small, just like I hoped, and takes up no more space than my child's actual butt.~ It is easy to move from one space to another, once you familiarize yourself with it.~ The colors are cool, we have the Lime Green and the Slate Grey.~ My son thinks it is super cool to use.  Once he practiced a few times, he can do it completely by himself.~ It is easy to take with you if you are going from one car to another.~ I can keep an extra in his backpack for times that carpool changes without losing too much valuable backpack space.Cons: (because even the best stuff has some)~ The shoulder strap is very long incase you have to adjust it for a super tall child.  The extra length does get in the way.  I haven't decided to cut it short just yet in case there is some reason I haven't thought of that it would still be valuable or necessary.~It folds up nicely, but it doesn't have any latch to keep it closed, so it will flop open if dropped or moved.~ That shoulder strap again, when you have folded it up for storage or transport the strap isn't anchored in any way.  I was thinking about attaching some kind of velcro or other attachment to secure it when being stored but haven't gone that far yet.Noteworthy: (Not a con, just some things to be aware of)~ The shoulder strap has to be adjusted to the specific height of the child so you will need to take a few minutes to do this if another child is going to be using it.~ There is a learning curve to using it.  Have some patience with yourself and practice.  Just leave the shoulder strap attached and the belt looped through one side all the time so your child only has to loop it to the other side and snap the buckle into place.~ Shoulder strap one more time (maybe I should have given it it's own section), it will fall to the seat, still clipped in place, when not in use because it is meant to slid and not grab onto the strap.  This means that your child will have to get used to pushing it up to slip their arm through so that the clip is over their shoulder before putting the belt into the other side of the seat and buckling.I hope you find this review helpful!I have [tried to link] a video to show these things because words aren't always sufficient. Looks like my file is too large to upload and amazon will not allow me to insert a youtube link.  You can search 'my review of mifold carseat' and find my link.  https://youtu.be/lQumai7NLms
