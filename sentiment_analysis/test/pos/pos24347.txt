I really like this system and can't wait to purchase more units.  The switches don't work with the Hyperikon LED lights. They have a loud hum (buzzing noise) to the lights.  It's important to try and get the bulbs that are listed to work with the switches.This appears to be a common problem.The switches really rock and work with Apple home kit.  I can turn on/off my lights with my Apple watch, phone and iPad.  It even is easily programed to come on when you get close to your home.
