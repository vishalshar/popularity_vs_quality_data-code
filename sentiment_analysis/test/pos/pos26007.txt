After spending days reading reviews on portable speakers, I decided to go with the Fugoo Tough.  While other speakers tempted me, the one thing that I just couldn't overlook was the battery life and the ruggedness of the speaker.  There may be other speakers out there that sound a bit better or get louder, but 40 hours of battery life and not being concerned if the speakers gets wet or covered in sand at the beach was something that ultimately sold me.The only thing that I wish it did better was get louder.  I downloaded the update, but two things I don't like about it.  One, it tends to distort at high volumes and in order to get the higher volume, you have to turn the speaker off to enter the "Loud Mode".  However, the reality is that I hardly ever care to play my speaker very loud.  Therefore, it's not really that big of a deal.  For my needs, the level of sound is fine.  It's just one of those things that you would rather have a bit more than you need just in case.The thing that is absolutely terrific about this speaker is that I don't have to pack extra batteries (for those speakers that take them) or the ac adapter when I go on a trip because I know I will have plenty of battery life.  I went on a 10 day vacation last week and when I returned, it still had 3/4 battery life.  I also had it out in the rain one day.  The only thing tricky about that is my audio source (iphone) is not waterproof so I have to keep it protected.  Another day I had my fuggo tough sitting on the sand.  By the end of the day, it had a lot of sand all over it.  No biggie... when I got back to the hotel, I simply rinsed it off with water and it was good to go.Pros:Battery life (amazing)Ruggedness (water, sand, drop it, etc.)Battery indicator (no more guessing how much is left)Connects quickly to whatever device is closest to itCons:Volume (probably don't need it louder but it would be nice just in case)Overall:I am sort of torn between 4 and 5 stars.  If I could give it 4 1/2, that's what I would give.  However, choosing between the two, I've got to give it 4 because it's not perfect (loudness issue) even though it meets most of my needs.
