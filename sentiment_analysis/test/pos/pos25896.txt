OK folks... I've been playing the guitar for a lot of years and decided to pick up one of these Line 6 amps to add some flexibility to configuration (via the iPad / iPhone app). Well, it works very well -- although if you have an older iPad you may find that the app is a bit too demanding for the iPad).  The sound is really very good to excellent.  Would work well for a smaller venue but excels for a practice amp -- a ton of flexibility to play along, try different tones.  AND, on the Bluetooth speaker front, this is hands down the very best audio I've heard from a "Bluetooth speaker" system -- although this is really a lot more than just that. Line 6 has a rich history of innovation in web / cloud based interactions and this amp si one of the products that really benefits from that. The hardware is solid and the software (mobile app) seems to work well.  Highly recommend.
