I am a male. I LOVE this product. I use to wear Neutrogena lash tint, the one in the purple/blue tube that has sadly been discontinued. I have searched for a subtle and totally natural looking eye lash product and this is it. I've tried so many other products and none have been natural enough. I also use it on my eye brows. No one can tell I'm wearing makeup but I do get compliments on how my eyes look when I wear this. If you want the effect that mascara provides where the lashes look fake, goopy, spidery this is not for you.
