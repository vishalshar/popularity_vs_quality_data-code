This is an amazing tool. I've been using it for more than a month to take my notes at work, build documents, make comments on pdf or just whiteboarding. I am not using it with its native app, but with Noteshelf. I bought it to replace my notebooks with my ipad. It's incredible, integrates easily with noteshelf, the battery life is long and the shape and form of the stylus is adjusted perfectly.
