I was talked into getting a microwave, but if I have to have one eating up my counterspace, this is a good compromise! The red is on the candy apple side. The size isn't too hulking. The noise is minimal. My only issue is the touchpad panel. The black plastic overlay already has a deep scratch after about a month of occasional use - something to keep in mind if you're considering this for a household that's big on popping things into the microwave daily. Overall, we're pleased with our purchase.
