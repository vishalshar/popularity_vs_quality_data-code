have the device for 10 days now, and this thing is too coolWhen I got the device, I wanted at first to place it on top of my TV, but the power cord is about 5 feet, which was too short for me, so I ended up placing it on my media stand. I guess I can look for another power supply or extension cord, but I actually like its current location now.Installation was pretty straight forward  I have an Android phone so I got the app on Google Play, and simply followed the instructions screen by screen. The device had my LG TV on the list, as well as my Xtreamer. It didnt have my receiver, which was a downer, but I reached out to the company and learned receiver support is coming in several weeks through a software update.The installation ended up with a couple of videos I found helpful, teaching how to perform the gestures. While they are easy to perform and seem straight forward, they have some videos showing what to avoid, which made control smoother. I was pleasantly surprised by the small gestures  its a lot easier and more accurate than my experience with the Kinect.Despite some functionality missing, I enjoy what I do have, and am looking forward to receiving the next update.
