Mevo is a great tool to communicate with the client, specially if one the parties cannot attend to meetings. In my line of work (Architecture) it's crucial to go to the construction site and check the daily progress. I bought Mevo to check out if it could help us make our time more efficient, and it has being working out great so far. The client can live stream the daily progress through Facebook without any need to waste their time by showing at the site, any time he wants. The live editing feature has had a positive review with the clients. I can zoom and pan without the need to move the camera (quite impressive). That way I can take a shot of one specific place and send it to the client. The communication has being improving ever since.I am not in the filming business but I've found some good use to it. The image quality is good, can't complain with a camera this size and this cheap. The zoom allows to show details without any blurriness.BONUS: Some of my relatives will not be able to come for the holidays. I'm planning to use Mevo and live stream my Xmas dinner through Facebook so they can feel a little bit closer to home.
