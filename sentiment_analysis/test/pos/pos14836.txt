Other than having to pay 10 bucks a month for this, I think it's a good idea ? but at least it uses America's best network in Verizon unlike some others that use the 3rd place T-mobile which has horrible coverage and would never ever ever trust T-mobile with tracking my dog and you shouldn't either!! I read and researched these a lot and it seems the bad reviews are from people that had the old ones and transitioned into the new company, I can say I have have not had any problems, the battery last a long time, when I leave the house with the dogs about 3 minutes later I get text messages, when I went to the vet it showed on a map where my dog was, I would like a slightly better map however but it's not terrible. The thing is, it's a "peace of mind" investment, can you imagine your dog getting gone and not having anything at all to find them, at least with this I have a better chance at finding them, I have 2, you can get better monthly deals if you pay in advance for the coverage but not knowing how it would work I just did the month to month! Funny thing, my vet had never heard of them, but they have now. The chip is limited in that you have to hope that someone who finds your dog actually takes your lost animal somewhere to have the dog scanned, I'm not going to wait on that so I use this, I can say this, "it's better than nothing".  For the collar, I initially had issues but it was my own stupid fault, rear the instructions is all I'll say. It's not hard, snaps right in once you get the hard plastic and rubber bands on, not a huge deal there, it's all pretty easy, I feel better with my dog having it on. The app is fine, just play with it and get to know it, play around with it, track the dog  with it, "refresh".... Like I said, it's around 10 bucks a month using America's most covered network in the US with Verizon, not some cheap carrier in T-mobile that doesn't cover jack but cities and even that sucks inside buildings.
