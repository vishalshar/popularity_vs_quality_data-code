Ive had this speaker now for a week and cant say enough about it. The tone is deep and rich, nice clear lows, highs, and mid-range, with a space filling, 360-degree sound popping out of both sides of the speaker.  For the price its un-matched. I put it hanging on our balcony and the sound just filled the area beautifully. I take it in on backpack while cycling and have a great soundtrack for the ride.  Its got a nice simple interface, slick simple handles that can attached and fill a wide variety of mounting situations.
