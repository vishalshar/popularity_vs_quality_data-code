Formerly used the Whistle activity tracker which I liked a lot. It was great to be able to see how active my dogs were over the course of the day and use that as a way to get them more active and also know when my older dog needed a rest. But I wanted an integrated unit so I could tell where my dogs were. We have one escape artist and even though we have a large fenced AND invisible fenced area, sometimes the lure of small mammals or garbage kicks in and she bolts. Rather than drive aimlessly around our urban area looking for her it's great to know when she leaves the designated zone and get an alert before she's gone too far, plus be able to get a read on approximate location. The device was easy to set up and the app works as billed. It's also good to know when our housesitter actually takes our dogs for a walk vs. says they will be walked. So all in all really pleased with the functionality of this device. Over time would like to see some improvements like more frequent pinpointing of location, a map of trail generated by activity, and bringing back intensity of activity display. Can't wait for future versions but happy with this one!!
