WeMo Switch InstallationI live in a dark rural area and prefer to keep my home well illuminated after dark. For the past 31 years my daily routine has been to turn the outside lights on at sunset and off again at sunrise. Sounds easy except there's one switch on the main floor, two in the basement and one in my garage. One of these switches is for two outdoor outlets that I use for floods lights and holiday lighting. On occasion I would get up later than usual, miss one or two switches because of a distraction or just wasn't at home. It was time to start thinking about the home automation concept.After extensive research I chose Belkin WeMo because of the favorable reviews on Amazon and my own favorable experiences with other Belkin products. The wired switches are designed for the DIY types like me. I had my first light switch wired and functioning in about 20 minutes. The second one in 15 minutes. I was so satisfied with the concept and functionality and the ease of installation until I wanted more so I bought two more light switches and two outlet switches for a grand-total of 6 WeMo devices. Now I can control all my outdoor lighting, with set on and off times, including a couple of indoor lamps and my garage electric heater with my iPhone and iPad from anywhere at anytime.The WeMo App takes a bit of learning and I've had a few mysterious on and off occurrences that have disappeared at the moment. I also should add that a few years ago I upgraded my router from the standard free one provided by my IP provider to a more reliable and secure one that I purchased myself. I mentioned that because there are so many factors that could result in problems unrelated to the switches or the app. Otherwise, a good router, a good mobile device with good reception and the elimination of as much interference as possible should result in none to fewer problems. Think quality! I'm glad I did because I currently have about 20 WiFi devices in by home hogging up my router.Personal Idea: Stuffing your light switch with wires in a single or double gang outlet box can be somewhat difficult, more so if your circuit is wired with 12/2 and double ganged. To cut down on my own stress and frustration I decided to used a non-metallic surface mount outlet box commonly used for surface wiring. Perhaps also by surface mounting interference will be minimal or could be virtually eliminated remembering that no metal face plates are allowed. The box comes with a plate with a knockout rectangular center. You attach the plate to the existing holes of your in-the-wall gang box. You'll see the holes after you remove your old light switch. Snap the 1 3/4 - 2" deep cover on the plate and you're ready start wiring and stuffing with less hassle. The holes in the cover lineup perfectly with the WeMo Light switch.The finished job gives your switch a bit of a commercial look but I don't care about that because I like the fact that it makes it standout giving it a questionable look like ask before touching. Less play from curiosity seekers. Also the plastic boxes are rather cheap from most home supply places and probably Amazon too.
