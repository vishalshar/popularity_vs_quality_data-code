I absolutely love the Leaf Nature! I wish I had thought of this device.  This is far cuter and more subtle than sporting the telltale plastic of a Fitbit. Instead of buying jewelry to cover-up your FitBit [or whatever you have] you can just buy the Bellabeat Leaf and you've got both together.It is made of a very high-quality but do not get it wet. No, it's not a Gremlin, but it isn't waterproof, so heads up there.BellaBeat also has a newer model, the Leaf Urban...you can check it out here [...]...I don't think the "Leaf Urban" is on Amazon yet.
