I've had this phone about a month now, and I love it!  It is by far one of the easiest phones I've ever used.  It does not come preloaded with a bunch of games and apps I'll never use, and I can find everything I want in the Google Play Store.  The features the phone does have are very efficient and functional.  There's not really anything that I would think of as wasted space.  I'm not much of a tech kind of person.  I want to take it out of the box and be able to use it without a lot of fuss, so all these things were very important to me.  I love the idea of the phone archiving things for me that I don't use much and never have to worry about running out of storage.  The camera works great.  I've taken some beautiful video at my kids' Christmas concerts, and my teenage son was quite impressed with the quality of the speakers when we were listening to the playback.  All in all, I'd say this phone is an amazing deal.
