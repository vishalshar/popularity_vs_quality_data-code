Love how thin it is and how the charger works to charge both the phone and the case. It's working great!  One drawback is that I had to buy a new, longer aux cord adapter because the case caused my regular aux cord not to reach without taking off the case. That cost me $8.49 but since the case is so awesome, I sound it's worth it.
