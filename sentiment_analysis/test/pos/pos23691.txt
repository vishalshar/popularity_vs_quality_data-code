Its CPU and graphics processing aren't as fast as the S7, and the screen resolution is lower, but as a practical matter, in many ways, it's comparable to the S7, which costs several times as much.After charging the removable 2000mAh battery with the included AC adapter (5V/1.0A), I connected with my home wi-fi, went through the setup, and installed a few apps that I use to check out a new phone or tablet. The phone comes with about two dozen preinstalled apps. The next thing I did was insert a prepaid micro-SIM (15mm x 12mm) in one of the two SIM slots. Phone reception and texting were excellent over the T-Mobile system. I did not have a data plan, however, so I was unable to test the GPS over a roaming 4G connection.I also inserted a 32 GB micro-SD card in the provided slot. I then went to the settings and made the SD card the default write disk. Right out of the box, the phone had a little over 4 GB of available memory. This would be enough for many people, but adding the SD card greatly increases the capacity for storing apps, books, music, and video.The phone came with Android 6.0 ("Marshmallow") installed. One of the things I really like about Android is that when I signed into my Google account, my phone contacts and Chrome bookmarks synced and were available almost immediately. The phone uses most of the Android conventions, such as the power/volume down buttons to take a screenshot.The screen display is 1280x720 (320 dpi). That's the same resolution as my old Moto X, and it had an excellent display. I watched some sports and a few videos, and the images had good contrast with rich, saturated colors. The viewing angle was not critical - in both portrait and landscape orientation, I could move to either side and the image was still good. Although the newer high-end smartphones have higher resolution, the Kick Pro LTE L520 has a very good IPS display that looks great. Playing videos on it, I honestly couldn't see any difference from the 2560x1440 resolution of my Galaxy S7.With a 2000mAh battery powering the operating system, background services, and the 5" (diagonal) display, I didn't expect great battery life, but  I was pleasantly surprised. I tested the battery by streaming full-screen video with audio, and the battery lasted for 4:40. For typical mixed use of phone calls, web browsing, reading, music, and apps, the battery will likely last much longer than that. Afterward, I recharged the battery using the Posh AC adapter.The audio from the twin speakers on the back of the phone isn't high fidelity, but it's not bad either. The maximum volume is pretty loud, but as with most phones and small tablets that I've used, you may want to have an auxiliary speaker handy if the ambient noise is high. A set of decent earphones is included with the phone.The phone has Bluetooth connectivity. The phone paired easily and worked well with one of my Bluetooth speakers and with a Bluetooth keyboard. For non-Bluetooth speakers and headphones, the phone has a 3.5mm audio jack.The phone has front and rear cameras. The rear camera is 8.3 MP (3840x2160). The front camera is 5.3 MP (3072x1728). Both cameras can shoot video as well as still photos. Video is 640x480 at 24 fps in MPEG-4 format. The camera has the typical Android camera controls, including autofocus, face detection, and 4X manual zoom. I was very pleased with the quality of the images. The detail the camera captures is very good, and it will focus very close (approximately 5-6 inches) without using an auxiliary lens.I used the AnTuTu Benchmark app to see how the phone compared to other Android phones, and it scored 24,284. That's almost as high as my Moto X's score of 27,898, and the Moto X (2013 model) was a highly rated phone just a couple of years ago.The phone comes as part of a complete package which includes an AC power adapter and USB charging cable, a set of earphones with microphone for hands-free calling, a screen protector, and a silicone "jelly" case that gives a good gripping surface and provides a moderate amount of protection for the phone. My only complaint is with the mice type of the user guide - I needed a magnifying glass to read it. It doesn't matter much, however, since the guide isn't really needed by anyone who's ever owned an Android device.A couple of random comments:* The phone does not have NFC (Near Field Communication).* The phone does not support wireless charging.The bottom line: I like the phone. It's fast enough for most purposes, it has a superb 5-inch display, its cameras are very good, and the battery life is good. It's one of the best sub-$100 unlocked Android phones that I've used.The phone was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.
