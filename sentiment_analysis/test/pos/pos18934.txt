I ordered this as a Christmas present for my 8 year old son. The first one did not work, so I got a replacement. The second one also appeared not to work at first, but I tapped on the battery pack and it started working. I think the connection between the battery pack and the robot is finicky and the battery pack needs to be very tighlty secured. So why the 5 stars? Two reasons - when the second robot appeared not to work, I contacted WowWee tech support directly. They were very responsive and communicative. I feel reassured that if anything goes wrong in the future, they will take care me. I also learned from them that it is ok to recharge the battery pack while it is still screwed into the MiP as longs as the power is set to off, which will save the hassle of unscrewing it each time per the instructions. The second reason I gave 5 stars is the MiP is so much fun! My son loves him. He uses both apps: the original for driving the MiP around and the new coder app for creating routines and more complex series of actions. I think MiP will provide fun and learning for many months yet to come.
