I was skeptical at first because this stuff seems a bit brittle off of the roll but once it's extruded, it's solid as a rock. This is the by far the best filament I've printed with. I'm not one of those dudes that has printed with a thousand different types of filament. I'm more interested in functional parts as opposed to exotic designs. I needed something strong and functional.  This does both plus it's finish looks like a flat black textured surface. What really surprised me is how amazingly smooth my prints came out with this. I'm talking zero flaws and it blends together really well between layers so stuff doesn't even look like it's 3D Printed.
