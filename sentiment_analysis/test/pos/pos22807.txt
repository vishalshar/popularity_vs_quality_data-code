This is something that we have seen over the years but never bought.  As my husband started a second career after retiring from his first I bought this as a gift for him.  We have some old LP's we hung onto for sentimental reasons but as technology came into the game they were put aside and we went on to follow the up to date modern and space saving conveniences of CD's.  My husband researched these type products on Amazon and decided on this brand after reading reviews.  Anxiously awaiting the possibility of hearing our old LP's we were disappointed in receiving a torn up box and the CD's we ordered with it to copy to were scattered all over the bottom of this shipping box.  Undaunted my husband set up the music center and found the turntable damaged as well.  He called Amazon which were helpful in trying to find a solution but when they couldn't and without any argument they emailed us a return label and told us we would have a new one on Monday, we spoke to them on Saturday.  We were thrilled at the excellent customer service of Amazon.  On Monday we received the new music center which works perfectly!  We have started recording to CD's which it does very well except my husband has to manually do each track which was one of the downsides he read about.  However, the CD's sound just like the records and we are thrilled.  We now take one day a week and record an album.  It is like dating all over again as we hear the groups we listened to while on a date and the song that became "our song" and so much more.  We have been happily married for 44 (soon to be 45) years and totally love this music center. It was larger than what I thought it would be but if found a home on our glassed storage center and is lovely to look at.  We laughed when we had to flip the switch on (how retro) and manually place the needle on the record.  What memories it brings back.  For those individuals looking for CD quality with great bass, treble, etc this is not for you as you can not set those things. We found we can adjust that on a CD player but not to the CD.  We love the back in time feel and look of this music center not to mention all the memories that come flooding back when we hear a song!  Amazing customer service by an amazing company, Amazon, and an amazing product.  We highly recommend this for all the "young lovers" of days gone by.**UPDATE** We have been recording to CD's for a while now and still find this machine a wonderful purchase. I now can listen to several of my albums on CD's and I love hearing them in the car.  We have not had any issues with the machine or the functions we purchased it for. The CD's come out clear or as clear as our albums.  Some of our albums are 44 years old so we don't expect the CD's to magically make the albums sound perfect.  Again you can't do treble or anything while recording but for us it doesn't matter but what does matters is the way we are transported back in time whenever we hear our songs.  I highly recommend this to anyone.  Great purchase for us.
