I'm very happy with my Spire.  That data is quick and concise, and I like that it will notify me if I'm not breathing or if I'm tense, which were my two biggest concerns.  I was concerned however, because it was discharging every 3-4 days, rather than the week that was stated for battery life.  I contacted Spire's Customer service via email, I got a very quick response and they figured out within a day, that my Spire was malfunctioning.  They sent me a replacement within a week's time and provided a return label for the defective unit.  I don't think they could have handled it any better.  Great product and great service!
