I had bought 3 of these guys, 2 have die, one died 2 minutes after operation.  Amazon was great about sending me another one but the second that is not working due to a bad adapter, I have to go find an adapter since Oco will not send me out a replacement adapter.  I would not recommend this product because the quality of the of the product is bad and support for Oco is pretty much non existent.  The adapter that comes with is faulty, it either fries the camera or stops working.The funny part is when I contacted Oco, the first trouble shooting steps revolved around using a different adapter/usb cable to see if the camera starts up again so seems to me they know they have faulty parts.  They're just unwilling to help the consumer out.**UPDATE**So, I was contacted by the CEO and he made it right by sending me a new camera.  4 stars for making me happy.
