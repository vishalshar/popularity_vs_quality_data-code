Love love love. Obsessed with tinting my lashes, not so obsessed with paying to get them done twice a month. Helps with gaps between tinting, and works on its own as well. So easy to put on quickly before bed, especially if you're previously already putting serum on your brows or lashes like me. Will continue to replenish, great product.
