Easy set-up within 30 minutes with a lot of medical information to provide to Great Call about my mother, it worked beautifully.  We have tested it and it's fast and responsive.  We bought the $34.99 that detects falls and that's a great relief.  I gave Great Call three family members numbers to call when it's not an emergency (however they will contact all of us when she calls for an emergency).  It reassuring to know all she has to do is push a button to get a "live" person on the device to help her immediately.  A great feature is that I got the "Splash" which is waterproof and she can wear it when bathing.This can also be a great benefit for people who hike or walk for exercise and may come across something odd or suspicious to get help with because it has a built in GPS that locates you immediately, and you can call them and tell them you "issue" or if you are afraid.  Also, the encourage you to call even if you locked yourself out of your house!  You can contact them for anything.  It's really the best and you don't need a landline.  I highly recommend this product.
