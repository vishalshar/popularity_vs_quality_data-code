After having had an anaphylactic allergic reaction to a name brand cinnamon bear snack, and other graham snacks not being manufactured in safe facilities, my peanut allergic son was without a cinnamon graham snack.  So glad we found out about Skeeter Cinnamon Grahams.  These little cookies taste better than any other commercially made graham cookie we have ever tasted.  Also, they are a perfect small snack size for toddlers to hold on to and snack on.  We have sent them in to my son's school so that they can be a part of his regular safe snack rotation. :)We cannot seem to find these locally.  So glad that we found them on amazon.  They arrived in perfect condition.
