I have very sensitive skin that's easily irritated by many of the compounds used in a lot of name-brand soaps, even the ones that claim to be gentle. Marie Ernst offers me a completely hypoallergenic bar soap that I can use on my hands, body, AND face, a concept I nearly forgot existed until I tried this bar. This is how every soap should be. I can trust Marie Ernst to deliver a consistent, caring wash that rejuvenates my skin and doesn't dry me out.I keep a Patchouli Lavendula bar in the shower for a nice calming rinse before bed, and a Lemon Beebrush by the kitchen sink to give the area a wonderfully fresh smell, and give my hands a well-deserved rest from dirty dishes and household chores.Highly recommended!
