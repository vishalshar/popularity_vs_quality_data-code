After reading many reviews and looking at just about every product available, I decided on the Quad Lock, and am very pleased so far. I wanted something that I could use on both my road and mountain bikes, so my primary concern was how secure the mount was. I have yet to use it on the mountain bike, but on the road bike this mount is rock solid. Easy to install, easy to mount and seems like it won't be going anywhere. There is no wobble or play at all, so I am hopeful that I will be equally pleased when I test on the trails.
