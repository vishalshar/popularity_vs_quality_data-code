Where did Fugoo come from?!! Forget about the Bose, UE, or Jawbone. This is definitely the new top dog in portable speakers, especially if you want to actually go anywhere interesting with your portable speaker.I bought the Fugoo "Style" directly from Fugoo's website a couple of weeks back after reading all of the positive press from CES. After receiving the Style speaker, I was so impressed that I pre-ordered from Amazon a second Fugoo speaker, this time the "Sport" model. The two models are nearly the same, except the Sport is even more rugged than the Style.Here's what I'm loving about the Fugoo Sport:Sound quality -- This little speaker blew me away. Not only does it play clean and loud, but the sound is ACCURATE! The other guys (I'm pointing the finger at you, Bose!) artificially over-emphasize the bass sounds, which might sound OK at first, but really results in a lot of songs not sounding right at all. The Fugoo performs a much more difficult acoustic feat: providing great bass without making it sound boomy and fake. Very much appreciated by this audiophile.Durability -- I can't emphasize this enough: the waterproof/durable design of the Fugoo truly set this speaker apart from the others. After all, what's the point of a battery-powered portable speaker if you can't take it places without damaging it? I was able to drop the Fugoo in the sand at the beach, toss the Fugoo into a duffle bag with sporting gear for a day at the park, and bring it into the shower, all without any problems. Last fall I bought my daughter a Jambox to take to college, and after a few weeks, it was so banged up from being carried in her backpack with her books that it simply stopped working. The Fugoo looks tough enough to survive getting drop-kicked by the rugby team.Battery Life -- I didn't realize how important long battery life was until I started taking my speaker with me on day trips: to the beach, the park, hiking, and so on. The Fugoo battery blew me away by lasting all day long. Combining durability with a super-long battery life opens up all kinds of new possibilities for me... They claim a 30-hour battery life. I wonder if it could handle a full weekend-long camping trip? I'll have to give it a try.360-degree sound -- Somehow Fugoo have figured out how to make the speaker sound equally good in any direction; back, front, side, wherever. This turns out to be a really useful quality of the speaker, since you can put it in the middle of a group of people, and they all will hear good sound.I also love the accessories, and plan to buy the strap mount (strap it to a tree, a pole, a backpack, whatever) and waterproof remote control. The bike mount also could be a lot of fun.BOTTOM LINE: Fugoo, you've just made a new fan. I love every obviously-carefully-thought-through detail you put into this speaker, and I know what I'll be recommending from here on to all my friends.
