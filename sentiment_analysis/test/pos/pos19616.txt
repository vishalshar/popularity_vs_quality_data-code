We are absolutely thrilled with the Feed and Go auto pet feeder.  We work long days and because our cats are gluttons, we can't just leave out food all the time.  Feed and Go to the rescue!  With this awesome auto pet feeder, we load up the tray the night before with wet food and program automatic feeding times on the Feed and Go website.  We get a text message when the auto feeder feeds a meal and we can even go online to see our kitties eating with the webcam in the feeder.At first, our cats were a little scared of the pet feeder because it was something weird and the motor sound is a little jarring.  But after a day or so- they've come to love it and run to it whenever they hear it go off now.  One of our cats even sits in front of it waiting for food to come.  And it has also become super handy when we go out of town.  Because now instead of having a pet sitter come twice a day- they can just come once to fill up the pet feeder and scoop litter.  It has really saved us a lot of money!I've had a couple of problems with it- but when I've contacted their customer service thru their website I've gotten incredibly fast responses- both times from Alex, the creator of the product himself!  He is super friendly and helpful.  He really cares about his customers and his product.Give Feed and Go a try.  Your pets will thank you for it. :)
