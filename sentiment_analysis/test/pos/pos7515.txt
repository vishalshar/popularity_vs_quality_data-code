LOVE THESE!  A few months ago, I purchased a pair of these remodeez Footwear Deodorizers along with a more traditional pair of shoe charcoal odor removers to compare how each worked with my 2 sons' basketball shoes.  Typically, their shoes smell so badly I have to cover my nose before getting close.  The smell is so bad that my boys were very religious about putting them inside their shoes nightly.  The "regular" charcoal odor removers (the kind in the nice burlap that you can hang in the closet or put in your shoes) controlled some of the odor but the remodeez Footwear Deodorizers left the shoes with no odor whatsoever!  Absolutely amazing.  Over the years I have tried numerous sprays, deodorizers, shoe balls, charcoal products, etc.  None have worked this well.I am so happy with the green remodeez Footwear Deodorizers that I bought 2 more pair and 2 pair of the purple remodeez On-the-Go Deodorizers (for inside their basketball bags).  Definitely worth the price!
