I purchased this phone almost 3 months ago and love it! I am coming from a Galaxy Note 3 that was quitting on me after 3+ years of usage. I really like the size of the Nextbit. Going down on size from my previous phone I think this is the perfect size for a phone that easily fits in my pocket. In my opinion the camera is pretty awesome and I've taken some very nice photos with this phone. The front facing speakers work well and are pretty loud compared to other phones I've had. I use this phone a lot through out the day for work, taking calls, sending emails, and using GPS for navigation and I think the battery life is great for how much I use it. I will have to put it on the charger around 4-5pm in the car but compared to my Note 3 it was 12-1pm so I think the battery life is great. The cloud storage works great and I'm surprised more manufacturers haven't followed in there foot steps. I'm using the phone on AT&T with no issues. So over all for $169!!! this phone is a great deal! (I paid $225) If you are contemplating purchasing BUY THIS PHONE!
