Purchased this for my son as a Christmas gift. He loved the idea and design of this drinking horn, but there are some issues.Pros:Very largeDishwasher safeMade wellCool designStrap makes it handy to carry aroundCons:Does not come with any type of lidCannot set down without base stand, and the base stand is a little wobbly. Would be better if the stand was weighted down a bit more.Still, it is quite the conversation piece and just fun to have.
