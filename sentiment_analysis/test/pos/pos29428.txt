We made a commitment this year as a family to be more environmentally friendly. This was the one of the first purchases we made to achieve our goal. We have had them a little over a month and they seem to be working well. Both my 6 year old and 3 year old can open these without any issue. Only down side I have seen so far is the staining. They take on the color of carrots for example.....but now we just try to use that same one to pack the carrots in for lunch. They do look a bit grungy when stained but I plan on buying more of the snack size, so I guess it doesn't bother us too much.
