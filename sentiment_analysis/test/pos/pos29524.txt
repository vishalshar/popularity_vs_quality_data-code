This product was the last resort for my declawed siamese cat that kept jumping our 6ft fence. Now I wonder why I didn't get it sooner, it's fantastic! I have never been a avocate of "electrocution collars", and I never thought I would be that person that would use one on a pet, but this is surely the best investment I've made. I've tried everything to keep my cat in the yard, nothing worked until now. I wired my fence according to the directions (it took about 3 hours) and put the collar on my cat. I think he was zapped a couple of times in the beginning, but now he knows the boundries and all he has to hear is the warning beep and he turns around and goes running. It's great! I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to keep their cat within the safety of their own yard.
