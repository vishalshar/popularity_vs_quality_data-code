OMG!  These are the absolute BEST tasting mini chocolate chip cookies!  Fresh off the front porch from delivery they were a little warm, and tasted like homemade cookies!  My daughter who has nut allergies actually said, " Wow!  These are good!  I've never had a chocolate chip cookie that tasted this good before!"  And as mom, it is nice to feel secure that they are safe for her to eat.
