I absolutely love these video sunglasses. After checking out a few different companies and debating over several products including a number of action cams, Cyclops Gear was recommended by a buddy of mine that has the snow goggles.As someone that's pretty picky on blocking my field of view, I can absolutely attest that these sunglasses do not in any way hinder my vision, but instead knocked my socks off on the clarity.Wearing the glasses is like wearing regular sunglasses and my favorite feature is definitely the vibration alert.  I dont have to fuss with worrying about if Im recording or not.So for the details, I give the ease of use a 10, and the video quality a 10.On a final note, these sunglasses are very sharp looking on me (at least thats what my grandma says) and Im looking forward to taking these on the mountains this snow season.
