Surprisingly great, responsive, screen resolution is good, plenty bright enough. Well worth the money. BUT BE AWARE! 7" phone doesn't sound big till you hold it, it is big!  And the sound is louder than my HTC and Moto G but not the best quality. All in all this is a great phone for YouTube, internet browsing, and good size for navigation. Haven't had it long enought to verify the battery life over time but I did buy a second one for my spouse who hated texting on a small keyboard and she likes it too.
