I clean my car every weekend and clean wheels are a must for me.  A friend told me about this product so I made the purchase.  Upon the first use it leaked and had issues.  I emailed the company and received a response immediately.  They sent out replacement parts and a few extra washers.  Hands down the best customer service I've experienced in a long time.  Put the parts in and it works very well.  I don't have to keep dipping the brush in a bucket anymore.  Overall I'm very happy with the product and ecstatic about their customer service.  I  can see I will need to replace the brush soon but it's in the same amount of time I would go through a regular brush.
