originally got a guitar triller through their Kickstarter campaign, so I've been trying it out on my nylon acoustic for a few weeks. loving the new sounds it produces and all of the videos on their YouTube channel that helped me get started. grabbed another one here on Amazon for a friend who plays ukulele and he can't put it down.
