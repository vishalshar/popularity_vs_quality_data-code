Probably one of the best accessory items that I've ever purchased! The fact that it's a carabiner that can clip onto backpack or clothes makes it perfect to have this cable around me at all times. For those complaining about the size of the clip or the price, they probably don't spend enough time outside of their office/home to make this worthwhile, but for people that travel constantly or students, this is PERFECT!
