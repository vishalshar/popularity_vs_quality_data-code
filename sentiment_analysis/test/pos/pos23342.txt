Wish I new about this product earlier...10X better than I expected. Well worth the price. It is extra durable and easy to use.  Lots of pockets, zippers, etc. Crazy amount of space for a smaller bag! I fit all my pool stuff, snacks, extra shoes all in at once.  I can't say enough about this product. Buy it!
