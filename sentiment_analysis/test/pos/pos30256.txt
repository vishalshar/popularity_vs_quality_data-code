This is an incredible phone for the price.I had some issues with the first one (After 2 weeks, the paint/coating began to chip away somehow; but apparently this was an issue with early batches of the Midnight version).The second (Replacement) Midnight arrived very fast and have not had any issues whatsoever since. It's been two months so far and I have not had any issues with the paint/coating at all.
