Delicious! I love the taste and texture of these! It's a great snack to have on hand. My nephew didn't care much for to cocoa flavor as it's a little strong and I think he was expecting dipped banana chips but I liked them. I enjoyed the different flavors but the taste difference was subtle except for the cocoa ones. I'll be buying again for future vacations.
