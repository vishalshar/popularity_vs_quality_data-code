The grip boost football glove grip juice is an amazing product, you don't need to put a big amount on your gloves, it only takes a small amount to rub around on your gloves and cleans it and restores grip back and makes it way stickier. Your gloves dry after about 25 seconds of applying it to the gloves and they become insanely sticker, it helps me catch footballs way easier now and you can hear the grip when you put and pull the gloves off eachother.
