I've had this for seven months now.  I put the pad on the dash of my Ford Escape on a slope, about thirty degrees off horizontal, and stuck the mount to it.And it works.  It has stayed just where I put it.  I put my phone in and out of this thing several times a day, and it has worked like a champ.  Every now and then I have to tighten it, but that's rare.In seven months the only time I've had a problem with it was three or four days in September.  It kept slowly (because of the sticky stuff on the suction cup) falling off the pad.  I cleaned it and cleaned the pad.  I put it on wet.  I put it on dry.  It kept falling off.Until it didn't.  It's been three months since it fell off.It wasn't temperature, because it's been near 0F here this winter, and it made it though the whole summer with temperatures in the nineties (and much higher on my dash.The only thing I can think of is elevation.  I was on a road trip when it was falling off, and I was driving through Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and Utah.  Checking Google Maps I see my elevation was typically above 4000 feet during this period.  My guess is that the lower atmospheric pressure didn't allow enough differential to keep the suction cup down.This is just my guess, after the fact, and I've done no research on the matter.  The only fact is that it failed repeatedly for the few days I was in those states and has not failed once in the months I've been closer to sea level.
