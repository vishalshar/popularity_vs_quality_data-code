I bought this for my nephew and I think my brother in law was just as excited about it!  Really cool product!  My nephew is only 3 so I think maybe some of the concepts were a little out of his reach, but he could certainly understand the part about creating your own mud energy, and what 3 year old doesn't love to play with mud!
