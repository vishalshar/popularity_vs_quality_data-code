I have been using this for 3 years and have some suggestions. The design of the Pet Loo is awesome. I like how it is elevated and my dogs have to step up onto it to pee, thereby eliminating any half on/half off pees that pool onto the floor and spread completely under a pee pad. I like how it drains and I LOVE the WEE SPONGE that comes with the Pee Pods. It completely absorbs the pee to form literally a spongy mass. It has no odor of pee whatsoever! However if you open the pee pod it smells extremely chemically (think sharpie marker x 100!) so don't breathe it in! What I love, is that I have a 5 lb and 8 lb dog and I only need to change the Pee Pod once per month! I clean the actual Pet Loo with hot water and soap about every 4-6 months. I think it is recommended to do it monthly but I honestly don't see the need if the pee stays contained and you have no overspills. Plus it is a pain to clean bc I have the 33x33 size, the smaller size would be easier to clean. My only complaint with this product is THE GRASS!!! It's awful. It doesn't drain effectively, rather it seems to absorb a lot of the pee and ends up smelling like urine after just one week of use. I clean it (which is a treat for your nose) and without fail one week later it smells completely gross again. The pet loo spray you can buy helps, but only temporarily (and expensive).Plus when the dog jumps on it, it can shift, and so my dogs sometimes just preferred to pee on the floor next to the pet loo rather than getting up on the unstable grass. It also is not soft and plush like real grass and ends up looking real dingy. I suffered with this nasty thing for about 3 years, thinking this is as good as it will get... and then I discovered K9GRASS!!! I have been using it for 2 months and seriously K9Grass on this Pet Loo is the perfect product!! I bought the closest fitting size online (which fit perfectly when I cut it in half so now I have a backup grass for later) and it really truly drains and so there is NO SMELL!!! It is also super duper thick and plush and so my dogs LOVE to jump up on it bc it feels like real grass!! Its heavier in weight so it no longer shifts when the dog jumps on it so they aren't so unsure of it anymore. Only having it for 2 months I haven't tried (or needed) to clean it, so i might have to update the review later.. but I can tell you it is a million times better than the other nasty fake grass. It also looks a lot better, no longer an eyesore! Try the K9Grass on your pet loo, with the wee sponge (pee pods) and you will love this product!! I had to search online and buy direct from the company, It cost $131.95 (3'x5' unbound) but I cut it in half to make two 33x33, and when you consider it makes 2, its a lot better deal than the nasty pet loo grass that I had to buy a new one every year bc I got so sick of the smell...
