Super neat product - the Sevenhugs hugOne Sleep Tracking System.  Took a bit of time setting up and syncing - I had to do it twice, but I think that was my fault since I have a password on my wifi network and probably entered my wifi network password wrong the first time.  The setup error didn't tell my I entered the password incorrectly.  When I entered my password again, it synced up just fine.  I like the air quality feature of it. I have this in my kitchen/dining/great room.  You can really tell if you need to do an air exchange after cooking.  The app is fine - not the most intuitive, but easy enough.  Sleep tracking is great feature too.  I never really thought about sleep tracking until i got this.  Now - I check every morning.  Its pretty accurate - not that I can tell the difference between light sleep and deep sleep, but it is pretty accurate at telling me when I wake up in the middle of the night.  My concern with the sensors (b/c they are so small) are accidentally not removing them when the sheets get washed.  Hasn't happened yet but I hope the are waterproof and heat proof.  When looking at the sleep log (detail), I notice that the app reports the temperature as 22.4 F degrees.  I think it means Celsius but in the Sleep summary, it is correctly listed in Fahrenheit. I hope the app gets fixed.  Overall, I'd recommend this product if you'd like to monitor your home air quality and track your sleep.
