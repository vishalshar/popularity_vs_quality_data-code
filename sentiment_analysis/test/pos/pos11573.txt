I was really hesitant and now I can't live without it. You just have to keep in mind how to use it. Use it for measuring funky measurements such as window frames where hitting the corner is a serious pain in the neck or if you want really accurate measurements for cuts. It's not fast but who cares. Accuracy is what matters when you build furniture and I have a lot more confidence in my cuts now. Great product.My only pet peeve is a valid one. The tab easily comes loose and wiggles so be careful. Granted a LOT of tapes have this same headache.
