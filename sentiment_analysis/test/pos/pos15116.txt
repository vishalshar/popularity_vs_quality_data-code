I'm a 5'8 guy with wide shoulders, so I have to spend time trying to do the water ditch with the curtain but usually it builds up and water ends up all over my bathroom floor.  This clingless makes it so much easier for me. Just close the curtain and I'm showering.My bathtub is the average 14 inch high tub so it's the perfect length not touching my floor.  And if I ever need to shorten it up I could just do a quick knot.Finally no more messing around, it just works.
