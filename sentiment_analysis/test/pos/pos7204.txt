Love the Quad Lock system.I have the bike mount on two bikes, the car mount, the running armband, and the belt clip. Transferring my phone between vehicles and myself has never been easier. I get a lot of jealous looks when I quickly switch from bike to hip, or when I stop to snap a picture during a run or ride. The case itself is great quality. My phone gets beat up due to my lifestyle, and this case has held up very well. The locking mechanism on the back is very slim considering how secure it is, and the case is no more bulky than the slimmest otterbox.I hope these guys stay in business for a long time, because I will keep buying new cases from them. The system is absolutely ideal for me.
