I bought this as a christmas gift for my boyfriend. He'd been wanting a white board but we try to avoid making holes in the walls if we can and I thought this peel and stick clear board looked chicer anyway. He loves it so much and it helps keep his to do lists and bills organized. It went on simply with no air bubbles and has been up for about two weeks now with no corner curls. Will be ordering from Think Board again in future.
