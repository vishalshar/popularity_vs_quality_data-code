Loving this! Very hard to find PURE BIRCH Xylitol. (You don't want it made from corn, particularly if you are ingesting it as a sugar substitute. Corn is worse than the cane sugar would be - both in terms of glucose-spikes, and with the added problem of increased inflammation within the body, not to mention that it is GMO-sourced unless certified otherwise.) So grateful for this company's commitment to integrity. We use it in our home-made toothpaste - as a way to naturally protect & strengthen the teeth. Our society has been taught that fluoride is safe, and it is actually extremely toxic. So we make our own fluoride-free toothpaste and use this in place of the fluoride to help prevent cavities. Excellent product, and nice subtle flavor as well. Thank you Morning Pep!
