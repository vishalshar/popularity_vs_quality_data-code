These traps are absolutely amazing!!!Worth every penny you pay for them!They work real well with clean quick kills.No muss, no fuss, no noise, no mutilated remains like with ordinary mouse traps. And no snapped fingers setting them. As the owner of an older home in a rural area, these are worth their weight in gold! Thank you!!!!
