I'm 30.  This is a product advertised for children and I don't have any.  This was one of the coolest little experiments I've ever done in my home.  Be careful though, keep these babies moist and pay attention to them.  I waited a little too long to pick my first batch and I think they got a little weird.  It's amazing how much bigger they get every day.  I'd get home from work and scream, "Wow!" every day because they seemed to double in size every time you looked away.
