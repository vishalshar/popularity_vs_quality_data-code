It's a Rokform. Nuff said.This casing is for iPhone 6. I would give it a 5 * if not for the irritating small piece at the back that's detachable & interchangeable. Quite bothersome & irritating. But Rokform is always innovating.A much better casing than my previous iPhone 5 which was such a hassle to fit when I'm on my motorcycle. That one had 3 pieces to fit over the iPhone. This one has only 1 piece. Quick & easy to fit (except for the tiny back piece). Excellent product. Simple. Attractive. Functional. The picture shows the casing on its mount on my motorcycle handle bar. No phone cox I'm using it to take the picture...duh!!!
