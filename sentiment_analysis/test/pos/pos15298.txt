It glows in the dark.  I kid you not.  The fit is a little loose for cycling wear and it feels as if it would present a breath-ability problem (but I don't have good first-hand basis for complaint on that score).  But the purpose was being seen and oh boy is it visible, with the most faint and indirect of lighting.  Must look funny to cars to see the headless-legless humanoid floating down the shoulder of a dark road.
