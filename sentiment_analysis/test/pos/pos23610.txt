So far so good. Works great. Only thing I do not like is if the green part gets water under it, it can leak a little., Doesn't get as good of a suction as it should then. Also, to me the glass looks like a good thickness. She has (and I have) dropped it many times and it is still on once piece.UPDATE: It is the end of december now and still in one piece! Only down side is that the green lid we don't use any longer. The toddler bit one if the slits in the mouth piece out.
