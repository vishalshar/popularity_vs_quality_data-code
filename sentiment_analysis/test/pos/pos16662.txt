It's a plastic container that heats up to yogurt making temperature. You put the culture-milk into a separate container which fits into the heated container. It comes with yet another container for storage along with a strainer for making greek yogurt. I have not used the strainer. I bought this model because it has a timer on it. It's a nice little set up and is easy to use and clean.
