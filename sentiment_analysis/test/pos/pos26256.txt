Amazing Thermal imager for the price. Does not have a wide temperature range (Min/Max), but is sensitive enough to see asphalt roads (91 degF) at night with a building in the background 100 yards away, or a curving gravel road (89 degF). Does not have great resolution, but consider the screen you are looking at. Easily picks up the heat coming out from under a door at 25 yards next to an window AC unit (104 degF), or the video cards in your liquid cooled computer (CPU is coolest component on the board with cooling tubes running to the CPU block). Because of my iphone case I also picked up a iphone 5 extension.I am a Volunteer Fire Fighter, and I carry this during investigations to locate hot spots, until the Fire Engine arrives and I can get the $4000 thermal unit from the truck.Remember this is the extended range so trying to use it closer than 10 feet can will make you step back to get the whole area. The computer photo was taken at 7 feet
