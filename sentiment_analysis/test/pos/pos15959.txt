UPDATED July 2nd 2016:I am happy to report that my broken part has been replaced by Wacaco and they honored the one year guarantee even when the Amazon returning policy had already expired. Costumer service was very courteous, informative and efficient, so just for that alone they deserve 5 stars, but just for the time I lost trying to fix the problem I'm giving them 4 stars only. The spare part took a while to arrive (about 25 days or so since the day I was shipped), this is understood since the spare part came from Hong Kong. TIP: Buy directly from Wacaco.com and avoid limited returning policy by Amazon. (Thanks to one of the other reviewers for providing me with the necessary info to solve my problem. As simple as looking for customer support at Wacaco.com)Now, let's talk about the product itself: As I said on my initial review I was very happy with this product until the day it broke. Now that the problem has been solved I can give you an objective review free of frustration. If you have seen the other reviews, someone said DO NOT DAMP. That person is totally right! This warning is written in the owners manual of the MiniPresso, but apparently not big enough since many of us have ignored the warning maybe inspired by the videos out there. Let me repeat it. DO NOT DAMP. This small machine creates enough internal pressure for your coffee. No need to damp at all. Just grind your coffee very fine and put a scoop in the filter. Let it stand somehow loose. Start pumping slowly about 7 times to let the hot water pass through and let it rest for a couple of seconds, then proceed to pump letting pass between 2 to 3 seconds in each pumping. IF THE PUMPING GETS TOO HARD DON'T FORCE IT. THAT MEANS YOUR COFFE POWDER WAS SET TOO TIGHT AND IT IS BLOCKING THE FILTER TINY HOLES. THAT CREATES EXCESSIVE PRESSURE AND YOU RUN THE RISK OF BREAKING THE PART AS I DID. Just open the machine and reload it again making sure the powder is loose.THE GOOD:The flavor of your coffee will be as good as if you were using more expensive equipment. I have tried as many as 7 different manual coffee makers and this is by far the one that produces the most concentrated flavor and thickest texture of the extraction. It is very portable. Perfect for camping. Some reviewers have said it is difficult to clean. I disagree. If you keep yourself organized the cleaning can be fairly simple.THE NOT SO GOOD.This machine was created for personal use, so the amount of liquid you get is smaller compared to other machines. Even with the extended water container (sold separately) you will get more water but the filter capacity will be still the same, meaning your crema will be more diluted and the flavor won't be as concentrated. Luckily for me when my first machine broke I got a second one as a present and now that I got the first one repaired I have two and that makes it easier for me to prepare a second cup of coffee right away. If you can afford a second one, go for it. You'll see how big of a difference it makes to have two. Otherwise keep in mind this machine is not designed for people who are in a rush and expect to drink a litter of coffee before starting their day.THE BADCurrent instructional videos suggest damping the coffee powder which can damaged the machine. Spare parts are not available for direct purchase in the website directly, which makes it somehow difficult and time consuming to replace if something goes wrong.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was so happy with my mini presso machine until it broke. Very portable and practical to take with me on camping trips. Yesterday the rim that holds the pressure rubber ring broke. I visited the Wako website for spare parts but they don't sell them. Meaning my machine is useless now. I don't know if I want to buy one again. I'm very disappointed. Amazon return policy is even shorter than the guarantee on this thing. I'll try to send it back to the manufacturer since the guarantee has not expired and I'll keep you posted.
