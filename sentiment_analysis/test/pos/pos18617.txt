This line of products is great. I have used arm bands in the past and they are too small and a pain to get the phone in and out of while it's on. I like to change up the songs, so that's not good. This band is highly adjustable and fits bigger arms, and can tighten up to fit a child's arm. The quadlock system makes for easy on and off while wearing the arm band. A must have for the gym to get the phone our of the pocket or waistband.
