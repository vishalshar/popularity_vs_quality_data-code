I Hate tying my shoes. These are perfect replacement for the horrible laces that came with my dress shoes. I cannot slip my dress shoes on really usually without any problem and they're not even very noticeable.  They are a little difficult to put on but definitely worth the hassle for the convenience of easy slip on good looking shoes. I ordered another pair for my running shoes and I can't wait to give him a try. thanks for the great products .I understand that the 1-5 star rating is to help both buyers and sellers. Here is a breakdown of how my 1-5 ratings are determined: 5-star rating that means that I truly love that product and it has features that put it above and beyond what would normally be expected, and it is something that wowed me and I am truly glad I purchased it and would purchase it again. Also I recommend it to everyone and anyone!4-star ratings are items that do exactly as would be expected of the item, is of very good quality, but does not stand out significantly in any way unless I specifically state why it stands out. But all in all, this item is a solid item and is still highly recommended. It just didnt have the wow factor that my 5 star ratings would have had.3-star ratings are given on items because my feeling about the product is neutral. I do not consider it a negative, but it just did not wow me, or there is nothing of great significance.1 or 2-star ratings are rarely given unless the item is completely worthless and not worth the money, and I am only giving that rating as a warning to others. Some items have received lower ratings because of the way they were made or put together, and it is getting that review because of the quality of the item, which is specifically described in my review. It has to be pretty bad to get these ratings from me!
