Very nice blanket. It might repel rainwater, but when i think of waterproof i think of it falling into a stream and it still being dry. It will be soaked if you did that, but its all synthetic material, so i think it would keep some of its heat retaining qualities. I bought this for camping and wanted some competition for my 100% wool blanket. And although it hasn't had many tough tests yet, i love it. It feels a lot nicer on my skin and is every bit as warm[possibly warmer]. Durability seems great, but i don't think it can compete with a wool blanket. Its lighter than my woolly. One thing though, if your going to use it by the campfire. You will get little burns in it. Hot ashes and this blanket do not mix. One of the only downfalls of it. That and maybe the price. But high tech gear cost a lot. Then again I think a 100% wool blanket isn't cheap anymore either. I recommend for sure.
