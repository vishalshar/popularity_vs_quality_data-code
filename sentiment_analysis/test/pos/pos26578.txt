Our dog, Kapu loves her Petzi!  Easy set up, and we can watch her and our cockatiel, Tiare when we are not home.  I "trained" our dog to listen for the sound of the Petzi cam starting up.  Walked her over to it a few times, talked through it and shot out a treat.  Now she knows what is going on and will go right to the Petzi cam when it goes on.  I like that it only turns on when you open the app.One improvement I would like to see would be to allow a separate email address to access the Petzi treat cam.  Our grown kids would like to be able to watch our dog and send treats as well.  As it is set up now, they have to use my email.  Great product, and we are very happy with it!  Highly recommended.
