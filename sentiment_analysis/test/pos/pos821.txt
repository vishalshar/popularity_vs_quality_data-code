I use these daily, since I clean my brushes everyday, it's really important my brushes are dry by the next makeup application. It dries the bristles nicely and keeps their shape. Probably will extend the lifetime of many of my makeup brushes. I've already bought two sets and will buy them as my brush collection grows :)
