I would give these a 4.5 if I could. These dice are beautiful. The ornate faces make it slightly difficult to read the d20; that said, if you want a really slick looking set of dice, it is worth the compromise. I would have rated these 5 stars except one face on the d20 has part of one of the numbers unpainted. The surface is recessed and I plan to repaint the missing section. All-in-all, I will happily buy more of the pathfinder dice sets. Despite the tiny flaw, these are high quality and beautiful dice.
