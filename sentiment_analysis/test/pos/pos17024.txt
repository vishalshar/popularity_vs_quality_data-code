My wife and I have been wanting to put up security cameras outside our home for some time, but did not want to deal with the expense and hassle of how we would power the cameras. I have been looking for a product that would make use of the existing power of the porch lights for some time and recently stumbled across the Kuna. We have three entry points and decided to order one as a pilot before ordering another two.We have been using the Kuna for about a week now and are very happy with it. I am not the most handy person but was able to install it with little issue. I do think that the mounting bracket it came with was a bit flimsy and could be improved, but suspect this is something that could be fixed/replaced at the local hardware store fairly easily if necessary.Once installed, I had some issues with the initial setup due to a Wi-Fi issue in the base firmware that prevented connection to networks with special characters in the password. I contacted support and they acknowledged that this was likely due to the early edition of the firmware the device ships with and suggested that I add it temporarily to guest network with a simple password long enough to get the firmware to upgrade and then move it to our regular network. This got us connected and although my attempts to manually initiate a firmware upgrade were unsuccessful, by the next day the device had updated itself. I then had no issue with moving the Kuna off the temporary guest network I set up to our more secure standard wireless network. Not a 100% issue free install, but nothing earth shattering considering that the Kuna is, as others have pointed out, a very "young" product.From there, everything has been great. As new as the Kuna is, in fact, it has been down right impressive. Once the firmware upgrade completed, we have had zero issues with any of the functionality. The smartphone app (Android) installed easily for both my Wife and I and has "just worked". The recordings screen is probably my favorite part. Kuna could have easily required that each video be "clicked/selected" to view but instead the recording list consists of videos tiles that are all playing at once. This allows you to very quickly view recent activity "at a glance", without having to click through each recording individually.For our front porch, we are currently using the Dusk/Dawn automatic lighting and are very happy with the image quality at night. Our plan is to use the motion triggered lighting for our side and rear doors and assuming that this works as expected see no issues with the fact that the camera does not include night vision. Although we have not yet had to use the intercom functionality in a "real world Â“situation, our testing of it worked well. The audio was clear on both sides of the connection and again "just worked".As we are still within our trial period for the recording service, it is difficult to say whether we would be as happy with the "free" service limitations of recordings only being available for 2 hours. We have every intention of subscribing to the paid service, with the only concern we have here is that the subscription plans are not yet available and we do not know what will happen after our 30 day trial has passed: will our trial continue or will we be forced down to the free plan until the paid subscriptions are available? The plans themselves seem reasonable with the base plan starting at $4.99 /mo or $49 /yr for one camera. Although other reviewers have expressed concern that $50 per camera per year would get expensive, I'd have to imagine that these reviews were posted prior to the 4 camera ($9.99 /mo or $99 /yr) and 8 camera ($19.99 /mo or $199 /yr) plans being available. Having just written that from memory, I just went to the website to verify prices and see that within the last week they appear to have removed the yearly options. this leaves me a little less happy with the plans (no discounted yearly option) and a bit concerned now that I realize that regardless of what is posted on their website today, we have no idea what the plans will actually be once they finally become available.All in all we are very pleased with the Kuna and would highly recommend it. In fact, we just ordered two additional units for our side and rear doors this evening. They are currently out of stock on Amazon, however the Kuna website allows them to be preordered (6-8 weeks - ouch) albeit at a $20 shipping premium over Amazon (ouch again).Other thoughts:Our existing unit is mounted in our covered entry way, shielding it from direct exposure to sunlight. The unit for the side door will be mounted out in the open; it will be interesting to see whether it can handle being mounted directly under the Phoenix AZ sun in the summer and whether not being shielded from the sunlight will affect the image quality (washout/glare).
