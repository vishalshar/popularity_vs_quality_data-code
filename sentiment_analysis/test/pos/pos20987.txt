Let me start with the the customer service. Incredible! 5 Stars for the turnaround time, communication style, and overall willingness/helpfulness of the company.I could not get the RIF6 to work with my Galaxy S6 and was getting very frustrated. I wrote customer service and received a reply in less than 24 hours. They gave me some troubleshooting steps from their website (had already unsuccessfully tried that). As I was at work I didn't have a chance to reply. A couple of hours later they followed-up and informed me that it was actually an issue with the S6. Samsung has decided to not allow video out on the phone (a feature I had never used on my S4. ha). The fact that they continued to investigate the issue even after sending first steps impressed me.Final Solution: Chromecast. It works great and allows me to remotely cast from my mac as well. Obviously I would prefer not to have to buy another device to carry around and hookup, but that's on Samsung, not the RIF6.The Device:For transparency you should know I've never owned a projector and did not get this to replace my primary viewing experience, TV.Pros:- Small- Good Picture (I'm guessing not as good as a larger projector)- Easy to use (UI could use a little work as far as highlights/colors)Cons:- No carry case (I made use of an extra GoPro case I had around)- Audio (to be expected for such a small device. We hooked-up a speaker via the 3.5mm connection)- Angles (I'm certain there's a technical term for this, but you have to project straight on or you get the trapezoid effect. Not a deal breaker, just something to be aware of.)Clearly the next thing I need to invest in is a screen for the backyard.
