Works great after you get it programmed, which can be a real chore.Directions for programming are very limited and could be much better in my opinion, however I will admit I am using it for what I would call pretty involved programming and I have it paired to my Echo so that my wife can simply say "echo tell anymote to watch a DVD" (or blu-ray or whatever) and the anymote will turn on all the required equipment, switch the input for the TV to the DVD and open the tray to receive a disk. This actually takes many steps and a few pauses that can take a bit to figure out.Because of lag I do not believe the AnyMote is very useful for actual playback functions such as pause, FF, stop etc. Sometimes it takes as long as 10 seconds for the command to process.But my wife loves that other than having to use the tablet with the Anymote app ( or her phone) for secondary control she no longer has to remember how to set the TV up to watch a DVD or Blu-Ray, or Sat, or listen to music or whatever she simply tells echo what she wants to do and Echo has Anymote set everything up for her.  I also have buttons setup in the Anymote app to do the same thing.
