This is the best peanut butter I have ever tasted!  It is smooth, creamy, just amazing on a sandwich or just on a spoon. But it does have a few problems. It is too expensive. I really do not want to pay $8 for a jar that I am going to eat in two minutes.  I have a big family and each jar lasts about 2 days at most.  The other problem is that this peanut butter is very often NOT IN STOCK! This leads to a big problem, as we are peanut butter addicts. Then I am forced to buy other flavors and I forget that I really want this flavor.  Now I need to go and get a spoon of peanut butter. YUM!
