** Update: unfortunately I have to take a star off because a crack appeared on my replacement phone...I really love this phone so it's really frustrating that I've now had cracks appear out of nowhere on TWO phones. **I moved from an iPhone 4S to the Nextbit Robin.  I was hesitant because I am so used to iPhone...I actually bought a Samsung Galaxy years ago but had to return it because I hated how different Android was to IOS.  The design of the Robin really struck a cord with me so I decided to give it a shot.I fell in love as soon as I held the phone in my hand.  It was actually a really easy transition to Android this time...I love the way everything is set up.  It feels great in hand - really solid.  I was one of those people who was always deleting things off my iPhone trying to make room since I was always getting the full storage notifications...really glad I won't have to deal with that anymore.The Nextbit community is great and support is there to help.  After a week of having my phone I had a hairline crack appear on the back.  I reached out to support and right away they were working with me to work out a replacement.  I got a replacement and have had that one for 2-3 weeks now and have not had the crack issue re-surface.If you're thinking about moving from iPhone to Robin...I say do it!  I haven't regretted it at all!
