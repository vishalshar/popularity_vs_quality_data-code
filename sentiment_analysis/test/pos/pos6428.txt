I LOVE this bike. It is absolutely worth the price. It is a sturdy bike but not too heavy, I can easily carry is up a couple flights of stairs. I have the orange and I am constantly getting compliments. The gears work smoothly and the brakes are strong. When it came in the mail one small part was a quarter inch too short so I called PUBLIC and working with them was a DREAAAAM!! The part came free of charge with free shipping in a week and the people I talked to on the phone were delightful. 10/10 reccomend!!
