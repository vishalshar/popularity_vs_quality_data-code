This has been a great product that has become part of my son's game day ritual.  The bottle we bought at the beginning of the season has been used sparingly, but has provided great results and allowed him to use a couple pair of he favorite gloves rather than replacing them.  I think he would use this more often but we have it tucked away or everyone on the team would be prepping their gloves on game day! Thanks to grip boost for a great product and a product that not only works, but gives a little shot of confidence when it comes to catching the ball!
