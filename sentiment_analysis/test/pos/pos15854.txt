Well I've had this installed for a few months. Ended up purchasing 6 more dimmers.  The HomeKit interface is great. The overall quality has met my expectations for the current products on the market. My biggest tangible complaint is the wall switches have a cheap feel. The remotes feel more sturdy and less wobbly when you press the buttons.  The app works well on the iPhone and watch. Siri is a bonus but Apple needs to work on their side of the integration a little more.  Most of the time I can use Siri quickly for dimming or turning the lights on.The app needs some improvement with the geo location.  I added my girlfriend to the app. However, I have the app programmed to turn the lights off when I leave.  If my girlfriend is home it still turns them off. Not big deal but this would be a pain if you have a big family. You can easily turn this feature off if you don't like it.Lutron if you're listening please keep improving the app and hub integration with other products. Bonus points if you program an alarm clock dimmer.Overall, the best you can get for the price and quality level.  5 stars based on that fact. The reality is its more of a 4.5
