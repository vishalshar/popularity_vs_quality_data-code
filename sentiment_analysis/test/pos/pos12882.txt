I bought this for my Note 3. It slides into the CD slot in my factory stereo ( 2012 Chevy Avalanche ) Once you slide it into the slot it can be tighten and for the past 6 months has sat seated perfectly.The mount is adjustable It also fits my  Itouch and my daughters iphone5. It has soft rubbar bumpers on each side aswell as on the back of the mount. the note 3 is pretty big and I use an otter box. No problems at all with the fit. Im pretty sure this could be used for a small gps but I dont think its big enough for the ipad mini.Its constructed of super high quality polymer plastic. Its not a cheap made in china mount. This thing is built to last im confident in saying under normal use it will last years.My only issue but its not a big deal at all is the yellow warning sticker is there to stay. I tried peeling it off and it dident want to go. Let me know if I can help with other questions.....
