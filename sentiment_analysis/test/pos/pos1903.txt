Although this seems to be marketed more to people who are camping or need to carry a utensil with them, I found this was an incredible tool for dog food.  My dog is on a prescription dog food that is packed into the can and needs to be broken up to be mixed with the dry food.  I admit I am a little grossed out by the wet dog food so rather not use my good utensils to scoop it out and cut it up.  Regular plastic ones tend to snap so I was looking for something a little stronger.  This was perfect!  It is very strong and easy to clean.  It makes it easy to scoop out the food and break it up into smaller pieces.  It is lightweight and durable. I saw spoons marketed as dog food spoons that were three times the price and looked flimsy.This would make a great utensil for a lunch box or to leave in your desk at work in case you needed it.  Fantastic product.
