Like another reviewer (D. Lee) I only bought this cradle to use the holder part, because it fits a Garmin (17mm) ball.  I have a custom Garmin mount, so I bought this cradle to convert my Garmin mount into an iPhone holder.  (I am not using the base, i.e., the part with the suction cup, the stem, and the ball.)  The holder works well with my iPhone 5 which is in a Incipio OVRMLD case, which provides a bit of grip.  I am not sure the holder would work as well with cases that are very smooth or with bare phones.  All in all, a good product, well worth it especially at yesterday's special sale price.
