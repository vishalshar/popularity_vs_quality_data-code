I've been looking for a video intercom but unlike some of the other people who have written in about this, I'm not primarily motivated by the intra home use but rather inter-home use (home to home and mobile to home).  The first motivation for me was to have a device that was dedicated to video chat making it easier to use than the ipad which requires too many steps to get to facetime.  It was primarily for my grandmother who lives 45 mins away and we don't get to see her often enough.  I bought her an iPad and it just doesn't work for her.  Too many permutations and complex interfaces for her.  When I heard about Nucleus I was hoping this would be a solution.  Then I also had a first child and she's obsessed with chatting with grandma (out of country) and great grandma (out of town) via facetime but that means I always have to be there to make the call happen.  Again I was hoping that Nucleus would be the solution to giving my kid a child-proof solution to communication with our extended family.I have to say ... this thing is MAGIC!Grandma loves it because I was able to set it up as if its in the same home and she doens't even have to do anything ... i put it in her livingroom and when I dial (turned privacy off for that room) and it just turns on and my daughter gets to chat with her.  You really feel like you're just there!  It also gives me a little comfort those times when I call her and she doesn't answer the phone and I get worried.  At least like this I can peer into her livingroom when I'm concerned and see whats going on.  I know this may sound creepy but my grandmother is also super excited about it and totally bought in.It is clear that this is a first release though and so there are a couple of minor things that I'm certain they'll fix pretty quickly based on what I've been told by the really responsive and kind customer support team.  Those issues are: video can be a bit dark when backlit, some wonky/annoying interface issues (like asking me for my password multiple times when I try to modify some settings), the mobile app doesnt work when its running in background, a couple of minor hiccups on initial set up on the software side that were resolved just by rebooting.Its pretty clear to me that this device is going to make a big difference in my family's connection and that this can only get better.  Really psyched to see what else they're going to add on top of Alexa too.
