I had quite a bit of trouble getting the app to work as the firmware needed to be updated...  After many tries and about to give up it worked.First of all the most important thing..  It makes a great cup of coffee.. Pre-Soak for 45 seconds and set the temperature to 203. Using Kobirck beans I have a big time cup of coffee. SO the few times I will lay in bed and ground the coffee the night before it is great.2nd very easy to customize the quick start button for the majority of times I will just manually start it.  Congrats to Behmor for being innovative yet making a great cup of coffee..
