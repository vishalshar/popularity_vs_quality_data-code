I installed the MicroSwiss All Metal Hot End on my Wanhao Duplicator i3 3D Printer. I bought this extra nozzle in the event I needed one. While the first one has not worn out yet, it's the same nozzle in the kit, and it's great. Absolutely love it. I think doing the MicroSwiss All Metal Hot End upgrade has made my 3D Prints better!
