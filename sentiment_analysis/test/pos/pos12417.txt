I helped my son assemble the wooden box, he got to learn how use real screw and nut and to handle the screwdriver... great experience for him.Then assembling the components he learned to have patience and to double check his work and that troubleshooting is a natural process of making things work.Once assemble, he did everything himself, the game walks him through the rest, he tell me of the great satisfaction get gets from making it work, and doing all the work himself.This is a great learning tool and i would certainly recommend for anyone with a curious and industrious kid that needs to keep his mind and wits exercised.
