After using this laptop for about a month now, I can say that I am very pleased with my purchase. Over the past 6 years, I've gone through several laptops; each of them perishing due to manufacturer defects - two Gateways and an HP. With this purchase, I wanted to make sure I was getting a durable device. The specs on this laptop are incredible for the price (notably, the Intel i7 processor, graphics card, 512gb SSD, and 8gb ram). I've been actively using FL Studio, Adobe Illustrator, and Windows Movie Maker without any flaws or hiccups. The system starts up very quickly and opens programs almost instantly. I would recommend this system to anybody looking to create music or edit images/videos. Additionally, the laptop has no issue running multiple programs at the same time. I will update this review if anything goes awry, but as of now, I am a satisfied ASUS user!
