Im no tech expert by a long shot but this new camera was so easy to use I can barely believe it. It was up and running very quickly and everything I recorded looks great, higher quality than I ever expected. It was just right for live streaming, which I had never done before and the WiFi is also wonderful, letting me be away from camera editing live on my iPhone. Another feature I like is that if I ever need to record for over an hour I can plug the camera USB power in. Overall  perfect for my needs. Work and family celebrations. So far my friends are very impressed with what Ive done.
