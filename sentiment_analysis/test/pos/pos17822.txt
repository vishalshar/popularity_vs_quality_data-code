Did alot of reading about LED light therapy for various skin conditions and chose this brand and type because of the recommendations. Cant tell yet if its doing anything. I use it in conjunction with my Palvia laser, a PMD dermabrasion system, derma needling and a NuFace trinity microcurrent system. All part of a program to stave off the wrinkles and not have to pay a spa a gazillion dollars.
