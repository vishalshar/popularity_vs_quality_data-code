Used for the first time this evening; no chlorine taste or smell!  My house is the last on the local city water line and the chlorine has been terribly strong and noxious since the switch from a well many years ago, The Soma pitcher is perfect! The Soma website has excellent how to"s for set up, care and use including videos. When putting the lid back on after filling I realized to be sure to line up protrusion on the lid that is opposite the pouring flap with the notch in the filter holder compartment so the lid is snug. As Soma recommends, filling the pitcher just to the bottom of the letter A in SOMA on the filter holder allows pouring without wasting water, as does filling slowly enough for the water to go through the filter to avoid over filling.
