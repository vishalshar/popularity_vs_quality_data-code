It does its job of letting me see n talk to my poochie. However, the treats dispenser pops out a few treats each time and depletes it real fast. My dog unfortunately is not very responsive to the sound and even the treats, he's just real depressed when no one is around and does not even bother with anything else. Time to get better treats!
