This thing is great.  If you don't get to spend all day with your dog, this little gadget will tell you everything you need to know about how much activity your dog is getting.  Setup is intuitive and straightforward.  Syncing is as easy as breathing.  True to the advertisement, it's very much waterproof (my wife ran it through the wash before I was able to get it strapped to the collar!).  The accuracy is quite impressive as well.  I was skeptical, so I sampled a few hours while I watched my dog closely.  Sure enough, the FitBark was accurate down to the minute showing me when my dog was playing, just active but not playing, and resting.  As it turns out, he rotates between the three all day and night and gets an incredible amount of exercise that I had no idea he was getting.There is some room for improvement, but I'm confident FitBark will continue to roll out improvements.  I, as do all FitBark users, look forward to the breed info module.  I have had a couple of errors, but nothing serious or irrecoverable.  Lastly, I would be interested in a slightly heavier duty version that comes in an extended battery life.  2 weeks is great... but 4 would be even greater :)
