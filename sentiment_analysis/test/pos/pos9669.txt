*Disclaimer - This is a sponsored campaign post with CVS and Mom Select. I received samples and a gift card.The flavor of these that I received and bought is berry, which tastes a bit strange but it's okay. It has a stronger flavor to it than I am use to with berry. This product is great for nursing moms, moms who pump for work, or just moms that exclusively pump for their babies. You must mix this in a bottle of water that's 12 oz or more, and shake it until it's well blended. This is only meant to be drank once a day per packet.This product has Propietary blend in it that are specifically great for milk supply and include:- Fenugreek Seed- Blessed Thistle PE 4:1- Fennel Seed (Foeniculum Vulgare)- Red Raspberry Leaf PowderI'm not too fond of the flavor, even though I love berry but I drink it because it's good for helping your milk supply, and it truly is! I have drank 1 drink mix a day for a week almost now and have pumped 3 - 4 times a day (I usually only pump once a day), due to being engorged from milk supply increase, and so far I have eight pouches of my milk in 8 oz in the freezer stored, which totals 63 oz in a week. I highly recommend this product to moms who are nursing, and they also sell Fertility drink mix that can help your fertility increase.
