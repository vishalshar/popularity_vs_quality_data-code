I have had my Pono about a month. I wanted to take some time with it so understand what I liked and what the shortcoming were.  I bought the Pono because I got really tired of Itunes for Windows which is one of the worst pieces of software written. I love my Ipods but Apple, in their infinite wisdom, decided not to make them anymore and software is so far out of date.Enjoyments:The sound from the Pono is fabulous. With a good (high quality) headset, the quality is much higher than on an Ipod. I took same pieces of music (mp3) on both devices and I can hear the difference. I took the same piece of music, but two different formats (mp3 vs FLAC) on the Pono and the FLAC is substantially of higher quality and resolution. If you are an audiophile, this is a no brainer.When routed through the car or home audio system, tremendous sound quality increase. Sound just comes alive with a good speaker system.Frustrations:I thought Itunes for windows was bad. Do not even download and use Ponomusic World. It is poorly written and fully frustrating. The people who wrote the software should be ashamed. Best, simplest and easiest way to move music to the Pono is drag and drop.  If you customize or change your music files, Ponomusic World (PMW) will likely not recognize it. I tried uninstalling and reloading to no avail so I just dumped it and will not go there.Poor battery life so carry and an extra charged auxiliary battery with me when working out side and keep it plugged in in the car or home.The Ipod is a marvelous piece of software and hardware so if you are comfortable with it, you will have a learning curve because Pono is not nearly as flexible.The shape is funky but no big problems.Audible book files (aax) need to be converted since they do not play on the Pono but that is not a big issue. Several good converters available for download.Would I buy it again knowing what I know now? In a heartbeat. Going to purchase another for the home audio system.  If you do not really appreciate and enjoy music, this is probably not for you however if you are an audiophile, order it now.
