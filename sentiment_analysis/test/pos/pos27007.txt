I LOVE this case.  I don't and won't use it in the car, but I use it everywhere there's a metal surface.  On the inside of my medicine cabinet, for instance, so that I can listen to my music while I'm getting dressed.  And it's great for taking selfies if you have the right app to count down the photo.  I'm hanging my phone all over the place!  Love it!
