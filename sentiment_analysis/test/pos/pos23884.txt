I don't usually write reviews, but there are too many people putting down these ear buds. I am very particular about the headphones I use. I would have returned them if they kept on disconnecting. I have to say I am very impressed!  They did not once disconnect while I was working out!  However, while walking through a busy downtown street they dropped quit a bit. I expected that and I can accept that. They work perfect for me!!  I held off cause the reviews were bad but I met someone with a pair and they raved about them. So, I decided to give them a try.  If u are in a busy area with a lot of RF frequencies, then it will drop (busy city).  I am not in an environment like that all the time. So they work for me and very impressed!!  Bought the AirPods and they don't have nearly as much controls and they kept on falling out. These stay in and are very comfortable!  I am keeping these!!
