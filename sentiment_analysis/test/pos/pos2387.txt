Absolutely love the product.  It is so breathable, something about the material allows air to the dressing.  The design is unique, and it goes well with my clothes; I wear black a lot so I love the color.  The blue logo is also a fun touch.  I can see the picc line insertion site and make sure to watch for any issues.  It is just way better than the other stuff out there or at least the tube socks and some others.  Flexibility is great, allows me to get back to doing the things I love.  So comfortable, like material.
