This was purchased to use as a demonstration to high school students in a school setting with students that have learning, emotional and behavioral disabilities. I viewed a demo video on Facebook and was quite impressed, not only with the concept itself, but as a demonstration of the innovation and the ingenuity of individuals.  Very impressive on both counts.
