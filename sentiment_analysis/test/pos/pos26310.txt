I really didn't know what to expect when I ordered these...I had seen them in the Tucson airport and was curious. They are good but they are quite hard, kind of like biting into a Jolly Rancher...I had expected them to be chewy. I feel that if the price was much lower, I would be inclined to purchase them again, but at almost $10 for a 4oz bag, I will probably not be getting more until the price comes down.
