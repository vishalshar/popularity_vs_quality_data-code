I bought this because it is beautiful. I am filtering for taste, replacing a Brita pitcher that I must have warped in the dishwasher, because the filters now sit about a millimeter off. It bothers my husband that a little bit of water might be (probably is) bypassing the filter.I went looking for a new Brita Pitcher, and I saw this one. I like how it looks. I like that it's at least partly glass. I like that the glass is shatter resistant.I'm a little perplexed by the size of the part you are supposed to hold while pouring, though. It's big for my hand, which isn't that small for a woman.But the rest of it is aces. It is way easier to clean than other filter pitchers and dispensers I have owned. And the water is really good. I am very happy with this purchase. If it turns out that the girth of the holding part isn't as much of an issue as it seems like initially (it isn't), I will add a star (I did).UPDATE: I have since bought more Soma products, and they have improved their filters. Still very happy and I recommend them to everyone who will listen.
