This drone is amazing and tough. My 8 year old has not put it down. It has various settings for bigginers to experts so my older son (12) has found an interest in it as well. We had purchased a drone last year for Christmas that we immediately returned due to my child being frustrated with it and us (the adults) as well. Although the other drone had good reviews, it was hard to control and at every bump lost a propeller. This one isn't fragile and very responsive. It makes a drone fun from the moment you take it out of the package.
