These filters look great! Haven't had much time with them yet but quality seems great. I have a Phantom 4 and I though mine was one that the stock filter was permanently on there. Nope. All you have to do is put tape on the stock filter around the edges and twist. It will come off with almost no effort. I tried to untwist it before with my bare hands and it wouldn't budge. It must need equal pressure around it to be taken off. IT WORKS.
