I was initially skeptical to buy because I have always used Otterbox products for my iPhones, iPad, & my oldest child's iPad Mini. However, this product is GREAT for my 3-year-old's iPad Mini! It is very durable & has protected the iPad from breaking when she has dropped it! Plus, the handle is perfect for her little hands!
