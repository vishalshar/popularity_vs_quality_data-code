Update: FiftyThree support was very responsive.  With very little back & forth (even after my long period of procrastination before contacting), they arranged an exchange for a new Pencil.  The new one works well thus far and their responsiveness led me to bump this up to a 4.----------------OriginalI'm something of a stylus junkie.  This is easily the worst one I own.Pros:  * Allows you to smudge in Paper  * Allows broader strokes in PaperCons:  * Worked for about seven weeks before losing the ability to pair.  * Tips have thin rubber layer so you should use light pressure.  * Requires medium pressure to detect the stroke.  With Con #2, means tips are torn up quickly.  * Replacement tips are very pricey compared to my other styli.  * Mostly only works in Paper. (Other apps like Procreate, Notepad + and Sketch Club really didn't work well. Nagging issues like having to re-pair after using the eraser, frequent connection losses)Definitely unhappy with this purchase.
