Pros:-High speed: impressed with the top speed it gets on smooth surface.-Software: awesome/ i have iphone 5s and the software is great. driving mode is portrait orientation and trick mode is landscape. you can switch back and forth whenever you want with no recalibration or anything. trick mode can get your out of a booger if it gets stuck-Battery life: played with it for like an hour and it had just started to run out of battery.-Durability: it gets to going pretty fast and slams into things but hasn't broken anything and hasn't gotten broken yet.Cons:Steering: you have to orient it usually after you do a trick. but once you orient it, drives fine. A bit hard to control but easy enough that it's very fun to play with.Price: a hundred stinking bucks!! really pricey but I think its worth it.OVERVIEW: a great toy, I am very impressed.I didn't think it was heavy enough to gyroscope itself up to 14mph, but now that i'm driving it, i can definitely get there. The price is the only reason it loses a star.
