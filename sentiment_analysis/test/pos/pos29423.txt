e bought Anki drive for a family activity on Thanksgiving. We have boys from 4 to 70 at our house for the holidays. I bought the starter set, 3 extra cars, and the crossroads track ( BTW sign up for emails from ANKI. I got our extras with an email offer for 20% off.) Despite a shipping glitch from Amazon, we got them in time, and everyone had a blast. My son in law was wandering around the kitchen ( He was the last one to arrive) and when I asked why he wasn't playing, like a little kid, he said "They won't let me have a turn." So we had to talk a little about sharing, but it's a great, interactive, family experience. It's really hard to find things that are fun that aren't too hard for the little ones or too boring for the older ones, and this totally fits the bill. The cars stay on the track, so the steering is just passing and lane switching, which means the 4 yr old and the 70 year old, who don't play as many video games, don't get too frustrated.
