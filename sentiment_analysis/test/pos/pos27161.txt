I use these for cooking prep bowls. I'm only cooking for two and maybe some leftovers so I use these old Pyrex glass bowls to keep chopped veggies and other delights ready for the stove. Tonight it was chopped ham, frozen peas, minced celery, and pearl onions. The good seal keeps them safe and ready to use later. Great size. Great product
