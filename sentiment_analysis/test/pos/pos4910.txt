Hi Everyone,I just wanted to share, to my surprise, that this actually works perfectly. We have a rather large female Siberian cat (at 16lbs). We wanted to be able to let her go outside, but just in a small contained area. She gets very excited over birds, chipmunks, squirrels, etc ... and I really thought she'd just go running straight through the barrier to get to them. To my surprise, she stops just shy of the border. And, if she does get shocked (we have it set to level 1/least amount of shock ... less than a 9v battery on your tongue), she definitely takes heed and RUNS back inside. Now, she's a happy kitty able to enjoy a small bit of outdoors without wandering off too far. Also, the collar fits her very nicely, and it doesn't seem to hurt her neck where the barbs touch (when not activated).So, I was surprised it worked so well. I'd highly recommend it.Update (10/14/2103): Recently the transmitter stopped functioning properly. It began beeping constantly indicating the circuit wasn't complete. When I tested it with a 10' line of the wire, it still had this problem. So, it was the unit - the unit stopped working all together a couple of days later. I think this is definitely not the norm for them as we have other products from PetSafe that has worked for years without a problem. So, I emailed the customer support for PetSafe - wow, what a great response!! They responded within one day and are sending me a replacement unit (with a return shipping label for the malfunctioning one). Really, top notch immediate customer support.
