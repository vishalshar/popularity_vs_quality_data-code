This scooter look unique design. The structure well made, well finished black color anodized aluminum. No cheap look.  When ride for the first time a bit awkward, balancing from its small tire not take too long. After some time, feel better and confident. The saddle large enough to hold adult rider,  but feel a bit slipery, i hope it should be more rubbery feeling to get more rigid. More than one hour riding on flat road w/ some ascending, the battery still hold w/ remaining 30 percent at least, the motor still ok and feel still strong in performance. It folded and expanded quickly. When folded, a bit clumsy to move it because both tire on the same line. For me,  It better to move for storing in expanded mode, folding for storing can be done later when it reach destination. In overall, it fun to ride, except you feel bumpy compare to real bicycle size, off course because it smaller tires. But saddle suspension reduce much the bumpiness when ride in the irregular surfaces. For such small size scooter, it is amazing to reach far distance that i doubted previously if it can. You may feel awkward as passerby staring at you everytime you stop at traffic light. Anyhow that the consequences of having something different on the road. Overall, i feel good having this scooter. I am thinking to commute w/ this one to office, eventhough i dont need too, I am in Houston, not in Newyork....
