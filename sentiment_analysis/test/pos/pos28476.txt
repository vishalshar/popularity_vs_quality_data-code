I was using GlobalMe in China SilkRoad Trip while while train are moving. some times it got lost, but most time I was at airport, museum, hotel, the device always working fine.  only suggest to buy more GB at first place, because after you finished  GB, it's hard to increase the amount. We paid after we finished the GB, but it took 3 days to recover. they told us they their workers are not working. but in the end, they still make it worked.
