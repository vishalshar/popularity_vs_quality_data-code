The quality of materials in the stylus is awesome. It feels very nice in the hand, has a nice weight to it, and the hard tip slides better across the screen than the rubberized soft tips that you commonly see in styluses. The etched grip area adds a nice amount of texture so that you can hold it well, and the battery lasts quite a long time. My only problem with this is the accuracy.Accuracy is a huge issue with iPads because the screens aren't made to be used with active styluses (most of them simulate a finger which is why the tips are larger). To have the accuracy of a stylus like on the Surface or Samsung tablets, the tablet itself needs to support the technology and be integrated into the display. Because Apple chose not to implement this technology, you're stuck with styluses that aren't trying their best but just fall flat. I've tried $20 ones, $80 ones, a Bluetooth one, and many in between. They all have flaws because essentially they're trying to overcome a hardware limitation that exists on the iPad. This stylus had a nice tip, but if you look closely while writing, the "ink" is never right where the tip of the stylus is. It's because the iPad is "looking" for a finger and this powered stylus is trying to trick the display, usually not doing a very good job. If you're drawing or doing anything like that, then this stylus works great. If you're trying to get accurate handwritten notes, you're going to have a bad time with almost any stylus and an iPad.Honestly, I recommend buying a stylus under $20, possibly one of the cheaper Adonit ones with the circular plastic piece, and just get used to not having amazing accuracy. If I did more drawing or graphic design work, this would be fine, but I use it to take notes in class and this stylus (as well as most others) just doesn't perform very well.Disclosure: I was able to get this stylus at a discount in exchange for evaluating it and writing an honest review. These are my own opinions and I wasn't compensated for my review or compelled to write favorably.
