I really like this new broom design. I have found a light touch works best. There is quality craftsmanship in the making of this broom that works as much more than a push broom replacement. Does great in yard work as a rake and I'm finding it replaces a lot of tools. I hope this design takes off and it is made in more (larger) sizes and the price will come down. For now, I will be buying more as presents to folks.
