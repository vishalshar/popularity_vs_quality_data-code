I bought this for my Yoga 900, not for a Macbook Pro. I bought the previous generation of this sleeve for my Yoga 2 Pro. Both times, the acme skinny sleeve has provided fantastic protection while adding a very limited amount of bulk. This updated version has a thinner strap, which appears to be more secure than the previous version. The color is also more red than it appears in the photo.There are thin plastic panels inside the neoprene that protect your laptop from being scratched or punctured by sharp objects, and the neoprene is thick enough to provide basic protection. However, it wont provide protection against serious falls or heavy objects. The inner lining allow the laptop to be removed easily, but is still snug enough that it wont slide out simply by shaking it.The newer iteration of this sleeve is a definite improvement over the previous version, and provides a surprising amount of protection while adding almost no bulk to your laptop. This is great for smaller backpacks and for travelers who like to pack light. Note that there are no pockets for any kinds of accessories.
