That's something I was looking for. Was so surprised to know, that same second I close the door my pup gets to all the forbidden places - checking dining table, kitchen tables and sleeping on sofa! He was soooo much surprised when I starting to come back when he is on forbidden territory :) I can read that from his pose - "But he was away already! How he could know?????"Haven't got a chance to try the laser pointer - not sure he will be interested.
