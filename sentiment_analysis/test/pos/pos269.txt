Amazing design and quality.  Looks like metal, if I didnt know better, wouldnt know it was polycarbonate.  First thing I did was install Google Now Launcher, cant stand UI's without Widgets or App drawer.  Only about an hour into the product, but so far it is very nice!UPDATE:  Everything makes this phone heat up like cheap toaster oven and the finger print reader is like a retard who thinks you are happy when you turn read and start punching retards... so pretty retarded and completely worthless...
