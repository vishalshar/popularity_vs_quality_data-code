I think I tried about 5 different sleeves and cases for my new 2015 Macbook 12 inch and this was perhaps the best as far as aesthetics, build quality, and easy of use.  Most of the other ones on the market at the time of this review in this price range or less were not snug enough or just felt poorly designed. I tested one other case that felt great--but the colors were lacking and made me feel like I was carrying a ladies slim, but large purse.
