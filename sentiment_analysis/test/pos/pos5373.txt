This is an upgrade over the previous mic I had purchased for use with my iPad.  Audio quality is stronger, for sure. and the windscreen is a nice touch.  But with a protective case on my iPad, this mic does not seat solidly and tends to fall out, risking loss or damage.  Keep a close eye if you're using it, or else you may be looking to buy another one.
