I am 9 yrs old and I got this for my room and found a trick! Go near your router and plug it in the nearest plug from the router, connect it, and find the second nearest plug and plug it in, then the third nearest, keep doing it until you get to where you want it to be. P.S. Houses with stairs don't work that well with this.
