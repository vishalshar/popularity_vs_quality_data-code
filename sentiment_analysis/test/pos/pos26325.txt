Although I didn't purchase from Amazon, I felt the need to write a review. I purchased my R1+ directly from Robo3d in December. I was surprised how well it printed right out of the box! Obviously it wasn't perfect but I can't complain for being a noob and successfully printing within 1 1/2 hrs of opening it. A few days later I had a mishap and the X carriage crashed into the build platform, bending the Z rod. Luckily I was able to skype with Robo3d and get a replacement shipped free of charge within a few days. I also found out that the Z stabilizer on the right side wasn't secured into the hole in the case (easy fix).After having the printer for about 2 months, I can say this is an amazing printer. For the price, you can't beat it. I chose this printer because I didn't want to build my own or spend over $1k since I'm just getting into 3d printing. I've already printed a few upgrades- taller feet, fan duct(must have!) and a few other smaller mods. I have also purchased a knock of LCD controller from China and another fan for the print head. My print quality has been getting steadily better.  I must say however, ditch Matter Control. It's good to start with but once you try other programs you'll see the difference. I have Simplify3d, and often times I have to keep checking whether the printer is still going. It prints much quieter(Matter Control was very noisy and jerky) with greater detail and is overall a more powerful program.I would not recommend this- or any 3d printer to anyone who doesn't want to tinker with things when they go wrong(and they will!) there are so many parameters and things that could throw off a whole print. It's definitely been a learning experience and I personally love teaching myself the ins and outs of this machine. Robo3d has awesome customer service and the forums have been great as well. A good YouTube user to check out is Novice Expert, he has some really good videos about this printer. I've learned a lot from him.I've added a picture of my latest print since doing some minor upgrades. Buddha was printed with Robo3d's green PLA, 100micron layer height using Simplify3d. 20% infill and it took about 4 1/2 hrs.
