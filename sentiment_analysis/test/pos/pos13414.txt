About 2 1/2 months into constant daily use and I've only had one band snap (used in U.S. size 13 DC shoes at the very top rung, just for reference)They fit incredibly well, even more so than the regular laces fit, and make sliding on and off super easy.The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because they expensive for what they are at $15 compared to the $2-3 you'd spend on a pack of laces and come with just enough for 2 shoes plus 2 extra bands
