07/19/2016: UPDATE!It has been over 5 months since I first decided to get this pets treat cam and I am still SOOO glad I did!I love watching my dogs and cats come running to the camera as soon as I turn it on.They have learned to associate the PING with TREATS and they could not get more excited.I still use it on a pretty regular basis, but not as much as before since I had surgery and get to stay home from work now.I was worried they might lose interest after a while, but they have not.I do recommend changing up the treats and taking out old ones every so often because they become stale.-----------------------------Update: it has been about two weeks since I got my petzi cam, and my pets now recognize the sounds mean treats are coming! I use the sound function to let them know they are getting treats because they are good dogs! They look around for me, not knowing the voice comes from the petzi. The treat aspect is what most draws them to the camera, especially since it is only one-way.--------------------------------I love it! I was anxiously awaiting its arrival, even though I have 2 day shipping through my fiance's prime account. I have used it probably 20 times today, and I enjoy the "snap" option where I can take pictures of my dogs when they are in front of the camera. Only reason it is not five stars is because the "petzi" logo was a little faded, probably from the heat in transportation since it was stuck on the box. Me being OCD, it bothered me. However, I have been going crazy dispensing treats and calling my dogs and cat over. They don't quite get it yet, but they like the treats that come out. This is my second day with it and I've hit a few snags (mostly connectivity issues) but I love it! I think the video quality could be better, but I like it anyway. It makes a noise when dispensing the treats, so my dogs move away from it, but they come when they see the treats are dispensed. I wish the sound was two way so I could hear my dogs and if they are barking and stuff like that. Overall, i am VERY happy with this purchase! I log onto the app every few minutes! I like watching my furbabies and it gives me peace of mind.  First pic is nighttime and the last two are daytime viewings. :) happy crazy dog mom over here!
