Where have you been all my life? This phone is great Not too big not too small I dig the performance and form factor. I'm a minimalist and the 100gb of storage is a nice touch. I like to filter out what I need vs what I have and this phone makes it much easier to follow my lifestyle. My only gripe with this phone is the battery life. I work on my business primarily through my phone so I always seem to be cutting it close. The turbocharging is pretty fast so the issue is rather mitigated.
