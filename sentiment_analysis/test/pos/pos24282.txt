Great chair! This chair is very well designed and feels sturdy. The seat is very comfortable, with good lumbar and neck support pillows if you need them. I am 5'8 & 240 lbs, and can sit comfortably in this chair for hours without issue.I was able to put this together easily with no issues. The instructions were not the best, but common sense can guide you. You get the main idea of what you have to do. I bought the pink on black model and it looks even better in person (in my opinion).Very satisfied with my purchase :)
