I just started cycling a month back and I've been going back and forth between different mounts for my iPhone. I decided the Quad Lock would be a safe bet as it's received very good reviews online. Been using it happily for last month and today it really got put to the test.Pros:- Feels very secure, and today that was put to the test (read below)- Case feels well made and it simple. Good looking enough to keep on even when not cycling.- Lot's of mounting options for car, home, anywhere reallyCons:- Pricey, just upgraded to a 6 plus and had to buy a new case $40, and I need to buy a new poncho but $30 is just so painful.I was cycling in a larger street in my neighborhood, when a minivan was slowing to make a left turn at a street just a hundred feet in front of me. I thought the minivan had seen me, but they didn't. They proceeded to turn and I slammed my brakes but it was too late. I slammed right into the side of the minivan and made a sizable dent. Fortunately I was okay with just a few scratches and bruises and the driver was very apologetic and called 911 on my behalf. After a few minutes of being stunned I took a look at my bike. The brake levers were twisted but my iPhone with the quad lock case had not budged at all. No scratches on it, nothing.
