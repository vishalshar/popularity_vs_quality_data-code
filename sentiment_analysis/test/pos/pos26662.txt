This is the third external usb3 solid state drive I have purchased. One was "home made" from an internal ssd placed into a usb3 enclosure, one is a 256GB Transcend and this 512GB ssd is the third. All these drives are "fast" when compared to physical disc platters but I bought this one based on some of the reviews that said this reached 450-460 MBs speed. The only thing I can say is "Not on my machines".I use a Mac and, when this arrived, I formatted the main partition for OS X. I then used the Black Magic speed test and compared all three of my drives. My "home made" drive was the slowest, presumably because the usb3 enclosure does not have a very fast interface. This drive was only marginally faster than my Transcend 256GB drive when tested on both my Mac Mini and my MacBook Pro. Both devices gave almost the exact same speeds - Read - 430 MBs, Write 310 MBs. I have seen reviews that say this drive writes at 460 MBs, but not on my Macs.Still, 430/310 MBs is reasonably fast at about half of my devices internal ssd memory so I am reasonably satisfied. I have not used it long enough to see how hot it runs or how much usb power it draws.One troubling item: This drive has disconnected itself from my Mac for no understandable reason. I do not know if this will be a constant problem or not, but it will be something I keep my eye on.
