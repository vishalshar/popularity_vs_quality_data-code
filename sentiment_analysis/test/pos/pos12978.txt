I've been using Generation 1 for many months and now have Generation 2.  In my opinion, Automatic is fantastic and is pretty ridiculously cheap for what it can do.  Let's start with a bit of an updated Gen 1 experience and then move onto Gen 2.As you probably know, Automatic can show things like how much fuel used and roughly how much you've spent on gas, how long you've driven, where you've driven, even where your car is parked.  An important feature (imo) is automatic crash notification.  You could be unconscious in a ditch and the thing may be able to call for help and report the crash and your location.  This could literally save your life.I've never used it for this purpose, but it could also help you spy on someone, as it will show where they've driven.  Maybe a cheating spouse?Automatic assigns a numerical weekly driving score.  Driving good and within the speed limit improves your score.  Driving bad (speeding, fast starts, hard stops, etc) hurts your score.  You'll hear a gentle beep (you can turn it off) when you're bad.A while back, my check engine light came on.  Automatic instantly told me what the problem was and allowed me to reset the light with a touch of my iPhone.  Very cool!If you can't tell, I'm a big fan of Automatic.  But I was intrigued by the 2nd Gen version.  I asked Automatic support about the differences between the two.  Here's the reply that I received:The 2nd generation Automatic adapter allows you to use streaming apps. Streaming apps are a new class of integrations that stream data directly from your Automatic adapter rather than from the cloud. That means that you can use apps like DashCommand, OBD Fusion, and Harrys LapTimer to read engine data in real time, with an ultra-fast refresh rate and without the delay of going up to our servers. This is made possible by some new hardware in the 2nd generation adapter, which is required to run them.The 2nd generation adapter also has its own dedicated GPS module which helps assist the app in route determination. Route capture is never 100% guaranteed solely from the 2nd generation adapter as we still depend on your phones GPS capabilities for this data, but under ideal conditions, the 2nd generation adapter will help capture trip routes when your phone isnt present. Many different factors that can influence the GPS modules ability to lock, those of which include: the car itself, structures around the car, and purely environmental things like weather.Very impressive.  So far, I only have one IFFFT recipe in place, but I hope to check out the new functionality of the device soon in other ways.Negatives?  Well, I couldn't establish a connection with my iPhone 6.  Turns out that I needed to log out of my existing Automatic account and log back in.  Not a huge deal, but something I hope they fix.  Also, sometimes I get false hard starts and especially false hard stop warnings.  In fact, quite frequently, I'll gently take my foot off the gas in a perfectly reasonable and normal way and I'll get the alert.But Gen 1 was an outstanding device and Gen 2 is much better and far more flexible and sophisticated.  Highly recommended with a 5 star rating.
