I have had my Cubii for three days now and I love it!  It's very quiet.  In fact, the only noise it makes would be from my squeaky shoes.  I leave it on level 8 and just peddle away.  Before I know it, I'm answering the phone and I'm slightly out of breath.  It took a little bit to get everything adjusted for the right fit.  The only problem is with my chair.  It's on wheels and although it came with the 'stoppers' the legs aren't wide enough to get around the Cubii.  So, I have my chair as close as possible, however, I'm also 5'2.  So, it's impossible for me to sit back in my chair, as I normally would and use the Cubii at the same time.  I tell myself that it's better for my posture and it forces me to use my core.This is an amazing product and well worth the money!
