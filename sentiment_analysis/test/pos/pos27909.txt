A fun deduction game, and it is a deduction game, you can use information to try to figure out what is going one, meanwhile the killer is trying to bend the situation to make it look like others are guilty.  Have played this game several times and it seems like the detectives are slightly more likely to win, but its pretty close.  Also the games go quickly so you will end playing several times.
