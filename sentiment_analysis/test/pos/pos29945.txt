This bike is absolutely adorable and so sturdy.  I bought this for my 4yr old daughter.  She loves it.  I added a basket on the front so she may carry her baby dolls and all her important nature finds.  The basket, which I also bought on Amazon, was the "Colorbasket 01624 Kids Front Handlebar Bike Basket" in Black.  It fits perfect and looks great.
