Had the chance to go two days of snowboarding Dec. 2 & 5 and the Outdoor Tech Chips 2.0 performed flawlessly... not one cut out at all anywhere on the mountain. They sound clear and are very loud to the point where I cannot keep them at full volume. They appear to have fix the Bluetooth problem.  I had purchased last year's model "yellow wire" and they would cut out continuously with the turn of my head or on certain parts of the mountain and I return them...that did not happen with the new "white wire" 2.0 chips headphones. Don't hesitate to purchase... well worth it you'll love them...!
