When it started hitting triple digits, our A/C wasn't keeping up in one room.  Checked the air temp coming out of the room's vent and it was 15 degrees higher than the other vents.  Figured there must be a hole in the vent, but crawling around in a 135 degree attic looking for holes in this vent than runs from one corner the house to the opposite corner sounded, well, unfun.  Don't get me wrong, the attic still wasn't fun with this doohickey, but at least I was able to find the holes in several different places in this vent as well as a few I didn't go up looking for a whole lot quicker.  Just put it on everything that's hot is orange mode and look for the dark (cool) spots.  Was able to find most of the problems before I left the air-conditioned ladder access.  Then started finding other sources of heat around the house with it.  Had a couple of "What the heck, we don't even use that anymore and it's plugged in generating heat and taking up power to do it?" moments.  I'm going to ding it for the connection though and the software though.  The software is annoying when you're trying to use it one handed.  It's easy to get into the wrong mode or screen split.  Not major, I'm going to throw this thing across the room annoying, but in a 135 degrees balancing on a 2x4 while sweating profusely I really wish I wasn't trying to find how to get it back to where it was before I accidently touched something, kind of annoying.  That's only half a star though.  The other half would be the connection.  Not sure there's a way around this, but it's really easy to knock the camera off your phone since it's basically hanging there by a micro USB connection.  Maybe a rubber band wrapped around it and your phone would be enough to fix that though.  Yes, it's expensive and I probably won't use it much more now that I've found all the air leaks in the A/C and where the warmest parts of my wife are (she doesn't think I'm funny either). But after the A/C techs couldn't solve the mystery of the warm air from one vent, (it's one vent: of course it's not a coolant issue ya dummy) it was worth it to me.  And I'm guessing it'll pay for itself (eventually) now that I'm no longer paying to cool nearly as much of the attic as I was.
