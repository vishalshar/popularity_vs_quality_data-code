Not a bad little machine for dogs who aren't afraid of the grinding sound it makes when it's pulling the ball through the chute. My dogs didn't like it so unfortunately we had to send it back.My only real feedback for the manufacturer is that the high-pitched sound it makes when you drop the ball in would work better if it went off right before the ball shoots out. My dogs would hear the noise, turn to the machine (expecting the ball to fly out), nothing would happen until a few seconds later but at the point they were off sniffing something else. Not all dogs have an exceptional attention span so it would be great if the machine got their attention right before the ball flew out - not a few seconds before.
