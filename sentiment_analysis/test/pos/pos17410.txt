It took them a bit to get the hang of using their phones as the remotes to the cars. After many years of playing with remote control cars with steering wheels and joy sticks,, i imagine the feeling would be the same as playing the original Nintendo all your life and then getting a wii or Xbox. I know it was hard for me to grasp. They mostly had the cars going in circles for awhile but it wasn't long and they were racing each other all over the house.We did have a bit of trouble getting the app to work on the iphone 4s, but after an uninstall and reinstall it worked fine. They both like that the app looks like a track and that they can race each other or you can race alone. I found the app a little distracting.  The only thing the boys don't like about these cars is they don't work as well outside in the grass or rocks. Just a small patch of pebbles can really stop their movement. They are more intended for hard surfaces or just indoor play. I would have liked them better if they came with rechargeable batteries, like a cell phone battery that could be charged by usb. 4 double a batteries for each car doesn't last them more than a couple days of all day racing through the house.Overall the quality of the cars are really great . They have took quite a few crashes and arestill working as well as the day we got them. Just a little warning to parents these cars maybe small but they do hurt when they run over your toes or hit an ankle, make sure you wear shoes and watch out for your crazy drivers.Disclaimer I received this product for free for my honest and unbiased review.
