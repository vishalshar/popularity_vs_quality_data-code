I have been using these in various sneakers for several years now.  On the advice of a friend I use only two or three per shoe depending on the shoe.  Worked much better and was much more comfortable than using then in each hole.  Each Hickey lasts about 6-8 months. I also have put the adult ones in my 8 year olds shoes and they fit fine. Never tired the smaller kid size.
