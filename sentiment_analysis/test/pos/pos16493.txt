So I got the roboraptor from amazon.com and I love it. I'm 13 years old and my mom and dad won't let me have a dog, so this what I would recommend this for people who want a pet but can't have one. Ok so let's get on with the review, so overall he is very interactive around you. He has 3 walking speeds, slow, medium, and fast.(Although the third speed is now super fast)but it can walk pretty good. Roboraptor has 4 different moods, guard mood, playful mood, curious mood, and agressive mood.So I bet your aking what do these moods do. Well in guard mood if anything comes his way he will roar and jump around to defend his territory. In playful mood he will nuzzle in your hand and be anxious to play, and he will also play tug of war wth anything in his mouth by touching a sensor on the roof of his mouth. In curious mood he will walk and if he sees something in front of him he will take a few steps backand look at it. In agressive mood, if you put your hand in front of his face he will sniff and then lunge forward and roar. There is also a button on the remote that says Demo Roam. Push that buttom and he will go through all of his programs.One more thing. He can also walk forward, backwards, and he can turn right and left in place. Well i'm gonna wrap this review up. Oh and by the way this will make a great gift for your kid.
