I am 14 and my mom bought me Spire to help me with my anxiety. To be totally honest, I love it. It has helped me so much in helping me calm down when I'm stressed. I love how easy it is to use and I believe this product is for all ages. I feel that it is better than a fitbit because it monitors more than steps. It monitors breathing, steps, tension and calm. You can also set the Spire to buzz at certain times for certain things. For example, I set mine to buzz after 5 mins of tension. As soon as it buzzes I try to calm down. If I can't do it by myself then I use the calm boost built into the app. Overall I rate this product 5 stars and I believe that it is totally worth the $150.
