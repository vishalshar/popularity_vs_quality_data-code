I purchased these Hickies for my elderly mother because the elastic shoe laces that came with her shoes would not stay in. She absolutely loves these Hickies and commented how comfortable they are, even when she wears them all day. I used the specific lacing instructions that came with the Hickies for a looser fit so her shoes would not feel tight when her feet swell. This method of lacing worked perfect for her required loose fit. I am thinking about replacing my own shoe laces with these Hickies too ... and would highly recommend them for anyone who wants their shoes to be convenient slip ons.
