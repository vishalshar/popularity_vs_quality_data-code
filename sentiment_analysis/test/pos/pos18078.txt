Very happy with ssd drive.  Drive's length and width is similar in size to a credit card, while it is a quarter inch thick.  Black magic speed test results are 349.99 mb/s write and 429.6 mb/s read.  I am not a hard drive expert but for a USB 3.0 connection i feel those speed readings are better than other similar drives.  I purchased the 256GB version and will probably buy another.  i mainly use the drive to store my windows 7 pvm and time machine back ups.
