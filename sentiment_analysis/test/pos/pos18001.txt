Ok, so this really is just a whiteboard.  But it is a really nice whiteboard with a wooden back that we use for number and letters.  It also comes with some really nice dry erase markers and a cool pouch.  My daughter really likes it and the monster game is a lot of fun.  We really like the entire Osmo set and don't mind paying a bit more if we were supporting that company.
