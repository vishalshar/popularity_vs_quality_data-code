So far, product is awesome and works as advertised. Sensors work well and the Stick (main unit) notifies me of activity almost instantly on my phone or through the website. Set-up was fairly straight forward and changing any settings on the app/website is easy. So far, I have no complaints and their customer support team seems active in helping users troubleshoot their issues.
