My cats love this litter and the auto litter box. I will need to get a couple more. I thought about buying the robot litter box, but I have 3 cats and one would guard it and not let the others use it even if it was clean. so I have to have at least several around the house, which I have the room plus a couple of cat doors, so it works. I was worried because my other litter was different, but it didn't seem matter. I also like this litter because it keeps the smell down without having an obnoxious perfume or chemical smell.
