I wouldn't put too much weight into this pillow keeping you cool as the description boasts.  Yes....push into it hard or fast enough and the perforated holes within will allow air to escape giving off the sensation of it becoming cool....but that last for about one second.  I typically "run hot" while sleeping....but I can't say that this pillow has kept me cool.  I haven't noticed a considerable change since owning it.  IMO the pillow is a little thicker than what I prefer.  Others have noted the strong odor or smell.  While it did have a smell of lavender to it....it wasn't too strong and only lasted for a week at best.  It arrived in a nicely packaged box....but it's a box....no big deal, not sure why other reviews rave so much about the packaging.  So....it's a pillow....does it's job....it's a quality product for sure....but as mentioned before....don't put too much weight into the "keep you cool" claims.
