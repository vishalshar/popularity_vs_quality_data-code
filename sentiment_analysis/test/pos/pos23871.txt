Socks are great. Not to thick, as to wearing shoes tight.  Also, the stretch around the calves is reasonable.  Not so tight, as to stop circulation. Weave is soft and easy on the feet.  Wish I had found these socks sooner.  I wear a 13 shoe and these socks are great.I have a chance to wear these socks for a week.  They are just great.  hold shape when washed and do not shrink. Very comfortable.
