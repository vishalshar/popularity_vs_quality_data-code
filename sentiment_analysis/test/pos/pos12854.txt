This is the only deodorant I use and it should be the only one you use, as well. The paste is very easy to scoop out and apply with the mini-popsicle stick provided; but, also it's just as easy to use by scooping some up with your finger. The paste is a great, smooth texture with no lumps. It smells divine--not too overly fragrant, though. Just enough lavender to feel fresh and clean without feeling like you've taken a walk through a perfume department, like other deoderants. It applies as paste and melts away, comfortably absorbed by your skin (and thank goodness we don't need to worry about any unwanted chemicals, this is as health conscious as it gets). It lasts all day. I don't need to constantly reapply it, and dude, I'm a gross sweater, so that's pretty applause-worthy.You might be worried about any pending sensitivity if you are switching from an aluminun-based deodorant (which if you are, congratulations on joining the fight against cancer!). I have very sensitive skin. Some people report redness or irritation when switching to a non-metal based product. I gave myself a weekend (2 days) of not wearing deodorant--think of it as a deodorant cleanse--before switching over to this product. I had NO problems at all. No sensitivity. However, I will say after a fresh shave, I tend to wait about an hour before applying this product. Direct application immediately after shaving gives me a 'tingling' sensation that doesn't really irritate me as much as it annoys me. Let your pores close up first. And now that we are talking about shaving, I'd like to say that this product also works really well on people with armpit hair. Just as good as it does with bare armpits! It makes no difference, so if you aren't a shaver, I'd still recommend this.
