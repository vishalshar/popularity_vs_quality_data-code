I Love this stuff.I'm using it to print parts for in and around my extruder where the temperatures get too high for parts printed with regular PLA.I printed a test piece to leave on the dash board of my RV to see how well it holds up to the heat. It hasn't been hot enough to test yet, maybe this weekend.It prints extremely well on a Lulzbot TAZ 4 upgraded with the Hexagon hot end, using the dual cooling fans and larger heat-sink fan as found on the TAZ 6. That mini blower fan is garbage, doesn't do a good job cooling the heat-sink, and should be replaced by all TAZ 5 owners.I'm printing at 215C for the hot end on PrintnZ plate (not heated).Depending upon the part, I heat treat at 170F - 210F. Smaller parts should use lower temperatures or they will soften too much.Note that the company also makes the High Temperature Coffee PLA, but it doesn't print as well (lots of oozing and color changing). The Silver Smoke HTPLA prints identically to this ICE PLA, just a different color.Freshly printed, the color is translucent. After Heat Treating, it becomes frosted. If you want it to stay translucent, just don't heat treat it. Non-Heat Treated, it is just normal PLA that won't withstand high temperatures.Attached is a photo from the company's web site that shows the difference between freshly printed, and heat treated.
