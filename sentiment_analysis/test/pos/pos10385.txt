These are really cute. They keep my 4 yr old daughter entertained. She has multiple sets, which I recomend for more building fun. The doors are a favorite feature. The magnets do not stick on each side of a piece which gets her frustrated, she usually builds and plays without the magnets though. Great travel toy. I'd recomend.
