This game is a fantastically well thought out game that we had the joy of playing three times the evening it arrived! Our eight year old son and our six year old son loved the game and had no issues learning to play. They both came out of it happy and expressed that they both love math! My wife and I had just as much playing and brushing off some of our dusty math skills. Great family game!
