I love these lifx bulbs. There are endless amounts of colors, brightness and scenes that you can set up. I have mine set up with several schedules to wake me up on work days and weekends, come on two minutes before I get home, etc. I also had a great experience when I dealt with customer support a few months ago. Highly recommended because unlike with hue, you don't need a hub with these.
