I love this thing!  I have always struggled to get my banjo tuned, this makes it so easy. My ear is good enough to tell if I am not in tune but not good enough to get in tune. The Roadie is the greatest thing ever, I wish I had one years ago. My only complaint is that the tuner pegs on by Gibson banjo are to big to fit the tuner. And the pegs on my Kentucky mandolin are too small. Looks like I might have to create some sort of adapter. But for my other two instruments in works great.
