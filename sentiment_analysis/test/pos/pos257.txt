Finally! The best of all worlds! Great sound! Great Fit! Great battery life! Excellent Bluetooth Connection! Heart Rate sensor, cadence sensor, etcetera, etcetera and etcetera! And all with absolutely NO WIRES!I have purchased and tried umpteen wireless earbuds including the highly touted Jabra Elite which were excellent except for the fit that caused discomfort in 15 minutes, pain in 30 minutes and were nearly unbearable after an hour or so - even after trying all the tip and boot combinations. I had to return those. I was pretty much ready to give up my quest for the perfect TRULY wireless earbuds when, by chance, I read about The Dash from Bragi. I decided to give one more brand a try. And Boy am I happy I did! They sound amazing. The fit is excellent. I love all the extra features. The swipe forward to increase volume and swipe back to decrease volume and the tap or tap-tap or tap-tap-tap to move forward or backwards through tracks is fantastic. There's also a tap-hold combination to FF or RR through a track. This is great when listening to audio books or Spanish lessons! I also really like the hear-through feature that I was able to customize to automatically start when I pause the current track. Also the "wind-shield" works well. I do a lot of skating and biking and when I need to hear the outside world, I don't want the wind noise inherent with those activities. The online support videos are also great! They explain exactly how to use these!I totally recommend these!! They are worth the higher cost!
