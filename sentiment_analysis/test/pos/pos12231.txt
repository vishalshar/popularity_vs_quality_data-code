My vet was thrilled when I brought her a bag of Whole Life Turkey as a gift recently.  She loved the fact that it has nothing in the bag but dehydrated TURKEY.  Also, she mentioned that there are cats that have chicken allergies and this would be a wonderful treat for them.I have been buying the Whole Life Chicken for years.  I decided to try the Turkey, and my male cat went nuts!  Turns out he likes variety too.  I shop around for the best price, and the Chicken is often out of stock.  I'm happy to discover the Turkey.
