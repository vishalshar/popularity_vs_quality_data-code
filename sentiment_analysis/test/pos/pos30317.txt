I'm one of the lucky people who had actually signed up fro this on Kickstarter, then a week or two later realized I probably won't use it enough, so cancelled my pledge.  Likely that's the only reason I have one now, since I had changed my mind and bought it here at Amazon.  Had I been one of those who pledged, I'd probably still be waiting for it.The company - horrible.  The story of their business practices is horrendous, making backers pay an additional $95 bribe to get what they paid for a few years ago already is just lousy, and I'm glad to see they're being investigated by government authorities for their business practices.That being said, I have to say I like the cooler.  I may not use the blender much, although if I find some good things to make with it, that could change, but we're not blended drinks people here.  I like the design, and the sturdiness of everything (except the handles, as others have mentioned, they're not very tight but still at least work).  I don't go to the beach, so I'm not worried about this rolling on sand.  For me, it's more likely to be used at parks, or on a boat or dock, or out the back of my car while tailgating.The battery design is decent, more like a power tool battery, and the charger is the same type of charger then, like you'd see a drill use.  Too bad they didn't use something compatible with say Black and Decker products or Ryobi or something.It does have a weight penalty, but for the things that are added here that normal coolers don't have, that's pretty much to be expected.I love the orange color, the recessed spots both on the top for cups, or even the good thinking for the UNDERSIDE of the blender side, that will hold the blender and lid while you fill it with ice.Speaker is just meh - i have better speakers I'd use instead, but at least this one is weatherproof, so it may get some use with inclement weather that would keep me from pulling out my others.I was a bit afraid of the small dimensions, but this is one of those things that the dimensions are a bit off-putting, but when you get it in front of you, it works.  Honestly, had it been larger it may have been an issue in my Jeep Cherokee with the back seats up.  At least this way it fits back there.The bungie is a good idea, but I don't know how much use I'll get out of that either.  But again, like the blender, it's there if i want.I never would've paid "retail" price for this, but having picked it up for less than some kickstarter people paid, for me it's worth it.
