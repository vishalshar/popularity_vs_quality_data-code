I have been eating these regularly for a few years now. I pack them in my carry-on while traveling or eat them pre and post workout. While I still purchase fresh bananas to use in post-workout shakes and what not, these provide a different snacking experience that I find highly enjoyable. I'm a very satisfied customer and I imagine I'll continue to eat these for years to come.I personally prefer the original style compared to any of the peanut butter/chocolate/etc covered ones.
