The handles fit and click securely together like a puzzle piece and then when you take them apart you can turn them around and slide and click the handles very securely together end to end, so you have a longer fork and spoon to be able to reach down to get the food out of the bottom of the container that you're eating out of and easily reach the bottom of the peanut butter container.Both the fork and the spoon are 5-3/4ths of an inch long by 3/4ths of an inch wide at the handles and the fork part itself is 1-1/4 inch wide and the spoon part itself is 1-1/2 of an inch wide.Both the fork and the spoon are tapered to become about 1/8th of an inch thick in the middle and it tapers to be less thick at the edges, but these are still quite strong even though they are only about 1/8th of an inch thick at their thickest point, because instead of breaking they slightly flex, but I don't know how far they will flex before they break and hopefully someone will test them to see just how far they will bend before they break, but that's not going to be me to test that. So I will wait for the breaking test hopefully to be shown on youtube.When the spoon and the fork are securely snapped together to make them longer, they become 9-1/8th inches long, which is a pretty good reach to be able to scrape the bottom of the peanut butter container or whatever you're eating out of.To see a tiny review of the GoBites 'uno' on youtube at the end of the video at (12:40) in the video look up, After the Camp - Falling Leaves Overnight AdventureThese will fit great in a Maxpedition Mini Pocket Organizer and these will just barely fit in the Maxpedition Micro.So far I have eaten cheesy lasagna and cheesy eggs and ham and I figured the fork would get cheese stuck to it and be hard to clean off, but nope, it wiped right off without sticking in the slightest. So these are much easier to clean then any utensil that I have ever had and that is very good for when I'm out camping, because it's best to have utensils and other dishes that are super easy to clean.Another great thing about these utensils is that when you attach them together you won't ever go fishing for them in your soup or stew again, because they get long enough that they won't fall and get submerged in your food and if you want to be able to find it easier when you're camping I suggest you get the red ones.
