I am very impressed with this product. It was recommended to me by a friend whose son also plays little league. The gloves my son uses are from his cousin and were getting to the point where we'd have to buy new gloves because they no longer had a grip to them.  I put just a small drop on the gloves and my son rub his hands together and the grip was back! Grip Boost showed these old gloves still have some life left in them! My son is very excited because he looks up to his cousin who plays football for the high school team so its perfect that the gloves worked out. As a few other reviewers mentioned, you really do not need much at all because a small amount works just fine.  You will waste the product if you put a whole glob of it on the gloves. I really recommend this product, and for the price you can't beat it!
