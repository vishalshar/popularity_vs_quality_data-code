I replaced a Rain Bird sprinkler controller that managed six zones in my garden with the Blossom Smart Watering Controller. Compared to the Rain Bird, what I like about the Blossom is the ability to intelligently monitor for weather in determining the watering amounts/times. However, there has not been any significant change in weather since I installed the system. So, I'm yet to experience how reliable the Internet-based weather indicator system this depends on. The other aspect I like about this sprinkler is the flexibility to configure the zones.The system was very easy to install and setup which is a big positive.I do see some improvements Blossom can make on their software app. First, I'd like to have the ability to program the zones for multiple times per day and have different times depending on the day of the week. This is not possible currently - only lets me choose one time for all days of the week. Also, I'd like to be alerted via the app (via push notification) when the sprinklers are in use - this is something that can be easily added to a revision of the app.All-in-all, its a good system and gets the work done.
