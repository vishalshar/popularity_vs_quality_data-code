What a fantastic iPhone 7 plus case! I love the idea of being able to just stick your phone on just about any type of surface. It is cool that it comes with a few different back plates to protect the suction cups when not in use. Just remember to pull the back plate off when you want to suction your phone to the wall. I almost forgot to do that on one occasion :-). Overall a really solid case, very pleased with the product!  Also the instructions are easy to follow. Looking forward to being able to buy one soon for my wife.
