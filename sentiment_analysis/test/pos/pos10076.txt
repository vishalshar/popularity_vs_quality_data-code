I like it, but my problem is that it's not compatible with my boyfriends phone. Luckily, he has a tablet  that he can use, but it's a little sad. I just wanted it to be a little more convenient. Also, I had looked up this product a while back and it was about 6 dollars cheaper. Which is not much, but still. Was kinda surprised when I went to buy it again.
