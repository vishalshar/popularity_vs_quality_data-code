A buddy and I went to a nice restaurant for dinner.  Before the main course came out, we went to the bathroom to wash our hands (we both happen to be pretty OCD about cleanliness).  We were blown away by the hand soap that was in the bathroom.  My buddy joked with the waiter that he was going to steal the soap because it was so good.  I made sure to note the name of the soap and look for it on amazon.  I've been using it ever since.  Cleans great.  Smells great.  Doesn't leave you hands feeling dry.  This has to be the most perfect hand soap I've ever experienced.
