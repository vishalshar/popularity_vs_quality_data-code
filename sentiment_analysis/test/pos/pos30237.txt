The D-Link Wi-Fi Smart Plug works great. I had it out of the box and setup and working with my Amazon Echo in less than 15 minutes. This is my third D-Link device (water sensor, siren & smart plug) so I already had mydlink Home installed on my Samsung Galaxy 7 phone and my router is also D-Link, which probably made the setup a snap.
