These taste good! I really feel much better than I did before I got Smarty Pants. I wasn't taking any vitamins at all. These were easy to remember to take because I wanted to eat them! Also- I ordered samples from the woman who created Smarty Pants and she sent them in the mail with a hand-written note. Such great care and service!
