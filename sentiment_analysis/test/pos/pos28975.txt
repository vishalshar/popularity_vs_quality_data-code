I enjoyed the smell of the soap and it made my skin feel great. Overall a good product for normal skin types. I have some back acne, but it was only able to clear it up partly through one complete use of a bar. I will need to switch to a bar more specific for back acne, but might consider coming back to charcoal soap if it clears up.
