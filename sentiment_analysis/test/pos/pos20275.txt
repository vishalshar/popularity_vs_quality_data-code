The build quality is high, and it is very easy to get started using the device.  Along with an eBow and glass slide, I have recently been using the Guitar Triller for live ambient guitar looping.  Previously, I was using pencils or wooden mallets from xylophones to achieve a bounced string effect.  The Guitar Triller has replaced these as it is much simpler to execute single string bounces.  It is a wonderful addition to my sonic toolbox as I perform, and I highly recommend the product to anyone interested interested in an easy way to get dulcimer-like tones (and more) out of the guitar.
