I like these.They are low calorie snacks and also good for you.Taste just like dried granny smith apples.Not a bad price for getting a dozen bags.They have a long shelf life as well.No added sugar, just the apples.But I do prefer the fuji apples, they are sweeter in comparison.Granny smith are more sour.
