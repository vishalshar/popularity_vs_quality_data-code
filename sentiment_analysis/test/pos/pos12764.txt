Best scale ever! I was able to pick this up on sale, it was actually cheaper than the normal body composition scale, which I had previously.. So glad I got this one! The scale looks very nice, has a low profile, and is aesthetically pleasing. I like the design a lot better than the composition scale. The body composition feature is pretty accurate (about 85% of the time). The cardio features are nice but aren't as accurate as a traditional heart rate monitor and a blood pressure cuff. Not really sure what "pulse wave velocity" means but mine shows normal so I'm not too concerned. The app is intuitive and easy to use, you can set up goals, track your progress, get detailed info about your composition, and set reminders to weigh yourself and do other things. All-in-all this was well worth the $129 I got this scale for, even if I paid full price I would still be very happy!
