I upgraded to this from the standard snap 2 and it's miles better.  The improvements I notice are1.  Less parts.  The Snap 2 was two distinct pieces for the pressure mechanism, while this one is a solid piece with cut-outs to allow the parts to separate2. Metal plate where screw meets the surface and metal reinforced plastic ensures it won't weaken over time or bend.  I live in florida and park my car outside most of the day so my snap 2 is pretty much bent and warped from the pressure/heat combo.  The old one even fell out due to the temperature changes.3. Better magnet and grip cover.  The cover is part of what makes it better, more friction and surface area so less phone sliding down because of bumps if you ever had that issue.4. Super stable.  Once screwed in I noticed the phone was moving with the body of the car.  The last model wobbled around from regular road driving and was terrible with bumps.  I noticed the phone stayed solid like it was attached to the car.Excellent product, while the snap 2 wasn't perfect it held me over for this version, can't see much they can do to improve it other than adding some sort of stabilization of the phone and the device.  Jury is still out on how it handles long bouts with the sun.
