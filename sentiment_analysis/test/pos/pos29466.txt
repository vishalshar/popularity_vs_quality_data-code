Seriously, buy it. I was a bit apprehensive of the price at first, but having used it now I can 100% say it's worth every penny. This is the best investment you'll make for your phone. Build quality is top notch, the magnet is very strong (sticks to my fridge with no other attachments needed) and the way it feels in your hand is unlike any other case. I've tried many different cases for my iPhone, and this is the best one out there if you want something both unique and highly functional.
