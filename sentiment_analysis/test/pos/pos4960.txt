The amazfit is stunning in this band. It is smooth to the touch and resembles a jade.  It looks very nice in the watch and I get a lot of compliments on it. The watch band runs small so keep that in mind when you order it. They should make different size bands like the other trackers do. I have had no problems with syncing it up with my phone like the other reviewers have stated and it charges just fine and the charge lasts for me two weeks before I need to charge it again. I also ordered the Amazfit necklace and it also looks very stunning with the tracker but doesn't track sleep while in the necklace so I might be returning it.
