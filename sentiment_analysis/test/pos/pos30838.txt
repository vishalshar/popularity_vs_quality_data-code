I only had 5 meals with this trio so far but like it a lot. I use this for lunch at work and caught some attention already.  The box won't last long in my opinion and potentially become separate since I open and close it twice day every day.  Being Asian I wish the maker would sell a set that also had a set of chopstick in it.  That would make really awesome.
