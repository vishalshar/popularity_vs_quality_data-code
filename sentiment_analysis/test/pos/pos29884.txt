This little thing packs a punch! There are 10 different sounds as well as a  volume control for personal preference. I keep it set on the same one and turn it on when ready to sleep - only one button to press when you find your perfect sound.I mainly bought this because I cannot fall asleep when hubby is snoring - there are only so many times you can poke someone and grit your teeth before you start to debate sleeping on the couch! I keep it on a very low noise level - The gentle hum is soothing and helps me mentally block his snoring out and fall asleep.Giving it 4 stars - would be 5 with a few additional types of sounds. Otherwise, great quality and size! Will bring this along to travel!
