My husband and I decided to purchase pillows from different companies to compare how we like them.  He bought one that cost significantly more than the one I got from PharMeDoc.  Verdict:  I haven't gotten a good, full night sleep since.  Why?  Because he likes my pillow so much he keeps trying to steal it from me during the night - lol.  Great pillow - Love it!!!
