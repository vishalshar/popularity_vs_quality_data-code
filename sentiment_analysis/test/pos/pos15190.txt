This thing is simply amazing. Do not pay for the assembly...it's comically easy to put together. My first day, I did a mile, and no one knew I was exercising. Absolutely silent, and the app on the phone counts your exercise in real time. I was so pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to put together, and how wonderfully it works. It costs a bit more than other types, but after reading reviews, I chose this one, and I'm so glad I did!
