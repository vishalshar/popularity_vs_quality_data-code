The good news is this product works as I expected. My son gave our dog a treat all the way from Australia.  The setup and app is not perfect, and here are a few pointers.  1) When setting up the first time, it's best to do so near the router.  The initial installation requires a stronger signal than to use the unit. 2) it's not real clear how to access on the app.  The small dinosaur icon at the top activates the pet cam.  3) lastly, only one person can view at a time.  I had multiple family members saying they could not connect, and it's because someone else was already connected.  There is no indication other than the app spins balls indefinitely.  The treats, video, night vision, and audio all work great!  It's also bigger than I expected so it just sits on the floor next to our dogs bed.  Nice product!
