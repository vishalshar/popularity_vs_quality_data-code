Has been very sturdy in holding up to the jaws of our cat who loves to chew cords.  Still going strong!Update: about 8 months later, the cable would work sporadically charging our phones, and eventually no longer charged. Contacted Fuse Chicken and after some troubleshooting and it still not working, they replaced it for us. Also of note, the maker required us to break the charger and send a photo of evidence before replacing... it took pliers and lots of muscle to break the charging end off, so not sure how others are breaking in a day.
