My pup goes crazy for the ifetch but hasn't figured out that she has to drop the ball into the hole to play with herself so she just yaps at me to drop the ball in.  4 stars because the trajectory and strength varies each time we play with it.  Brand new batteries and same setting.  Hope this lasts.
