This is a great addition to the Rachio 2 Controller which is much better than the description would lead you to believe.  I knew I needed it, so neglected to read the reviews...something I normally always do.  As a result I wasted time thinking about how I'd wire up the new controller which is replacing my existing hardwired Rain Bird controller.  I was pleasantly surprised to see there is an outlet in the enclosure and plenty of room to mount the "brick" power supply.  As a result it was a simple matter to make a neat wiring job.  I agree with another reviewer that Rachio ought to show more pictures and promote their excellent product a bit more.  This is an excellent product for anyone mounting their Gen 2 Rachio outside.
