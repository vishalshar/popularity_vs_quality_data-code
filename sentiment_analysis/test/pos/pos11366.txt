We love this collar.  We already had the in-ground fence for our bigger dog, and we bought this to add our new little dog.  It worked perfectly.  I highly recommend it.  Here are two tips to make the most of this collar.Batteries:The battery plugs don't last as long as the one in the big collars, and cost $8 or more to replace.  The good news is that you can re-use the plug and just replace the battery inside for $1.50.  Here is a video I made, showing how to replace the battery: [...]Flags:Pet-Safe provides little flags to show your dog the boundry.  They are ok, but your dog must learn that they can't go between the flags either.  Instead of flags, we used a rope.  This made is really easy for our dog to know the boundry.  She had it down within a week.
