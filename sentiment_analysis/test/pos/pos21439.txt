This thing is rock solid on my bike. Have taken a hard fall and my iphone did not budget. However the design makes it bulky in the pocket and the big opening for the mount makes it a dirt collector. Still for a long bike ride, it is well worth taking a moment to add and remove the case. Easy. Toss your dedicated bike computer and use run keeper for much better data and display.
