I love Morning Pep Xylitol because it is made from birch and not corn.  It's non-gmo and gluten free!  It melts evenly in hot water and lightly sweetens my match tea without being too sweet.  I don't get a sugar crash which is why xylitol is my favorite sweetener.  I've even used it in baked goods with excellent results.  Love!
