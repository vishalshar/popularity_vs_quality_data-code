I walk my dogs in the wee hours of the morning, and feel a little safer having a personal alarm. I think the startling effect alone would buy precious time if there were ever an assailant.My only wish was that the included clip attached to the alarm itself, as opposed to the pull-away activation piece. If I was in an emergency situation, it's likely that I would want the alarm to stay attached to my body, as opposed to having the pull-away activation piece attached to my body and the alarm in my hand (where it could be dropped, or grabbed and thrown). I would rather drop the activation piece and keep the alarm attached to me. I might replace the clip with a small carabiner that would fit the alarm better.Other than that, it's easy to carry and the piercing alarm is an attention-getter. Is it enough to bring neighbors out of their homes at 4:30 in the morning? I hope I don't have to find out!
