These are awesome as far as durability and cleaning ease. If you freeze something in them, just place in hot water to loosen material inside to pop out and then microwave or cook on the stove.I sometimes use for small batches of pancakes to be frozen. The problem with taking them in and out of the freezer is the lack of ease to open these bags primarily when very cold. I have to warm the seam with my hands and then work it open. The strength of the seal is a good thing to keep food fresh and either dry or moist, but they really should have made the flap at the top a good inch or so...maybe just a pull tab sort of design. This would make these bags a lot easier to open. I have tiny hands, but I still have a hard time opening these when the material is very cold. There just is not enough bag material at the top to pull on for opening.*BlueAvocado...please consider improving your design with added material at the top to help with opening.*Otherwise, these are super sturdy and I think they were built to last, as long as you don't tear them when trying to open. To dry after hand washing, I just prop them open with a small wooden utensil perpendicular to the seam, and set it upside down on the rack. It only takes a moment to do this.
