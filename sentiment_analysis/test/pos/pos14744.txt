From time to time I go to the beach and start a fire in one of the fire pits. With the ocean spray it always takes a little longer to start a fire and I'm always looking for something to make that task a little easier.Normally I use paraffin wax with wood chips in a little paper cup. It's slow, but it always does the trick. I've tried other products to make life easier and non worked better than the paraffin wax with wood chips - until now.I bought the Instafire Fire Starter Pouches. It says each pouch can start 4 fires, but I decided to go big or go home and used one whole pouch. I've never started a fire with so little effort. It was wonderful. Within a few minutes I had a big fire going.
