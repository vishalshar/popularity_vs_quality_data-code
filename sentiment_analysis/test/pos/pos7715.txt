I buy this bread mix for my family, since 3 of us are gluten and grain sensitive.  We have not experienced any allergic reaction to this bread.  We do refrigerate the loaf to keep it fresh, so it can get a little dry, but we heat up our slice (add a little bit of butter) and it softens up.  It can't really be compared to traditional wheat/white bread as far as texture and taste, but all in all, it is a good substitute when you have gluten sensitivities like my family. I think it's a matter of becoming accustomed to a different texture and taste that almond flour gives to bread.  We enjoy it and therefore will keep buying it again and again. :)
