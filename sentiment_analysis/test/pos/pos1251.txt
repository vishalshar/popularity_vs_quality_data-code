I'm very impressed with Misfit products. I started with the low-cost Shine but after the band broke I decided to upgrade to the Ray. It's the only fitness tracker I've seen that both looks good (not like a fitness tracker but more like a bracelet) and does the job I want, which is to remind me to keep moving and allow me to track my movement and sleep. I also like that I don't have to remove it to re-charge, shower, or swim. I have also had consistently great interactions with customer service, when my Ray's lights were sporadically malfunctioning (although the phone app was accurate), I emailed through the Misfit website and got a response within a few hours. They confirmed the problem was a known issue and replaced my Ray within a few days. I have small wrists and was concerned the Ray might look bulky, but it fits fine and the black standard plastic band looks good as well.
