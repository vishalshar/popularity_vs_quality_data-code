Here's the deal - straight and simple. Printer works well. Prints in seconds and delivers adequate photo quality. App scanner still kind of glitchy so if the main draw for you is the moving pictures, I'd either hold off or mentally prepare myself to be very patient. It works, it just takes a while. All in all, a really cool product that I do not regret buying.
