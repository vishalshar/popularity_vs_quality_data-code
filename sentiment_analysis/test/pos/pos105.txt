Happy with the correct reviews I read before purchasing this! Really small but really awesome! My husband hates that I always need our little (but loud) fan on. Complained all.the.time. So I bought this. It can be directed at me on my side of the bed and I hear it just fine but he doesn't really notice it from his side. I must have that fan sound or I can't sleep!!!! I think this little machine just saved our marriage. Haha
