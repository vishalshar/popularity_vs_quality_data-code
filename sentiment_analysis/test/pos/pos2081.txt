Having replaced many iPhone screens for myself or friends (I am not a commercial user and do not do this professionally) I have seen and used a wide array of replacement IOS screens. This is by far the best I have seen and well worth paying the extra money. Other cheaper screens have been damaged in the box, been defective (which you can only know once installed and powered on) or simply come with poor quality tools or missing many peripherals. This screen came with GOOD tools for the job that actually fit the screws, it has a direct link for a video that the company produced themselves to walk through the replacement if you're not familiar which is an excellent tutorial, it fit well (wasn't too thick like some aftermarket replacements) and functioned perfectly.
