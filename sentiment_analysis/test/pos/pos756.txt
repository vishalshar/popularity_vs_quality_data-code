By remembering my parked location, the Zus charger has saved me from wandering around a large parking lot many times. The double reversible USB ports charge my devices in very little time. The USB ports are reversible. I've never seen this type of feature before. It allows you to insert your charging cable either way so you don't have to fumble wit the cable. The ports are subtly lit which enables you to see the ports in there dark. Three small lights on the top industry that your Zus is connected. Those is a very well made item and is a necessity for every vehicle.
