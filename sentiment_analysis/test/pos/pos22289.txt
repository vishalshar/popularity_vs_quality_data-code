Just tried this after trying an edamame based pasta substitute that was pretty terrible. My friend recommended this brand so I thought I'd give it a try. Can't say enough about this pasta! It tasted so great and like pasta. After living in Italy for a month and gaining a few too many pounds, Ive been very hesitant about my pasta intake, but this is definitely a guilt-free way to enjoy my pasta!  I would say for a softer, less al dente feel to cook it closer to 8 minutes than 6 minutes. 6 boxes are great! I will definitely be using them and giving some to my friends to try.
