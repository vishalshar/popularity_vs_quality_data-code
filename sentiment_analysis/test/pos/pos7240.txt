BRAND NEW PHONE WORKS WELL WITH CRICKET WIRELESS JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A NANO SD CARD BECAUSE THE MICRO SD CARD WONT FIT  (TOO BIG) CRICKET CHARGED ME 10$ TO SWITCH SD CARDS IF YOU DONT HAVE AN SD CARD BUT YOU ARE A CRICKET CUSTOMER THEY WILL STILL GIVE YOU ONE  AND STILL CHARGE 10$ NO PRICE CHANGE. AND THE CHARGER OR THE "USB TYPE C " CHARGING CABLE THAT COMES WITH IT WILL WORK WITH ANY USB CHARGER WALL OUTLET, DONT LET THE PLUG FOOL YOU. PHONE IS VERY SLIPPERY SO MAKE SURE YOU DO GET A CASE AND A SCREEN PROTECTOR OH AND PHONE RUNS HOT HEAR THE TOP BACK  NEXTBIT SAYS ITS "NORMAL" AND THERE WORKING ON WHATS CALLED A "THERMAL HOT FIX UPDATE" TO REDUCE SOME OF THE HEAT. I MEAN THIS PHONE RUNS HOT TO THE TOUCH LIKE WOW BUT STILL RUNS AND OPERATES FINE OTHER THAN THAT PERFORMANCE ON THE CRICKET WIRELESS NETWORK IS AMAZING. DOWNLOAD SPEEDS AND WEB BROWSING IS DECENT THIS PHONE STANDS OUT FROM THE REST AND I HAVE HAD PEOPLE COME UP TO ME AND ASK WHAT TYPE OF PHONE I HAD.  I HAVE THE CRICKET 70$ UNLIMITED PLAN. AND I WAS COMING FROM A SAMSUNG GALAXY GRAND PRIME. AND IM GLAD I MADE THE SWITCH HOPE I HELPED AND IF YOU NEED QUESTIONS LET ME KNOW ILL ANSWER THEM (FOR CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE CRICKET WIRELESS)
