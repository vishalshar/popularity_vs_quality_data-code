I hardly ever write reviews but these things are awesome. the hold my shoes on just as if they had laces (big surprise). If you put a blind fold on me and had one of my shoes laced and another with the Hickies i wouldn't be able to tell which was which. Those that complain that they are too loose or too tight etc... Please read the instructions and go to the website there are many different ways to install these plus you can mix and match the techniques to get just the right fit. I have there on some New Balance 575s and i used the normal technique on all but the bottom lace holes where is used the tight method because i like it tighter around my toes. Bottom line is now i can slip on my shoes super quick and have them be just a secure as they would with laces and not be too loose like purpose built slip ons.
