This is a cool little device. I put it on my keys. Through the app, you can sound a chime to find your keys or turn on a blinking light on the device, which I found handy when my keys were buried at the bottom of my purse. You can also use the button on the tracker to find your phone, and you will - the alarm is LOUD. The camera feature is especially cool - you can use the tracker to active the camera function and take a picture on iPhone (I have an iPhone 5c). Since it operates via Bluetooth, I was worried about it draining my battery. I turn it off when my keys are nearby, and turn it on when I need to activate the tracker, which seems to work fine without reducing my phone's battery life. This worked well for me last last week when when I wasn't sure if I left my keys in my office bathroom or kitchen. I turned on bluetooth, activated the chime, and found my keys immediately.The reason I am giving it four stars instead of five is that the instructions for set up and use aren't detailed enough. For instance, you have the ability to set up alerts based on how far away the tracker is from your phone, but those ranges are just described as "getting lost" and "out of range." I would like more specifics, especially since the phone alarm is super loud - I wouldn't want it to go off every time I leave my office for a work meeting without my keys. When I was setting up the device, I kept accidentally setting off alarms because I wasn't sure what the buttons in the app were for. I figured it out after a few tries, but better instructions in the app would make this a 5-star product.
