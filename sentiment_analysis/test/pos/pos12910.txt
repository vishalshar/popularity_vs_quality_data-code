The projector came with almost all of the accessories that you would need.  It has various cables for charging via the micro usb port.  There were various adapters including an HDMI to micro HDMI converter.  For my specific setup I needed a HDMI male to male adapter, and this wasn't included.  I had one laying around, but wish they included that.The projector itself feels very solid, being encased in aluminum on 4 sides.  The remote is a little flimsier because it's plastic, but it feels sturdy enough.The fact that the entire unit is battery powered for up to 90 minutes really blows my mind.  If you fed it with a memory card, you can literally take it anywhere and play movies on any surface.  For my first use, I went and set up a projection on the ceiling so that I could lay down and watch a movie up in the sky.  It was a ton of fun, and I watched a few Netflix episodes.The quality is quite good from a few feet away, but if you get up close you will notice that the blacks are pretty noise, and that due to the lower resolution of the projection HD content can become a little pixelated.  This isn't really noticeable when watching standard content, but when looking at text it can become apparent.If I were setting up a home theatre, I would spend $600-$1000 and permanently mount a projector.  This device is geared towards being ultra portable.  You could bring it to your friends house and project a video on the bedroom wall.For the price and size, I give it a 5/5.  If you go and compare it to a full sized projector, then obviously the results are quite weak, but as I said before, if you are looking for a permanent solution, then don't look at a micro projector.
