These are good sized and have nice, fresh flavor. If you like them a little spicy, these are the ones for you. I was surprised that they had a good pepper/spiciness. On the other hand, if you're a Plain Jane, pick a different flavor. They are a little softer/moist than other brands I have tried, and there's no snap when you bite into it. Not a deal breaker for me. Would recommend to friends and buy again.
