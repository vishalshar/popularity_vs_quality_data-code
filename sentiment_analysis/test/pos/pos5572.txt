Easy set up with clear directions, easy to use. Fall notification works really well. Overall, this is a good product. I am concerned abt the too short length of battery time.  With the regular 5 star program, battery life was over 40 hours. Now, with the fall protection, battery life is about 16 hours before it dies.
