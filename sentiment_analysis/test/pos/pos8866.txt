I have a very artistic 10yr old daughter who loves art projects.  She was very interested in using the 3Doodler to make some various 3D Art around the house.SETUP- Very easy overall- Insert the colored plastic of your choice into the top of the unit once the pen heats upDOODLING-Once the plastic is loaded and the pen is hot, there are two choices (FAST/SLOW)-I highly recommend that you download some design ideas from the internet (the 3Doodler website has plenty) as it helps you to trace the design.-It reminds me a lot of drawing with a hot glue gun if that makes any sense.  You're pulling a heated plastic around on the paper trying to make a design.RESULTSMy daughter and I tried several different projects from a Minecraft Creeper head to a pair of glasses.  Ironically, the glasses turned out really well and she likes wearing them around the house now!  The Creeper head I think had too many turns required and I found it really difficult to meld six different sides of the head to form one cube.REFILSYou will quickly go through the initial pack of plastic fills that they give you.  This is where it gets really expensive in my mind.  Most of the refills such as this one: 3Doodler Bohemian Blend ABS Mixed Plastic 3D Printing Pen (x25 Strand) range from $9-$15, with some going up to $20.  For simple strands of plastic I would have expected a $5-10 range instead of $10-20 range.  You go through them so quickly on some projects and of course you need specific colors to make it work, thus requiring more frequent refills just to get a specific color.All in all I think it's a fun toy, but it's just that....a toy.  Do not think you're going to 3D print something by hand with this thing.  My 10yr old daughter loves it and I think that's about age appropriate for what it does.
