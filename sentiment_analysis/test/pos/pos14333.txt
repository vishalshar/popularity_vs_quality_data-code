This thing is awesome. I had it in my saved items for a while and threw it in my cart on a whim to hit a $35 minimum. I'm so glad I did. It works very well, exactly as described. The packaging is beautiful, the back isn't too tacky/sticky, and the case itself is a thin, attractive, and high-quality plastic. If it sounds like something you could use and you're in the market for a new case, definitely go for it! (Unexpected surprise: it's listed at $39.99, but dropped to $32 once I added it to my cart. Not sure why, but bonus!)
