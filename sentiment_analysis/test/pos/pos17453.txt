I received my first Roost battery as a Christmas gift and LOVED it--so much so that I ordered a second one for my basement.The battery arrived quickly and setup was easy, but when it came time to test the alarm, the battery wouldn't send an alert to the app despite the audible ringing of the smoke detector.After contacting Roost customer service (which is great, by the way) and swapping Smart Modules, the problem seemed to be fixed. That is, until I checked the status of the battery a few days later and found it offline. Another email to customer service and this time they updated the firmware on my batteries.The problem seems to be fixed--for now.At the end of the day this is a great concept and I like the product. I just get they sense that sometimes they are still working the kinks out. Definitely going to stick with it, though!
