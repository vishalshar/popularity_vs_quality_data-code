Okay as a contact wearer with super sensitive eyes, I had to stop wearing normal mascara. I then found neutrogena lash tint, which was safe for lens wearers and added just a touch of black to my lashes versus globs of black tar. Then of course, it was discontinued and I had to stop wearing anything. I found one lash tint at ulta that was $25 and I walked out because it was too expensive, and the ingredients scared me (It mentioned discoloring my skin and eyes. Um, what? No.)Enter this amazing little product. A natural lash conditioner with a hint of color. And under $20. THANK YOU. It never bothers my contacts, comes off easily at night, yet does not run if I cry. If you are looking for a natural alternative to wearing mascara or have super sensitive eyes give this a try. Please note this does NOT give you mascara coverage. It's just adds a touch of black conditioner into your lashes. If natural coverage is what you want, this is way you need.
