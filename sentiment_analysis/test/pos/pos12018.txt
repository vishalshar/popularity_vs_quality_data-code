I bought Pavlok after getting tired of a bad habit I've had since I was a child (now I'm in my 40s) of chewing or biting my tongue, cheeks or lips.  It started to get painful and just looked silly.  After receiving the Pavlok I only used it when I started the bad habit, never as practice. It didn't take long.  It was calibrated stronger than I liked, so I connected with the app and adjusted it lower.  I shocked myself around 10 times the first day, and after a week it was down to 0.  After a couple months, I found myself starting to fall back into old habits. I put it back on and just a few jolts have it back in line.  I've had a few questions about it and I just defer saying "its like a fitbit" to most people. It is completely discrete so no one has noticed when I use it, even in a meeting or in a social setting.  Also, I used a different charger than came with it and it will buzz constantly when charged. Just use the charger that came with it and there's no issues.Great device that has broken a 40 year bad habit in a week.  That's a great value and wish I had done this ages ago.  I don't think snapping a rubber band on my wrist would have the same effect, and would be much more conspicuous.
