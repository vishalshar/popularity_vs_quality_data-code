These are so easy to use, a perfect tool for ensuring beginners (like me) get good results.I've made small batches of lacto fermented cucumbers, jalepenos, zucchini, and green tomatoes and all came out well with no sign of the white yeast that had been plaguing my pre-pickle pipe ferments. Great design - I love the simplicity of this airlock. Throw some vegetables and brine into a Mason jar, top with pickle pipe, and forget about it for a week. Foolproof.
