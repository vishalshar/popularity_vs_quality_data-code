As a frequent traveler who was in need of a luggage upgrade, I couldnt be happier with my new Bluesmart carry on.  It meets or exceeds all of the requirements of a standard carry on, and adds some truly revolutionary features.  Ive recently used the Bluesmart to fly to a wedding, train home for the holidays, and fly to a ski mountain, and Im confident I will never use any bag or suitcase other than the Bluesmart for any other such trips ever again!I first used the Bluesmart while flying from New York to the Midwest for a wedding.  I was able to pack all me wedding attire  including dress shoes and a suit  very comfortably; no wrinkles!  The Bluesmart fit easily into the overhead compartment and was very durable  no dings or scratches even after being banged around a fair bit.  The Bluesmart really came in handy, though, on the trip home.  After neglecting to charge my phone after getting back to the hotel late after the wedding reception, I had barely any charge left by the time I got through security at the airport.  Instead of fighting for a (very scarce) outlet at the gate, I plugged my phone straight into the Bluesmart and recapped the previous night via text with my friends as my phone charged and I waited for my flight.  I ended up having enough battery to get me through the flight and for the cab ride back to my apartment.For my next trip with the Bluesmart, I brought it on the train with me for the trip home to Boston from New York for Christmas.  I was able to pack some Christmas gifts as well as a long weekends worth of winter clothes with no issues.  This time, the Bluesmart feature that was extra helpful was the easy access opening to the front pocket.  I had slipped my 15 inch laptop into the front pocket with the expectation that I wouldnt have to do any work on the train but that Id need it over the weekend at my parents house.  However, half way through the train ride I received an e-mail via phone that I had something that needed to be completed that night.  Having to dig my laptop out of a traditional carry on wouldve been a nightmare; considering it was peak holiday travel time, the overhead storage space on the train was packed to the brim, and it wouldve been nearly impossible to open up a traditional carry on and dig out a computer.  However, I simply unlocked the top compartment and slipped my laptop right out (see photo) without having to move the Bluesmart or any other travelers suitcase.  The easy access front compartment is a unique feature that, as I can already attest to, will certainly come in handy for future business travel.Finally, my most recent trip with the Bluesmart was a ski trip from New York to Jackson Hole.  I was worried that I wouldnt be able to fit all my bulky ski clothing in the Bluesmart for the long weekend trip, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I had more than enough room for multiple sweatshirts, sweatpants, beanies, and other associated snow gear (see photo).  A cool feature that I havent seen on other carry ons that proved valuable was the zippered divider between the main compartment of the suitcase and the outer shell.  I ended up packing a couple of swimsuits in this outer compartment (see photo) with the idea that they might still be a bit damp from the hot tub by the time I needed to pack for the return journey, and I didnt want them to soak the rest of my gear.  The divider successfully kept my clothes in the main compartment dry, and it made for a more pleasant unpacking and less laundry when I got home to New York.Overall, I couldnt be more pleased with the Bluesmart.  It has surpassed my initial expectations and has significantly reduced the stress of travel.  I highly recommend this product  5 stars!
