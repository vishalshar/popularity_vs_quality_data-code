I'll begin with the fact that I am neither a Videophile or a Techie, and even for me, the Cube was very easy to set up; all of the cords were very clearly marked and the quick start guide was written in lay person English. It did take me a couple of trips to find an adapter to use for the iPhone, (Lightning Digital AV Adapter https://amzn.com/B009WHV3BM). Next time I'll just order off of Amazon and save myself the trouble. Once plugged in and connected, the experience was seamless. I used the included remote to select Devices and that was it, "Zaboomafoo" was playing on my wall to a rapt audience of two small boys. After the show, we projected bat images from a google image search to trace onto paper and cut out for Halloween decorations. I didn't have to change any settings in the projector to go from Video to Slideshow.For my purposes this is an awesome little projector. It is so tiny and portable, it will be perfect for trips and hotel stays to keep the kids busy with streaming video, projecting slideshows for the grandparents, and my random crafty projects that I never seem to finish. We are looking forward to using it on our next car camping trip and the hubby is planning on borrowing it to project soccer games out in "Manland" (the garage). The battery life is only 90 minutes, but you can keep it plugged in while playing to watch longer movies. The picture showed up perfectly indoors on a wall on a bright day. Granted the picture quality is not as bright or sharp as the television, but I wasn't expecting a projector to match the picture of a nice television. The speaker quality also isn't great, but that is expected for such a small projector. I've read in other reviews that you can use the headphone jack for small external speakers (the kids don't really care about audio quality so we are all good as is). The hum of the projector fan is also audible, it was not an issue for us, but I wouldn't try and watch "Pink Floyd The Wall" or Kubrick's "Space Odyssey" on it either.The included mini-tripod is very handy and packs away easily in the packaging which is nice enough to keep for storage for all of the cords and parts. The projector itself feels sturdy and well made, all of the buttons and ports don't feel cheap or wobbly, and the metal case is such a nice change from the sea of black plastic cases out there. This would be the perfect gadget to have on hand for a wedding rehearsal or birthday party where you want to show a group of people photos or video without going to the trouble of hiring/renting all the AV equipment.All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase and look forward to using it a lot.
