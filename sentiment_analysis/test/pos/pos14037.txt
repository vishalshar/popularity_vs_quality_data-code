For around the same price you can buy other headphones with the exact same sound quality, but what separates this pair from the rest is its metal build. They feel durable not like its plastic competition. They fit snugly and comfortably. Also the don't scream "look at me and my razor sharp lazer light spaceship design,"which was something i was looking for. I love these headphones and they're definitely worth getting.
