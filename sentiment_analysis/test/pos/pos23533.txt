I'd been looking for a way to mount my Samsung Galaxy S2 in my car.  Suction cup...no.  Ripping my dash apart and drilling...no.  Then I happened upon the Mountek CD mount.  It's just perfect.  I have never used my CD player in my car, so I was happy to be able to use it for something.  It does cover my radio when I install it with the insert up, but I have volume and channel controls on my steering wheel, so it's not a problem.  I can install it with the insert down, but it raises the phone up too much for my comfort and, you can't rotate it down as much when it's in this position.  It does have an adjustment screw (use a penny to unscrew it) to adjust the rotation, but I haven't played with that yet.  Because it's in my CD player, I can easily reach it if I have to but, I find with Vlingo and my a2dp BT headset, I don't have to touch it.It takes, literally, 10 seconds to install it and it's secure.  The phone doesn't shake, vibrate or move at all.  It's solidly installed and just absolutely perfect.  It's easy to take off and take with me when I change cars.  It's made well and appears to be quite sturdy.  It adjusts to fit any phone.  I keep my Galaxy S2 off center a little to keep the volume and power buttons free.  I plug it into the sound port and power port in my dash and it works fine.  The wires are a little much, so I'll wrap those.I wish I had stock in this company.  Do yourself a favor.  Get the best car mount for your cell phone you'll ever find.  It's wonderful to buy something that actually works out of the gate and have it work so perfectly.
