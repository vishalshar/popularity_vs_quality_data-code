I enjoy using this during hunting season. I also use this at my work to locate water leaks underground on roads and yards to see temp change.  Only downfall is cannot use this if phone is in any type of case. Wish the Lightning plug was longer to  accommodate phone cases. However you can purchase short extension cables but then have to hold both.  The case protects it when not in use.
