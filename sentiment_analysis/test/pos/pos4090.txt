Just received this and used in coffee.  YUM!  Another reviewer commented that this tasted like vanilla pudding, and I agree;  it does indeed without the sweetness, of course.  This is an extremely tasty product, and I highly recommend it.**I've now had this for a few days, and I cannot keep myself from having a taste several times a day! It is silky smooth and absolutely luscious.  I love ghee, and this is the best I've found.  I will definitely be trying some of their other flavors.
