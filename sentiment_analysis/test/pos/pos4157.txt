I have been wanting a smartwatch for a long time, but there were not any that piqued my interest - until I found the Vector Luna. This watch is a watch. That statement may seem obvious, but so many smartwatches nowadays try to be 100 different things at once. This is simply a watch that happens to show you notifications from your phone. Several people have asked me what kind of watch I'm wearing, and when I tell them that it's a smartwatch they are amazed since they thought it was just a traditional analog watch.The Vector Luna uses a round LCD screen, but it is monochromatic. If you have ever seen an e-Ink display it is very similar to that. It has a blue-hued backlight which you activate by pressing the main button (so you can read it at night). But in normal lighting conditions it is easy to read with its black and white graphics.  Some reviews of the watch complained that the screen wasn't high-resolution, however the screen looks pretty darn sharp to me.  This monochrome display plays a big part in the Vector Luna's ability to last up to 30 days on a single charge. In reality, I've been able to get about 3 weeks of use before requiring a recharge. That is still amazing, considering devices like the Moto 360 and Apple Watch require charging once per day.I also need to take a moment to personally thank Vector for making the Vector Watch app available on WINDOWS PHONE!! I am a devout Windows Phone user, and this is the first smartwatch that works flawlessly with it. The Vector Luna paired easily with my Lumia 950, and the app is functionally identical to the iOS and Android offerings.  So for all my Windows Phone homies out there, this is the watch for you!
