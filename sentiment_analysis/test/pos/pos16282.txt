I am pretty rough on my phones and this case handles my clumsiness. I love that it is magnetic. I can put my phone at eye level on the fridge and see recipes as I cook. It's awesome.i would have given it a 5 but I was disappointed the case doesn't come with the back hole cover. It's a separate purchase, but I am very grateful the company sent one to me free of charge. Also, the magnet would be more helpful in the center of the case, it's on the lower 1/3 portion of the case, so when I use it long ways while I'm driving (for gps) it tends to tilt awkwardly. Other than that, it's great. I've had it on my phone for about 8 months now.
