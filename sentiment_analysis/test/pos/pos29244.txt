I love music. I've worked and traveled in the entertainment industry for years, so quality sound with ease and low weight/compact ratio is a must. I have traveled with the Bose SoundLink Mini Bluetooth Speaker II, Harman Kardon Esquire Mini Speaker, and Rocksteady XS- all great speakers! The Libratone ZIPP Mini sounds better than all of them, yes its a tad bit bigger however the sound is clean and bright with a deep bass that makes you believe its much bigger than it actually is! It's super easy to connect to using the app, bluetooth, and Spotify.I would buy more of these to link up all the rooms in my house...if I had a bigger house! Would definitely purchase this item again.
