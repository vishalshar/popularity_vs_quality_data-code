I'm a weekend warrior playing fastpitch and slowpitch softball in competitive tournaments. I've been burning through $30 Franklin batting gloves every six months and was looking for a solution to increase the life of the batting gloves while maintaining good bat grip. I recently picked up some Grip Boost and it works well to address both of these problems. I have found the more porous leather grips like Franklin Batting Gloves (image attached) tend to require multiple applications of Grip Boost versus cheaper batting gloves with slicker leather/ rubber/ plastic surfaces. This stuff is clean and doesn't leave residue on bats or batting gloves.  On the con side, it does leave the batting gloves feeling like dried leather after use. I have only tested for 1 week, but have been pleased with the results. I will update this review after a month.
