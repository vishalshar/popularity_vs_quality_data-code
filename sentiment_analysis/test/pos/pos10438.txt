This is just what I was looking for! I make my own iced coffee and simple syrup and have been looking for a decent mason jar cover with a pour spout. I tried making my own (pintrest fail, lol) but a quick amazon search and I was able to find exactly what I needed. It makes getting into my coffee and sugar much easier and keeps the sides of the jar clean - very few drips. I will definitely be ordering more, I use mason jars for everything!
