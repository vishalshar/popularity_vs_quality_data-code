This is a great product!!! My hair is thinning, so I only need it along my part because I'm self-conscious about my scalp. I shake the bottle with the cap on, then lightly shake just over the part. I pat it down with my fingers and spray a little hairspray. Takes 30 seconds...but blends perfectly and lasts all day. I bought the small size to try it, but I will be ordering the larger size ASAP!
