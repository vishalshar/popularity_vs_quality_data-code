We like cheese in this house - really good, expensive cheese.  But there are only 2 of us so sometimes we don't get around to eating it before it goes "off".  This paper actually does extend the life of your cheese.  We can get at least an extra 2 weeks plus when we use this paper.  It's worth the investment when you consider throwing away an expensive piece of cheese :(This is a 2-layer "paper".  The inside is a plastic & the outside is kind of a waxy paper/parchment.  You can cut the sheets in half if you have a smaller piece of cheese to store.These are manufactured in France.  I have found these for less money in markets in Europe so if you are there, seek them out!  Ask a cheese monger if he will sell it to you.  It makes a really good souvenir.
