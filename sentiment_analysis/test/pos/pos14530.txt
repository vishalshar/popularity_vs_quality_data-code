I bought this broom for outside work to replace the hand-me-down kitchen broom I'd inherited when my wife bought a new one. The straight long plastic bristles always seemed too wimpy to haul around the various biological and project related detritus I encountered outside.  Also, I wanted one a little more manageable than my big push broom.  SCORE!  Besides,  it's kinda weird looking and is always good as a conversation piece while it is functioning noticeably better.
