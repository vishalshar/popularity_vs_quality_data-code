Configured on both my phone and my tablet - this works fast, there's no lag, and I enjoy controlling my TV using my Amazon Echo. There's the catch that the tablet always has to be in the room (even in standby) for the Alexa integration to work, but i understand that it's an Echo limitation and not AnyMote's, so I can't fault them for that.
