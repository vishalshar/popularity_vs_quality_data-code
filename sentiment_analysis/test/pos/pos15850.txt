This is a great kit but make sure you don't need the SmartBridge Pro.  The Pro allows you to integrate with some alarm systems but it usually only sold via wholesalers.Lutron has 24 hour tech support via telephone.  It's great and they were able to help me figure out a wiring issue late on a Sunday night.  I was very impressed!
