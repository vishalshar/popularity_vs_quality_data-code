I am eyeliner challenged and things that work with effort don't stay put even with urban decay primer. I probably have tried 10 different kinds of eyeliner this year, all epic fails even after lots of research beforehand. (Thank goodness Amazon, Macy's, Sephora, etc have liberal return policies.) I happened to run across Julep when pencil met gel and after reading reviews decided to try. I prepped with primer and tried it. I was thrilled with the ease of application and that it stayed on in intense heat for several hrs. I wish it wasn't quite so shiny. I'd like to see a matte color.People who complained about sharpening should get the julep gel eye glider sharpener. It's around $10. It sharpens it perfectly without wasting the pencil.
