Drinking filtered water is important to me and I have explored many different expensive and less expensive options. I had a large plastic $300 filter that, after a couple of years, stopped working efficiently (and took up a ton of space in my kitchen, and was plastic). When Soma arrived on the scene and I learned more about the company, the beautiful design, and signed up for the replacement filter delivery program (every two months), I was hooked. It is beautiful, efficient, looks great in my kitchen, and I love that I can 'set it and forget it'. I don't have to remember to change the filter; as long as you sign up for the replacement filter plan (on the Soma website), one arrives in your mailbox every two months. I highly recommend this product and will never use another water filter! A perfect blend of design and functionality.
