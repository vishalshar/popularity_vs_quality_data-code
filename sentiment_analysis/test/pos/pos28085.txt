Being a design-conscious parent in the modern age means that you have to really hunt for kids products that don't have characters on them or aren't just plain ugly. Enter Public Bikes with a clean, simple design in classic colors that kids and parents can agree on. We've had this bike for several months now and the paint and vinyl still look beautiful! It took a little while for my 3 year old to get the hang of it because it's a little heavy, but she had it down after a few days. The handlebars and seat adjust easily. Even my six year old likes to steal it every now and then. We bought the a mini basket by Sunlite to go on the front to keep treasures in and it is just darling. This bike will definitely last through a few kids! Cute, sturdy and fun!Like to basket: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B003LR26BA/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1481575356&sr=8-1&pi=SY200_QL40&keywords=sunlite%2Bbike%2Bbasket%2Bkids&dpPl=1&dpID=61fIOxM0iuL&ref=plSrch&th=1&psc=1
