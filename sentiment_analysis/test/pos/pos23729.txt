This was a life saver, mostly the dogs life.  Had a barking problem that is now solved.  They learn quickly and there is a non shock tone that alerts them incase they lose their mind and start barking again.  I was against getting one of these because I thought they were cruel but they are not.  This makes my dogs behave and not scare people as they are German Shepherds.
