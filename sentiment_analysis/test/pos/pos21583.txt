I've been using netgear router for a over a couple of decades, and I finally found something modern in this genre. The boxing and hardware design is sleek! The installation process was super simple, the free app that you use to set it up makes the experience a lot smoother. No more digging through tabs and accessing your browser for cryptic local address and looking for admin password for updating/configuring the router. Also, I live in an apartment and Portal have seemed to have fixed the issue where other people's wifi signals get in my way. Not to mention I have dozens of devices and IoT devices that now connect to it.. Super fast and simple!
