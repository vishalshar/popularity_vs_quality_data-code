Just what I needed.  I'm the only drinker in the house and having wonderful bottles of wine and I always felt I needed to drink the bottle within 2 days or I was wasting it (but lets be clear, there's no problem doing that either :-)).  This allows me to have a glass of whatever wine I choose and that might be or 2 or 3 different ones.  This is truly so ridiculously fantastic.  I came across this while in Sonoma at a boutique winery when they came to our table using one.  We got to talking about it and they use it because they are boutique size, they could easily go over a week or so with each of their wines and this was their saving grace.  Can't believe it took me going to Sonoma to discover this but so glad I did.  It doesn't decant it really, but you can just let it breathe a bit.
