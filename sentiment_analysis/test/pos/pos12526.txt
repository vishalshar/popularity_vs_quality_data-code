I'm challenged when it comes to electronics and bluetooth devices. However, it was super easy to sync with my iphone. The sound is incredible for it's small size. It was only adults at the pool, so I haven't had a chance to test how water resistant it is, but I did drop it on a hard sidewalk trying to carry too much at once. Didn't phase it one bit!  I agonized over which speaker to get based on reviews and price - so I'm extremely happy this turned out to be a great deal.  I would recommend it to anyone in a heart beat.
