I LOVE this thing. Great build quality, shoe mount for accessories, and the macro/wide lens is beautiful. Definitely exceeds the Aukey smartphone lens. This is a bit overpriced, considering the SmallRig for the Sony a6300 is only $50, but it's definitely a quality product and worth getting if you want to get the most out of your smartphone video. I got this on an Amazon Lightning deal for combo lens and rig for $130 (basically $10 off the rig and the lens for free). If it were regular priced, I would've just kept using my Manfrotto smartphone mount. Great gift for techies.
