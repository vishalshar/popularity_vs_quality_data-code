I bought this in hope of getting my period regulated and since I hate taking pills I started looking online for something I can take in hopes of it working and then I found and read that Premama powdered drinks don't have a taste to them and can be mixed with your favorite drink. I had just finished having my period about 2 weeks before starting to drink Premama Fertility so I was not expecting to start my period again but I believe it was on the 2nd or 3rd day that I started cramping on and off and then on the 5th day of drinking Premama Fertility I started spotting on and off for 4 days and then the next day my period came. I started drinking it the day I got it for 6 days straight and then after that just drank it when I was in the mood to but I am starting to drink it everyday again just until I finish it up. I can't say for sure if this will really help me in the future to get pregnant or even help regulate my periods since I have not finished it and so far I am really just liking the fact that it has no taste to it.
