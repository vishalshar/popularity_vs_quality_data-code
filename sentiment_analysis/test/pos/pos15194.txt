This thing is great.  Works much, much better than the stock guard.  The only problem is, it's black and relatively small, so it's easy to put down somewhere and forget.  I left mine at the park, now I have to buy another :(  I guess another negative is that it is kind of pricey for a piece of plastic, but it does its job extremely well.
