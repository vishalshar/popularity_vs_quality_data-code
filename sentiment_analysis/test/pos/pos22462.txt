This is the first salmon product our dogs enjoy eating.  Ive tried kibble, but they just turn up their noses.  Buckley jerky is pretty pungentI could already smell salmon before the package was even opened.  That had me a little worried, but its a pleasant, fresh aroma and the jerky pieces are soft, big and thick.  More important, all three dogs like eating them.  One stick can easily be broken apartI split them into threes, and the pieces still offer each dog a substantial chewy treat.  Doing that and getting this big 15 oz. size is an economical way to make treats last a bit longer.  There are about twenty sticks per bag, and each piece measures about six inches long.This is my first exposure to Buckley pet products, and Im impressed.  I dont like giving the dogs anything that uses fillers, preservatives or by-products.  This has none and is as simple as it getssalmon and vegetable glycerin.UPDATE:  We've since tried the liver and chicken flavored jerky, and our dogs like them all.  That said, the chicken jerky is a bit drier, has a more rubbery consistency and is harder to chew.  That doesn't stop the dogs from eating them, and some pet owners might want a jerky treat that offers a heartier chew.  Our dogs seem to prefer the softer liver and salmon ones though.
