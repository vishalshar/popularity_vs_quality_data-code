This thing is awesome. It's part gimmick, part actually functioning beer tapper/dispenser. It does what claims to do. It's not something everyone needs or will want. I like it for tapping a freshly filled growler the best.It's the closest to a draft beer experience without having the expense, the space, or the maintenance of a kegerator. I find the machine works best for styles of beer that are not super hoppy or high ABV that have very sharp flavors and typically don't pour heads. I would never put an imperial stout or a barley wine, or probably anything barrel aged in this machine as the very sharp alcohol and complex flavors will tend to get smoothed over by the pseudo-nitro head. But for any kind of lagers, stouts, brown ales, wheat beers, session able beer styles, even 40 ounce malt liquor bottles, those are the best. I don't use the machine every time I want to drink a beer. But when I am craving and smooth and creamy texture similar to draft beer, I'll tap myself a can or bottle.I have 2 cons with this machine. Tapping a can is more difficult out of it than a bottle. The can has ridges along the top and the hose can get kinked up on it and not fully pour the beer. And I wish this machine has a wall outlet plug so if you want to save batteries you can. this machine uses 4 AAs and claims last over 100 pours.Other than those 2 cons of the machine, I can't recommend it enough as a beer enthusiast. If you can find it cheaper than $169.99, I do it. I got mine here on Amazon for $129.99 used as the seller's "sealed" box had a few dents in it.
