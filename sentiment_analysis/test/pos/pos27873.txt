I have a Nexus 5 which has been just sitting in a drawer until I recently stumbled upon the nanoconsole. Now, my family and I just plug the Nexus 5 into the Nanoconsole and watch TV using the Xfinity TV app as well as Hulu, Netflix and PlayStation Video over our home WiFi network. Its easy to set up and includes all the necessary cables (HDMI cable and a Micro-USB charging cable to keep the phone charged during playback). The remote is perfect for opening the guide and switching shows. Its nice to be able to quickly pause a show from across the room. So far, Im really enjoying it and I think it's a great product.  Im especially happy I can use it with my old phone. Not all phones are supported, so make sure and check their website before you decide to buy.
