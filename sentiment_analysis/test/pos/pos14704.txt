This is the best chocolate hazelnut spread we have tried!Nutella is definitely a gateway chocolate hazelnut spread, but the high sugars have made it an occasional treat.We found the Justin's brand, and the lower sugars were nice, but the better taste was even more nice.But the Chocmeister spread is far and away the best tasting one we've tried. These are all very high in sugar, but I do feel a little less worried about it with the Justin's and Chocmeister.Delicious snack! I recommend everyone at least try it
