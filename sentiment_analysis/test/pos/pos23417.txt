This food is great! I would not recommend it for a cat with food allergies due to chicken being in the ingredient list but it is awesome for a multi-cat household. All four of my cats agreed that it was delicious. I'm sure the flavor of quail is a real treat for them. Their poop seems more normal while on this food also. I do wish there were larger sized bags but other than that the product is awesome. The kibble is smaller too and allows my cat with sensitive teeth to eat more comfortably.
