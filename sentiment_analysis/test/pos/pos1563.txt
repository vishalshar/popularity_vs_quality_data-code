I asked my grandchildren what they wanted most for Christmas.  My granddaughter showed me a cute commercial for it, and said if she got nothing else, she wanted one of these Mugs.  After buying one for her, I ordered one for my husband.  This Mug works so well - if you put ice in it in the evening, expect to see some still frozen the next day!  We haven't used it yet for a hot drink, but I think they would work just as well for that.  They fit in the drink holder in the car perfectly, so I think I want one too.  They're water-tight (with the seal closed) so I wouldn't worry about using it around my computer.  So bottom line is, after buying these Mugs, I ordered more for Christmas gifts... they're great!!!
