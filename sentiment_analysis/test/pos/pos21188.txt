Picked up the phone when it was on sale that I couldn't pass up.  FYI, I'm a bit of a phone hoarder.  Figured what the heck!  My daily driver now is an LG G4 and my Google Nexus 6 that I switch between.  Now to this Posh offering.  I've gotta say that I'm quite impressed for what you can get for less than $150.  Both of my phones were $600 at release and this Posh Titan HDe600 can do what these other big boys can do.  The processor does not lag and it can handle multiple apps simultaneously.  Both of my higher end phones have 3GB of RAM and the Posh only utilizes 1GB, but somehow, it just works really well.  Also, video rendering is really great, not just ok.  Which leads me into the display.  Both of the phones I normally rock have 4K displays.  So my expectation of having a display with only a 720p resolution was not high, however, after streaming Netflix, You Tube and HBO GO content, I can confidently tell you the display on this phone is FANTASTIC.  It is very comparable to my much higher end phones with supposedly 8 times the resolution.  T-Mobile signal is a bit spotty inside of some buildings, but for the most part it is good.  Speaker phone is loud enough and clear as is the headset built into the phone.  Battery life is pretty good for a screen that is this large.  With light to moderate use I can easily get a day and a half until I get to 25-30%.  The GPS has been good so far, not an issue as other reviewers have noted.  MY ONLY MAJOR GRIPE (and I feel bad complaining about this phone because of how little it cost and how great everything else works) IS THAT THE PHONE DOES NOT USE GORILLA GLASS!!!!  OMG!!!  The only reason that I've moved back to my G4 is because I really DO NOT LIKE the plastic like texture glass that Posh Mobile decided to use.  I understand it was most likely a cost issue, but I cannot stress enough how that one cost cutting area is deal breaker for me.  I had no idea that I could deal so well with lower end resolution, RAM, processor specs, internal storage, etc. and be happy with how the phone works.  BECAUSE IT DOES!  I also had no idea the glass would make SOO much of a difference.  Posh, please use better glass on your phones.  Otherwise, I love this phone for what you did with it for such a low cost.  Please contact me for more feedback.  I love what your company is doing with putting out great affordable phones.  You are SOOOOOO close.  Peace.
