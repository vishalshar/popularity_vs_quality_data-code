I'm a skeptic. Having said that, let me tell you... this product worked for us.  Our daughter had been having night terrors for 2 years, almost every night. We were desperate to find a solution that would stop the nightly wakings. We bought this product as a last resort before hiring a sleep therapist to do a sleep study, and I'm glad we did, because that would have probably been a huge waste of money. We used the Lully for about 2-3 weeks as directed by the app. Miraculously, the night terrors stopped. That's really all I care about. If you have a child who is having night terrors, this product just may work for you.  I see some 1 star reviews saying it doesn't work, so I guess it won't work for everyone. But let's get this straight... this product is not intended to "make your child a better sleeper." It is intended to stop a very specific problem where your child wakes up and screams inconsolably in the middle of the night. For that purpose it works well.
