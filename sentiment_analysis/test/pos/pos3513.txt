What a great invention! Our school OT recommended these for our son because he doesn't like the laces coming untied or touching his skin. I ended up ordering for myself because I have arthritis in my fingers and for my husband, who's a contractor who needed a slip on-type shoe because he needs to take off shoes at client's houses. Easy to put on and very comfortable on the shoes. We all love them!
