Five stars! This is the coolest toy ever!!! There may be some connection problems, but everything else is perfect! I would recommend ages 8+ for this toy. It works perfectly in the house with a very strong hull. I have tested it in water, and it works great, and easy! What is really cool about it, is that it can change any color you want, and you can change the speed!
