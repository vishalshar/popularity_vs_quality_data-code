A friend told us about Starling for our 7 month old daughter. After putting in a few hours of online research, we decided to finally order it. We've been using it for almost 2 weeks with our baby. It is great!! The device itself is small and compact, it doesn't bother the baby. Now we know exactly how much we are speaking to our daughter. Both the mother and I have been putting in extra effort to reach that 10,000 words daily goal. Starling rocks!
