I love this little CUBE projector. For the size, the quality of the projected image is amazing. I love that it fits in the palm of my hand and is easy to travel with. I am using it for projecting an iPad Air 2 - using Apple's Lightening to HDMI adapter and it works great. The only trouble I've had is my own fault in that I didn't read the instructions well enough to know that because of special fibers in the RIF6's cable I MUST use the mini HDMI to HDMI cable that came with it and not the longer one I bought. Now that I know that all is well. I can make due with the shorter one for now. I do miss having a keystone option but that can be dealt with by placement of the projector.I purchased this as a test for a project I am working on for my job. I liked it so much, I purchased 10 more for use by the groups that I am working with. I am hopeful they will enjoy this projector as much as I do and find it easy to work with and of good quality.
