Simply put: awesome.I've always had a problem with brushes splaying when I dry them. Not anymore. I have purchased 3 variety packs and I love them! Wash your brushes, squeeze out the excess moisture, then slip on the brush guard that easily accommodates the brush head. Lay them flat, or standing brush side down in a glass and let them dry. They dry perfectly. Can't say that I love them enough!
