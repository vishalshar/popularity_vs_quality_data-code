Really fun toy! I bought Coco for my 5 yr old, and he loves it. It can actually do a lot more than I was expecting. It even puts itself to sleep when you stop using it :)We couldnt figure out the Dance Party game at first, then realized the first line was Toss me high not put me high. You have to throw it in the air to keep the song going... He was super excited the first time he made it all the way through the song!
