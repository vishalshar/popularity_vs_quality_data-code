My husband and I both experience motion sickness and have pretty much avoided boats most of our lives. We recently went to the Great Barrier Reef and split one of these bars in addition to wearing our Sea-Bands. It was a stormy day so the ride out to the reef was rough, we ate the bar at the beginning of the trip, closed our eyes and just went with the rocking. No ill effect from the motion while at the Reef, we had a great time as the weather cleared. We repeated the process for the return trip and boy was it worse! Big choppy waves, but, once again we came through with no upset stomach at all. Very nearly a miracle and wow, now we can experience boat related activities without feeling bad (ie from Dramamine etc) or waiting until nausea clears. Thank you thank you for this product!
