I switched to XY from Tile because even with discounted replacements every year it was too expensive and wasteful to simply discard or return my Tiles every year.  Since the Tile came new finder devices have appeared on the market.  For me the best of these was the XY3.  With manay color options, a replaceable battery (which can be purchased very inexpensively), and the new options to warn you when a device gets out of range and to find your phone, the XY3 was very appealing.  I ordered the three pack and had some initial setup problems due to a dead battery which XY support responded to very quickly with replacement batteries.  So far they are working great.
