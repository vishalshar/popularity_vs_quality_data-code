Most importantly, all 3 of my cats LOVE this food. They range in age from 16 yo down to 1 yo, and they never agree on anything. This is a 42% protein food, the highest I've found for this price. Unlike some high protein foods, this one does NOT stink to high heaven when you pour it from the bag. Also, I feed my cats in the shower room, so it is a food that can handle moist air and still not stink. Litter box cleanup is less stinky with this food. One drawback: if you have a longhaired cat prone to fur balls, this food looks disgusting coming up. On the other hand, the improved health it supplies reduces the hairball problem. I read here in reviews that the packaging is changing. I hope the formula and price don't.
