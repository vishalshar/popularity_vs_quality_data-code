My phone rings all day. Text, call, personal email, work email, small business email, calendar reminders, etc.This may seem like a useless piece of tech, but once you set it to only go off to what is really important, you just stop looking at your phone so much.Phone in the left pocket, Ditto on the right- here I am, stuck in the middle of two. If my right pocket doesn't go off, it's probably not super important. I don't have to look at my phone during meetings or soccer games, the Ditto tells me if its someone who really needs me right away.Interface is a bit slow, but you get used to it. Battery use is on par with how often it goes off. Ditto goes off a lot every day? 2 months of battery, if not less.Either way, I love it- white and clear get pretty grimy, but that's applicable for any white plastic.Love it.
