Awesome design, and looks great, but I only used it a few times now its collecting dust on my bookshelf.I stopped using it is because whenever I attach it to my backpack I'm worried it and the sleeve might fall off. The functionality is ok, but the mug and cap seems to be cheap, however it works. More like a showoff product but less of a solid everyday mug.
