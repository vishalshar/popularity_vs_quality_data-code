My Awair works very well and easily detects changes in the air quality when my girlfriend uses aerosols or runs on the treadmill, or even when my cat farts next to it.I'd like to see some more intricate details such as a breakdown on air composition, which I acknowledge may require an updated device build (a newer unit design). I'm picky, I like to see as much data as I can.
