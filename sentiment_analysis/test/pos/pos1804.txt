Everything l streamed through the speaker sounded clear and crisp. And the bass response also did a lot better than l expected for such a compact speaker. The volume can get pretty damn loud when using the music services offered by the app, like Pandora. Its not exaggerated at all to describe it as room-filling.The gesture control is the part l like it most. It proved so effortless to simply tap the box rather than searching for a mouse or keyboard button When your phone rings or someone's shouting at you from another room. It works instantly every time and without any delay. I would like to say its pretty cool and convenient than buttons.But the drop-outs seemed a little more frequent than other AirPlay devices. After updated the latest firmware, it seems much better than before. Looking forward to better experiece through future software updates.
