They were easy to form, just follow the instructions.  The YouTube video was helpful.  People that say they work as well as Bose noise suppression must not own Bose noise suppression, with music off they don't block sound at all.  However, they do stay in place easily, sound pretty good, and when music is they flock outside noise out.  I'd give them a 5 but the company and some reviewers over-hype them.  They are good for the money, but keep expectations reasonable.
