I initially bought this product because a friend recommended it. The product arrived quickly and I was able to set it up swiftly with no problems at all, just make sure you have a good wifi connection! I played with the product for a bit when I first got it while in the other room and my cat was so very curious about it! It was really easy and fun to set up along with the app!This could not have came at a more convenient time especially with me going away for the holidays. I had someone coming to check in on my cat Olivia but I still wanted to make sure that she was okay and it also doubles as ensuring my house was okay as well! It made me so happy to see her on the camera while I was away for the holidays and I'm sure it made her pretty happy too by hearing my voice!I would highly recommend this product for anyone who goes on trips several times a year or is just not home during the day like myself. It is a nice and quick way to check in to see how your pets are doing! I absolutely love it and I am very happy with this purchase!
