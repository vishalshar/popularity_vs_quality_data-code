We finally got to play this last night as a group of four. Because it was our first time and there wasn't five of us we didn't use the dark lord but it was still great. I think it's a nice combination of a deck builder like Legendary and a draft game like Seven Wonders. It was a lot of fun deciding whether or not I should fight or buy, and then what should I buy. Of course I ended up buying citizens that only triggered once or twice but still.The game itself is amazing. The art is fun and detailed. The currency is made of little wood pieces rather than plastic which is amaxing in my opinion. And everything feels really well made. Also, the organization tactic they provide is spot on. I wish legendary did something similar by default.  Overall this game is great to play and made professionally.  Definitely recommend.
