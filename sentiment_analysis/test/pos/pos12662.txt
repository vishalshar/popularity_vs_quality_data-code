I have tried other Pure Birch Xylitol sweeteners, and this is right up at the top of them all for flavor, and it mixes well into tea, and other recipes.  I make my own toothpaste, and use pure birch Xylitol as the sweetener of choice.  It mixes well with the baking soda, coconut oil, peppermint extract, and H202(hydrogen peroxide).  I make it up in a blender.  Well worth trying.
