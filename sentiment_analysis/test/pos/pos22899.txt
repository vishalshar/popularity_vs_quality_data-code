I bought these for things in my fridge that i am constantly putting in zip top bags, like lunch meats, leftovers and cheeses. I've had them about about two weeks, and they are working great. They are pricey, but a great help to my 'Stop Buying All That Disposable Crap' Policy.Not sure if i'm supposed to put then in the dishwasher, but as i am allergic to hand washing, (that's my excuse) i ran them through anyway. If you do, make sure they are upright and supported. Once they get folded over, they do not drain and stay in that shape. Mine needed to sit on the drying rack over a glass to keep them open. I think i'll try a plastic lid with holes cut in it as a framework to keep them flat and draining properly. If it turns out your not supposed to machine wash, ignore all this!! :)
