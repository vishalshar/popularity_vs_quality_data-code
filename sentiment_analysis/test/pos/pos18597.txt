I like the LIFX White smart bulbs because they offer a wide range of white light (i.e. white/blue to warm).  I own several Philips Hue bulbs (colored and lux versions) and find these to fill the gap that is currently missing in the Hue lineup (bright variations of white).At first I was hesitant to purchase LIFX White due to the reviews about the original LIFX being big and getting too hot.  However, I haven't experienced any of these issues with the LIFX White.  The LIFX White are a bit smaller than the original LIFX so they fit nicely into average sized lamps and don't protrude out of the shades.  They do certainly feel hefty and solidly built, so that's a plus.I had some trouble with the initial setup because the app kept wanting me to update the firmware, but after an update on the Android app those problems went away.  I like the LIFX app better than the Hue app, although admittedly I don't use either often since I've integrated them both into Amazon Echo and/or Smartthings v2.
