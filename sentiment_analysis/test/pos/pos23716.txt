Fitbit, Jawbone, Polar, Nike, they have all released some form of fitness tracker but they were all so plastic looking, most of them were only splash proof and you had to charge them every few days or they stopped doing their job... you know, tracking your activity!  So here are a few of the fitness trackers I have had over the years.  I really love the concept of a wearable tech BTW.I started my journey of wearable tech with a Polar Watch & chest strap.  The watch I had (10 years ago) was cute with it's green band and it would track my calories burned while exercising.  This wasn't something that tracked my activity throughout the day but it was my first piece of wearable tech so I figured I should include it.  This watch also had a breathing exercise thing where it rated your overall health based on a number of metrics.  Unfortunately, the silicone band caused irritation on my wrist when I would sweat during workouts and I wasn't able to get a different band for it.When I entered the market for a Fitness Tracker I got a Polar Loop, one of the few waterproof fitness trackers on the market at the time.  I wanted something to track my activity all day, how many steps / how active I was / how much I sleep.  I chose the Loop because Fitbits were not waterproof and I was worried that it would get wet when I was washing my hands or something.  The tracking was cool with the Loop and I liked the bar that filled up as you got closer to your goal each day.  Once you hit your goal you got monotone fireworks on the screen.  Eventually, I forgot to charge it and it died while I was traveling for work.  Since I didn't have the fancy charging cable with me, it ended up in my suitcase and then a drawer someplace never to be used again.  The Loop was neat as far as tech goes but charging it all the time was a pain.Next, came the Leaf by Bellabeat.  This one housed a watch battery so it would last 6 months without charging and it was PRETTY! It actually looked more like jewelry than a traditional fitness tracker so I was really excited.  I was nervous about it not being waterproof but I figured it must be at least splash resistant.  Out of the box, the bracelet that came with it was confusing to put on and only came in what I would call child size so I was never able to wear it on my wrist.  It also came with a necklace or you could clip it to your shirt so I wore it as a necklace most of the time.  The Leaf tracking wasn't very accurate.  Since it was only splashproof, you couldn't wear it in the shower.  If you got it wet you would void your warranty and it was a goner, which I learned the hard way.  My husband was goofing around in the driveway washing the cars and sprayed me (and my Leaf) with the hose.  It stopped working and never came back to life.  I had been wearing it for about 4-5 months at that point.I knew that if I ever invested in another fitness tracker, it NEEDED to be waterproof!I recently came across the Misfit products.  They are waterproof to 50 meters, extremely accurate according to the tech blogs, and use watch batteries so they don't need to be charged all the time..  At first I was going to get the Shine but everywhere I looked people were talking about how it had this strong magnet in it that caused it to come out of the band.  Being round, in a stretchy silicone band... this sounded like a design flaw.  That being said, the Shine came in a bunch of colors and was much prettier than the other activity trackers on the market.  I debated getting a Shine and then I came across the Misfit Ray...  Waterproof to 50 meters, batteries so it lasts about 6 months before you need to replace them, better design shape than the Shine so that it doesn't pop out of the band, and it's pretty!  I was sold and ordered the Rose Gold one!  Installing the batteries is super easy and so far it's been awesome!  There are lots of accessories coming out for it to be a necklace or to add a leather strap (I got the sport band).  The app is pretty easy to use and it will even sync with Google Fit on your phone if you want it to.  I have to say I'm impressed so far.  IDK what the deal is with all of these bad reviews.  This thing is great!  It even tells me when I get a call / text by vibrating.
