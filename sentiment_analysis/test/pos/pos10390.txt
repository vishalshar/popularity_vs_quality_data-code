This is a product that exceeds my expectations.  I know, you say so what, make the bed, what's the big deal ?!To start with, the sheets are wonderfully soft and comfy.  But the most important thing, and I know you all think this is crazy, but the sheet and the duvet cover all stay together.  This may sound kind of "meh, who cares" type of thing, but it's really, really nice.  I love the fact that I never have to tuck in the sheet, yet because the duvet cover and the top sheet are connected, I never have that "top sheet is messed up" feeling.We live in a very tiny home (a motor home) and to be able to just pull the cover up, and the bed is made is wonderful.  I purchased a king size for my queen bed  because I like some overhang.  This was probably a mistake. I would have been fine with the queen size cover.  It is meant to hold a duvet so it is larger already.  The worst part is this seems to be so well made, it will be a long time before I need a new one, and then I will purchase the queen size.It is hot out now, so I am not using a blanket in the cover, the three sheets (duvet holder and top sheet) provide the perfect summer weight "blanket".  I have a down blanket to put into the duvet when it gets colder.  These are also made of all cotton, and breath wonderfully.I have paired this top sheet set with what I consider to be a miracle bottom sheet for hard to get at beds, QuickZipÂ QuickZip 2 Pack, the Only Fitted Sheet that's Quick to Change, Easy to Fold and Doesn't Pop off of the Mattress, 400-Thread-Count Sateen Cotton, Deep Pockets (15"), White, Queen
