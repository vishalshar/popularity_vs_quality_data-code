ZUS New Smart Car Charger  works great.. I now own two chargers, I love the speed of the charger, and the "Car Finder App" . I have one in each car, and it has a timer reminder for parking meter... And also a easy way to find your car in a large parking lot (Disneyland).. Nice size for your dashboard .  And light to help find USB port .. I like it over my past car chargers.
