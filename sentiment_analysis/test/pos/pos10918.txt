I have no complaints about this product, it does exactly what it was described to do. However I would expect it to have a better quality camera for the price it retails at. Also a word of caution for owners of flat faced cats/dogs (I have a persian), your pet might struggle a bit with the shape of the feeding tray. My cat always ends up not finishing his meal because some of the bits get pushed into the inner corner and he can't get it out. I'm hoping a stainless steel or ceramic tray will be available soon as cats are known to be prone to plastic allergy. But overall this feeder is very easy to use, has a design that doesn't allow for pets to break in (I can't imagine how and my cat hasn't been trying). I hope a mobile app will be available soon because it is kind of a no-brainer not to have one.
