I've never owned a nice carry-on bag and figured it was finally time to stop lugging around an awkward backpack. I've been traveling a lot lately because my girlfriend moved to the east coast to go back to school for a year and Bluesmart's carry on made the most sense for me. When you're taking red eyes back and forth, it's nice to know I'll always be able to keep my phone or laptop charged when I get off of the flight (even if the plane or airport has power, I always fall asleep and don't charge).Anyway, the design and packaging are really sleek. The one thing that was a little confusing was that it didn't come with a USB to power adapter but once I realized I could just use my regular iPhone power adapter I didn't mind.Also I have to say, the front compartment is great. I feel a lot safer packing my laptop in there than just in my old bag (especially with those packed overheads), and it's easy to take out for TSA.
