Great engineering story -- solved a problem that has cost me $$$$ in laptops, keyboards, and many tears shed by family and friends. The Mighty Mug Mini "just works" as promised. Not much more to say but there are some limitations if you order stainless steal, the worst is that it is NOT DISHWASHER SAFE. This is not so much a product issue as a consequence if you choose stainless steal.Consider plastic version instead if you want to put it in the dishwasher!
