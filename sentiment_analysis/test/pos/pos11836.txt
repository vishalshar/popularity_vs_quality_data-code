This mount was extremely stable! I put it in my Ford Transit Connect. I decided to mount it on the rail closest to the passenger door and have the arm come down and rest on the seat. No one would be able to sit in the passenger seat but I often ride alone and if I do have a passenger it is easy to remove the mount with the quick clamp. I would deffinately recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a secure, sturdy, easy to use mount.
