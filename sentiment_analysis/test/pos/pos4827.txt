I use this cap for the mason jar that I make ranch dressing in.  It worked great and was so much easier than putting a spoon in the mason jar to dip the dressing out.  The jar fell over in the collapsible cooler I transported my food in and never came open. That was a big plus too!  I will probably be buying a few more because I really like the product!
