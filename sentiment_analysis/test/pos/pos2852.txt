I've been watching this device for well over a year, and gearing up for some sleep hacking with the new year, decided to go ahead and get it. I've only had it for a day, but I'm already pleased with it. After going for a walk in the late afternoon it reflected what light exposure I would have expected.Testing it on a light therapy lamp, it showed that the lamp was basically useless beyond the tested range of 10 inches. If the battery is low it will throw some bluetooth errors in the app as the bluetooth will kill the battery, but the app just sees this as an error, so battery level reporting would be nice.The price for this device is kinda high, but if you're dealing with sleep issues it just might be worth it. It is for me.
