I can see a noticeable difference in the minimization of my pores and also a reduction of my teenage acne scars. It's like they are slowly fading away. I use this device twice a week on my face and neck and one treatment is usually only about 5-7 minutes tops. I also facial steam, extract, and use a Murad mask skin kit treatment as the complete regimen.
