SwimSafe provides peace of mind to parents with children (and grand parents like me). Drowning is the number one cause of death for children between ages 2-6; the vast majority of those drowning occur even when parents are present and supervising their children. Using technology to help adults monitor children while they swim is 'good parenting'. Everyone with a backyard pool and children in their household should own and use SwimSafe.
