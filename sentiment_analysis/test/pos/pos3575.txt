Have been baking and making pizzas for a number of years as a way to entertain a group of friends.  With Denver's hot summer and a hankering for a pizza party, went on line to look at options for cooking on our gas grill.  The BakerStone pizza oven came highly recommended, but I was still skeptical.  Last night's inaugural pizza ball confirmed all the high marks this product has received.I tried a few run-through's before the big event and here are a couple of my particular tips:1.  Used a Charglow, 4-burner gas grill.2.  Removed angled directional heating vents prior to heating. (Also cleaned out all the burner holes. Tedious, but long overdue.)3.  Turned on all 4 burners to medium-low (not high), closed lid (Yes, even though this is not recommended) and let it preheat for about 30 minutes.4.  The temperature was perfect.  Then I opened the lid and began cooking.  Kept the lid open after that.  Our grill did fine with the lid closed for the preheating, but I do understand the caution of overheating.  I just figure grills are designed to get hot and still perform.5.  Pizzas were beautifully baked between 4-5 minutes each.  Yes, you MUST turn them every minute.  Back of the oven is where the good blistering happens.One final note, unrelated to the BakerStone.  If you don't want to make your own dough, nearly every pizza parlor --whether chain or independent--will sell you balls of raw dough.  I pay between $2-3 for a one pound ball at our local pizzeria.  I cut each ball in half, work it around to smooth it out and absorb whatever flour is on the outside,  cover it with saran wrap, let it rest a spell, and then proceed.  Best to let it come to room temp before baking if it's cold.  Can sit covered in plastic wrap on the counter for quite some time. These half pound sizes are a perfect fit for the BakerStone.For 8 adults and 3 children under 7, I used 5 balls of dough and 2 pounds of mozzarella cheese. Don't recommend those bags of pre-shredded cheese. They are tasteless.  I used one ball of whole milk mozzarella and one ball of part skim.  Shredded it on a hand grater --a crummy chore but essential, I think--and mixed them together.  Lovely combo.  Trader Joe's sells a smoked mozzarella that's a wonderful change up.  Try some par-cooked broccolini on it or very thinly sliced Meyer lemons.Bon appetit everyone and if you are considering a pizza oven, this has my highest recommendation.
