For the price, it's probably your best bang for buck. I will rate the Autel Robotics x-star premium on 6 categories.Ease of use, 4/5 stars. It was my first time piloting any flying drones and I had no problems with learning how to control it. However configuration wasn't seamless and I encountered an issue with my phone pairing with the remote control.Range, 2/5 stars. The drone is advertised as having a range of 1.2 miles and fell short of that by a long shot in my real world use. I started having video transmission issues beyond 4000 feet. It's still somewhat impressive that its able to do that so I won't deny it at least a 2 star rating.Video Quality, 4/5 stars. The footage I recorded with this device was 4k at 24fps. I didn't experience much banding unless turning or panning at a high speed. A larger sensor would be an advantage considering the payload that it is capable of carrying, but I won't complain too much. There is a very wide field of view.Picture Quality, 4/5 stars. The still images were great quality and crisp. After 15-20 second of editing and color correction, they looked as if taken by a digital SLR pro quality camera. I would almost give this catagory 5 stars but exposure control and image adjustments were a bit difficult on the fly.Flight time, 3/5 stars. Fell short of advertised 25 minutes. Never got more than 17 before return to home activated.Features: 3/5 stars. Some of the features were not installed until updating firmware, some features seemed too much trouble to use and I didn't quite trust the object avoidance.Overall I give it 4/5 stars due to the value factor, for the price- there's not a better drone out there. This compares well to the phantom 4, for much lower price.
