I am a very avid traveler, and have tried most trackers out there because my luggage was lost several times and I don't want that to happen to me ever again. That said, using my Lugloc has been a life changer!Compared to Trakdot, LugLoc is VERY user friendly. Trakdot loses its Bluetooth connection very often and has to be paired again every time, which is annoying. When Trakdot works, it's difficult to understand what the icon on the screen means, as the suitcase icon jumps around whether it's close or far away. LugLoc worked perfect every time, and I go into the plane knowing consistently that it's with me, thanks to its Bluetooth.I was skeptical about LugLocs battery as well, what with 15 days being an absurdly long time for any battery, but mine actually lasts over 20 days, so I was very impressed. Compared to Trakdot, this is a no brainer. I've had a few flights where I received no notifications from Trakdot due to its battery dying mid-flight, even after purchasing new batteries for it right before the flight.I've tried using other trackers as well, but LugLoc proved to be the most reliable and friendly to use, and I would certainly recommend it over any other similar product out there.
