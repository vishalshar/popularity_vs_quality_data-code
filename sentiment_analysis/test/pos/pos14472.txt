I had been looking at this pencil for almost a year. Finally I gave into my desire to own this product and have certainly been please. I got the wooden pencil and I love the look of it. I enjoy doodling mindlessly as well as using the pencil for more serious projects. I also want to note that I am left handed and this pencil works perfectly for me. (I mention that because, for example, calligraphy pens are right handed unless you purchase the special left handed ones).
