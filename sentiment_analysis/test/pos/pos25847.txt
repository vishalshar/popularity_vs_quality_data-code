I love these all purpose towels. I got the original from the kickstarter, used for a several months while travelling and at the beach and then decided to get a second one. I use them as towels, wraps, etc. They are light, soft (compared to other similar ones) and dry quickly.Even if you don't use it for travel, it is always handy to keep one at home.
