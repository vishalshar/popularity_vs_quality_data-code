We saw this on "Shark Tank" on March 11, 2016, and ordered it immediately.  It arrived 2 days later.  Installation is extremely simple:  insert 3 AAA batteries, stick the motion activator unit on the outside of the bowl by the 4 sturdy suction cups, and then attach the fiber optic light cord to the inside rim of your toilet bowl with another sturdy suction cup.  A small switch on the side of the motion activator unit allows you to set the device to just one color, or to allow the Illumibowl to cycle through 8 beautiful colors.  The Illumibowl Toilet Night Light is ideal for those of us who make frequent trips to the bathroom during the night.  We don't have to wake up others in the house by switching on the overhead bathroom light; and we don't have trouble getting back to sleep because of having immersed ourselves in light just to go to the bathroom.  We love our Illumibowl Toilet Night Light!
