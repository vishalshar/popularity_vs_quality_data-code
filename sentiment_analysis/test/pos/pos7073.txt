Firm yet soft, very little "sink" which I was looking for. would rate the firmness as a 6.5/10General notesDelivery - wonderfulPackaging Satisfactory- Had a few tears in the main box, but that is something that happens in travel, or between hands. eh it happensFirmness- Exactly as expected, more firm than tempurpedic which was wanted.Smell- Non noticeable "new mattress smell" (if very faint) but to be expected.Recommendation- Unpackage on top of the frame, as it can be quite a bit to handle in a tight room- Also, let the mattress sit a full 24hrs before judgement. The first night was a bit squishy, since the mattress had not fully fluffed up yet.
