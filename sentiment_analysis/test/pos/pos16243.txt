I ordered the iCracked iPhone 6 screen, all I can say is it's just like the original and I am overall impressed with how good the quality of the aftermarket screen is. It's packaging was very protective.Displays like the original, and I see nothing different with its touch sensitivity. Tools where nice; also they where magnetic, and screen protector was good, but I ended up using a different one. The screen has not seperated from lcd panel and the adhesive seems to hold like original and its been over a month and a half. Kinda hard to find a good DIY aftermarket screen kit.Price wise, would have paid anywhere else the same amount, but I have trust issues when others have my technology lol, mainly because I bought this screen because I had my screen replaced at a local shop a week before I bough this screen to do it myself, and the one at the shop only lasted 3 days then it wouldn't display... So yeah this screen was well worth it to me.Just to let others know.Do know that if screen displays lines it may not have been defective to have started with, because when installing it can be common to accidentally touch the LCD on the back which is supper senvitive and can be broken easily at corners without knowing, so take your time with installing a new screen.Also, don't try and pick at the corners or edges of screen, some upon install can protrude just a little and can be tempting to pick at which will cause it to peal, mine did not.Also purchase from the manufacture, not third party.  How they pacaged theirs you could easily drop it without worry (but do not try to).
