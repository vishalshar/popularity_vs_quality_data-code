Great bike mount for my iphone 5s, at no point do I feel my phone is unsafe while riding my road bicycle. I want to mention that my usual route takes me down hill with speeds of 50-55 mph and this has no problem staying on, the only thing I notice is that the vibration from hitting bumps or dips may cause the mount to move slight up or down.It would be a VERY good idea to rubber band your phone to the mount for any just in case issues.
