I wrap the cheese in the paper.  Then I wrap the paper package loosely in light weight aluminum foil.  It makes the package easier to wrap and unwrap.  No more drying out and no mold (except the mold intended to be there).  At least not in the couple of weeks cheese might stay in my refrigerator.  Yes, it is expensive.  If you consume cheese within a couple of days of purchasing you probably do not need this.  But if you are like me and sometimes buy more than you end up using quickly then this is a wonderful product.  I have tried every other hint provided on the internet, including wrapping in wax paper.  The one that worked best for me before I tried formaticum was putting the cheese in a plastic zip lock bag with a folded paper towel and changing the paper towel every couple of days.
