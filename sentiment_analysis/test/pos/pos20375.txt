I oreded Grip boost early this year to  make my practice gloves sticky so they were like new every day. It has worked great and I've used one bottle about 25 times for my gloves. It has made my gloves like new every day of practice. Whenever I put it on my gloves and someone see's me using they ask if they can use some becasue it works so goood. I would recommend this product to anyone that wants "new gloves" every day.
