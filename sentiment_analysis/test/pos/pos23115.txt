This little thing is amazing. I'm the person who sleeps with a fan on all year long because I need the background noise, but sometimes it gets chilly. This sound machine makes me think my fan is on. It's tiny so I can put it anywhere, no clutter or bulk, and it gets loud! I've tried using sounds on my phone in place of a fan but the sound is always a bit pitchy, and I need the low-tone background noise. Pitchy is not an issue with this product at all. The volume is fully adjustable and there are plenty of options as far as sounds go (there's even a low fan option and a loud fan option, among others). I highly recommend it.
