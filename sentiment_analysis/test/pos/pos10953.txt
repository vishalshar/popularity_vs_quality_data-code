I think this  is a great product.  It helps me track calories burned during workouts and keeps me on target for my steps for each day.  I check throughout the day to see where I am in my progress. I find it to be right-on in terms of my level of calm and focus.  The reminders are helpful as well - it tells you when you've been sedentary for 45 minutes which is great on days I have many meetings back-to-back.  It reminds me to get up and stretch my legs.  I also value the notification that I feel tense - when I feel the gentle buzz it triggers me to take a few deep breaths and refocus.  The company has been very responsive when I've been in touch about small bugs in the app - they've fixed them right away and given me directions on how to navigate them.  The app not only tracks your progress, it offers short guided "boosts" to bring you back to calm, focus or activity.  There is also a visual summary of the day and week to help identify patterns when you are tense, focused, etc. I highly recommend this product.
