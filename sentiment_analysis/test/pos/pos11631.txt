I searched a long time for a juice storage solution. My wife and I juice 3-4 times a week and we needed something that's made of glass, easy to clean, and portable. Most of the glass bottles on Amazon aren't designed for juice storage, as the narrow mouth makes it cumbersome to wash even with a brush. When I realized that mason jars were a much better solution, a quick search led me to this cap. (the right mason jars were hard to find, but that's another story)we've had these caps for about a month now and it is the perfect complement to our mason jars, it meets all the requirements I had and make juice storage much more convenient. Don't be deterred by the price; you can tell from the construction and design that someone put a lot of thought and R&D into this item, and it's absolutely worth the price.
