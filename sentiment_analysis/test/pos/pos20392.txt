Anyone with two dogs will appreciate this coupler. I didn't know how my two Pomeranians (brothers) would take to it ( they are both strong headed, but they took right to it!), and we have a great time outside together walking now and they are getting the much fresh air that they need. Thanks for making such a great product for my pups!!!PK, Nebraska
