I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. I had tried buying a different brand last Christmas, and got burned when the seller disappeared from Amazon. So when I saw this one which had backing from Kickstarter I felt confident in ordering it.We opened it and read through all the instructions (which were super easy and clear) and then started drawing away. It only takes about a minute for it to heat up which is really nice, the cooldown period is quick too. It takes a little while to get used to, but it is a lot of fun. It comes with 3 different kinds of plastic (Matte, Flex and glossy) and a really nice variety of colors for any sort of project. I like that there are options to purchase different tips, styles and colors of plastic. We are still getting the hang of using it, cleaning it after use and what not, but it's all pretty straight forward. Both of us are having a ton of fun with this pen.
