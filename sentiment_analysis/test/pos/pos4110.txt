I like these socks. They're crew height, but are thinner than athletic crew socks. They provide sufficient cover to prevent my feet from being abraded by my shoes and even afford a modest amount of cushioning for the heel and balls of my feet. They stay up well and do fine in the wash.07/11/2016I still like these socks...indeed I love them rather than like them. They're thin yet comfortable to wear. They stay up on your legs without tight elastic that restricts blood circulation and leaves those marks on your leg when you take them off. I bought another six pair - the ones I purchased previously have all held up, but some have apparently been lost in the laundry. IMO you can't go wrong with these socks
