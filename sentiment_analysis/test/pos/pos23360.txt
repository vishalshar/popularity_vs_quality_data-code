I thought these would be handy, but I didn't count on just how perfect they were!!!Unfortunately, buying 1-1.5 inch cuts of meat just doesn't happen where I am due to availability, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway.I put them in 1/2 inch ribeyes, and while I had to be much more exact, I put them on the grill.The instructions make it sound like it's going to be crazy to keep track of all the colors, lights, etc. - it's not. Even with the 1/2 inch thick ribeye I had there was plenty of time to cook it perfectly. I followed 2 minutes per side for the first turn, and then 1 minute per side afterwards as it suggests 1-2 minutes per side thereafter.I pulled it off a bit late, as the yellow light had just taken its first flash and let it rest until the light went off. It was, as promised, just slightly over medium-rare and just slightly under medium.This is restaurant-quality perfection I've only had in the top 4-5 steak houses I've been to. I paired it with this beauty, a Professional Meat Tenderizer: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005962EU4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1 a professional meat tenderizer, for utter perfection.Seriously, pair these two together and your steak game just went through the roof!!!!
