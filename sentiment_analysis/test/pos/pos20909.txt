I want to learn to play guitar but I'm very busy most of the time so this is an ideal tool. The build is top quality with real strings and a sturdy body. I use a note 4 and a Nvidia sheild to play and learn.The charge lasts pretty long though I don't play it ad often. My only gripe is you can't connect it to a speaker or headphones directly to play as it a doesn't have one built in ,always has to be connected to the device.Wish there was more app support and a way to download songs into it to learn to play them
