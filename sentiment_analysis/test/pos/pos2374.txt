I bought this for my husband, who loves tech stuff. Normal thermal cameras are $1000's, so the price on this one was the first thing that appealed to me. It worked fabulously right out of the box. The images are clear, but not sharp. If you're looking to find heat leaks or just want to have fun looking at things, it is absolutely wonderful. We can even see the studs in some of our walls; they are a different temp than the insulation between them.
