Sugru is the great multipurpose bonding agent for rubber and plastic.  I've used to repair handles, charging cords, chairs rubber foam arm rests.  It has lots of other uses and is great for molding and cushioning things.The only downside is that it's got a limited lifespan.  I'd stock up, but you really never know when you're going to need it and it's easier as a Prime member to just buy it when it run into a job I need it for.  That said, you can extend the life of it by storing in the fridge.
