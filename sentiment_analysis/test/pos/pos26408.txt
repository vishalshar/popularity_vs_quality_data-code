Awesome little educational toy that seems to be popular with everyone. I'm a keyboard player and have been using synths since their inception. This is such a brilliant way to discover the sound synthesis fundamentals. There's no time wasted with figuring it all out because it's just that intuitive. I really wish I had thought of this product 25 years ago!
