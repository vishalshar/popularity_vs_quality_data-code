Was looking for a gaming chair and compared this to other brands. I wanted one from Amazon that was also available through Prime. I ended up choosing this one and found it to meet my expectations.Packaging was great since everything was kept neatly in a giant box but obviously it's very heavy. Nothing was visibly damaged but I must say assembly was more challenging than I thought. I do recommend watching their assembly video in conjunction with the instructions it comes with. I ran into a few problems with the assembly. The adjustable lever jammed somehow and was stuck until I yanked on it hard. Also the wheels are a hassle to attach because it took alot of effort to push them into the base (the video makes it seem alot easier than it actually is...). The whole process took longer than usual and I was tired by the end.The quality of the material is very nice. It has a premium feel that you would expect from the seat of a sports car. I love that the armrests are adjustable. The material is a little hard but after sitting on the chair for several hours, I didn't notice any pain or discomfort.Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase. Everything functions properly and the chair is comfortable enough to sit in for long periods of time. If you can get through the annoying assembly process, you'll have a sturdy and high quality gaming chair.
