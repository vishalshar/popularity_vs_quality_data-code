We have ordered a couple of these.  We have to keep one car out of the garage and being in Minnesota, there are mornings you wake up to frost on the windshield and/or snow a few months out of the year... these along with a frost guard on the windshield work great and reduce the time for my daughter to clear off the windshield and mirrors so she can head off to school or work.  I feel safe knowing she has clear visibility out her windshield and side mirrors.
