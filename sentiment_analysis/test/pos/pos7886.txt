I love this thing. I read all the reviews before I bought this. I was concerned about the resolution since it seems that some people complained about the lack of resolution. I have a gas powered lawn mower that was running hot. I took the mower completely apart and blew all the dirt and grass out, with an air compressor. I took a picture with the camera. The resolution was better than I expected. The picture is attached.  The muffler shows up very hot. I can see the "cooler" spark plug wire. I can see that the mower deck on the side of the mower with the muffler is hotter than the deck on the side of the mower that is away from the muffler. I know that I will be using this thermal camera unit a lot. I have one of those point-and-shoot IR detectors that measures the temperatures of things. I thought that was cool until I got the Seek unit, which is so much better. When I used that other point-and-shoot IR temp detector, I would use my phone to take a picture of the reading on the detector as well as a picture of what I was pointing it at. I used to think that was slick. I can't wait to use this new Seek unit in my attic. I have one of those poorly designed houses where the HVAC ducts run through the attic. In the Kansas City summer, the attic air temp has hit 140 and the underside of the roof decking has been 160 degrees in the past.
