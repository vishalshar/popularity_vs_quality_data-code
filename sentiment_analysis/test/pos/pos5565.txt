I loved the product, BUT customer service stinks. I talked to 7 customer service people, not one knew how to finish the install process. This was after 4 1/2 hours. So next day talked to tech, set up 15 minutes. My dog accidently set 911 feature off, I wear it around my neck with a 29" chain I use for my medical alert tag. He jumped in my lap landed on the device and pressed the 911 feature. What is your emergency says my name. The nice man laughed hard. Its water proof. You can travel all over the USA and use it. You can get help with running out of gas, flat tires, locked out of vehicle, someone is following you press the button, and they send emergency help. You can list unlimited people to be on your emergency contact list. I also listed when I registered that I have a 911 lock out box, the key code and my garage pad  #'s to enter the garage. I also listed where 911 people can find a complete medical list in my home and in my oxygen bag in the garage. I paid only $43.00 for it on Amazon. The fee to register it is $44.95, of which $10.00 is taxes. It's only $21.95 a month fee, charged for all the services. If you get this device3. Register it, but in the final process ,demand to talk to a tech to finish the last phase of it. Which all it involved was to go to a window, set the device on the window sill and the tech does the rest. It's much cheaper then any other de3vice on the market and so is the monthly fee charged. You get around the set up and I would recommend the actual product 100%. I've talked 3 friends into buying this device who all have severe medical problems. It can save a life. You can't put a price on that. I have been told for 10 years I needed a device to summon 911. After a horrible life threatning scare in my shower stall. I fell in the shower, grabbed my grip bar, no clue how I put my pj's on. No glasses on, nearly crawled to the kitchen to get my phone, and couldn't see to summon 911, so speed dialed a friend and said call 911. LOVE this device.
