Very comfortable.  The boot is more rigid than I even expected.  Had some speculation with only having 2 buckles how much support the boot would offer, but so far so good.  Only bad thing was I had to remount my ski bindings.  I went from a 24.5 Technica boot to a 24.0 in these, but the length of this boot is much larger (301mm from a 285mm) and I wanted to be sure to have a central mount with my bindings.  I am a snowboarder as well and the boots provide sufficient support to do both sports, which is exactly what I was looking for.  Very nice to only have to worry about toting one pair of boots.
