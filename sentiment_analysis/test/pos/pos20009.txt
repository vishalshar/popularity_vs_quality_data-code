I got this cable 2 weeks ago, and since then I use it as a key chain. In this 2 weeks of use it looks brand new. The durability of this cable is awesome.What i like about it is that i can use it together with my power bank and i don't have to worry about the length of the cable . It's the perfect size for this kind of use.At home i can use the normal cable, but outside i would never leave home without it .In fact i'm thinking of buying another one just to leave it in the car as a spare.I definitely recommend this for outdoor use
