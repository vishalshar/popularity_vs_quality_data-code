Holds your phone at a much much more practical position to view and access your phone when riding than the tube mount that comes with the quad lock bike kit.  It's well made and the clamp has remained secure over several rides with no rotation at all.  If you are looking for a way to mount your phone on your bike, this paired with a Quad Lock case is your solution.Incidentallty, this purchase was the final piece of my effort to avoid spending the money on the $500 GPS computer I really wanted...Because really the iPhone 6 I already had does everything I wanted the GPS computer for.  And there are a lot of other great cycling apps out there.  "But your iPhone battery sucks", you say.  Ah, but when paired with a small 5200mAh "Candy bar-Sized" battery in a top tube bag, I can ride literally all day with the phone unlocked and still have a full charge when finished.  So yeah, I've spent about $100 give or take to not buy the GPS but I'm happy with my setup.
