This mount is way better engineered and seems more secure than the rubber band stem mount. I bought this plus the iPhone case instead of the bike mount kit and I'm very happy with the decision. You can attach it pointing forward in front of your handlebars or rotate it 180 degrees to sit backwards over your stem but without contacting it. I'm running it backwards on my road bike and that's a comfortable position for me to view my screen.
