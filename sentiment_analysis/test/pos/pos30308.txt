Very nice watch with this price. Very comfortable and light on wrist, don't even feel that it's on the wrist. I am using with my iphone 6s with ios10. Software is pretty simple though lacks basic feature such as ability to install extra apps and sleep tracker. Watch experiences intermittent disconnection with iphone which is frustrating, I don't is it only happening with iOS or same happens with android too. Hopefully this will be fixed with software updates. I really hope to get sleep tracker on it.
