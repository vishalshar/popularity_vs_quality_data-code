After having had the Ecowasher Pro system recommended to me by a neighbor who had been using it for months, I purchased one.  It was very simple to install; I was finished in about 10 minutes.  (after the initial cleaning of my washer, which takes as long as a wash cycle lasts--instructions are included with the Ecowasher and are very simple and straightforward.)  I was delighted when the Ecowasher functioned properly on my first use.  What really impressed me, however, was its powerful removal of stains and odors.  My husband is on blood thinners and bleeds very easily.  If he so much as scratches his skin, blood comes oozing out.  This problem has left our bed sheets blood stained on most mornings.  I put the sheets in the washer without any pretreatment, and the blood came out.  Then I washed some washable bed pads that we had used in the dog bed with our dog when she was sick.  They had been washed with bleach, but there was still a faint odor of urine.  After I washed them using the Ecowasher Pro system. they no longer had a urine smell.  I could put my face right up to the pads and breathe in without detecting any urine odor.I am so happy to be free of lugging detergent and softener bottles home from the store, knowing that pollutants were going into the sewer system, and running out of detergent on occasion.  The clothes are fresh (no scent) and clean, and I am doing less and paying less to make that happen.
