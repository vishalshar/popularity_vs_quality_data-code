I love this sleep sack. Which says a lot because I hate all the other ones. It's very soft and very warm. Probably wouldn't work great if the temperature in your baby's room is stuffy, because it is WARM. But it's very breathable and made of good quality material. If fleece makes your baby sweaty, this is a good cool weather alternative. My baby sweats easily and I don't have any problems with this as long as I don't layer him in anything more than a onesie and socks. But he also gets cold easily and so I needed something warmer than those one layer cotton sleep sacks. This is a perfect compromise. It is sewn and designed well. It has a flap to cover the zipper head thing. I have to say, I wish i could get this adult size. It is very roomy and the snaps for sizing down are clever in their simplicity.
