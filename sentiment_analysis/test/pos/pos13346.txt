This thing is awesome! We recently moved to a new apartment and living in the city you never know what you are going to get. Realized we might be walking into a mouse problem after locating some hidden traps and steel wool stuffed into holes. Didnt see any activity until it started getting cold outside and now they are making themselves known.Within 15 minutes of setting the trap for the first time it registered its first kill. Simply dump them out and re-bait and you are ready to go again. The best placement for us was on the counter right on the edge of the oven. I cut a small piece of plastic and stuck some seeds into a little mound of almond butter on it and placed in the back of the trap. The almond butter must be irresistible to them because they go for it every time. Since we also have 2 cats on the prowl I taped a small piece of cardboard over the entrance and cut a mouse hole. Dont want them putting any paws in there. Between our stone cold murdering cats and this trap I hope the mice decide to find greener pastures!The only complaint I have is that its tough to put the bait in the back of the trap with larger hands. However thats not a big deal if you are using dry bait.
