I absolutely love these zipper sheets.  They make it so that you don't have to lift the entire crib mattress whenever you want to change the sheet.  The only thing to consider is that if you get different colors and plan to interchange them, the mattress can look a bit weird with the contrasting colors around the outside and then the top.  Not a big deal but worth thinking through when you are deciding what colors to buy.
