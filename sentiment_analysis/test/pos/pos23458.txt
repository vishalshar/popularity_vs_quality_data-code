This is my initial review of this product. I will update it when I get an opportunity, as this is the first day of ownership.Initial apparent Pros:1. FAST. Fast on load, fast on response2. Super fast set up.3. appears to be very durable in comparison to other laptops I have ownedInitial Cons:1. I had to google search how to get the backlit keypad to light up2. No touch screen.... I guess I did not see that this was NOT touch screen.... overall, not sure it makes a difference to me, but just wanted to throw that out there, as many utilize this feature in windows 103. Caps lock indicator is on the FRONT EDGE of the laptop, so if it is in your lap it is facing your stomach..... not the best design IMHO4. Numeric Keypad is not 10 key set up..... REALLY? WTH is that? if you do 10 key be prepared for disappointment, the right arrow is where the 0 should be. If your a 10 key person like me, this is SUPER annoying.Overall, I think I am going to be happy, but some of these cons kinda diminish the machine and I feel it is a huge detriment to an otherwise awesome machine.
