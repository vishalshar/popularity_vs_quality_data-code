It looks sleek and professional in black and it's not as bulky as I thought it would be--the 6 Plus is already so large so I was worried about the case adding bulk. Not the case. This is the 2nd EYN case I've bought, they last forever. When I upgraded my phone, I knew I had to buy another EYN case because I didn't want to go back to searching my wallet for my ID or frequently used credit cards.
