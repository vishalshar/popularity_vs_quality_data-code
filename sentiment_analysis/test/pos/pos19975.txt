OK, seriously.....how do they do it?  My 9 year old black lab started showing signs of aging by not being as "springy" as he used to be. If I would slap my knees, he would jump and put his paws on my chest, but now he thinks about it twice and only makes it to my knees if he tries. Getting up is also taking longer as he uses more upper body strength rather than using his hips.  I saw this on a daily deal here on Amazon, read the reviews and said "Why not?"  Well, 2 days after giving him these treats (1 per day), my lab greeted me at the gate like he used to, after I came home from work.  I saw he was standing up to the fence wagging his tail and turning his body round and round...and when I opened the gate, he commenced by running to his favorite toy and asked with his body language to play keep away all springy and stuff. I was like...WOW! Although these treats are pricier than others, I do appreciate the "Made in the USA" and the natural ingredients. Would I recommend these...HECK YEAH!  I definitely will be buying more at regular price.
