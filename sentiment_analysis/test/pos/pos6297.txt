Okay, First off this rope is SERIOUSLY sturdy. When I first got it I made the really stupid mistake of having it both attached to my wrist and my dog. Then to compound on said stupidity, I threw a frisbee for my dog. Of course, as this was the first time we had used it my dog was clueless about what it meant. He took off after the frisbee like usual only to come to an abrupt and painful stop when he reached the end of the rope (It was attached to his harness and not his neck). His momentum yanked my arm and me straight to the ground.My dog was unharmed. Me not so much I had bruised ribs and a wrenched wrist.To make a long story short this is one hell of a rope. The knot held when that happened and in the month since I bought the rope (to work on recall training) It hasn't tangled, torn, or frayed. Its latch is still working perfectly as well. This rope is 100% worth its cost.
