This is really an amazing little product!  My 10 year old son received one for Christmas and has spent hours playing wit it.  He loves to drive it and do all sorts of things.  There are many apps that go along with Sphero, as well as a programming app that teaches basic programming.  It swims, gets dirty, and travels anywhere.  I LOVE learning toys and this is it.I would encourage you to purchase the accessories along with it.
