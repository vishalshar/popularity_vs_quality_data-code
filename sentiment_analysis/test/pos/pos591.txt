My 13 year old has fine motor skills issues and has trouble keeping his shoes tied after he ties them. He will tie them and then literally within 5 minutes they are both untied. He is in a sized 8 men's and I can no longer find a stylish shoe in a velcro or slip-on that will stay on his feet. These have been a real life-saver. I have even been able to use 4 of them in each of his high-top Vans and they slip on/off and stay on well. A must buy for us!
