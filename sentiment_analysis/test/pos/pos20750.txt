What I like most about this product is that it requires no work on my end to function. Unlike other sleep tracking devices that require its user to wear them overnight, the Sense is very unintrusive. All I need to do is sleep and Sense silently works throughout the night. I've been using it for the last 7 months and I've been able to acquire valuable feedback on my sleep. Not only does it help me understand the environmental factors that are impacting the quality of my rest, but it has gotten me to be more conscious on the quantity of my sleep. Being able to look at my average sleep data has helped me to be more proactive in managing my time and to be more diligent in getting a good night's rest. To top it all off, Sense has one of the most unique and beautiful designs I've seen in an product in a very long time.
