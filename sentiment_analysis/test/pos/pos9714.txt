All quad lock stuff is good quality but pricey. I like this updated model over the older bike mount for 3 reasons. 1 I get my stem back for walking my bike. 2 the new release lever makes it easier and faster to remove. 3 the installation makes it possible to to customize the angle you want to see your phone and is more secure than the rubber bands from last model
