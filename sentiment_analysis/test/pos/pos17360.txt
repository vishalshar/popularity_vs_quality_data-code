This is a cool little device and I like the app that goes with it. Not very accurate telling serves from forehands, though. Hopefully in newer versions they will make it easier to attach to your racquet strings and also the USB charger makes it impossible to charge the thing while it's attached to your strings. So either make it easy to take on and off, or make is easy to charge while on your racquet. For the price, it's great. I haven't tried the video part yet.
