This is an awesome little light. It doesn't tell you if its fully charged, but a charge lasts for a long time. I have been using it as a bedside lamp. It hasn't been in the sun in two weeks! I will be buying more of these for wneh the power goes out in the winter and some for the kids as well for Christmas!
