We have tried several different types of tops for fermenting, generally for sour kraut or pickles, and, by far, this is our favorite. The low profile makes it certain you won't knock over any jars. They work so you don't have to remember to open the jars to "burp" the gases. We have them and have also gotten sets for two people for gifts.
