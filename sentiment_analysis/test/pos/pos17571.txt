Absolutely Awesome... It is early but the product appears to be of quality. Installation was easy, quick and the functionality is flawless so far. HomeKit integration was a must for me in choosing a Smart Lock. I love the implementation and design of not replacing the outside lock mechanism. August approach of not creating a "Hotel-like looking door mechanism" product is much appreciated and admired. It is a little bulky but looks good on the door, much better than the big block option from other providers.Despite the unclear information regarding hub integration and requirement for off-site control, I have confirmed that it does not require the August Hub if you purchase the HomeKit version of the August and you have a 3rd Generartion AppleTv that will act as that hub as expected with Full integration to Apple's HomeKit.If it holds up well over the next couple of months (no reason to see it won't), I will be purchasing another for my vacation home.
