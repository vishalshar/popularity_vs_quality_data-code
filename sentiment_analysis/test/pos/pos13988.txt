This is a nice mouse pad.  I expect it to last a very long time too - it appears to be very durable.My mouse (Naos 3200) glides over it very smoothly, and tracks fine.  My old MX518 also works fine on it.It's pretty wide, but I like that.  It measures 15"x10".  The product description doesn't actually list the dimensions anywhere, so I just thought I would get that out there.  It's pretty thin too, just over 1/8" (about the thickness of 4 credit cards stacked up).The grip on the bottom surface is very good - it's not going to slide around at all.The only potential con I can see is that it takes up a lot of desk space.  That is kind of the point though, so it's not a con to me.EDIT:  I am still using this mouse pad, 4 years later.  It has held up great.  It has some wear where you would expect to see it, but it hasn't affected use at all.  Still flat - hasn't curled or warped at all.
