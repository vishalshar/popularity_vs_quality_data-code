:: QUICKSHOT ::PROS: - Filters Quickly - Tastes Great - Looks awesome, Brita looks like cheap plastic Chinese knockoff next to this.CONS: - None really, it gets the job done nicely -:: DETAILS :: - Bought this one after not being able to find it anywhere in stock at Target, looks so much cooler than other pitchers, filters fast and tastes great. These people seem very eco friendly though I don't suggest doing like in their commercial and flipping it upsidown haha (duh..)
