This is an incredible product. I set it up today, and I love it. The setup was very easy... about 15 minutes with the iPhone Triby app.I plan to use it as a simple internet radio in the kitchen and as an emergency VOIP phone for my kid. As an internet radio, it is great. Plenty loud enough (at half volume I can hear it clearly in another room) and good quality. It won't replace my Chromecast audio setup paired with multiple systems throughout the house, but if I just want to listen to a little bit of radio... it's perfect. Just one button press and boom... radio. No pairing or syncing of devices to get it going.As an emergency VOIP phone (no landline here), it is also great. My kid can press a button to call me or press another button to call mom. If you intend to use it this way, I suggest purchasing an uninterruptible power supply for your WiFi router and/or modem. That way if your power goes out, your internet service is not disrupted. I was able to call my iPhone and my wife's iPhone from the Triby. It also worked on our phones with WiFi turned off (using LTE for the cellular internet connection). You need to have the Triby app installed on your phone. When your phone is being called, a notification will appear asking to open the Triby app where the VOIP call takes place. This feature is great!The notifications are super cool, too. My kid likes the emoticons and pushing the yellow flag back in the Triby when a message comes in.Overall, this is an excellent product. The Alexa integration takes it over the top. It's great to just talk to a device and have it respond to you. Simple things like "Alexa, turn the volume down" make me feel like George Jetson. The Triby is an excellent product.
