I was not at all satisfied at first. Thing kept popping out of the bracelet. I even lost it for good. I was a very unhappy buyer. Then I contacted customer service. I received a new device and an improved and redesigned action clip. It hasn't popped out and it even sits lower on the wrist. I love it! Any new device out there would have to be pretty special for me to even look at it.
