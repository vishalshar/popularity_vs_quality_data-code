Wonderful quality and the binding is something I've been missing in other notebooks.Is there any plan to make the "Scribe" with ruling?  I very much like the type ruling I have on this "Origin" but unfortunately had to go with another option for a pocket sized notebook for keeping track of work orders.  I just can't deal with the blank pages!All that aside I love your product and hope you continue to grow your lineup.
