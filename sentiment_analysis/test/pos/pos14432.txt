I bought the dog version because its more economical, but the same ingredients - simple freeze-dried chicken breast.They are wonderful to have on hand as a treat or extra little meal at times!  Also I would imagine wonderful for a traveler too. I do not give these to my cat in their packaged state because i dont like even giving just hard food to pets because of the dehydration factor, but what I do instead is love taking a few of the pieces out, placing them in a little bowl of spring water, and rehydrate them back to fresh cooked chicken breast ready to be devoured by my feline!They literally rehydrate within a minute or so, and half way through i pinch them to allow the water to get all the way through to the core. Once rehydrated I dice the chicken pieces up for my cat in a plate and add some of the soaking water for juice, and voila, a nice healthy pure protein treat for my cat!He adores them!!! Licks the plate clean and waits for more! Loved so much by the both of us (me ease of use, him flavor) I have ordered these three times now and will always be retuning for more!.*An added note - I find ordering the dog version better than buying the ones for cats - because The cat version came in smaller pieces.These smaller pieces i think may be more of the end cuts of breast, the longer pieces going to the dog bags, and these smaller cat ones therefore had more hard edges of what I believe is the dehydrated little bits of fat or tendon perhaps? in the meat.I find them also in the larger dog pieces, but less frequently. They do not soften when rehydrated and remain quite hard so I always remove them when dicing up the meat. I mention this fact because with the cat version of smaller pieces I just found way too many pieces containg these hard fat ridges making more waste. (like hard crystallized fat that resembles resin bc dehydrated).The larger dog pieces seem to be the nicer clean cuts of white breast from the center so they have a much less noticable amount if these "hard bits" so I prefer the dog version for this reason.
