I am not an audiophile. I have never been willing to spend really big bucks on sound equipment, tending to go with mid-range consumer products. I was even cheaper with IEMs, since I don't use them every day. Prior to buying these, I had a pair of wired Sony earbuds that cost around a half a hundred, and a pair of LG Tones Bluetooth earbuds that didn't sound as good as the Sony's. I mostly used the Sonys when traveling on planes, and the LGs for listening to podcasts while mowing. I've always wanted to try a really good set, but I just couldn't bring myself to pay hundreds to get them. I am heading off on a couple of trips soon, and decided to upgrade my Sonys.I read a lot of reviews and was screwing up my resolve to pay a couple of hundred if necessary, when I came across these on an audiophile site. Then I searched for all reviews and almost all of them came out really complementary, especially talking about the midrange, which always seems to be the worst part of my previous pairs. This seemed really promising and so I bought them about a week ago, and I am sure glad I did. All of the existing reviews talk about the really nice packaging, the large number of earpiece options, the great look and finish, and I agree with all of those. I just want to add my impressions as the non-expert, who has been using inexpensive products, and who really wasn't sure he wanted to spend even this much (and definitely not several hundred).After these arrived, I started with my Sonys and them switched back and forth with these during some of my favorite music. Putting these in is like taking cotton out of my ears. The difference is like night and day. The sound is clear and crisp, and I can really hear vocals stand out without either overwhelming bass or harsh high tones. It's like when you have had a cold, and your ears finally pop, and you realize that everything has sounded muffled until now. That's what it was like to switch to these 1More IEMs.I feel like I could listens to these for hours and never get fatigued by them. (I'll find out soon enough, when I head out traveling.) One other interesting thing I noticed is about the equalizer settings in my iPhone. I know the built-in EQ is a really blunt tool with just a dozen or so presets, but here's what I noticed anyway. With both of my other sets, I used particular presets that definitely improved the sound of the music. I generally used either vocal boost (to overcome the muddy bass) or acoustic (to damp down harsh highs). But with these, I played about a dozen different types of songs, from vocal to rock to classical, playing with the presets and I kept coming back to the same setting, which is 'flat' (I assume the same as turning the EQ off). Again, I'm no sound expert, but that makes me think that what I've been doing before was trying to counteract the weaknesses of the products, but that these are so nicely balanced that they don't need any electronic enhancement.Anyway, I am obviously not writing this review for audiophiles who know a lot about IEMs and will probably tell me that I am completely misinterpreting the EQ thing. I am writing this for other people like me, who need a new pair of earbuds and aren't sure whether it's worth spending a little more to step up to the next level. My answer is, yes, it is absolutely worth it. These sound amazing and they are worth every bit of the price they are asking. My thanks to the folks at 1More, who brought us this level of quality, and went the extra mile in packaging and accessories, at a price that non-audiophiles can also afford.
