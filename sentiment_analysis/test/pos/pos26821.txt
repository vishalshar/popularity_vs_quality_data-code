Its so funny to think about how many times someone in your life said they were going to invent a glow in the dark toilet seat and make millions and at the same time make solving  part of the toilet sear up or down issue. This light is awesome! Its like having your own butler turning a night light on for you in the middle of the night but just inside toilet bowl, no blinding lights just business and back to bed! on and off all by itself. my mom my sister and my sister in laws will all get one in there stocking this year putting to rest that !@&$*#% argument you hear every year.
