I absolutely love my Libratone (I named mine Bob). It has really cool features like "hush" where you can turn down the volume for a little bit (i.e. for a phone call). It's easy to figure out and the sound quality is really crisp and clean. In the app, you can adjust different settings for what your listening to; there's one for listening to rock or jazz, one for classical, speech, etc. I found the speaker to be great for listening to various types of music and the sound quality never got grainy. The best feature of this speaker is it works really well with Spotify. The connection is always strong with no issues loading songs or glitching. It was super easy to connect the speaker to Spotify and easy to use each time. I got the Deep Lagoon color and it's gorgeous.
