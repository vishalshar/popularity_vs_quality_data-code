This is a game changer. I have been dealing with Sciatica pain in my lower back from a herniated disc for a couple years and this is the only thing that immediately relieves the pain. I also wanted to wait a couple months to give this review to see if it was just for pain relief or actually helped my posture. I think it definitely is helping my posture and decreasing my overall pain when I am not using it. It also helps just train your hips and hamstrings to get in the correct position.Best money I have spent in a long time and any bad review on this product seems absolutely ridiculous to me.
