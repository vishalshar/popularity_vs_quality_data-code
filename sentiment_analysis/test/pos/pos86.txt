I bought this for my wife so that she could plug her iphone and ipad in at night in a very limited night table space.  I like the product, it has a solid feel to it and works well once you have a bit of experience with getting the devices to plug in.  I've seen two issues.  The minor one is that the charging cables tend to come out of the little rubber channels in the bottom if the dock is picked up which means you have to put them back in.  The cables need to be kept snug for the plugs that go into the devices (in this case Lightning plugs) to sit upright in the dock so that the devices can be plugged in.  The slightly bigger one comes from the fact that the ipad has a think case on it that completely encloses the ipad.  If the connector misses the socket it'll slip under the edge of the case which gives enough resistance to make you think you're plugging it in when in fact the plug isn't in the socket.  It wouldn't be a problem without the thick case.
