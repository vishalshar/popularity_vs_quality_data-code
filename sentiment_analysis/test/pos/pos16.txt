I love this thermal camera and all of its features, EXCEPT the fact that the USB does not swivel and there is no interposer to allow it to flip. So, depending on your Android phone's USB orientation this camera might only be useful for thermal imaging selfies. On my Nexus 5 this camera works, but it faces me, so it is pretty much useless for inspection.I would assume the iPhone does not have this issue since the plug can be inserted either way.I love the tiny Pelican-like box that this camera comes with. It appears to be waterproof.I cannot talk about reliability since I've had it for just one day.
