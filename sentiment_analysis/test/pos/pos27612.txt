Beware: SECURE YOUR BUTTON WELL. SECURE. SECURE. SECURE.It's a very good idea to make as much effort as possible of being present and "aware" of the button at all times.Just upon approaching close to four weeks, I lost mine as it became undone from my waist. It was clipped to my boxers, not recommended becuase the elastic is very thin so thin it's not of enough thickness for securing the stone and preventing it from coming off losing it for good.I did originally purchase a second kit the same day I lost my first button. After thinking about it, I reached out to the staff at Spire who were incredibly helpful once I shared my story with "Ian." I was fortunate, my letter was read by a compassionate team member who after confirming via snapshot  my original invoice of first purchase -just three weeks prior- quickly refunded in full my second purchase for $108.00 -after taxes- and replaced the one I lost quickly and free of delay complimentary courtesy of Spire.That is how you do business in the twenty-first century. It certainly is a stamp of integrity as it serves concrete evidence for the will to be genuine about caring for Spire's customers.Yes, I did write Spire believing that they would not replace only the stone even after offering to pay for only its replacement. But, I was wrong. I cannot confirm to anyone thinking about buying one that their policy reflects one replacement either. This separation occurred with no wrong intentions, I wrote to them explaining the details and they delivered. What more can I say?It's a good tool, I've enjoyed the coaching it subtly provides as it reminds one to breath, get up, stretch, and periods of quality focus or calm. If you are willing to work with it as a team, it certainly does indeed hold the potential of improving one's quality of life in a world feeling of no quality as a result of the abundance of pressures.I'm grateful for Spire's support. Thank you kindly -Ian- for understanding. A temperature sensor built within the button paired with a ringing or sound from one's smartphone alarming the separation between human and tech could remedy this issue; I have a feeling I am not alone. Just a thought considering our core consistently remains at around 97/8 degrees fahrenheit, a steady base reliable enough to be used to alarm the user of subtle changes that can call out and prevent a costly separation.Thank you and good luck with your stones. I've had it with mine and couldn't be happier. This is a true story and was not paid or compensated for sharing my experience with Amazon by Spire or anyone else.Scouts honor.Orlando
