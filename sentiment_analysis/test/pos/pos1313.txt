I've had the original canary since it was released and I've been extremely happy with it since.  When I heard they were coming out with a weatherproof version for outdoor use, I pre-ordered it as soon as I could.  And now that I've received it and set it up, I can say I couldn't be happier with my decision.  The main key for me is that not only is it weatherproof, but works completely wire-free.  I looked at some of the main competitors (especially the nest outdoor cam) and this was the main hold up for me.  Not only is the wire unsightly, but I have a fairly large piece of property and the wire-free nature of the canary flex gives me a lot more, well, flexibility in terms of where I can place it.Now I have it set in the optimal position to watch the comings and goings of visitors (both expected and more importantly, those that aren't), keep an eye on packages left at the front door, and keep tabs on the wildlife.I've only had it for a short time, as it has just been released, but so far I am 100% satisfied and feel more secure at home.
