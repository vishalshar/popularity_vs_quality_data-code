For the past ten years, I have not been able to wear  any eye makeup. Even the tiniest bit of mascara would cause my eyelids to become red,swollen and inflammed.  (I believe the medical term for this condition is blepharitis or "granulated eyelid".) I had pretty much given up on wearing mascara.I'm so glad I decided to try Lamas Lash Masque! I've been using it for a few days and my eyelids are fine! This "mascara" lash treatment is extremely gentle.Young women who want to create a super-dramatic big "fake eyelash" look, might be disappointed...But I'm in my 50's so I just want a natural look that enhances my eyes.First,I put on a coat of Mavala Double Lash.(That's another lash conditioner...also very gentle.) Then I put on one or two coats of Lamas Lash Masque. It definitely made my lashes look longer, fuller and darker. I wore it on the top and bottom lashes and it did not smear under my eyes even after a long day at work. The directions say you can leave it on overnight, but I wash it off at night.It is easy to remove with a warm, damp washcloth.If you have very sensitive eyes, troubled eyelids, wear contact lenses and if you prefer natural, organic beauty products,I would recommend Lamas Lash Masque as one of the best!
