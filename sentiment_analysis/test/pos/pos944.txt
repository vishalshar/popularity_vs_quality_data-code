To say that I love everything about the Dash would be a bit of a stretch... but not much of one. The design is cool and the fit is comfortable. Audio quality is good even at its loudest, though maybe not on par with my old bose ear buds. Passive noise cancellation is spotty, depending on how well the seal is formed. I could wear a larger sleeve size but it can be a bit uncomfortable. Having no cord whatsoever is amazing though. If I'm doing some late night film watching or listening to music in bed, there's no cord to get caught and yanked if I turn over. Just pop them in and they stay pretty secure. The macro gestures and face tap to access your personal assistant are especially helpful because finding the sweet spot on the optical touch of the Dash is a bot of a learning curve. I really like that Bragi continues to update the OS, and I hope they will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Bluetooth connectivity is alright, though not flawless despite the software updates. It has improved but even having my phone in my waist pocket of my scrubs the connection can be spotty. Be sure to keep your phone around arm or chest level as recommended for best results.Okay so the absolute worst thing about the Dash, - at least in my experience - is the charging cradle. Everything has to go through the charger to work. If the Dash stops communicating with each other while in ear, you have to plug them back in to the charger. If they need an update, back into the charger. Not using them? In the charger. Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but the all important magnetic lock that is supposed to ensure a proper seat 100% of the time in the charger is incredibly finicky to seat correctly. So much so I have looked at trying a new charger to see if I have a defective one. Today I popped them in the charger while I wasn't using them and by them time I got back to them they were dead because they hadnt been seated correctly. Luckily the charge time is pretty quick, but the left Dash is so much more troublesome when trying to get them to charge that I have to move it around till it blinks and then hold it there for a number of seconds to make sure it doesn't disconnect.Bottom line? These are the most functional headphones I have ever purchased. I do love them, but they are not perfect. And for 300 bones I would have liked the hardware to be a little more solid. Fix the connection between the Dash and the charger and it would be well on its way to a 5 star rating. Then again maybe it is just my charger.So yeah. Love the Dash! Wish I had supported them on kickstarter because I like a good company to succeed but alas I am more consumer that investor. Hope they keep bringing the magic with those OS updates!
