I am a big fan of Wasabi Peas.  When I ran across World Peas Bombay Curry at TJ Maxx, I had to try them (I love curry).  They were fantastic.  I really could not get enough of them.  When I realized how good they were, I hopped on Amazon to search for other flavors.  I have now tried a few other flavors of World Peas.  Here are my reviews...Curry is great and worth trying.  BBQ and Garlic are both very yummy.  The Chili flavored are disgusting!  Several of us in my office tried them.  I liken the flavor to what I imagine bathroom cleaner would taste like...blech!  My co-worker's tongue went numb after eating several.  We couldn't get to other food fast enough to get the taste out of our mouths.  Stay away from that one.
