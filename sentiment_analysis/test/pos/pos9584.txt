This allowed my cat to have some fun dashing around our yard and even hang out in trees and on our roof.  I stapled the yellow wire to my fence and around the fascia at my roof line.  I trained him to become acquainted with it as per the instructions then I took a video of his first encounter with the "zapping perimeter",That video is posted here for you to see.  The zap he received definitely didn't bother him a much but maybe enough to make him respect the boundary, hmmmm - about 95% of the time.I used to think these were cruel. But he never seemed hurt, depressed, or annoyed by the system.  Again, this is the first time he went outside after system installed and he was trained as instructed.On the contrary, he struck a really cute stance when I showed him I was about to put the collar on him; he'd raise his chin extra high for me.  He knew he was going outside to run and climb trees like a the maniac he is.  He actually acted very proud when he had the bulky collar on.It's not 100% prevention of a cat escaping because my cat would periodically either go through the perimeter or find a way to jump off my roof onto something, or maybe just directly to the ground.
