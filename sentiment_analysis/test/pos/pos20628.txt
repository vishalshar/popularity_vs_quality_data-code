I've been using this product, along with a few others (cleanser and moisturizer) from Don't Call Me Ma'am over the last several months. Really like the clean feel of the products on my face, doesn't go on heavy and doesn't feel heavy.They work well together and my skin looks good every day. I have tried different products over the years and often have to stop using them because of breakouts and have had no issues at all since I started using these products. I like the size and shape of the containers as well because they fit nicely in my travel kit and I travel quite a bit! I recommend this line of skin care products!
