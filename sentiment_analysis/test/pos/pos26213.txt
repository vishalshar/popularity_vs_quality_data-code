I've been battling razor burn and severe bumps for most of my adult life. I've been wet shaving with a safety razor, since 2012. It was a great move, but just shaving with the Bevel safety razor, just once so far. Man, it has taken my level of comfort to the stratosphere! I'm more than just pleased, but truly relieved. This razor is a game changer, I've been the Merkur long handle from " The Art of Shaving", it pretty good; but this cuts the hair right at skin level.
