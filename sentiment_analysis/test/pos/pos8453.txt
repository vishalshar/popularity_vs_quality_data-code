This laptop is perfect for an engineering student like myself. It will run CAD programs with ease utilizing its SSD, however; I would not recommend this product for gaming. The dual core processor cant handle most intensive games. It can run a game like CIV 5 but not First Person Shooters like Counter Strike at a competitive level (meaning frame rate issues and screen refresh rate). The overal performance of the computer is spectacular with very short boot times. My only gripe with this product is that it is labeled as a gaming PC but doesn't really perform well in that category.
