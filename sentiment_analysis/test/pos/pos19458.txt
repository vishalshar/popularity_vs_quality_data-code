Had mine since late Feb 2016.  Arrived surprisingly fast after ordered.  My experience with customer support has been excellent.  Online manual and PDF manual you can download have extremely good information especially if you are new to making Point Clouds. Bought this model mainly for form factor in the price range, especially for safe storage between uses. You have to read the manual and work with it to get the best out of this scanner but for its price vs. the ones with higher resolution which cost a lot more it does a fine job and is an excellent learning tool.  The Mac version of the software loaded and ran on El Capitan without any serious problems.  Even though the critical "Align" function is stated still as Beta it seems to work quite well if you feed it a pair of decent scans. As a total newbie to point clouds it took me a while to start getting the best it can deliver but am surprised at what it can do for the price. Hardware to do better seems to start in the $3,000 price range.  I am mainly interested in scans of organic forms for use in DAZ3d via OBJ files though I also have a 3d printer.  Hexagon 2.5 is quite happy with the OBJ files, but finds they have a huge number of vertexes! And of course DAZ3d imports the OBJ with only the usual "what size is it" bit of figuring out.  My first decent Froggie scan imported initially larger than a Genesis 3 Female! The software outputs a fairly long list of file formats and the Meshing Software included seems to work well  I am now using the same laptop I use for 3d printing to do the scan capture as both take a fairly long time to work through a decent job. Just like a high quality 3d render, the hardware has to work on it for a while and so far this scanner has been quite happy to chug along problem free for however long one of its maximum resolution scans takes.  Comes with a nice little green Froggie to practice on so you have a "standard" target well known to the company if you need to ask for help.
