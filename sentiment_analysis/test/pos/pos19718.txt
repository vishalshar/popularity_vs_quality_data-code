I wish I had discovered this product years ago. I like mascara but it's always been a problem for me. My skin is oily and the mascara would always smear or smudge or flake. I just could never be comfortable wearing it because I was always stressing about the racoon eyes. And it would irritate my eyes with the chemicals.This stuff is different. No chemical smell or irritation, goes on easily, dries quickly, does NOT smudge or flake or smear. It's not as dramatic as a true mascara but it's perfect for the daytime when I want to look nice without looking madeup.
