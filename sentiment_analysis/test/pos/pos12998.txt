My Oak Ticwatch 2 arrived yesterday. Nicely packaged, in fact it took me some effort to break through the plastic shrink-wrap!This is a big watch - bigger than any other smartwatch I own. The thickness is especially obvious - even the heavy old Sony SW2 is only two thirds as thick. The included leather strap is pretty horrible - cheap leather which feels nasty and uncomfortable. Thankfully the free silicone strap I received as a kickstarter backer is much more comfortable. Replacement 20mm straps are easy enough to come by. The black plastic back of the watch is disappointing considering the smart looking stainless steel construction of the front, although with the black strap it looks attractive enough. Overall the watch is much lighter than it looks, but the size still makes it a little awkward on the wrist.Setup was fairly easy. Annoyingly I had to log in with my Google account, it wasn't possible to register using a different email address, since the verification code email never came through (Mobvoi are looking into this). Once signed up there is a short tutorial which shows the most important aspects of the OS. I've set the watch up with my Sony Xperia Z3. Notifications for email, SMS and facebook messenger come through fine, a little vibration and a chime, and they are readable on the screen.The screen is fantastic - bright and clear with amazing viewing angles, everything I could hope for. The OS is fast and responsive, although a few times my swipes (especially left to right) haven't been recognised. The touch sensitive tickle strip running down the side is also a little temperamental. All functions seem to work well - heart rate sensor, step counter, voice recorder and playback.Music was easy to load on (although there's only room for maybe 100 tracks), and playback through the watch speaker is very loud and of surprising good quality. It was easy enough to pair with a Bluetooth speaker as well, and Bluetooth range seems good. The watch does seem to be able to connect to a phone and speaker or headphones at the same time.The calendar app only appears to show todays entries  Ive not figured out whether its possible to see further into the future.I've not used the watch to make a phone call yet, but judging by the quality and volume of the speaker and the quality of voice recordings, I think it will be fine. I might look a bit stupid talking to my wrist though!If you enable it, its possible to use the built in voice assistant  I found I had to get the watch close to my mouth before saying the OK Tico hot word - also manually starting with a swipe and asking a question works well. Questions like "what's the weather in London" and "what's 2+4" gave useful answers, and commands like "set a timer for three minutes" work. Recognition is fast and accurate. Some questions ("what's 200 pounds in kilograms") were recognised but not answered, and occasionally Id get a voice search not ready message.Fitness will have to wait until I go for a run, although I've successfully paired the watch with Google Fit and Runkeeper. Step tracking and heart rate sensor seem to work fine. Likewise Uber will have to wait until I need one, although that seems to have been paired up as well. The process for all the above is simple, requiring you to log in again to the service you want to pair.Getting the Mobvoi store onto my phone meant downloading and installation of an APK file - the app lead me through the process, but still a little unnerving given the Android warning messages. The store also seems to want access to things I'm uncomfortable with - my photos, my phone calls etc and wont continue without the permissions. Once on the phone, the store is pretty pointless, since there's not many apps on there at the moment  hopefully that will improve over time.Long term, battery may be an issue for me - the watch arrived fully charged, and after installation and a few hours of playing around was 35%. At the end of yesterday it still had about 5% after six hours of heavy use, and charged up very quickly. I'll wait to see how it lasts during a proper day, but I imagine youd be able to get 12 hours of normal use out of it. This certainly won't be a whole-week watch like the Pebbles though. The charging puck seems nice, although even after only a few minutes on it the watch feels warm.In summary, so far I think this is a very nice device. The OS is excellent and everything works well. The current lack of apps is disappointing but that will hopefully change. Ultimately I think the size and battery life are going to be the deciding factors for me as to whether I can use this watch daily. Future versions need to be thinner - ideally half as thick.Four out of five stars at this early stage.Some comparison pictures below showing Ticwatch 2 next to other smartwatches (Pebble, Sony SW2, Pebble 2).
