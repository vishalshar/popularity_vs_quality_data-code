We bought this food for our Rhodesian Ridgeback puppy. THe food is great and has made his coat really shine. My one complaint about the food is the fact that the morsels are tiny and he is HUGE. I wish they had "large dog" puppy food. He is 80 pounds but just 8 months old therefore he still needs the puppy food.
