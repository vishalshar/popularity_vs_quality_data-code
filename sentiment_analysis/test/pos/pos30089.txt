I bought this for my youngest who by birth order gets schlepped all over the place, including during his nap times. Seeing his head in awkward positions was killing me! This truly solved the problem. I wait until he falls asleep then put his head back and slip the little panda over his forehead. I wish I would have bought this earlier.
