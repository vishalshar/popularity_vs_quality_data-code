I love this pizza oven! Took a bit getting used to heating it evenly[ a few burnt crusts]. Turns out my 4 burner grill has hotspot issues that were resolved with replacing the burner tubes; a bit of a pricey fix for the grill but the oven not heats up perfectly and a 4 minute pizza is not out of the question, evenly browned both top and bottom. Who needs delivery anymore? Thanks for producing a superior product at a fair price.
