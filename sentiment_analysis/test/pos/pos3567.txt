FINALLY received mine the day before heading out of town for two weeks and setup today.  So far, so good.  Replacing an older Apple Time Capsule and two Airport Express(es).  In initial observation:Setup:1) Luma directions do not explicitly say your phone needs to have a data connection to proceed with setup.  It took me two or three tries and some head scratching to figure this out.  Setting up my base unit in the basement with no cell signal available, I had to use one phone as a hotspot upstairs to proceed with connecting.  Once I did, not problem.2) Luma instructions wanted me to place the second unit in one room next to the base station - huh?  We live in a two-story ranch-style home.  I put the second unit in our upstairs den where one of the old Airport Express units was located.  Third unit went into the hall closet where the third Airport Express was.3) It takes a minute or two for each unit to sync up.  Watching the blue light start spinning sends one into paroxysms of doubt, but be patient butterfly and you will be rewarded.4) The old Time Capsule had an Ooma and printer connected to it.  I had to buy a switch TP-LINK 5-Port Gigabit Ethernet Web Managed Easy Smart Switch (TL-SG105E v2.0) because there's only one Ethernet out on the back of each unit.Use so far:1) On the Apple network, I had 30mbps down and 6 up right next to the Time Capsule base station.  Airport Express #1 had 15 down/5 up.  Airport Express #2 had 8-10 down/4 up.  Speedtest  is giving me a steady 30 down/7 in home office near the base station and about 25/7 elsewhere.  Huge improvement.2) We had an issue watching Netflix or Amazon Prime on a Firestick if the kids were streaming videos.  So far, the network seems better managed and there's been no noticeable buffering or dropping.3) App usefulness tbd.  After setup, I was connected to WiFi but the app told me I had no connection.  Tried signing out and back in and was taken to the setup screen.  Finally called Luma support.  David was incredibly helpful and told me my issue was with Luma's cloud servers.  Just try back later.  If I get setup screen, their servers are down.  He was honest and very helpful.  I know that Luma wants a positive Twitter feed but how about a little update there to free people up from your excellent CS reps?Looking forward to using the system more and will update the review with any hiccups.  The negative reviews are a little surprising and I guess haters are gonna hate.  I'm likin' it so far.
