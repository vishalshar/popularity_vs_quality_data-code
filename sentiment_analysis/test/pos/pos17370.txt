For about a month, I have been using this small battery pack to power two separate incliners.  I have tried other non-mAh portable, rechargeable power packs, but they would not last more than a few hours.  This ChargeTech unit is excellent, perfect for my incliner application, which I use daily.  The other units were much larger, but not nearly as reliable.  They would not last a day, before needing to be recharged for 10 hours.  I recharge the ChargeTech about every two weeks, for 2 - 3 hours.  Excellent product, which does what its developer says it will do.  Did I mention that it powers BOTH of my incliners...at the same time?And it's easily hidden out of sight.  I also bought a power plug splitter, so that I could plug both of the chair power plugs into the power pack, which has a single three-prong receptacle.  Money well spent for what had been a very elusive solution!
