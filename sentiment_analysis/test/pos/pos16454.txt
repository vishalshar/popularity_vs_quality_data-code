It is nice not to have to change the litter box every other day.  I was spending a fortune on cat litter, and the box was so heavy it was hard for me to lift it.  I really like the ScoopFree Litter box, and it only take a minute to replace the refill tray and reset the timer.  The only problem that I have is that my cat likes to play in the "litter crystals" which increases the counter each time he gets in there.  When he hears the motor of the scoop running, he sits and watches it and then climbs back in the box.  I have the timer set on the max of 20 minutes.
