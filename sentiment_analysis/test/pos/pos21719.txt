I down a pack before a hard mountain bike workout or race and notice a nice energy boost. I've also used them competing at altitude this year and have not experienced altitude sickness and shortness of breath and racing heartbeat nearly as bad as I used to. Taste is ok, about what you'd expect. Earthy and slightly sweet. Mixed in a smoothie you can't taste it or it adds a woody note to a cup of coffee.
