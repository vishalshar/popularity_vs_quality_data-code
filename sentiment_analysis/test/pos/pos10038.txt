I'm not usually a fan of dried fruit. It's usually too chewy and too sweet. These chips have a bit of crunch to them without being like potato chips and just enough chewy. Not too sweet, I love the cinnamon addition as well.  Low in calories, this is a great way to get the "sweet" while still eating healthy!
