Excellent water bottles! I bought two for cycling, and they fit perfectly in my standard water bottle cages. I love being able to unscrew both ends to wash them out and prevent mold (yuck). The only minor issues I have are that the bottles are not insulated, so condensation forms on the outside in the Texas heat. This condensation runs down and collects in the bottle cap, which then spills on you when you tilt the bottle to drink out of it. But again, it's hot so the extra "hydration" cools you off! It's not enough of a problem to bother me, and I highly recommend the bottles and will purchase again.
