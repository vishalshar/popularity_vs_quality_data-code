This is THE best treat-- single ingredient, loved by our cats (and it's been so much cheaper to buy the bigger "dog" bag and just break it into smaller pieces) and is much better and healthier than any treats that are not just fresh or freeze-dried.But when I got this (and the last order as well), it was not what's shown.  It was instead the older, foil bag and it was like sawdust rather than chunks of freeze-dried chicken.Amazon is replacing it (they have great customer service) but I hope the new vacuum-packed packaging will alleviate the dust issue and wasted treats.  The last one went back to the manufacturer who ensured it was better packed.  Hopefully this next order will be spot on.  My cats (one who is very allergic to nearly everything else) are yelling for this!
