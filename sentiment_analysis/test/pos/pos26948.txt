I originally used Penny board wheels on my skateboard and then replaced them with these.  With the Penny wheels, although great standard wheels, if they were to roll over gravel in the road or go over a big crack, the wheels would catch and throw me off the board.  Once I put on the Shark Wheels amazingly they just rolled right over top of gravel and big cracks in the road without any issues.  These have got to be better than any standard skateboarding wheels.
