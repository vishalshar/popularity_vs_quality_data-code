Generally, i connected more than four wifi devices, played video and browsed the Internet. All devices streaming look very smoothing. Downloading data seems faster than my old Netgear router.My house are two floors, whose size is about 2000 squire feet. It seems signal strength is very strong. No any connection issue to the router at anywhere.App is so funny, and is very convenience. Very easy to operate.Very good production.
