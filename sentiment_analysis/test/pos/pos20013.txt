Awesome product to make sure you can charge your iphone in a hurry and without having to search high and low for a sync cable.  Cable quality is absolutely top notch...makes me feel like it would survive being run over by a truck (glad I have not tested this yet...).  Both ends fit together very nicely that make for a keychain loop.  Or if you're like me, I just keep my chain straight so that it fits in my computer bag to take out anytime for quick charging.  Either way the product is perfect.  Cost may seem a little on the high side, but, in my opinion, it's worth the extra build quality that seems like it would last forever.  I travel on international filming trips quite often and keep this baby handy at all times.  I highly recommend the cable!
