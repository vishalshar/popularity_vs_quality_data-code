The auto editing feature is fantastic for making a single camera look like multiple ones and they make "live editing" of the video easy and intuitive. It's clear that the company is committed to the product - they have released multiple software updates and are responsive to feature requests online. I'm impressed with the video and audio quality but it's the small size, great user interface and ease of use that make it stand out.Nothing is perfect. I wish you could use it upside down and have it automatically sense the correct orientation - then I would mount it hanging from the ceiling. Configuring wifi on the camera is the best I've seen but still clunky. The battery only lasts about an hour on it's own (but you can plug it in for unlimited use). I have 2 of them and look forward to being able to network them together for even more camera angles and options.
