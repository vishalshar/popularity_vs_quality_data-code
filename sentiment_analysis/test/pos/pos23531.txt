Mounting a Garmin GPS is problematic. You want it in a convenient location but dashboards are carefully designed not to have anywhere to hang anything. This mount uses what is today almost unused dashboard real estate: the CD slot. Four thin fingers slip into the slot. A tightening screw then pushes the center two fingers upward to wedge the mount into the slot.The phone holder itself attaches to the mount via a ball mount that allows left/right/up/down adjustment as well a 360 degree rotation. This lets it hold a phone vertically or a Garmin horizontally. The jaws open to a maximum of 3-3/4 inches. The jaws are removable if you want to mount something else to the basic mount, like a Garmin ball. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it held my Garmin 2595 horizontally with ease. No need to adapt it at all. See attached pictures.
