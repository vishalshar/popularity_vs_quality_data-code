I bought this jacket for my trip to Thailand because I had seen the Kickstarter campaign and though I'd support a venture by ordinary people doing extraordinary things. I love the concept of the jacket and for traveling, it's really handy. There are two things I would change: 1. the inflatable pillow is a disaster. It's heavy and the air comes out in two minutes. I took it out and used my old pillow which folds into a tenth of the size and weighs a tenth. I think Baubax should either rethink that design or eliminate it. The second is the handwarmer which is sewn into the sleeve. So every time you put the jacket on, it comes out so you have to spend time, stuffing it back up the sleeve. That is really annoying. I'm going to cut it off because for the most part, anywhere I travel, I won't be needing it. I also wish they could make it in more colors: black, blue and red is about as generic as it gets. I was thinking of getting it as presents for the family but not until some changes are made.
