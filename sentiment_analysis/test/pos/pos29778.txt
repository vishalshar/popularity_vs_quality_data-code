This is by far the BEST popcorn butter you can get, in fact I think its 100x better then anything at the Movie Theater. I have used other brands, and they do not offer a true butter flavor like this brand.I use this with my white kernel Air popped popcorn, and ground sea salt.~From a life long popcorn lover!
