Great product. We purchased 3 Whistle trackers after one of our Schnoodles decided to go on walkabout after a huge storm blew open our fence gate. Only through perseverance and sheer luck did we find her in the nick of time-dehydrated, malnourished and on her last legs. My wife and I decided to get an online tracker to make sure we could find any of our animals if this happened again. The product and app are really easy to use. You basically make a Whistle account and associate a tracker with an animal choose how big you want your immediate area to be, Charge it up on the supplied base, put the tracker on your animal's collar and you can check their location and how much activity they have during the day. Only thing I really don't like is that you have to plug your base into the house receptacle and use no surge protectors. Apparently they use the house wiring as an antenna. While your animal is near the base/charger, the tracker uses very little battery power so you may charge your tracker once a week if your animal stays close. If you have a large yard and your animal stays away from the base, you may need to charge more frequently. You can also set up your account to receive e-mails/texts about your animal. I may be one of the lucky ones that get texts at 2 AM that one of the trackers need to be charged. lol.  You can also share the app and add owners so if you have a pet sitter, they can have the same access. This is a service, so expect to pay a monthly fee. You can dampen the pain by going for longer service plans.
