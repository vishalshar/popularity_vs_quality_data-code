This is amazing!If you want the ability to be able to control your sprinklers from your phone (and/or remotely) you need this system.The appliance is super easy to set up (a few wires and a Philips head screwdriver).The app is even easier.Top to bottom...this probably only took 30 minutes to complete.I now can turn on/off my sprinklers from my app and I have a schedule based in the current weather that allows the Rachio to turn them in when needed.
