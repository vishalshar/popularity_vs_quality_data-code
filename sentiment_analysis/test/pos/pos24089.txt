The MK802 are a well built set of headphones ,the sound the reproduce is really good wired and or through the Bluetooth.Ive only had to charge them one time and have had numerous sessions with them .fit may be a bit  small around the ear but is not uncomfortable  and does cover the whole earthe pads do get warm over a couple hours of listening but I'm always moving around tooSound isolation seems to be good ,no one has complained of hearing the music and I dont hear anyone talking around me unless there is no music playing.The buttons on the side are small but function all the volume and play/pause etc. I have dialed number by mistake so I turned that function off .I have not made a call with them so I cant review that function of the headphones .I don't use the software that you can download.I use them on a LG V10 and Ipad min they sound great on bothHope this helps you decide on them for under $200 you cant go wrong
