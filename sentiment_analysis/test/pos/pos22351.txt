My boyfriend offered me Eben Naturals Facial Cream couple days ago and I enjoyed it so much that I felt the need to try other products in their line. I settled for the Body Lotion as the description closely matched my needs. After using it for a few days I must say the results have exceeded my expectations! The lotion is easily absorbed by the body and you are not left with an annoying oily feel on your hands. My skin feels very smooth and Im happy to actually use an All-Natural solution. For far too long I was drawn to fancy brands with high price tags, until I became more knowledgeable and started pursuing healthier alternatives. Im very happy to have been introduce to this line. If you have dry or combination skin and love lotion with a pleasant yet light scent, youll love this!
