Works very well. Comfortable and remarkably cool as promised. My only issue with it is due to my unusually sensitive ears, which tend to feel squished and begin to ache after lying on one side for more than a fairly short time. I do have pillows with memory-foam shreds that allow me to push the shreds away from where my ears need to go, but none are nearly as consistently cool to the touch as this pillow, a necessity for my particular sleep needs.
