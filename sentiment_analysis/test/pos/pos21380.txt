I really like this product. It could be improved if they could make it lighter even - perhaps titanium or carbotanium. Even aluminum should work for an option without the bottle opener. I understand that strength is important, because some people may keep it in a wallet that is kept in their back pocket and that may flex. At least they could offer a super lightweight version for those of us who aren't concerned about bending it, or they could even offer a flexible carbon fiber / plastic version. When your pockets are loaded up with a miscellany of keys and other junks, every extra gram adds up. One more idea would be a version / option that contains a little makeup mirror viewing window - in a pinch, at least you can quickly preview the results of your grooming effort.
