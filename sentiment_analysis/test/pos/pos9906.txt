I have only used it 1 night but so far I am in love with it!  I am a side sleeper and it was the perfect height to use alone without another pillow..  I think I've had the best night of sleep in years with this pillow.  I bought one for my husband as well but do not have his feedback yet.Update:  My husband describes it as 'drowning in comfort'I'll update after a week or so of using it.It's been a few weeks now.  I still love it!
