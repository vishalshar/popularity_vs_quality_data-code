Some people have said that this does not work with Nexus 6 but that is because they are probably covering the M on the back with either the magnet or the metal badge plate. I did some testing of my own and the only time I had problems was when I placed the badge over or partially over the M on the back. I now have the badge just below the M and it works perfectly and holds the phone with no problems whatsoever.
