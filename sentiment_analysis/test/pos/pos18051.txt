I cannot use any conventional deodorant due to being dreadfully allergic to the aluminum in it. I get a rash that goes all the way to my back if I use "normal" deodorant for more than one day". I've tried several natural brands over the years; Tom's of Maine (horrible), EO spray (okay, but doesn't last long and no wetness control), and now Primal Pit Paste.I don't know what else to say other than Primal Pit Paste is perfect and life changing. It simply works. And works WONDERFULLY at that. It cuts down on wetness and odor all day and, while you certainly might need to apply if you're being very physically active, I've never felt worried or self conscious that I might start to stink while using it. Putting it on with your fingers (much easier than the stick, which I promptly lost) takes getting used to but isn't too weird or messy. I've never had an issue with it staining my clothes at all either.Also, I've never had a reaction to it. I was nervous when I tried it after seeing people's photos of irritation, since I have very sensitive skin, but ive never even gotten so much as an itch in all the time I've been using this product! However, I should also mention I was definitely "detoxed" from conventional deodorant when I started (hadn't used one with aluminum in almost 2 years) and I don't shave my underarms at all.The scent is also wonderful!I love anything that comes in lavender! Might try some of the other scents in the future too!Overall, I love Primal Pit Paste! Do not hesitate to give it a try!
