After not sending commands to the switch for a few hours, the first command of a series has a few seconds delay. Succeeding commands execute in well under one second. It's as if my account has to swap in on their servers, or it takes a while for the device to wake from sleep.Setup was easy, through the "manual" method. My problems with the automatic (WPS) method weren't the fault of the Smart Plug: I'd had trouble before with WPS on Airport Extreme.I wish there were a direct API that I could call - instead, I must currently use D-Link's canned app to talk to their servers which in turn talk to the device. In an ideal world, I'd register once with them, and get a permanent cryptographic token and an open-source library that I could incorporate into my own programs. That way, I'd get some certainty that I'd continue to be able to use the smart plug even if D-Link, in the future, chose to turn off their servers.I wish the iOS app implemented a documented URL scheme such that IFTT (IfThisThenThat) could,for example,  tell the iOS app to set device 3 to ON, and then return control to the calling app via the x-callback-url URL argument.
