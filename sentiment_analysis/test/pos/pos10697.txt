Bought this for my daughter and her boyfriend for xmas for their dog and they love it!  They check the dog's activity several times a day and joke with her when they think she needs to get moving and get more steps in!  It also monitors the dog's sleeping patterns!  I can even install the app on my phone and check the dog's activity from across the country!  It was definitely  a big hit as their xmas gift this year!
