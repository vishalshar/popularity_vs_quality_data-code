I was so skeptical about buying these bags because the reviews wrote them off as expensive, mediocre and hard to open. Yet, I purchased them and I love these bags. They are awesome and exactly what I was hoping for. They are easy to open (although albeit children might have a hard time, so help them out!) and they wash up nicely. My only complaint would be that they need to be hand dried very well, if I were one to complain. Overall, this does get a 5 star rating because sustainability rocks, and I am so excited to buy some more of these bags! Thanks Amazon and Blue Avocado. You rock!
