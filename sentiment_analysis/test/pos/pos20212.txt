The setup is a little difficult at first (you should have a friend help unfold it), but this kayak is amazing!  When you have it over your shoulder, it feels like an overgrown laptop instead of a 12 foot long, fully functioning vessel.  After kayaking on the Gulf of Mexico, I forgot where I parked my car.  I walked 5 blocks easily without having to take a break!I think my favorite part about the kayak is its size.  I look forward to taking this kayak here and abroad, in my Prius or on an airplane.  This is a kayak you don't have to part ways with when you move somewhere far away.  Definitely worth it!
