I have been using Whistle for 3 days now. Today I tested it extensively. Here is what I experienced:CONS :1- Customizable safe zone ( Geofence) : Alert message comes after 5 minutes or so when pet leaves the safe zone. I believe safezone is greater than what is shown on the app.2- Lets say you noticed your pet is missing then you can hit track button. Since device thinks that pet is near the base station, it refuses to track. If you press the track button repeatedly then tracking starts. And it will give the location of the pet on a map and in address. This is not real time tough. It refreshes about every 3 minutes.... Address info is not accurate but location shown on the map is accurate. This is not perfect but very helpful.. I am impressed with accuracy of the tracking as long as you don't mind 3 min delay.3-  I use other GPS software such as Waze or Google Maps - I am surprised that why tracking CAN NOT be REALTIME. Technology is available.PROS :1-  Device was easy to set up. Software is easy to use.2-  Device is small enough and sleek.3- Activity tracking is good. But I would prefer a working Geofence or REAL time tracking in stead of that.I will send more updates if I decide to keep the device.Update : I decided to keep Whistle . Once you accept 3 minute delay with notifications and location tracking then it is a good device to find your lost pets. It does give me peace of mind if in case my pet runs away.Lastly :  It would definitely help someone find a lost pet but the TIME lag (timely alerts when safe zone is breached or delay in tracking is troublesome)
