The size of this mat is ideal, it is large enough for my two kids (8 mo and 2.5 yrs) to play together.  The material is both supple and supportive.  I was drawn to it initially because it uses kid-safe materials. However, now the top reason I would enthusiastically recommend this mat over others is because of the amount of cushioning it provides while still being easy to clean and light weight. I liked this a lot more than any foam tiles I've sat on at other places.I wish it came in more neutral color options, it would be perfect in a tan or light gray.
