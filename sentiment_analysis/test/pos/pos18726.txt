Good:-It works.-It's relatively inexpensive.-Decent software.Bad:-Hybrid mode (thermal + normal images) doesn't work good on close distances.-Calibration clicks may be slightly annoying.-You need to understand what exactly you're purchasing.Overall:Seek cannot compete against serious products like mid-level FLIR cameras, but it's way better than nothing or in situations when you don't need a full-featured pricey thermal imager.Images:1. A laundry washer, ~1m away2. An iMac, USB disk below the display, B&W MM-1 on the right (left speaker is invisible, so you can imagine the difference in temperature!), LED lamp on the very right.3. A living building with balconies. As you may see, there's a big difference in heat loss between the first and third floors.4. A man in a winter forest ~50m away from the camera. A few more meters away and a still figure cannot be recognized.
