Been using it about a week and it works great so far. Was easy to set up, and I love being able to turn on each zone from my phone to see how things are working.  The iPhone, iPad software is still pretty simplistic, but it is improving. Right now it only tells me when the last watering was and when the next is.  Personally, I would like more information about what it actually did (how much water did each zone get?) and better detail about when it plans to water next.  I also would like to see a browser based version that has a history file of when each zone was watered and for how long.
