One of the things I hate most about using a water bottle, is cleaning it. I love the idea behind this, the bottom is removable and allows full access to the inside and bottom of the bottle. Nothing leaks because the design is so well done, and the squeeze is very easy to drink out of. My one complaint is that the clear plastic scratches very easily. Be careful and use a soft sponge.
