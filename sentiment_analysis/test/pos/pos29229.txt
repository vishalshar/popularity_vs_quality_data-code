Wow! That is all I have to say about this cat food. It is listed as one of the highest quality dry cat foods by a couple sites. As soon as you open the bag it smell like a higher quality food than your averages store bought brand. And I hate to say this about cat food, but even the packaging is top notch, seriously. It is definetly an expense cat food. But in the grand scheme of things it is not that bad. And you it is much better for your little guy/girl.Additionally, pro tip is to serve food with some water to increase aroma for your pet :)
