I use my Raicator for chipmunks more than mice.  Works great you just have to keep it out of the rain. If I used any type of food,  I end up getting ants so I use a large wood chip, rock, or a marble.  Chipmunks are so curious they just go in because they're nosy. My only complaint is that sometimes the light is flashing but there's nothing caught inside. I check the batteries and they're  no longer strong enough so they need to be replaced.  Caught  about 28 this year and 2 mice. Highly recommend Raticator S plus
