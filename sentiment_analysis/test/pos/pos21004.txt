I received the Korner Home Security yesterday.  Installed in 10 minutes. The most time was spent with the third sensor, where best to use it. I put it on a coat hanger in the closet and it works like it was a window opening.  So now when my grand kids are over I can arm the system know if they go out a doors or get into my closet where firearms are located.  And I also have each gun locked and ammo in another location.The reporting is great, I get more information on this security than ones we use commercially at work @ $60 a month.I think even if a family never armed the system unless they went on vacation and had it they would be impressed.  What time was the front door opened, When did the kids leave the house in the morning.  Its all recorded.I'm thinking of getting another sensor or two for my ammo box and maybe one on the lawn mower and/or four wheeler.The four rating is based on not having the test of time, but I will report back
