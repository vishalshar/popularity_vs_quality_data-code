This is a great phone! Phone looks and feels good to hold and use.  My favorite things about this phone is that for not a lot of money you're getting a very good phone.  I'm picky about my phones and this checks everyone of my box.  it's affordable. It has a great 720 display with great viewing angles. It has just enough ram and storage (2GB and 16GB) for my needs and more.  It has LTE bands. It has 2 great 13 MP cameras with Electronic Image Stabilization. It has a fingerprint scanner.  Those last 2 points are just the cherry on the cake.  I'm very impressed that you're getting so much phone for not a little money.  There are other phones that come with half of the specs that this phone has for the same price.  Posh Mobile really put out a good phone this time.My 3 favorite things about this phone is the front and back 13 MP cameras and that it comes with a fingerprint reader.  They are really really nice for what you're paying.  The phone is stock android so the camera app.  The camera shines when you get a different app that can really maximize the use of the cameras.  Pictures are very detailed with good color saturation.  Video recording caps out at 1080 at 30 frames per second on the back camera and 480P on the front camera.  Both look great and if you need a phone with video chatting capabilities than this phone is for you.  Selfie lovers will love this camera.  I like that it comes with a fingerprint reader.  It works very well and no one will get into your phone.  You don't have to hit the power button most times.  I find that I just put my hand in the pocket and find the fingerprint reader and by the time I put it up to my face the phone is unlocked and ready to go when I am.  Finally my last favorite thing about this phone is the battery life.  It has a lower powered processor and 720P display that makes battery life last most of the day.  I found that I didn't have to top off until later in the day with moderate use.  Playing games and watching videos and GPS are normal parts of my day and this kept up with me just fine.The phone I think is a great value but there are some things you should know.  The only accessories you can get are what comes in the box.  Charging cable, plastic case that hides how good looking this phone is, and a plastic screen protector.  I searched and searched but there isn't anything for this phone.  I had to be comfortable with using this phone naked.  It attracts a lot of fingerprints because of how glossy it is.  I really wish I could get some accessories for this phone.  The speaker is single firing from the bottom of the phone.  It's loud but not the greatest and is easily covered up by holding it in landscape.  It's not a deal breaker at all but something that should be pointed out.I also haven't gotten any updates for this phone yet. It could use a few tweaks to make it that much better but we shall see what's in store for this phone.  I don't know if it'll get Android 6.0 but if it does than this phone will become an absolute must buy.
