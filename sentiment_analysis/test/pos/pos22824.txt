Happy to find xylitol that is from the U.S. I use this in my coffee and there's no "off" taste. Just don't use too much because it can cause a bellyache and diarrhea (true of any xylitol regardless of brand).  My sister can't use it at all; however I've had no problems after starting out with just a bit each day and gradually using more.
