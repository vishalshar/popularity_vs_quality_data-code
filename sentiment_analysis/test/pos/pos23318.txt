Fantastic and game changing.  I have a large old brick home that requires internet on three floors.  Here is a list of the wireless routers that I purchased in the last three years and that did not work to provide reliable wireless in our home: (1) Airport Extreme (2) Netgear N900 Wireless Router, (3) Linksys EA9200.  In a failed attempt to make these three different wireless routers work I also added a Netgear range extender and used an Securfi Almond as a wireless range extender.  None of these combinations provided reliable wireless internet throughout our home.  Sometimes everything would work and sometimes some devices would get kicked off the network and could not login without rebooting everything.  The range extenders often did nothing.  Before I purchased eero, I was unplugging and restarting my modem and router at least once a day. Even at its best, I could never reliable get devices to work that required a reliable and strong wireless connection. In particular,  I have 5 Nestcams that would rarely stay connected for a full day. They require a very strong and reliable wireless connection to work.  Also, WiFi calling on my AT&T iPhone does not work unless it has a strong 5ghz wifi connection which I never was able to achieve consistently in my home.  I have approximately 30 different devices connected to our network at any time (5 iPhones, 2 iPads, 2 apples TVs, 1 Roku, 1 iMac, 2 MacBook Air's, 8 Sonos speakers, 5 Nestcams, 1 Peleton bike, 2 printers, 2 backup hard disks etc.) and in order to get all this stuff, I had to hard wire as many of them as possible directly to ethernet because wifi was never reliable enough.eero has changed everything.  It took less than an hour to set up 3 eero units.  Everything worked on it immediately (Note: you have to restart your modem as instructed and unplug an restart any ethernet switches).  We have wifi in every corner of every floor of our house.  Every Nestcam has worked continuously without fail and I have full wifi calling on my iPhone.  The eero app (which is fantastic) lets me check the status of my network from anywhere and has shown 60mbps of download speed, 5mbps of upload speed and all three eero units online since the moment I plugged them in. My family has never been happier.ps If anyone wants any of the routers or extenders the eero system replaced, let me know and I will send them to you for free (picture attached).Update as of June 26, 2016: since the day I set eero up in April, I have never touched it. I have never had to reboot it or restart it. I have never lost internet connectivity for a minute. No other router I have had has worked like this.
