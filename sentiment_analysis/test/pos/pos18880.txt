These totally work! They make my cheese last longer, so I can use cheese at my own pace and not worry about throwing away food (it's hard with only 2 people in the house to eat everything before it goes bad). I have used the bags with parmesan, colby jack and cheddar so far. The cheese doesn't seem to be able to go old!! The block of cheddar was already questionable when I put it in the bag; I cut off a thin layer on all sides hoping to give new life to it, and threw it in one of these bags - it's now been a few weeks and I'm still cutting off slices to eat with crackers! I haven't seen one sign of ageing (no white powder on the outside like I used to get after 1 week in a Ziploc). My boyfriend didn't understand why I spent money on "paper bags" for cheese, LOL, but they're not just paper bags, I don't know what they line the inside with but it seriously works!
