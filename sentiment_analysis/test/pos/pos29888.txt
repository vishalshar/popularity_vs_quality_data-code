I was very skeptical at first about this little thing. I'm very particular about the fans I use because of how light of a sleeper I am. Any noise wakes me up, even if it's the fan changing tone or rattling. I'm blown away by this tiny little speaker. The fan noises are great. They mimick actual fans very well. The white noise sounds are kind of scary but to each their own I guess. No more bulky fan and no more fan taking up space in my luggage when I go on vacation. Love it and I highly recommend it for people needing a fan to sleep with at night.
