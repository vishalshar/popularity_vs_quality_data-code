Wow.  I see the negative reviews and just don't understand them.  Look at the attached picture.  Can YOU tell where the heat duct is hidden in the wall?  The only thing I have to really compare this camera too is the new Flir One and all I can say is they are comparable in price and function.  I tried both and it was close but I did go with the Flir, but prior to these new cameras coming on the market I was only familiar with the units that cost $30,000 - $50,000.  I am an engineer who uses these cameras for work.  We have used them to detect heat loss from buildings, concealed heat ducts and trapped water inside a leaking membrane roof.  Other engineers I know have used them to evaluate electrical equipment.  These new units compare very favorably to the older ones, and for the price, these are incredible.  I have to assume that those folks who are giving these cameras bad reviews just don't understand how these tools work.  I have showed mine to five other professionals and all five asked me to send them a link to where they could buy one. One whimpered a bit about the $55,000 version that he already owned that would probably just gather dust because it was the size of a suitcase.  These new units do not have all of the functionality that the larger, more expensive ones do, but I suspect every engineer who designs or contractor who installs; insulation, walls, roofs, fenestration, electrical, heating, AC, ... everybody will have one.  At least everybody who knows how to use one.
