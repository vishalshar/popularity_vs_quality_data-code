This stuff is great. The cheese keeps much longer wrapped in this paper, and the papers last a long time. When I'm finished using one, I just wipe it down with a damp sponge, wipe it dry with a dishcloth, and it's ready to use the next time. Even though it's an expensive box of papers, they're going to last me for years.
