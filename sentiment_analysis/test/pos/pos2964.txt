One of the coolest things I have ever purchased. So very cool. This is the purchase that has spawned the now famous game, "What Did I Buy On Amazon Today...?". Lol. These kits should be bought for every kid you know, every foodie you know, any science geeks you know, every horticulturalist you know, anyone you want to impress that you know, every Mom you know, every Dad you know, every cool person you know, anyone you know, you know. I cut the entire front off and grew it laying down. I am proud to call myself a Mushroom Farmer. :) Dang, that sounds cool. It was cool. I watered the shrooms everythime I looked at them. Which was a lot. I feel like they liked that. :)
