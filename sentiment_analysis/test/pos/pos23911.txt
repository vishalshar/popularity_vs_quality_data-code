This is pretty awesome! Loving an ability to control everything from my phone when the kids keep hiding the remotes. I didn't figure this out right away, but having an access to my important buttons straight on my lockscreen without unlocking the phone is pretty cool! Much easier to press just one button to switch to HBO and catch up on my VICE documentaries! Highly recommended!
