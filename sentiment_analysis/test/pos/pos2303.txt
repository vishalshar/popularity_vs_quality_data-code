THIS saved my life!  I cannot believe the relief I have found because of BetterBack. When I started using it, I was going to the chiropractor 3 times a week, doing therapeutic yoga 3 times a week, eating an anti-inflammatory diet, and everything else that would help my low back pain.  BetterBack is WONDERFUL. It alleviates the pressure from sitting which has helped the chiropractic adjustments to hold.  In addition to getting a new bed, and an orthotic in my shoe, I am now down to once a week at the chiropractor and using the BetterBack whenever I go out to dinner or to the theater or any place where I will be sitting for any length of time. I feel that even though I was doing a lot to help my back pain, BetterBack gave me a jump start to fully heal.  I highly recommend it.
