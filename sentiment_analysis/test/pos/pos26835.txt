I had to begin an elimination diet because of allergies. I am allowed to have sweet potatoes but was unable to have any type of 'snack' food like chips because I  couldn't have the oils they were cooked in. I AM allowed to have coconut, so when I found these it really made my day! They have a great flavor and are less greasy than other potato and sweet potato chips that I have tried previously.
