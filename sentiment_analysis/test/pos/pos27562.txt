These are so great that I bought one for my mom too. No need to spend $250 on fancy wifi enabled detectors if you use this. As an added bonus, this will allow you to hear what is going on during the alarm, which I do not believe those fancy "bird bed" ones will do. This helps a lot with context, especially if you have set it up so that you get a call from your family member's Leeo device. It also makes a rad night night-- any color of the rainbow!I tried to get others onboard but they scoffed at it, unable to understand why I would want to get comparable functionality from a cheaper option rather than dumping money into the famous options that would make me look cooler and "allow for fewer apps on their phone." So, if you need to look cool and spend more money doing it, this might not be for you. If you are more worried about your house and loved ones while saving money to take them out to victory dinner after rescuing them from an inferno, buy this!
