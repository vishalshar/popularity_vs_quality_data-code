Zero problems setting this up.A few comments:- Have wall anchors suited to YOUR wall type. They provide generic ones, which might be Ok, but if you're rockin' stucco, brick, slump block, lead-lined reinforced concrete, etc., you'll need suitable fasteners.- If you're hard wiring, be careful. Make sure that circuit is off from the breaker.- Make sure you have enough wire protruding, if you're replacing your old system.- Use the provided Little Rubber Washers to seal the mounting screws. Don't neglect this. You don't want water in this thing.- It is IP54 - this means Ingress Protection 5 (Any dust that can get in won't affect performance) 4 ("splash" water protection from any direction - mount it under an overhang, and make sure sprinklers don't directly hit it, and it'll be fine.) It's water resistant, not water proof.Rachio: Good stuff, guys!See my other review on the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller which fits in this enclosure.
