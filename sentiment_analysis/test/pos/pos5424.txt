This product and app are great, except it does not seem to pair with any devices that have more than four digits for a Bluetooth password (mine have six). What's more, the Cassia Bluestream (great idea, BTW) wants to "monopolize" the audio stream, making it near impossible to link from other devices directly to the speaker(s). Still, if there is some tech support and a few kinks worked out, this solves a great deal of my issues with connecting to Bluetooth. Oh, and due to the range (500+ feet), you're able to essentially see all of the neighbors' Bluetooth devices as well! ;)
