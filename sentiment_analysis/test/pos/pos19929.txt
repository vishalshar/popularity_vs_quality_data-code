Update... though first one arrived with a dead unchargable battery. The replacement one arrived and works fine. The images are vibrant and clear. The fact you can save as jpg files or movies that move between focus points is great. Easy and fun to use. Solid build too.Arrived with the internal battery at 0% and completely unchargable. Edit: I noticed that this review does not appear if one sorts by most recent, even though it is most recent or close to it. Only if you intentionally filter to see 1-star reviews only, then and only then does it appear. I am changing this to 2 stars just so someone may see it and be spared the hassle. Many folks got dead on arrival on these shipped by Amazon.
