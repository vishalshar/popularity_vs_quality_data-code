We got this for our son for his 6th birthday. Excellent! Fun bright color, the bell and the water bottle are perfect touches for my enthusiastic kiddo. I put it together in under an hour. Would have been faster but I had a little trouble getting the handle bar to slide into the base. Arrived on time and the tires were pumped up already which I really appreciated. Great bike.
