I've really fallen for Julep as a brand, these colours are great and long lasting. It does take a second to get use to using them but they dry like gel nails and are worth spending more money and you wont have to redo your nails every 2 day.My favorite is to put the lightest colour on my nails wait for it to dry and add a coat of the gold sparkles on top.
