I frequently look for new ways to curl my hair and following several failure purchases in the past few years, I was delighted to be thrilled with these!!!!  My hair is heavy and straight, it's difficult to add volume and curl rarely stays long, even with a LOT of hair spray.These gave me light, fun, bouncy curls!!  As well as, a good deal of volume!  I used very little hair spray, trying the first time while hanging out at home, and to my surprise, I still had fantastic curl at the end of the day.  I am so happy with these!
