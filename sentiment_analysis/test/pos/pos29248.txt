Here's the backstory: I had a Razer Mamba for a year before it died on my (right click stopped functioning). A razer product that fails? SHOCKING (sarcasm)!So, I began a quest to find my perfect mouse.My criteria were as follows:- two thumb buttons- ideally wireless- feeling of control while gaming- ideally, solid construction and feeling of high build quality.I've tried the following mice at length over the past month: Logitech G700, Razer Mamba 2012, Deathadder 2013, R.A.T. 7, Steelseries Sensei, and the Mionix Naos 8200.Out of ALL these mice, I've finally decided that the Mionix Naos 8200 is the one for me. It meets every criteria, except the wireless, but the mouse feel and control is so excellent, I'm willing to not care about wireless.The material on the mouse just feels WONDERFUL in your hand. The construction feels really, really well done, and in general this is the ONLY mouse where I just stopped noticing the mouse altogether because it worked so flawlessly. Razer's products all had minor issues or defects. The Sensei's design was nice, but clicking (compared to the Naos) felt a fraction more stuff, and the body made my palm begin to sweat after 45 minutes or so of use. The G700 was pretty good, but the body was a bit bulky for fine movements, and the side buttons didn't have a satisfying click to them. And the R.A.T. 7 was just...wtf. Adjusted the hell out of that thing, still never felt as comfy as the others.Then there's the best part: the click. I can't describe how satisfying the click on this mouse is, lol. It just feels right.The Naos is EXTREMELY well made, and even though its using a laser sensor (known for having a fraction of hardware-based acceleration), it was the only mouse that just felt good the whole time.As far as lifting the mouse: yea, its hard to lift. But I never felt I NEEDED to lift the mouse, and in fact, the whole "pinky and ring finger rest" forced me to get more picky about my DPI, and in the end I felt more control because I didn't have any awkward drag from those two finger on the mat (as happened with the Sensei).Best part: they are a newer company based out of Sweden, so it feels great to both love their product, and to whole heartily recommend somebody else aside from Razer, who's build quality and customer support is absolutely abysmal.Try the Naos, give it a few days of use, and you'll probably end up loving as much as I do.HIGHLY recommended.
