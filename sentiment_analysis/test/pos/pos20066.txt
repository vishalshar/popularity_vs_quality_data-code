The iro is one of those inventions that makes you wonder, how can something as simple as a irrigation control was never improved to fit the needs of a limited valuable resource?Thank God someone thought of this and made the IRO.It still amazes me how intelligent this little box can be. I have saved a lot of water thanks to weather prediction feature built into the IRO.The versatility of me being able to monitor my water usage from my phone is also an amazing feature.If you have a mechanical water timer please upgrade to this timer, it will also pay for itself in a short period of time.Other reviewer said that this is the nest thermostat for your garden, I can attest that it is indeed the nest thermostat for your garden!####UPDATE####09-15-15#####After using the Iro for about 10 months here are my experiences:1.- Customer support is really helpful and are dedicated on serving the customer2.- The device itself and the APP have both received a bunch of useful updates, they make the IRO simpler to use.3.- Power failures are not an issue with the IRO since everything is stored on the cloud. I would forget when using my mech timer to replace the 9v backup battery, which in turn resulted on the timer resetting itself to 12 AM every day for 15 mins each water station. This impacted my water bill really bad4.-  A new feature called FLEX SCHEDULE was added, you basically let IRO do all the work and determine when its convenient to irrigate.Flex schedule works best without any restrictions, but if you live in a city that has watering restrictions, like I do, you can limit WHEN IRO works.All in all I think its one of the best purchases I have ever madehope this helps!
