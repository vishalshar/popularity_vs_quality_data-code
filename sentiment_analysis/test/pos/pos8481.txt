This is my second Line 6 amp.  I also have a Spider.  They are both modeling amps.  What you give up on pure sound, you gain on flexibility and connivence.  The sound does not compare to my Carvin tube amp but it does so much more.  I bought the Amplifi as a practice device.  The app works OK but not with every other app.  The link to your music library is pretty cool.  It finds the most likely tone setting and it does a pretty good job.  You can also slow the track down, etc.  The actual amp/pedal setup works good too.  You can set up a wide variety of amps, cabs, effects.  You won't gig with this, but for practice, it's pretty good.  Also, it sounds pretty good, you can use it for a bluetooth speaker in a pinch.  Sounds much better than a lot of the smaller units.
