My little fur daughter is thrilled about her new iFetch and the balls are perfect for her little mouth. My only problem (not yours) she refuses all of my efforts to get her to drop the ball into the toy.  Still working on that.  The balls are not easy to keep up with, but she has not chewed through one YET.
