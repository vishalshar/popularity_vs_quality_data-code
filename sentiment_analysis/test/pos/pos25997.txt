I love them! The packaging is super nice! I am a sucker for pretty boxes.:) The ear pieces are very well made as well as is the charging case. I had trouble connecting at first but after a search I found that I needed to do a firmware update. That did the trick. The ear phones connected right away.The ear tips that come on the earphones fit my ears but didn't give me a good seal. I don't like open sound. There is always  a low amount of bass.  I found some fixes that did the trick but the best and cleanest fix was some of my old apple inner ear soft gel tips. I use the small tips and they fit perfect and give a great seal and it allows the headphones  to fit fine in the case. But, finding replacements will be difficult because Apple doesn't sell replacements. Bummer! The best part is once they are set up they pair together once you put them your ears. They are great! I can't say enough good things about them. Well worth the money.
