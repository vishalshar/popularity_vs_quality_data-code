1st time reviewing anything on Amazon but I feel that the team behind Nextbit Robin definitely deserve a big thumbs up on creating such wonderful phone. I also found that the camera and battery is much better than a lot of people said. The battery last through a day easy and I'm always on my phone. I came from note 3 and although the processor and ram are the same it feels like an upgrade. Design of super sleek as well. Great job!
