Caesar loves these bones but they can be really messy and smell a little up close. When he eats them they break into a million sharp bone fragments. I'm not worried too much because I know Caesar chews everything he eats. Other dogs who eat really fast and choke down food, I would be worried they might swallow larger pieces of sharp bone and hurt themselves. But Caesar had nothing to complain about. He chomped them down. In all fairness, these are marketed for puppies and our Caesar is a full grown Chocolate Lab who can munch these like pretzels. Your puppy will love these. Just be aware that if you have a dog or puppy who eats really fast, choking may be a possibility and that the many pieces that are produced when a dog munches on these can be a bit of a mess. Caesar keeps the pieces in one place so this is no problem for us. It's up to you to decide if the pieces make too much of a mess for you and your dog.
