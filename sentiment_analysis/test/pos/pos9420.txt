I wish to withdraw my previous one star review that I wrote for earlier today. My problem with the charger was totally my fault although I think the directions might need to be clarified.  It says to press the button a certain number of times depending on how many hours charge you want. So when I did that the light came on and was still on when I set it out in the sun.  This caused the Waka Waka  to become completely discharged. Others who wrote a bad review might want to take this into consideration. They might have made the same error I did in the charging process.  I am giving a four star review instead of five only because I think the instructions could be clearer.
