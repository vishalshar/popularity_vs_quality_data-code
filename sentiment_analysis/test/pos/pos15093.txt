Use this for circuit type training and love it! my phone is kind of big (Galaxy SIII) but it does fit...just seems to "weigh it down" unless I have the band tight.  All in all, I recommend it if you don't want to wear an arm band (which gets in the way for HIIT moves and lifting, in my opinion) I pull the headphone cord up thru my shirt to keep it out of the way
