Amazing lights.  While homekit isn't flawless, this kit is pretty darn close.  SUPER easy to setup and easy to use (even my 85 year old grandmother can use them).  And lets face it, the are so beautiful.I had some issues with the hub dropping due to a communication issue.  I have never... and I mean never been treated better by tech support personal than the people at Nanoleaf.  I called, and a REAL person answered!!!!!  They walked me through everything about their technology, they help me get things resolved, and let me know about upcoming firmware that will keep the issue from happening again.  And then... they actually followed up, and make sure I had everything I needed and that things were working correctly.
