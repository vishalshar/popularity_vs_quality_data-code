You could say I'm deff a makeup girl. I practically live at places like MAC, sephora and the Nordstrom makeup counter. I had heard about these and I was curious. These are absolutly awesome, the sizes are perfect for my MAC makeup brushes. Look up how to use them exactly perhaps on youtube because if you do it right you'll get all the benefits out of your brush. The shipment was here in 5 or 6 days, so that was great. The best thing to do is get a plate and put olive oil and antibacterial soap on the plate, and spin your brushes in it. Then rinse the brushes and slip on the brush guard. Leave a little space at the bottom of the brush and put them face down in a cup so the water isn't going to sink into your brushes, and bam, you have great brushes!This is great& you can't beat the company or the price.
