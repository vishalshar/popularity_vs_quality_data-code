Beautifully designed from all angles.  They are beautiful, in all finishes.  They feel so good in your hand as you pick them up you almost don't care whether you have any ice cream in the house or not.  And they work wonderfully well, angled for exactly the right scooping process.  Gave them as gifts...to glowing reviews all around.  Can't wait for the next utensils they take on and redesign!
