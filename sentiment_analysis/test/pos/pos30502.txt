I'm a peanut butter fan.  I've enjoyed a peanut butter and jelly or honey sandwich all my life.  Because I've preferred a particular name brand of peanut butter that starts with Peter, I didn't start out expecting to like this peanut butter.  I'm pleasantly surprised.  The honey mix adds a nice sweetness.  You can make a sandwich without adding anything, although I've tried it with honey and with strawberry jam.  Either works nicely.  I was also surprised to find that it is 40 calories less than my name brand and 50 calories less from fat.  It looks to be more natural and from better ingredients than what I usually buy.  It is a creamy peanut butter and spreads nicely.  I'm not sure what I would suggest to improve this peanut butter, except a reduction in price.  It's definitely pricier than my regular brand.  Overall I can easily recommend it.  I did receive this at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased review.  If you have questions about this item or my experience, please ask!
