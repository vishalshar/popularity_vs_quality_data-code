I have a tri-level home and I was not getting very strong Wifi signal with my previous router. My wired LAN speed is 47 Mbps, in my basement I was getting about 6 Mbps on wifi. Even on the main level where my router is, I was only connecting at about 30 Mbps, whether 2.4 or 5ghz. Set up the Portal, which is a very simple and basic setup, and connected...I got 32 Mbps. Super bummed! Only took a second to realize I was not connected to "Fast Lanes" which is the 5ghz channel(s). Once I connected to that (it's listed as your SSID with HD after it) I did a speed test and got 46 Mbps! Basically the same as my wired connection. Tested again from two different devices in my basement...same speed. Incredible! I'm so stoked on this router. I'm basically getting 8x the speed in the basement compared to my previous setup.The drawbacks? Well, there aren't any advanced settings...yet. I just got an email today from Ignition Design Labs saying this:Thank you for your wonderful support and feedback to help improve Portal.  We have incorporated your feedback in many of the new features recently released in the latest firmware and app updates. And many more features are in the pipeline to be released in the coming weeks.Here is a summary of the latest new and coming soon features:Newest Features (available now)PPPoE support during setup.WAN static IP configuration.Bridge Mode configuration in iOS and Android app.Advanced Compatibility ModeGuest Network with static credentialsImprovements to 2.4GHz performanceFixed iOS password setup bugComing Soon week of 11/7DHCP reservation (LAN static IP configuration)allow Port Range selection in Port ForwardingDynamic DNS (DDNS)UPnP supportMAC address filtering (wireless and LAN)View attached devicesComing Soon week of 11/21Advanced Mesh with dynamic auto-routingMultiple Portal management support in iOS and Android appGuest Network with dynamic rolling code credentialsPort TriggeringDLNA server and clientJapanese translation (iOS and Android app, and WebUI)Coming Soon week of 12/5VPN ClientIPv6 supportMost of the features mentioned as missing in several of the negative reviews on Amazon, appear to have been addressed by Ignition Design Labs (creators of Portal) and are on the way.The one feature I want to see ASAP is MAC filtering. The PlayStation 4 cannot connect to 5ghz networks, which is embarrassing for Sony considering that technology was around for several years before the PS4 came out. I bought a wifi access point to connect to the Fast Lane channel and then connect it to the PlayStation with an Ethernet cable...but the access point will not recognize the 5ghz channel from the Portal without MAC filtering. That appears to be coming in the next firmware update next week though so I'll just wait patiently.I have no other complaints. This thing is nice looking, doesn't have ugly antennas sticking out and actually has 9 built in so the range is outstanding. It sets up with a mobile app which is interesting, but it's super easy to pair and the GUI is very user friendly...partly because those advanced features don't exist yet to clutter it up. By default, they're hidden anyway. So if all you want to do is plug it in and get connected, you couldn't ask for a better system. All in all I'm super happy with it! The speed is mind blowing, and that's all I really care about.So far so good, no dropped connections. I'll update if anything changes that would affect my rating. Until then, buy with absolute confidence!
