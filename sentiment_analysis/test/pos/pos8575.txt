Love these.  I like using mason jars for storing food.  This works great.  I used two of them with the shaker attachments, for sugar and sugar substitute shakers.  Very cute way to store.  I also used one for peanuts, love that I don't have to take the whole cap off to have a handful of peanuts.  I need to order a couple more, so I can have a jar of cashews and one of almonds.
