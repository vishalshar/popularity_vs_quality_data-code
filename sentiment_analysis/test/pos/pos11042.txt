I have tried a couple of different brands of trackers.  This one best fits my needs.  I like that it has replaceable batteries.  I had a Fitbit Flex that tracked my activity and sleep and had an alarm to wake me, but it had to be charged every 4-5 days.  When was I supposed to charge it?  The only thing I don't like about the Misfit Ray is that I can only set one alarm.  I would love to be able to set it for a different time on the weekend without erasing the weekday one.
