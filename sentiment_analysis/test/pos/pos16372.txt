This turned into my nephew's most loved Christmas present. He LOVES Minecraft. This allows him to carry all of his world's and hard work with him wherever he goes. He has been so proud of it and wears this daily.We are keeping an eye on it to see how long the band lasts and holds up (due to constant use.) So far, so good!~After keeping an eye on this item for a few weeks, we were able to get it for a great price! Since we got it for such a good price, (around $50) I can't really complain about the subscription fee. Although, you do recieve a year or so free to try it out. The subscription fee is rather cheap and we'll worth it considering this band has become his life line. We spend money on other subscriptions to Netflix and such, so I guess we shouldn't be surprised about the yearly subscription for this band.
