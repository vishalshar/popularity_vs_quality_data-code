This little fella puts out good, clear, and surprisingly loud sound for a speaker that fits in the palm of my hand.  I wish it was loud enough to hear when I was driving my boat, but I think it's unreasonable to expect something to be heard clearly over the sound of an outboard motor and wind out on the open water.  Good product.
