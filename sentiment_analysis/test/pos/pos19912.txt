We loved the quality and taste of this xylitol and knowing is made out of birch is nice. Besides from cooking and sweetening teas and coffee, I also used this for my homemade toothpaste because it protects the teeth and gives the paste a sweet taste (the kids love the orange flavor). The price is not so great for a bigger family but it's the right price for this quality.
