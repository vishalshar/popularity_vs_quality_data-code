I pretty much like everything about this phone with one exception. When you turn up the IN CALL volume all the way up it becomes distorted and is really noticeable. Maybe I got a bad unit but it's pretty annoying. Other than that everything works well and speakers also sound pretty good. Not as loud as the Moto X Pure but similar quality. Solid phone overall and no glitches with anything so far. Also I got the mint color and I like it. I'm a guy and I don't think it's too girly, it's just very clean and fancy looking. It turns heads for sure.
