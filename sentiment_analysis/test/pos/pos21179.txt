This is a fantastic phone, especially for the price! Coming from a Samsung GS4 (which I loved), I was looking for a bigger screen and an escape from bloatware. This phone offered both those needs and gives the quality I've become used to, with my previous Androids. I'm very careful with my phones, but feel a little better knowing this one won't cost me $800 to replace if I accidentally damage it. The screen resolution is great, and the 13mp camera takes excellent pictures. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one if these.
