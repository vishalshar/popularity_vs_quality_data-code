I honestly don't know how I lived without these bags for so many years.  We eat a lot of cheese in our household, and we enjoy having several varieties on hand at any given time.  Invariably, one or more of the cheeses would start to mold before we ate it all, and this was especially true of the larger blocks of cheese that are so affordable at Costco.  With these bags, I have "lost" a hunk of Jarlsberg in the back of the cheesebox for 4 months and when I pulled it out, there was not a spot of mold to be found and the cheese wasn't dried out in the least.  It tasted every bit as good as the day I put it in the bag. I have had equal success with of all the cheeses I've stored in them so far - cheddars, jacks, goudas, Parmigiano Reggiano, havarti, Swiss - you name it and these bags protect your cheese investments.  They are generous enough in size to easily hold the large blocks sold at the bulk stores or the two-pound bricks sold at your local grocery. I am a fan of Formaticum bags for life, and my pantry will never again be without them as part of my storage arsenal.
