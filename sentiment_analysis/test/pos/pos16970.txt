I really appreciate this product for now. I've bought it for my family to keep track of our sleeps days after days and care a bit more to the nights of each other. It's a very kind way to know someone's daily feeling and engage deeper conversations.On the other hand I had some unexpected wifi issue but the customer support helped me in very few exchange to make it work properly! Very quick and efficient.Big + for the app which is very relevant even if I would love to see some graphic adjustments in a near future. :)
