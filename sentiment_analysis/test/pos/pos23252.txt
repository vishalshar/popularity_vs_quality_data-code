I live near large fields and have had a problem with field mice getting in my house.  I used this product as soon as I saw a mouse.  The red light blinks to let you know when you have a mouse.  No mess disposable.  Just dump into a garbage bag.  No touching the mouse or dealing with a trap.  I used dry dog food as bait.  I'm sold on this product!
