I rarely write reviews.  I made an exception in this case because I love these Hickies so much, I want to do everything I can to ensure this product continues to be available.  I've had my Hickies for almost three months. I will never go back to shoe strings (at least on workout shoes) ever again.  I get a much better "tie" with my shoes now than I ever did.  When I first put the Hickies on my shoes (5.11 Men's Recon Cross Trainers), the top two bands would pop open when I put the shoes on.  But after the first week, this stopped.  I have only had to reconnect a band maybe 2 or 3 times since.I have put these through a lot - I do hill sprints at least twice a week.  I also ride about 50-75 miles a week and lift heavy (squats/deads) multiple times a week.  I have never had a single problem with my Hickies despite the workouts I have put these through.This is a great product - please support this company so I can continue to order these!
