This product was a gift for my mom. She loved sending pictures of the daily progress. It "sprouted" within a couple of days and was really fun to watch. It was easy and the directions were fool proof. There are 2 sides so you get to enjoy the process all over again after you grow and harvest your first crop. I would definitely recommend this to any novice gardener.
