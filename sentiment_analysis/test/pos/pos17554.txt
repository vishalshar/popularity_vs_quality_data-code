There's not much I can say here to add to the title. This is a quick little USB drive with a lot of space to offer. As others have noted, there is no cap to lose, and it takes up very little space in a bag or pocket. It does have a little light on the side that is on when in use (which is pretty common in flash drives). If you need a good bit of space for a good price, I think this is a good choice.
