It is not in the manufacturer's packaging and arrived without any instructions or documentation of any sort.The design for installation needs more refining.  There is a set screw underneath that is impossible to get in place, if you have any extra wiring underneath the unit.The device did not working correctly until I contacted support.  Everything setup as expected, but the ability to "Watch Live" never connected.  I have the skybell right outside my room with a brand new high end router, so the signal is very strong.  It strangely would still record video from motion detected or doorbell rang, but no motion or people are in the video.After contacting support, everything just started working perfectly.
