I really like this. It is exactly what I wanted to attach my GoPro to my backpack.  The straps on my pack are relatively thick so I has no issue with the screws or bracket rubbing.  I could see where very thin straps may allow some small screw protrusion but for me it worked great.  I would recommend it.
