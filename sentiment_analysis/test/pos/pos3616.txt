Kid loves it. Easy to use (after about half an hour of learning), he is now making his own designs, searching the 'net for other people's designs, proudly showing off his creations.A major con: It goes through filament pretty quickly - you will end up buying a lot of additional filament. The filament is not the standard 1.75mm one, but 3mm. Their FAQ warns against buying any filament not produced by their company. And guess what - the branded 3mm filament is super expensive. They seem to be doing a printer cartridge / shaver blade kind of business model. Very disappointing.
