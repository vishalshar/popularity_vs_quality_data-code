I received this a few days ago and so far so good. The two issues I ran into were 1) A consistent crash when trying to backup ALL of my videos at once (at least 10GBs). Backing up smaller groups solved this and generally I'll back up files more regularly so this shouldn't be a problem for me. 2) The device/software seems unable to transfer Slo-Mo videos to a micro SD. I've tried many times and the progress hangs on zero and the device doesn't flash (which it normally does while reading/writing).  For others experiencing trouble transferring files, avoiding Slo-Mo, may help. Not ideal but usable.  I tried a 16GB and 64GB card (pictured) with no trouble so far. I reviewed the backed up files on a Mac after transfer and they all seem to be intact. Primarily I will be using this to review and transfer videos from my Yuneec drone, edit them on iPhone, post to social media, and transfer edited file to a different SD Card, delete original video from first SD card. I successfully tested this use. Tested on iPhone 6 Plus.
