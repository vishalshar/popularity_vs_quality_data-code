Note: I've only had these for about 3 hrs...but I am compelled to write a review.  If you buy these expecting to have the same "experience" as your typical glasses...nope.  When I first tried them on, I thought they might pinch too tight.  Was about to set them aside and say...oh well, they will be my out on the town readers, but not full time.  Luckily, I decided to keep them on a bit longer...cause after some time, they really do not pinch.Now they are smaller than many readers, so that is another thing to get used to, but the diminutive size and weight is amazing.  They weigh nothing!  In the case, they are slightly bigger than a credit card.  You really can take these everywhere!The nose bridge has a sort of sandpaper grip which helps it stay put on your nose...and it (so far) works very well.  What you do need to be careful of is knocking them off.  If you wrinkle your nose a certain way, they may pop off. You may forget they are on, then rub your eyes and knock them off....that is just something to be aware of.It is a really interesting thing, but I do believe they will be my favorite readers..full time! The free replacement offer seems pretty cool too, though I have not read the fine print.Again, this is an early review, but I am quite impressed...enough to write a review on a Friday night!
