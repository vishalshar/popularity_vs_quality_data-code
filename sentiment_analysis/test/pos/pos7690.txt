I have had this lid for a few weeks and I love it... except that once it is on my jar it is extremely difficult to unscrew. Even using a towel to get a better grip it won't budge. My boyfriend couldn't get it off either and he is quite strong. On the plus side, this lid doesn't leak and the opening is easy to drink from if you are using it to turn your mason jar into a water bottle. Although since getting it I have only successfully unscrewed it once, I can easily fill the jar through the opening on top. I use it every day. It would have 5 stars if I could unscrew it when I need to.
