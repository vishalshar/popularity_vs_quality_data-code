I just filled my newly purchased U keg 2 days ago and love it!  The IPA I filled it with is a fresh as when the growler was filled. As I walked to my local bottle shop to fill it, 2 people stopped me to ask about it, based on looks alone. It's easy to use, and I love being able to have a small glass or a nice frosty pint at home. ????
