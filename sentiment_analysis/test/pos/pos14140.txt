This is a great water bottle and super easy to clean. I love the concept of being able to open the bottom to clean.  There are times when I leave water in it and with other bottles it would get icky and would be so hard to clean.  The only thing is that I wish the bottle was a little bigger.  Other than that excellent purchase!
