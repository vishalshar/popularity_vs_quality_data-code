I purchased the JeNu Conducting Gel when I was sent the JeNu device  (for free) to review. When I found out that I had  to buy the gel, I was a bit surprised but it's really essential to get the best use of the device. You don't have to use huge globs of gel - less is more. keep applying as you work around your face with the device.It's really hard to evaluate just the gel because the device is part of what makes the gel useful and vice versa. I like the device when used with this gel. I don't know if gels for other types of facial stimulating products would work but since they work with electronic conduction and this device works a bit differently,  it's hard to say.  I would recommend the device which means since the gel is necessary for the device to be effective, that I am recommending the gel too.
