My 7 year old son has had night terrors for over 2 years and we have tried everything, even saw a sleep specialist. But nothing worked until we started using the Lully.  We have been using it for 3 months and it is amazing.  My son was having 1-5 night terrors every night.  We were all exhausted.  The first night after using Lully he had only 2 night terrors and each night after that for the first week or two the number dropped off significantly.  Also each one he had was much less intense.  After using the Lully for about two weeks he stopped having them for the most part.  He still sometimes will talk or get up a sleep walk but for the most part over the last 10 weeks he has had maybe 2 night terrors.  To go from 4 a night to that is amazing.  The Lully is so easy to use, download the app, answer a few easy questions, and then it tells you when to do the rest.  I highly recommend it.
