For by birthday in 2013, my wife purchased me the Quad Lock Case for my iPhone 4s and I loved it. So when I upgraded to the iPhone 6, I was bummed I had lose the ability to have my phone on my head tube where I could easily access maps and hear real-time feedback from my apps while out on the road bike. So I was excited to find that I could order just the case for my new iPhone 6. This case is actually better than the one for my 4s. It's slimmer, fits and protects just as well, and feels better in my hand. Both were plastic, but this one feels a bit more matte (if that makes any sense) and doesn't slide as easily across smooth surfaces (good for when it's not clipped into the lock). Overall, this is a great purchase and I'm really happy that I can now have both my new phone and my Quad Lock!
