My rating my change over time for it's only been a week, but so far this phone is great. For me I use it for email, Facebook, text and naturally calls. For all those utilities it works just fine. The dual sim slot is a bonus since I have two numbers. Just wish they installed another slot for a SD card, but what does one expect for paying $160. Battery lasts well for a day. Screen size and resolution is also very good.  Naturally a top of a line mobile would be better with all the attributes mentioned. However, for my needs this phone is perfect.
