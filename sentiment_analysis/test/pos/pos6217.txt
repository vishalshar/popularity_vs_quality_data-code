Wow! I think this is the first time I can honestly say that the purchase of a novelty horn really exceeded my expectations. Not only was it a great "beverage ounce to horn taper ratio", but it felt sturdy while I was clutching it. Normally, I have only experienced this type of performance in a small-batch, artisan crafted horn.
