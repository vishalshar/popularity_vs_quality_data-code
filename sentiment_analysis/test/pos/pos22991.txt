SUMMARY:  This is a great entertainment and creative expression tool for older kids to adults. It's unique and fun to play with and there's nothing else like this activity in the world of toys and tools.  My only complaint is the cost of the plastic filament that fits this pen (about 3mm wide and no one else sells filament of this size, so you're forced to buy from this company and the price reflects that), and that's why I took it down to four stars.  There are cheap versions of this tool (that will probably clog and break in two weeks) and they use the 2mm filament that is used in 3d printers, so it's sold by many companies and is much cheaper (it comes in rolls instead of 10" sticks).HOW IT WORKS:The tool works in two temperatures and you select the one that heats up to the temperature required to melt the type of plastic you are feeding into the pen (there are two types of plastic).  There are two buttons: fast excretion of filament and slow excretion of filament.  I only use the slow because even slow is a little fast for me as a newbie.  By pressing the button again, the pen stops excreting within about a half second. When the plastic filament is excreted, it hardens in a few seconds (it helps speed up the hardening if you're in a cold room instead of a warm one).  The pictures were my first attempt at making things.  When the filament stick ends, you just insert a new one of the same or a different color.  There will be a period where the color mixes a little.  The pen has an auto shut off timer so if you stop using it it turns off on its own.PROS:This is fun to play with and experiment with.  It really makes you exercise your brain and think of creative ways to create objects, shape the plastic, and draw in the air or on paper.  When you draw in the air you have to draw only one segment at a time, pause the tool & hold the filament in form until it hardens, then continue.  Things look a little sloppy that way at first.  The other option is to draw on paper and then attach the drawn piece to other pieces you've drawn on paper using more plastic as a way to "weld" the pieces together.  This allows you to be a lot neater. That's how I drew my flowerhead.CONS:  you only get like 25 pieces of plastic sticks with this package and so you're going to need to buy more.  I did everything in the picture with 3 sticks and a lot more was wasted playing around that you don't see in the picture.
