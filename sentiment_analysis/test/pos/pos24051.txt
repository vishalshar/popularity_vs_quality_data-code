I WOULD give this a 5 star, but more on that later.  I purchased this Drone after studying them for the last several years.  The DJI has always been the one to watch, and improvements by the month almost had me buying one.  The biggest issue however was the lack of support, and when you buy a "toy" as expensive as this, you want good support.  Then, Autel Robotics came out with this fantastic X Star Premium. It was hands down better than the DJI Phamton 4 in most respects. The software was better.  The control options were better, and the all around build was better.  Just as importantly, it was said by most that you could actually call Autel and get a live human being on the line for support.  This was it for me.  I not only purchased one,  but purchased a second one about 2 weeks later.  Why?  Because due to my own stupidity, I crashed the first one on the 4th flight. Not the Drones fault... MY fault.  I was SO impressed with this Drone that I couldn't wait what might be a week or two to get it serviced by Autel, so I bought a second one.  I'm hoping they can repair my first one because I'm really pulling for Autel to make it big.  I really love the Drone.
