My son has suffered from insomnia all school year, and has been on at least 8 different meds to try and correct this.  I bought this in sheer desperation because none of his meds have yet to work.  I have tried just melatonin before his meds, and nothing ever helped.  Now, with Sleep Water, my son at least BELIEVES it works after being hopeless about everything, and he is soundly asleep hours before he has ever been able to sleep all school year.  I just want to know how I can buy this by the case :)
