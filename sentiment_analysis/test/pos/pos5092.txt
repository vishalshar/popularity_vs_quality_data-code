So far i like this because it's simple, i just want something to track activity/sleep and that is waterproof (for the most part).  Its very clean looking and it fits well and is very light.  I just started using this a few days ago so ill update the review soon.  The only thing that gets an absolute ZERO from me is their instruction manual that came with the band, its probably the worst i've ever seen, luckily i figured it out on my own pretty quick but still, if you get one you will see what i mean.Been about a week now and i LOVE this band!  I didnt want another watch, i own a lot of watches!  I just wanted something to track my sleep, track my activity during the day and nudge me if i'm sitting on my behind too long.  This device is awesome, it's small, it looks good and its waterproof, yes i said that already but i just love it.  Perfect if you just want a fitness tracker and not another watch or device you have to be careful about not getting wet.
