I bought this AquaFarm because I wanted to learn more about aquaponics and the aquarium hobby.  I definitely learned a lot in such a short span of time.  This whole experience was enlightening and I've learned the Do's and Don'ts first hand of keeping aquatic life alive and thriving.  I greatly customized my AquaFarm (imagine "pimping" out the AquaFarm so that the water always stays clear and clean, and the ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates stay at 0 ppm) and I ended up loving a small family of thriving Red Cherry Shrimp complete with live plants both above and below the water.While the basic directions and guidelines are fine for the average person who just wants to play around with the idea of having a Betta fish and some herbs, as others have posted, you will most likely experience some issues in the long run.  Whether that be the fish dying, or the plants not growing, or you get bored of having just one fish.  From my experience, I can safely have a lot of dwarf shrimp swimming around the tank and never get bored or worried about their bioload.The knowledge I've gained from this and my new found love for aquatic life and live plants has inspired me to one day create a larger scale version.  There's a lot of things that go into a safe habitat for your aquatic life.  Some of things that I ended up buying were a heater to keep the temperature at a constant 75 degrees, a thermometer to keep an eye on the temperature, a freshwater kit to test the ammonia, nitrites, nitrates, pH of the water, a canister filter to replace the pump and provide merchanical, biological, and chemical filtering, a waterproof LED lamp to light up my cute little tank, and much more.At first I liked the wheatgrass because it's fast-growing and removes nitrates well, but I can see that it eventually dies and needs to be replaced.  One of my goals for this aquaponics system was to reduce the amount of maintenance needed by me.  I ended up researching good plants for these conditions and really liked the idea of lucky bamboo on top so that's what I have now.  It looks really awesome; sort of a shrine on top due to the intricate designs of lucky bamboo being sold in-store and online.I had a good experience.  Knowing what I know now, I'm ready to take it to the next level.  A custom, much larger version of the AquaFarm.  Cheers!
