I really like this soap! I had heard that charcoal was really good for helping to clear up breakouts, and that was the reason I bought this. While I still have a few breakouts, theres definitely less than compared to what I had before. The soap lathers up really nice, and when I rub it on my face, it's kind of weird but I feel like it could almost be a mask-consistency because the lather is so thick. That's definitely not a bad thing though; sometimes I lather up the soap and just let it sit on my face for a few minutes while I brush my teeth or whatever. When I rinse it off my face, it feels so clean and I look so much more refreshed. I love it :)
