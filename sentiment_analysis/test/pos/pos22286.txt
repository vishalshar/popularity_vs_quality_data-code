yes, Yes, YES to BANZA! I am a devout carbo loader and pasta eater and I frequently worry about the carb intake and the nutrients that I am getting from pasta (especially since I do not like wheat pasta). I tried Banza for the first time and ordered a box and shared it with some friends and it was a rage with everyone.Having a delicious gluten free option with protein is an amazing feat and helps me adjust my diet appropriately. It is also a great alternative to pasta as well! It definitely takes a little less time to cook than normal hard pastas you buy at the grocery store (saves time!) but it took me a few tries to get it the al dente i liked it- so watch the timer carefully to adjust!Definitely a huge advocate for Banza and will be telling everyone!
