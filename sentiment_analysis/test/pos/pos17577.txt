I absolutely love this device. It's been a great addition to my fledgling smart home. And it works almost without fail. I can count on one hand the number of times it's had a hiccough and with the app and the keypad which I also purchased that has never been a deal breaking issue. The addition of Siri integration is great and makes it super easy to check the status of your door.
