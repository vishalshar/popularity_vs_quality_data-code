Hi All,I bought this amazing self-cleaning tank about a month ago. I started with 1 betta and wheatgrass and radish sprouts that came with it. Unfortunately, the betta came with some sort of an infection and after a couple of days, it could barely swim. So I took him back to the pet store and they replaced it with 3 guppies. My tank is so lush and the fish seem very happy! I've got a round of wheatgrass and radish sprouts which grew very fast and we potted them in bigger pots. Now I have basil, mustard, parsley, radish sprouts and wheatgrass growing on my tank.I would like to thank Back to the Roots for such an amazing product!! I would highly recommend this!
