I bought these in both regular and cinnamon. I must say, they are addicting and I love them. Not just the taste, I love to read an ingredient list that just says "Apples" without anything else. Just one word of warning: Take the chips you plan to eat out of the bag and put in a separate bowl. I made the mistake of sitting down with the bag while watching TV. Before I knew it, half the bag was gone and I was on the floor clutching my stomach in pain. If a full bag is 30 apples, and I easily ate half of it, you can imagine what that would have felt like. I recovered, and even after that painful experience, can't put the stuff down. I've since learned all about portion control though!
