I bought this supplement for my husband. The vitamins are well absorbed and work wonders especially when you have a cold. My husband takes two a day and four when he is sick and he feels that these particular vitamins give his immune system the boost it needs better than other brands. My husband actually thinks that these particular vitamins contribute to the fact that he has cold very-very rarely. Of course he takes few more vitamins and supplements but he thinks this supplement is like a base that you must have. Excellent supplement. I will buy it again for him and gladly recommend. I would subtract half star for vitamins' taste and smell - not very pleasant.
