I'm a big into keeping my screen clean for so many reasons.  PhoneSoap works and the more you use it, the better it works.  I probably use it on my iPhone and iPad 1-2 times a week.  I don't believe you can overdue it.  It works great, the screen seems to prevent smudges since I've used it, and your finger truly does glide across the screen.  I also like that its antibacterial, keep those pesky little germs off of it.  We've also used it on iPods and Nooks with no issues!The only issue for the 4-stars...  The gray foam top came right off after 3 or 4 uses.  Using my finger isn't a big deal, but why put the foam on the cap it if it's not going to stay on long-term?
