I've had the Coravin for about a year now and really love what it does.  I don't drink a lot of wine and typically want only one glass at a time, so opening a whole bottle presents a conundrum.  The Coravin allows me to pull a single glass from a bottle and preserve the rest.  I can attest that it really works.  I have drawn out a bottle of wine for 2 to 3 months and the last glass was every bit as good as the first.  It also works well for Madeira and Port.  There is a small learning curve about getting the puncture to seal well - sometimes a drop or so of wine will leak out - but several suggestions have appeared online about putty or wax to address the issue.  Also pouring the wine is an odd experience with the back pressure, but again you get used to it quickly.  The Argon canisters last quite a while - in a year I'm on my third one - so unless you have an extensive collection and want to drink one glass of each, they should not prove to be a significant expense, particularly not when compared to the bottles of wine.Overall, I love this product.  It saves me money by not requiring me to open the whole bottle for just a glass once in a while!
