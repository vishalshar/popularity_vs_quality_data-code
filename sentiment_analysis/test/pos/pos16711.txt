Bought my first bottles at a local drug store.  I work a night shift so sometimes I need the help since sleeping during the day seems to be a violation of nature.  Anyway,  Dream Water tastes pretty good and does seem to help you relax and get ready to sleep.  On the great side is that the product is definitely not habit forming.  I sometimes go a week or two before taking it again.  It does seem that if you take it too often it is not as effective but I don't so it isn't an issue.If you have trouble getting to sleep this can be of asisstance.  I'll buy it again, and again.
