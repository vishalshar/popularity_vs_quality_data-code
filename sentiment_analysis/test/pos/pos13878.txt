Ditto has been the most useful product i have purchased in a long time.  I am very hard of hearing and cannot hear any iphone ringtones.  I had it on vibrate, but I could seldom feel it.  Resulting in missed calls and texts.  My wife could rarely get in touch with me, and I would notice hours later that someong was trying to contact me.  Now I wear the ditto on my wrist using the band, and I know immediately when I have a call or a text.  My wife is very happy!  I am also very pleased to be able to use my phone for a timer ( remember that you have water boiling on the stove!), and and alarm.  I wear it to bed and it wakes me up at the needed time.  All in all, a great idea and a great product.  Highly recommended.  BTW,  it definitely does increase iphone  battery usage.  For me, all that means is I have to remember to plug it in every night instead of every 2 or three days. Also I have a charger at my computer and I just plug my phone in when I am online.  it's not a problem at all.
