Ordered these to try a new flavor after getting the peach ones. These are also really delicious, and were enjoyed by my whole family ranging from 3 year old nephew, to my 9 year old niece, to my wife, and her parents. The bags re-seal in case you only want to eat a portion, but typically I've been crushing these a bag at a time. They've been particularly great for me to eat on my drive to work. I like that I can easily get a mix of fruit in for my breakfast on the go.
