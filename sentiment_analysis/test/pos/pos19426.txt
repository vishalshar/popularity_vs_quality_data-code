This is an amazing speaker! It has the incredible wow factor with the levitation that makes it a wonderful and artistic, futuristic addition to your game room, living room or office. However, the audio quality is also incredible.  The product is very heavy, sturdy and well made - it is not just a cheap plastic piece of speaker.  It is a very high quality speaker at a competitive price...no wait.. an amazing price when you consider the artistic wow factor of the levitation!I just opened it and started it today, so there is still much learning to be done.  I recommend reading the instructions to make sure you get the levitation and charging down first.  The only downside is the app.  You need to use the app to connect, but for choosing music, it's pretty pathetic. You are better off using iTunes or other music apps after you are connected to blutooth.Now, if only Amazon could connect Alexa to this it could possibly take over the world.....  =)
