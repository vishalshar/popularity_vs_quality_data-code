These are well worth the price just for the convenience. I must have 10 pairs of reading glasses sitting around but often find myself without them, particularly in a restaurant. These stick to the back of my iPhone and are unnoticeable.  I used different double sided stick tape than what was shipped with them and have had no issues at all with them coming loose. I bought a second pair for my hubby's android phone.UPDATE: I've had these a little more than six months, so I wanted to revisit my review on these.  I still love them! I love that when I forget my regular reading glasses, I still have these, as my phone is always with me.  I have only one issue.  Over time, they have gotten scratched up by being taken out of and placed into the plastic case they are stored in. It has started to affect how I see through them.  The pair I bought for my husband also has the same type of scratches.  The is the only drawback of having these.  I have continually recommended these to people but have warned them about the scratching.  If they come out with a case that is lined with felt or some other soft material, I would probably purchase another pair. I'm attaching a photo of how the scratches look.
