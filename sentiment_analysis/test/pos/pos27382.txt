I have "Weird Ears". I've had multiple surgeries on them since birth and the ear canal that you stick ear buds into is very short. That means that traditional round ear buds have as much of a chance of staying IN my ear as a drunk on a bucking bronco at a Western bar!I was offered the chance to try these EARHOOX out from Helmut, himself, who is a peach of a guy! Very funny, very kind and appreciative of people helping him and Jeff build up their business.Because I had given away ALL of my headphones that featured round ear buds, I had to wait several weeks to get another pair so I could finally "hoox" up the EARHOOX. They come in a very simple packaging with two different sizes for ear canals; if you are prone to losing things, stick them and the instructional photo in a ZipLok baggie as I did.Super simple to install, the photo REALLY helped you with that "D'Oh!" moment when you had one on the right way and the other one the wrong way. I slipped them over my new ear bud headset, tucked the blue EARHOOX into my ear and "BINGO-BANGO!", they stayed in! But, I had to put them to a REAL TEST, such as getting my arse off of the sofa and actually moving about the cottage.So, I made my husband and I brekkie, then did the washing up, did a couple of loads of laundry and finally collapsed back on the sofa after 3 hours of chores! (Hubby was outside, shoveling the walk and driveway: I had the better/warmer deal!)  Not once did they come loose and the EARHOOX actually held the speaker portion of the ear buds deeply enough that I could hear the music. Normally, I have to >JAM< the tiniest size ear buds deeply into my shortened ear canal and that only lasts for 10-15 minutes before one or both of them *pop* out of my ear. Grrrrr Arrrrgh!I love when something SO simple and SO ingenious comes together and at such an affordable price, too!  But, please be careful when removing the EARHOOX: I had thought that I had lost one half and went bonkers looking for it before my returning husband laughed and said, "It's stuck in your ear!"  LOL So, now I double check when pulling the ear buds out, to make sure that everything is coming out as it should.For someone like me, who has such an unusual condition with traditional ear buds, it's WONDERFUL to be able to use those light weight.great sounding head sets like normal people. I have several fantastic traditional headsets (the kind that look like ear muffs) but when I wear them cooking or cleaning, they become too sweaty and too hot to wear. Now, I can become one of the "Cool Kids", thanks to Helmut and Jeff!Well done, guys, well done! ~clap-clap-clap~*I received a complimentary pair of EARHOOX for an honest review.*
