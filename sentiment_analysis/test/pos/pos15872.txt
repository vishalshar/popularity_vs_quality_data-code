It is a nifty idea for basic captures of film scans. Your phone is pretty limited in picture quality since it is jpeg. The adjustment heights are limited. And the film size is limited. But it does a decent job on the hardware. The software it is pairs with is not good at all. Just take a regular picture and use a photo editor to fix it. The app is low quality and cropped. Use the native camera app for full image and highest res or use another app to use enhanced features for shutter speed/iso/aperture that might also enhance the photo. It uses regular batteries so you don't have to worry about it eventually dying. You can just replace them with regular rechargeable batteries. It would be nice if the light was a tad brighter or adjustable. I will eventually use this to scan the pile of old film negative I have. Not as high a resolution as the traditional film scanner, but this is fast and very inexpensive.
