My dogs really like this. Other kibble I have to put goodies in with so they'll eat it (like a few shreds of chicken or some gravy). I do think the stuff is getting to be way too expensive, though, and I may just start feeding them shredded chicken and gravy (j/k) - but seriously, c'mon, folks, why is it so expensive? I know it gets high ratings, but at some point it's going to be cheaper to feed them organic people food along with some dog supplements.It does make them bark at the moon, though, so be aware if you have close neighbors. AAAwwwoooooo (OK, I bark at the moon with them sometimes, it's fun.)
