This light works! When I use it, I feel a nice warm feeling. My skin is a little dry when I am finished, but Trophy Skin explains this and instructs you to use a moisturizing cream. Trophy Skin is great at following up with you once you receive this light with messages and instructions. The only reason I give it four stars is the head that holds the light panel has gotten loose. Amazon is letting me return it. It may be because I took my apart and put it away after each use and that may have led to its early breakdown and loosening. It is convenient to use and goes anywhere. I would recommend it but be very careful with the stem that attaches to the base and the light panel.
