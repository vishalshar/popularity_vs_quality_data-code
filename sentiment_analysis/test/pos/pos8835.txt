Such a useful product!  It's not for everyday use, but if you are ever in a pinch, this is great!  I frequently find myself at friends houses or parties or whatever and my phone will be at like 3% and of course I forgot my charging cable. This thing is great because you can find USB ports just about anywhere. Look on the back of Tvs, cable boxes, computers, xboxes, ect. and let it charge. I can confirm that this accessory will charge and sync with my iPhone 6 Plus. Also the cable is made of very flexible and durable rubber. This thing will not break. Highly reccomended.
