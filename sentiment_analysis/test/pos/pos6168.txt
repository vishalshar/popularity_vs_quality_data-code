Fun fun fun! My dog still hasn't got the hang of it, but I'm working with her. My cat could care less. The app lets you see other photos people have taken of their pets, that's fun. Wish we could upload video, maybe I can just haven't played with it enough. People quit taking selfies with it. It's for the pets!!
