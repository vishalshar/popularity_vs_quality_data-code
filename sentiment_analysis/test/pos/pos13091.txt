Great sound and good volume. The LED lights and meters failed right away, and the remote is a piece of crap. But for the price and the purpose I had in mind it was just fine! Heck with the little issues I've had it was still VERY much worth the money. This is a perfect little unit for the likes of a bike shop, or similar. Makes a really good cheap home entertainment system too because the BlueTooth on this works very well. I love the Bluetooth feature I wish all my BT systems worked that well. Don't expect the backlights to live very long but the sound is MOST excellent.
