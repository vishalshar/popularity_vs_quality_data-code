I love it, it is a good product housed in an inexpensive housing. The housing could have been robust as it is going to be used in a garage.It emulates "Nest" product by providing a small screw driver which does not meet the stranded of the device. It is so easy to install and get it running. It is self explanatory, does not require any manual. My only complain is the mini USB that refuses to inset in to the device port properly on one of the devices. I bought two of them. Hence I only have one running at the moment. I am trying to find solution at the moment. I still like the device operation and that is the reason  five stars. Thank you for answering my questions prior to purchasing.
