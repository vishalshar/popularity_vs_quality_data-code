I bought this for my brother, and he let me use it a few times before he headed back home.  AWESOME device.  Typically, I hate styluses.  This one is nice to grab yet still has a nice fine (or thick, or medium) point on the screen.  Would definitely recommend, and since this is his second one (I don't recall the details, but the first died of his fault) I think my brother would do the same.
