First off the spring mechanism that pushes the card out for removal is almost non-existent.  When inserted, my card doesn't pop-out when pushed in like it is supposed to.  I have to go fish it out.Secondly, there is a stubborn tacky film on the USB-C connector.  If you want the USB-C connector in your phone to remain functional, I suggest you take the time to clean the film off this unit so that it does not gunk-up your connectors.  Bad quality control IMO.I plan to contact the seller so that these things can be addressed for other buyers.*Update: sent an email to the seller.  Have not heard back.***Update: seller sent a new unit with a pre-paid mailer for the return.  Perfect product this time - no issues.  Revised rating**
