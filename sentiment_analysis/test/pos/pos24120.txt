The watch is very nice and as opposed to other products we considered, it is small enough for a child to wear comfortably. My daughter loves wearing it and shows it off to everyone.It works very well, and sends us alerts at relevant times like when its turned on, when she leaves the house, when she leaves school, when she arrives back at home, and when the battery is low.The battery lasts the whole day and we charge it overnight.
