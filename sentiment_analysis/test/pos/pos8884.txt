I love this. It's almost exactly like the fitbit except 3 things. You can't challenge friends through Facebook, not sure on waterproof  and it's a little bulky, but not enough to not love it. I'm so glad I didn't spend the money on a Fitbit. Who knows maybe this will be seen and well get an upgrade to challenge our friends. That's the reasons I gave 4 stars. I'm a mom of four and this is great deal for the $$$
