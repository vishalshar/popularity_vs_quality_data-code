Like others, I was very impressed with the grip of this device compared to traditional suction cup mounts. I ordered this just before taking a 14-hour road trip, and not once did this mount show any signs of budging, even with removing and re-inserting my phone several times over the course of the trip.I was a little concerned over how well it would hold my phone (a Samsung Galaxy S III with an Acase Superleggera Hybrid Case) when I was comparing it to the iOttie One Touch Universal Car Mount on Amazon. The lack of a bottom support in portrait mode, plus the thickness of my phone's case, is what I was most worried about. I am happy to say that my concerns were completely unwarranted and this case holds my phone very securely, both in and out of its case. I would prefer the locking mechanism of the One Touch case (push button to release, squeeze arms in to secure) compared to this model's (pull arm to release, automatic button press upon phone insertion to secure). The automatic button press against the phone's back can sometimes cause the arm to try and secure the phone before I have it fully-inserted into the mount. Not a big deal, but the One Touch's method would be more consistent and make removing the phone a little easier.The aesthetics of this mount are leaps and bounds ahead of the One Touch mount, however. This is not a clunky piece of equipment I'm ashamed to have sitting up in my window. It looks very elegant from the passenger's point of view, and it isn't a distracting eyesore when I'm driving.I'd give this a 4-1/2 out of 5 star rating since I like the secure-and-release method of the One Touch better, but since there is no half-star rating available, I'm going to give it the full 5 stars instead of docking it a full star for that one minor issue. This mount has it where it counts - secure attachment to the car, secure phone grip, easy to operate, and great looking.
