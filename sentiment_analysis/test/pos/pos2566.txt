It took15 minutes to set up. App takes you through all the steps with detailed instructions. I signed up for my account before the product arrived. Attached my unit to the garage ceiling to avoid laser vibration drift.  Animated opening and closing on app is cool. Works great on wifi or cell network and shows door open/closed status. No more turning around to check if I closed the garage door. Thanks !
