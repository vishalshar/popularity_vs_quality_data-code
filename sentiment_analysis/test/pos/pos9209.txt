This product has saved me hundred of dollars at the Vet.  My 11 year old cat has feline asthma and has a tendency to get colds often to the point that we can't go three months without going to Vet to get an antibiotic shot that cost me $120, I purchased this product after reading the reviews, I am on my second container of this, first container lasted 3 months, I put one of their spoonfuls in my cats wet food everyday and not one cold since he has been on it, in fact I notice that he is even playful now, which is surprising to me, I started giving it to my other cat, he is 10 years old and he does not sleep as much anymore, I highly recommend this product, I bet my Vet is wondering why I have not been to see him, but after purchasing this product it is well worth the $20 that they ask to pay for it, not one cold in 3 mos, I am beyond thrilled.I am under no obligation to provide a positive review for this product, nor am I receiving any type of compensation, incentive, or reward for doing so.
