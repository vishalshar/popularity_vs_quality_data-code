Couldn't ask for much better than this. Well, I could, because in order to place my Android Phone on it I had to use the 3M version, which doesn't feel half as secure as a specific case. I'm relying on a strip of sticky material to keep my $800 phone from flying off the bike.Other than that, it has performed well. Very happy with it.
