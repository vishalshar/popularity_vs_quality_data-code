This is a GREAT idea!  My detectors are interconnected, so when one goes off, they all go off so I only needed to purchase one.  Now if any of my detectors go off, I get an alert on my phone.I bought two more to install at my parents house.  That way, if one of THEIR detectors goes off, I will get the alert. They are getting older & I really like the idea of being notified if they have a fire.I had a little trouble programming mine, it took a couple trys - the installation video shows lining up the battery and your phone lying flat on the counter, but that did not work for me. after a couple trys, I just held the battery near my phone speaker & it worked right away - not a big deal.Being able to have my existing smoke detectors alert my phone, without having to buy all new detectors, is a HUGE bargain for only $35.
