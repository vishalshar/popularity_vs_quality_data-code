I was very skeptical as the original one i saw was more expensive but decided to take a chance since it was such a good price. I have to take lots of full body pictures but I hate people to take pictures of me. When it came in the mail, I think I played with it for over 3 hours as i was so amazed. I've now had the case for since July, which makes it 5 months now. I haven't switched cases at all and its still working. It does get dirty from sticking it to surfaces but i just get alcohol and cotton ball and wipe it off and it works like new. Very pleased with this product, it also amazes everyone that sometimes catch me taking pictures. lol
