I fixed my car's insulation with this.  It was surprisingly difficult to find just the right insulation to replace the piece that cracked and tore off.  After looking around at several stores and on Amazon, I finally just tried this, and it was cheaper than any insulation I could buy and it molds to fit perfectly.  No more leaky door!
