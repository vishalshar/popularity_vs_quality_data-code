I was surprised to receive a mattress packed into a rectangular box. I then unpacked it to find it rolled up tight in a vacuum sealed plastic. When I cut the plastic there was the sound of air forcefully being sucked into it. It expanded from its flat form of 1 to 2 inches into a solid 10 inch mattress. Its firm almost solid like feel is very different from other mattresses, and seems strange at first. However after lying on it for a while it felt very supportive. I have only slept on it a couple of  nights, as I purchased it for a guest room, but I think I will like it a lot  if I acclimate myself to it.
