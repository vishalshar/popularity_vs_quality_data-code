I'm a engineer and order a lot of things for on Amazon but it takes a lot to impress me enough to write a review as one could see looking at my profile history. This is not my first 3D printer and probably won't be my last but it will be the one I use for the foreseeable near future. I inboxes this thing and had it printing in no time. I'm not sure it is %300 faster than the competition, but it is a noticeable leap ahead. I will make this short and sweet,Pros:Device QualityWell planned/designed around plug and playSpeedPrint QualityDual extrudersCons:CostMisleading dual feedstock fillament portNo manual open close buttonPrint bed sizeNormally I would give this a 4 start but once you normalize against the competition and realize how far ahead this unit is, for now it will remain a 5 star.
