I love the Misfit Ray. I was previously using the Shine and had problems with it popping out of the band. I lost it twice and was able to backtrack and find it. Then the band actually broke into two pieces and I lost the Shine. I replaced it with a new Shine and had the same problems. It was very frustrating because I liked the Shine because I could use it in the pool and I was doing a lot of water aerobic classes to rehab my knee after knee replacement surgery. When I read of the Ray coming out I wanted to try it because the design seemed intuitively to make more sense than the Shine. I've worn it every day for three months and not once has it come off. It is so nice to not have to worry about it and to not have to charge it every few days. I've never had an issue with it syncing-it is fast and smooth. I'm not an athlete like some of the reviewers on here but do exercise regularly and walk a lot as part of that and find the mileage to be very correct. I love being able to wear it in the pool and it get credit for all the exercise I do there.  I also love the sleep tracking, it has been very accurate for me. I use my phone for an alarm so I don't use the alarm function on this. Overall, I am totally satisfied with this purchase. I will come back and give it the extra star if the band makes it to the 6 month mark!
