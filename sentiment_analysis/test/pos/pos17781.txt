We bought this feeder because our Oriental Shorthair cat was waking us up around 2:30 AND 4 am to be fed.  Feeder works great!  We programmed two separate feedings for the overnight hours and he finally lets us sleep.  Love that we can easily program it through the website, makes setting up one time feeding a breeze.I recommend you gently shut the lid, we were a little overzealous and broke one of the latches on the lid.  Contacted the company and they are sending a new lid!  Great product and customer service. (Thanks, Alex! =)
