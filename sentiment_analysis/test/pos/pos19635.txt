HOLY DELICIOUSNESS!  The yum factor is off the charts.  I've already bought these in mass quantities to stash around the house, the office, the car, wherever a (heaven forbid) snack attack might happen.  Why will you love these too?  Let's count the ways...- NOT SWEET!- Healthy!- Low sugar- Gluten free- Protein sourceWhy, oh why, is every snack bar sweet?  If I wanted a candy bar, I'd buy one!  I want a snack, better said, a meal on the go.  Thankfully Savory Harvest has hit the nail on the head.  The things that come to mind are bold, zesty, and straight delicious.  I've now tried all 3 flavors and can't quit talking about them, and better yet, craving them.  They are filled with nuts, grains, seeds, kale, sun-dried tomatoes, and all sorts of healthy and yummy things. My favorite flavor is currently BBQ.  It doesn't hurt to have a snack bar that doesn't ruin your mid section.  I feel pretty guiltless when eating a savory harvest bar, and better yet, after eating one, I don't feel like I could eat about 20 more.  They are pretty darn satisfying.Savory Harvest - Where have you been all my life?  Thank you for putting the "bold" back in my life.Hey Amazon Prime, if you're listening - I love my Prime and all, but Prime Now is where it's at!
