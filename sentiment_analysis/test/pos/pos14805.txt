Decent audio quality and are most effective with my new Giro ski helmet.  The are simple to use, mute, answer phone, etc. with a gloved hand.  I tried these with a Bluetooth adapter but since you need to connect it with a wire anyway, it just makes better sense to connect the audio chips directly to my mobile phone and take advantage of the oversized ear pod button vice the smaller Bluetooth adapter control.
