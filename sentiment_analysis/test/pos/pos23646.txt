These are the finest IEM's I have ever used. When paired with a good DAC and amp they simply soar above anything I've ever owned, in ear or over ear. Not only that but 1more went above and beyond to make me happy in doing an exchange.I bought the black and gold colored unit and when it arrived I realized that the inline mic controls didnt work properly with my HTC 10. I shot off an email to the company and they explained that the titanium color model works better with the 10 due to using a different inline control system and would work with my phone. They offered to exchange my unit for the titanium, emailed me the shipping label, and had a new unit in my hands within a week of returning the set I bought.All of the controls work fine on the titanium color except for double clicking the center button to go back one track. I can live with that. So if you have the 10 then I suggest you buy the titanium color.As for sound quality, as I said, these are stellar. For thkse who like base heavy earbuds, these will disappoint you. Keep in mind though that all that head thumping base isnt how music is supposed to be heard. Balanced sound is the goal. Where one end of the audio doesn't bleed into the other. These are balanced, extremely so.The low end is pronounced and there is expressive base. At higher volume levels they will thump quite a bit, but do so at risk to your hearing (as with all high volumes on any device). When you can hear the base drum levels and base lines of guitar separately and distinctly on the low end, that is balanced. That is what the 1more triples will give you. The mids are crisp, clear, bright, and resonant. The high end doesnt rattle and shines bright without piercing through you or sounding tinny. Vocals? Well they just come right up and smack you in the face and tell you to listen up!1more manufacturers all of the earbuds for the huge chinese retailer Xiaomi [...]. Ive been buykng Xiaomi products  for a couple year now, so when I heard 1more had these I decided to buy them based on past experience. I've owned (or do own) own Sennheiser, Bose, Sony, Sure IEM's ranging from $50 to $700. The 1more Triple Drivers are the finest, most balanced, and well tuned IEM's Ive ever used. PERIOD.In order to make the most of these, YOU MUST, have a DAC and high quality FLAC audio files to use with them. If streaming, ONLY, use the highest quality setting. I have a Fiio DAC, as well as my HTC that has a built in DAC and amp coupled with Dolby Atmos. When I plugged these into either of those devices, and got them tuned in, I was in awe of how incredible these performed. If you are using a phone or cheap mp3 player without a DAC buy something else. These and all other HQ iem's are a waste of money for you.Everyone says how nice these are packaged, and impressed with the selection of eartips offered. Thats absolutely true. Best packaging Ive ever seen for IEM's. The carry case, clip, and airplane adapter are nice add ons. The kevlar braided cable doesnt tangle up and the choice lf earbuds is insane. If you cant find one that fits you need your ears checked.Please keep in mind that the selection, size, and fitment of the tips IS ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL for making in ear monitors sound correct. You will definitely have to try different sizes and be analytical about this part of the process. Just simply selecting tips that look the same size as your old ones is not the right thing to do. If you experience bad quality audio with these 1more's then either you have a manufacturer defect (not likely), or the user is the defect.These are just flat out awesome, and even at a $100 price point they are a steal. Ive had mine just about 2 months of daily use. If anything goes wrong with them long term I'll update my review. Buy them. Im glad I did.
