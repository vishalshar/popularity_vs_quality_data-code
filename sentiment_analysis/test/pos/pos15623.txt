Little bit of a backstory.I had always used the Note series when I upgraded phones - the stylus worked fantastically for what I used the phone for- mostly art. Then, of course, the incident with the Note 7 came about and I obviously wasn't able to get that. Being a bit burned by that fact [all the puns intended], I decided to do my own little boycott at the thought of the Note series ending by switching to the iPhone 7 Plus.After going through multiple styluses to test with the phone, I finally found this one worked the best. No lag, connects with a tough of a button, and it's completely pressure sensitive. And the fact I can flip it to erase helps a lot. Easy to hold- just like a pencil. And, it works with most apps I've found.The only one I've noticed it can't connect with being MediBang, which I do hope that happens in the future.tl;dr:Great Stylus. 10/10 Will use for a while.
