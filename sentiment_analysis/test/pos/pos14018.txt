This toy is a blast! Bought it for my 4 year old nephew and the possibilities are endless. I love that there are a range of sounds within each selection. For example, if you select the drum and move your wrist certain levels/directions you get a range of sounds like cymbals and snares. My nephew also really enjoys using the cooking and BBQ noises in his play kitchen. Lastly, I love the snap band feature which makes it easy to put on, comfortable, and another instrument to play with if the band is full straightened. I look forward to the new sounds for the holidays.!
