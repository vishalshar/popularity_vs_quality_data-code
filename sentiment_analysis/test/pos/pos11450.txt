So, I have been using the Arccos system for about 6 weeks and maybe 15-20 rounds of golf (I try to play 2-3 rounds a week).  The system works by a sensor telling the iPhone app that a shot was taken (impact detection) with a specific club. The App then records the location for this shot. Very simple and no need to take the phone out of your pocket, which makes the whole process unobtrusive.Shot detection and distance tracking is very accurate and fast.I had used another app before in which you had to manually input each shot at the spot you took it, and it often took very long to acquire a reasonable GPS location, which made it cumbersome to use in a round or gave wild errors. Not so with Arccos. I don't think there was a single misplaced shot location in all of the rounds I played.I did notice that tap-ins and gentle putts are sometimes not registered (Arccos point this out in their manual and instructions). Since I keep a paper score card as well, I just add these putts as "Gimme Putts"  at the end of the round (mainly to ensure proper stats). Takes maybe a 1 minute or 2.In the 15-20 rounds I played with the Arccos system, I had to replace the batteries on 3 sensors. Since the batteries are supposed to last up to 40-50 rounds, I originally thought a sensor was defective when one club did not register shots. However, after contacting support (more on that later), it turned out to be a spent battery. I bought a 20-pack of CR2032 for $8 here on Amazon and keep them in my bag to be prepared.The App (iPhone only for now):The stats are awesome and help me with improving my game in ways that I didn't think could be possible. The biggest revelation was with respect to club selection for me (yeah, we don't average nearly as far as we think we do, and the average doesn't mean that that's the distance we hit most often). I only would wish there were a statistical mean of distance as well as the average, as the latter is more affected by outliers (the occasional 15 ft. drive or bomb straight down the fairway).Minor improvements I wish for: I wish one could edit rounds (gimme putts and penalties) on the web site. Also, if you have multiple iOS devices, the stats do not sync across these.Support: I contacted Arccos support a few times - lost a sensor and asked about the "faulty" sensor I had (turned out to be a spent battery) - and have found them responsive, competent and generous (replaced a lost sensor free of charge).TL;DR: Love it, highly recommend it. A great tool for improving my game and practice as it shows me my weaknesses through the extensive stats.
