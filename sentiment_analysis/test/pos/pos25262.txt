I got this for my husband as a gift and it was really a hit. It glows frequently and it really cool to enjoy at night when it really shows. It's easy to set up and take care of. Just remember to buy food! That would be the only drawback is having to keep buying food but it's not too often and well worth the awesome sight this dino brings.
