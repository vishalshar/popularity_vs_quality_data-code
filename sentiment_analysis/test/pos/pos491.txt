Two years ago, we had friends and their newborn staying overnight when the smoke alarms went off--a false alarm. I removed the battery, but then another sounded, then another... each time waking up the baby. With the interconnected smoke detectors, I couldn't figure out which was the problem. We were five grumpy people the next morning! Two of the alarms have been batteryless ever since. So unsafe!I gradually replaced the two end-of-life smoke detectors with Roost detectors and the rest of the batteries with Roost Smart 9V Batteries. Setup was a breeze and a quick test proved they would alert my phone. It's comforting to know I won't find myself up on a chair in the middle of the night, trying to quiet a faulty alarm! Or, if we're away I can know if there's a problem at home without paying for an expensive monitoring service.I was worried about replacement cost when the battery eventually dies, but I was pleased to find they'll replace the battery part of the Smart Battery for about $10. Considering a Duracell 9V is around $6, this really is a very economical solution. I'm so glad I didn't have to buy 4 Wi-Fi smoke alarms at $200 each! For less than the cost of one of the pricey ones, my home is completely protected against fire and carbon monoxide.
