The form and function of the holder is excellent. Easy to use. I can slip my IPhone 4S with or without the case onto the holder.It sticks a whole lot better than my previous IOttie car mount. The only problem is do not plan to move it from the location you choose. The suction is super strong! I cannot move mine off the windshield.  I cannot complain since the old one always fell off the windshield and never stayed put!
