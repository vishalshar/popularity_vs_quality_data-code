I recently received my Libratone ONE Click and I love the design! It's simple yet sturdy. The sound is also amazing. We currently have it downstairs and we can hear whatever we're playing crystal clear across the entire first floor. If we turn it up, we can also hear it perfectly upstairs. The set up was so easy. I did it in less than 3 minutes with a toddler running around me.  And bonus points, you can stream any music from your phone, which includes YouTube videos which my little one adores. This speaker has really created some enjoyable experiences for our family, and I can't wait to take it on our family vacation!
