The Snap+ is really well made, strong and unobtrusive.  the CD tray attachment is definitely the best I've seen; extremely strong.  We bought two.  The only downside is not having friction control on the ball joint.  With movement, the joint can weaken, so this isn't for those who like to move their phone around a lot.
