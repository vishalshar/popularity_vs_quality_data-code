I was skeptical about this case. I'd been admiring it back when I had my 5S and I've since upgraded to a 6 Plus, I had never owned a "wallet" phone case before. I started out with one from another site for the same price but could only hold three cards. I decided I needed more space because like most people I own more than just three cards that I use on a daily basis. Seeing as this case could hold double that of any other on the market, I sprang immediately for this one. I compared this to a bunch of other wallet cases I'd seen, and none of them even came close to the amount of storage this case supposedly had. So, I decided to go for it. And I'm so glad I did.The case showed up five days after I ordered it and I was pretty surprised it arrived that quickly. I bought the turquoise one and the color in real life is true to the picture. The quality of the case is nice and sleek, and I don't find it slippery at all. It is supple and soft and nice to hold in hand. The real test though was how many cards it could hold.I chose the cards I use every day and put them in the case. 6 cards, and I threw in a 5 dollar bill just to see if it would be okay and it was! I was completely surprised and immediately excited at the amount of storage this case offered. 10/10 would recommend if you want the most storage for the money you pay. Buy this case and you won't need a wallet anymore.
