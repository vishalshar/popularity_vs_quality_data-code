Despite the price, I like this spoon fork setup. It uses a plastic that is a much higher grade then the Light My Fire brand sporks. It should not be so expensive for what it is but it is something you can count on for backpacking. I like the three piece set made by this company too. If they ever go on sale I will have one.
