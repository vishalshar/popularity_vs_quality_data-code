This review is for the 4 ND 16 filter. I used this filter towards the end of the day about an hour before sunset and the results were great. Without a filter like this the native video does indeed feel a bit muted and washed out. Colors are a bit flat, with this filter color saturation, depth and contrast were all drastically improved. My only issue is that when the filter is on the native gimbal gaurd that comes with the P4 will not fit over the lens. So you either have to screw it off and put on the original UV lens or by a different lens/gimbal gaurd.
