Received the item very fast. The stand is built very well, with a wide range of adjustments, which makes it very easy to position it where it's most comfortable for the user. It's very easy to adjust to fit my needs and equally easy to adjust so it's out of the way or even remove in seconds. I purchased the stand to install and use in my truck, while I work on projects in the field. It's very sturdy and will function perfectly for my intended use. I recommend this for anyone using their vehicle as a mobile office.
