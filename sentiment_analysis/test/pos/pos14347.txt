I really liked this belt since I was going to be traveling to some pretty rough countries that are known to target tourists particularly to get a hold of a passport. I used this also when I didn't feel comfortable leaving my passport someplace (i.e. I was camping in the dessert and no safes were provided because it wasn't a typical hotel) I didn't want to leave my passport in my tent while camping so I was able to take it with me discretely.The biggest drawback to this was that while it holds a decent amount I would have liked it to be a little larger so that I could carry more items with me in place of a purse/pocketbook/bag. It fit my passport and money, but when I added in my Phone it started to show signs of over loading (i.e. the two flaps that cover everything up started to spread apart. Also it's not great for coins since the way you have to access the main pockets is moving the top flap up and then going inside and spreading the top flap out. This isn't a problem because it's a really secure way to hold important items and prevents them from falling out - I'd much rather have the BANDI be secure than work as a change purse.One other nice feature is that there is a separator inside the main compartment so you can separate money from passport or phone from money whatever you want to organize.
