About the product itself:-Pros1. Extremely functional since phone can be placed and taken out with one hand in 1 second. I can do this while driving without risking accident.2. This mount can hold all current smartphones that exist at this point. It can hold iphone 6S plus. So you won't have to worry about whether it will fit your smartphone or not. It can even hold some of navigation type of devices. Also, it holds the phone very firmly. I have used this mount for weeks. I drive camaro and many times I am not driving very calmly but the phone never fall so far..3. Very strong sucktion cup. Once you place it properly, it won't go anywhere. Also very durable in the sunlight.4. Very flexible. The leg of this mount can turn more than 180 degree. You can adjust it to almost any angle you like. Leg is also extendable.5. Nicely designed. This does not look so cheap. The color is not jet black. Rather it is more like ashen gray which I think is richer color.- Cons1. The biggest cons for this mount is the suction cup. This uses the same suction cup and pad that are being used for the previous version of the product, iottie 2. It is strong but if you place this on the dashboard, it is highly probable that it will leave mark. So I recommend you use it on the windshield instead unless you don't really care about minor cosmetic mark on the dashboard or if you intend to use it permanently like myself.2. The mount head tend to lean downward over time due to cellphone weight. This happens very slowly so you might not notice it. And one day you might notice it and say "did somebody touch my mount??"3. If you the leg is extended to its maximum length, it rattles a bit while driving on a tough road.About the Customer Service and After Service:iottie has an excellent customer service.
