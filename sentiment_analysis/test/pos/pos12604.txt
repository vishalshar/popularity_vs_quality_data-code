When it was working, it worked exactly as advertised and was great; color was clean and bright, and the blink1-tool command line utility for setting the color gives a very nice, smooth transition from one color to another.Unfortunately, mine malfunctioned; it suddenly started flickering through several colors, and when I unplugged it from USB and plugged it back in, it came on in a state where one side was full-white all the time, and the other side could be controlled. After fiddling with it a bit more (and trying it on multiple computers), I unfortunately found it in a state where it just flickers through colors wildly. I expect an electrical short?That having been said, I'm ordering another one because when it worked, it worked great. For the price point, maybe order two just in case one goes faulty on you.
