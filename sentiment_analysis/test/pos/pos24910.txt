An absolute must and well worth the added track configurations that can be created. We love this product and the entire Anki OVERDRIVE line.  From day one of setup, it has provided endless fun for everybody in our house.  We have both boys and girls ages 6, 9, 12 and 16 that have been entertained along with their friends and us parents also.  Well worth getting extra cars.
