Bought this to replace my failing Logitech G700.In a world where eveyone wants wireless things and Laser-sensor mice, this OPTICAL, WIRED mouse was a nice change.The cord is a very nice, long cable with a nice braided outer jacket and looks to be fairly durable.The texture of the mouse is a very nice feeling surface though your fingers seem to wear the surface visually somewhat quickly (at least compared to my G700)The side buttons are in a nice spot and all buttons are satisfying to use.I'm not a huge fan of RGB lighting and have all the lights turned off via the easy to use software.Surface tracking on my soft mouse pad is superb.I've turned off acceleration and the mouse feels great to use in any situation, games or otherwise.Easily the nicest tracking feel of any mouse I've used recentlyA definite HUGE step up from laser-based sensors, though be careful as optical mice are picky about surfaces compared to laser mice.My only wish is that Mionix will release configuration software for Mac OS as I use this on both windows and Mac systems.Luckily, configuration changes are rare, and persist after making changes using the windows-based software.This mouse is a great piece of hardware and my liking of it is only rivaled by the Logitech Mouseman dual optical from back in the day.
