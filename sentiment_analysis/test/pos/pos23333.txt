Costs half as much as a comparable bike at REI. Easy assembly. The provided tool was mostly worthless. My only gripe is the brand name. "Royal Baby" stickers and brand are plastered all over the bike. Even the bike tread spells it (the words ARE the tread). My six year old wasn't crazy about his bike saying "baby" on it.
