Before getting the Behmor Connected Brewer, I mostly did pour over (Bonvita electric kettle, Hario V60) so that I could control temperate. The Behmor allows me to set a specific temperate for each brew, which is awesome. You can do either 6 or 8 cups; I usually do 6 cups and use between 46 and 49 grams of coffee. Before each use, you pour the water into the top of the machine, grind/weight your coffee, put coffee into the basket using either the provided mesh filter or paper filters, then either use the (very nice) iPhone app to begin your brew, or push the circular button to use a preset (set using the app). The water heats up pretty quickly -- you can tell the heating element is powerful! The circular button changes color depending on what the machine is doing (ie. heating, pre-soak, extraction, and finished). The button is large and bright, so it's easy to see from across the room. When the brew is done, the machine sends your phone a notification; neat! (you get a notification when you brew from the app or using the preset button) The build quality of this machine is fantastic; it's built like a tank. App / Firmware upgrades have been smooth. I use this machine daily and am really impressed by the consistency and quality of the coffee it produces. Highly recommended.
