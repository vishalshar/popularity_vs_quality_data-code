Shipping was quick, the case itself is very nice and it fits snugly from falls & scratches, all buttons are perfectly covered, and its slim and light weight. It is a medium soft quality plastic & flexible. It stick firmly pretty good on most flat surfaces, package comes with 4 different color plates to cover and to protect the sticky from picking up dirty while its inside the purse or etc., which very thoughtful!Over all I like this product very much, and its really fun using it when following a new makeup tutorial and trying a new receipt.Cleaning the phone case is simple, just water raising off then air dry, and it sticks again pretty well. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
