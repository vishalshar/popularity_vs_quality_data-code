Don't tell my wife that I have been eating these daily. I secretly want to buy a box of these for snacking. Also, my daughter loves them which I suppose I should include in a review about kids gummy vitamins.We have tried nearly all of the healthier gummy vitamins out there, and I seriously mean nearly all. Why would I want my child eating a vitamin after breakfast with added process sugar? No one really wants it but kids also might not eat it if it doesn't...UNTIL NOW, these are AMAZING, they is NO ADDED SUGAR and they are better than fruit snacks. Seriously why are these so good? They are SO good.I couldn't recommend this brand more.
