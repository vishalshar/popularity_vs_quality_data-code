We purchased this feeder in August 2015.  Our cat is 17 years old and was losing weight.  She would eat too much at one time and throw up on a regular basis.  We purchased the feeder to feed her smaller amounts five times a day.  It works great!  She has put weight on and rarely throws up.  We also use it for weekends when we go away. In August 2015 we started to have an issue with the rotation of the feeder.  We contacted the company and they very quickly helped us with the issue.  It has been working perfect ever since.  This is an excellent product and I would highly recommend to anyone.
