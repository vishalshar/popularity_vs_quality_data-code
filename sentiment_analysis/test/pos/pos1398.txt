Was very disappointed that i bought a "new one" and find out that it had been opened already and the raspberry pi holder and base plate were broken. Will adjust stars when other is received. This was to be the one and only Christmas Present for my son this year and now he has too wait too get it till next week. Updated got i replacement and works just fine. Son got it built with in a day and running and playing minecaft. Looking forward to seeing what he makes with the Pi.
