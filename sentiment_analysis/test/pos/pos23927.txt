Seems to be reliable, does not make loud noises that scare off the dogs (4, ranging in age from 1-12 yrs old) and more fun than the proverbial barrel of monkeys.  Our dogs mill about and haven't caught on yet and they get in the way of the chute.  They catch a ball in the side and wonder where it came from.  LOLs until your sides hurt.  You'll get more practice fetching than the dogs...Bought it as a present and despite the iffy quality reviews it seems to be OK.
