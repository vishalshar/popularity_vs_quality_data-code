I got the neon ones for my grandson!  My daughter was at her wits ends trying to get him to tie his shoelaces :(I checked out the "magnetic" ones and they wouldn't have worked out for him at all, he would walk out of his shoes to start with, the magnets just wouldn't have been strong enough.Now with these he can slip his shoes on and off.  Plus the neon ones are adorable!  I would probably wear sneakers more with these.  I'm checking to see if they come in pastels, and then I'm off to buy a pair of sneakers.LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM, LOVE them!!!!!!!
