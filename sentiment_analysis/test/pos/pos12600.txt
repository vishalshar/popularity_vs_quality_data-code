Exactly what I needed for my small studio apartment. Setup was super easy and quick (using Android app on samsung s7). Paired it with a wifi camera so I can check the live video in case of a falsa alarm from vibration. But so far, no false alarms. Within the first week of installing it, got a notification... Turns out I had left the door a crack open all day!Had a small issue with the stick going "missing" in the app. Customer service resolved it very quickly. Very satisfied.
