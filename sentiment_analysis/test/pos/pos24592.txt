I like it!  And when my grandkids use it, they like it.  But they never ask for it.  I always have to remind them it's there.  Each game is educational and entertaining.  I especially like Newton Masterpiece where they have to look somewhere else while drawing.  The kids love putting their heads on whatever they're drawings.  Lots of selections to choose from.  The games make  them think outside the box.  I think it has actually helped them become smarter.  I will probably buy the math set for Xmas.
