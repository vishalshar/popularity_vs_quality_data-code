I don't usually review anything but I wanted to say that this truly works. I was having a super hard time trying to collect my cat's urine. They gave me some plastic litter at the vet that my cat wouldn't even look at and I had to lock her inside the bathroom to force her to use it. In the end she peed on the bathtub and the sample was not enough for the vet to use. They wanted me to take her to an animal hospital but I wanted to give this a try before putting my cat under so much stress. She used this as if it were her normal litter, and the package includes tools to collect the sample!! The amount of litter is not huge, but enough for a couple of visits to the litter box.
