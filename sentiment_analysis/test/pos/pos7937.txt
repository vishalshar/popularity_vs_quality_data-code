I've tried Fitbits, Apple Watches, Google Running watches, Nike Plus gear....and my Leaf blows all of those out of the water. The step counter and calorie estinates on the enormous range of activities you can choose from are the most accurate of any gear I've tried short of GPS tracking. And the sleep tracker? Not having to have you phone in a holding pattern while you're asleep and just update it in the morning is WONDERFUL!
