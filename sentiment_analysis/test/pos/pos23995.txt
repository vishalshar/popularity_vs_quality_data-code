I'm a physician and my father in law has been having some dizzy spells.  His physician didn't seem particularly concerned and scheduled an appointment for several weeks out, which was concerning to me.  I ended up getting this device to see what his heart rate and rhythm looked like when he was having the dizzy spells.  It was useful in detecting that he was in sinus bradycardia, and was on too high of a dose of beta blockers.
