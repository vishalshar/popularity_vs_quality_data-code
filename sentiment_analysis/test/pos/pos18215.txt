FYI, I rarely write reviews. But I felt a strong urge to spread the love about this product.I commute/ride daily. I pretty much always wear a helmet and have done since I lived in NYC back in the '90s. So I've owned *tons* of skate and "urban style" bike helmets over the years. Out of all of them my go-to helmet is a battle scarred Protec Ace Skate mainly because this helmet looks best on me which means it's the least MushroomHead of the lot. It's also super comfortable.Well this new thousand helmet just whooped the ProTec's bum.The thousand looks absolutely stunning, is crazy comfortable, comes with two sets of fit pads (which are super well constructed), and is the least MushroomHead CPSC helmet I've ever worn.There's also a U-lock hole for locking it to the bike. I prolly won't use that 'till it gets scratched up a bit, but I will eventually start using it since I don't generally carry my helmet around with me.I suppose the only "downside" is the helmet is more expensive than most urban style helmets. But it's a *premium* helmet with excellent fit and finish and I'm so so so willing to spend an extra few bucks for this.Oh and to clarify (since many ppl rightfully question effusive reviews): I received no compensation for this review. I bought it with my own cash. I wasn't contacted by this company nor do I have any relationship with them whatsoever. What I am is a very happy owner of a super nice premium helmet.
