Laptop works great! I bought the 21.5 inch (Black).It's fast and works well with what I need it for. Graphics is pretty good. I was using GoPro studio to compile my videos, and it lagged on me for a little while, maybe it's just the program. Graphics and rendering playing Shift 2 was pretty good. It's very light and seems sturdy enough be be carried everywhere.Same cons with other reviews such as: screen display is not that good, seems pixelated. The keyboard doesn't feel that sturdy as well as the mouse pad. The space bar got stuck down the first time I used it. I had to pick at it to pop back up. I used a wireless keyboard, but it was such a disappointment. The speakers works fine.
