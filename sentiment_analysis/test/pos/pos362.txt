I was a little hesitant buying this mattress because this mattress wasn't as established on Amazon. There weren't as many reviews as other competitors. I was not shy at all with ordering online though. There really is so little risk with any of these bigger companies. If you don't like it, send it back. Well, they either send someone to take or donate it, or ask for proof of donation.  I haven't heard a single horror story returning these mattress from any of  the popular online only companies. It beats mattress shopping and salesmen any day. Even if under all the pressure of a salesmen you find the right mattress after laying down for 20 minutes, who knows how you'll feel after a night anyway.My search started with Tuft and Needle. We were about 90% sure we were going to try the mattress but after reading many of the popular mattress review sites we learned of the Leesa. In the end it came down to the Casper or Leesa. I know I'm probably wrong, but the thought the Tuft and needle is essentially made with the materials common car seats or couches are kept bugging me even if it is very well reviewed.When it came down to buy the Casper was back ordered on Amazon so the choice was easy. We've read you really can't go wrong with either. You only get 30 days to try the mattress on Amazon so that was a downside but we wanted it 2 days kind of quick. I highly doubt at day 50 I would suddenly decide the mattress wasn't right. 30 days is plenty, I don't care what mattress companies say to keep you invested in your purchase.Delivery and unpacking was super easy. Took about 5-10 minutes. Your mileage my vary, the easier you can toss around 100 lbs for a king, the quicker it will be. It has its shape within minutes and id say by around 3-4 hours I measured it at its full advertised height give or take a quarter of an inch. Build quality looks great, doesn't feel cheap in the slightest bit. Me personally...we noticed little off gassing at all. I was concerned with that since ventilation in our room. I honestly noticed none unless I held my nose to the mattress within the first hour. By night time, about 8 hours later we noticed nothing sleeping. My dogs jumped on the bed, they typically act skeptical to chemical type smells. Neither were phased. Maybe we were lucky or others have much much more sensitive noses or low tolerances.As far as sleep, it's great. We had mattress shopping troubles because my wife and I are very different sleepers both in preference and position. She is around 145 athletically built and prefers a firm mattress. She is a stomach and back sleeper. I am around 200 also athletically built and am typically a side or back sleeper. I usually prefer a medium type of mattress, on the softer side. If you do your research that's pretty much polar opposites as far as a recommended bed lol.This bed just works. She was immediately in love. The avena foam (a material similar but more durable to latex) gives it a firmer touch more on par with a latex vs memory foam mattress. It has more bounce and not that quicksand feeling if memory foam. It felt a little on the firmer side for my preference at first but when you lay for a minute or so that memory foam feeling of the bed contouring starts to come in and it feels great. We pretty much cover every sleeping position imaginable between the two of us and we couldn't be more satisfied. I would definitely agree this is about a 6-6.5 on the firmness scale.  It's very versatile though.In hindsight I think this was our correct choice. I think the tuft and needle may have been perfect for her but left me wanting a little more and settling for a mattress pad on my side to continue sleeping on our side.The Casper I speculate would have left both of us unhappy. It seems to be very dependent on weight for feel. The top is very soft giving it a softer feel compared to the Leesa. However I hear people around my weight and heavier feel it's a firmer mattress, we bottom out closer to the support layer. If you're dynamic is opposite to mine, the lighter sleeper likes soft and the heavier firm that might be great for you. I think it would have left her being lighter feeling it's too soft and myself being heavier feeling the mattress was too firm.I'll update as time goes on but at this time I couldn't be happier.
