This product is legit. I've tried the major brand's similar item. It's pretty much glorified hand sanitizer. Just cleaning the gloves. Grip Boost actually makes your receiver gloves more tacky.It only takes a dime size dab of Grip Boost, rub gloves together, it coats your gloves in a haze giving them noticeable tackiness.The grip lasted a full game. I used Grip Boost on some Cutters Rev gloves.I'm going to test these out on some worn out Cutters next time and see if it rejuvenates some older gloves.Big thumbs up to this product. #7XLAPPROVEDGrip Boost Football Glove Grip Bottle (2oz)
