Holy Cow! Portal rocks.Before, I had the router that came with my cable service and a Linksys extender to reach my upstairs media room. The system was fickle and sometimes unreliable. One Portal replaced my old router and the extender and result was more than double the speed in the upstairs media room.There is no way Im going to run ethernet from the lower level of my house to the upstairs where we watch Netflix and do some gaming. So I needed a wifi solution. Portal fixed everything.It was super easy to set up. Plugged it into the Internet, waited for it to update and then walked through the iPhone app. The set up only took a few minutes after the router updated itself.One thing I would say is it will create two networks. One name ends in HD. That one is by far the fastest. The other one is more for distance. Definitely put everyone on the HD network, unless you are punishing them for some reason :)It has a great sleek design with no ugly antennae. Its in my home office so it needs to a have a little style. Its a perfect fit for me. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to get faster and more consistent wifi downstairs and upstairs.
