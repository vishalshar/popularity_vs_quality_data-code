There are definitely some people on here writing bad reviews from other competing companies. There is nothing to complain about. I have now bought 800s, 900s, and the 1000 series bulb. Put the 1000s on the front porch and set them to be red/green for Christmas. Set the app to turn them automatically at sunset and off at daybreak. Have a night setting for the house that turns them to 1% and basically becomes a nightlight for the whole house. I can ask Alexa to turn on them by zones or even set light level by percentage. There is really nothing not to like about these lights. Put them in subscribe and save to replace 3 every month until all lights in the house have been replaced. These say they are equivalent to a 65 and 70 watt bulb but I am replacing 100 watt bulbs with them and they are just as bright or even brighter. Dont be afraid of the wattage. My only fear was they were not going to be very bright but they are VERY bright.
