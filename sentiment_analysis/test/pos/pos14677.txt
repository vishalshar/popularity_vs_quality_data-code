Great design. I got a set for iPhone 6 type headphones, and liked them so much that I got another pair for some iPhone 5 types. The iPhone headphones never stayed in my ears, even for simple phone calls, let alone for work outs or running. These keep them in place, and seem to help seal in the sound. You get two sizes, and both work fine for me, so I essentially end up with 4 usable pairs. Good deal.
