This review, however, will be my own opinions and feelings about the product and are not there simply to promote it.First things first, this headset is very close to the perfect combination. What I mean by that is when you look at many types of VR rigs on the market from google cardboard to the oculus rift,  A simple way to describe it is a bridge between the two. Merge VR has a great build quality and a lot more professional features but offers the simplicity and ease of cardboard. Basically all you have to do is launch a virtual reality app, slide your phone in, and enjoy.Now like I just said, the build is great, but if you thought this was made of a very hard material, it deceiving, but it's not. Actually, the entire exterior of the device is foam. This offers a lot more comfort when wearing and generally makes it a lot lighter which means: first, its less bulky, and second, it doesn't weigh you down as you're using it. On the topic of comfort, they also supply an optional head band which makes the experience even better. If you are a person who uses the cardboard camera app as well, that piece in the bottom left corner does come out.One feature they implemented that I have never seen anywhere else is the ability to adjust the lenses to how far apart your eyes are. This may not mean much to you, but you would be surprised how useful this feature is. The tops of both sliders are where merge places the buttons to be able to interact with many of the games and other apps.So the most important part of any VR unit is the picture, and I gotta say, its pretty great. There is a good amount of clarity, and its very nice to look at for a few minutes. Make sure you take note that the merge looks the best on larger phones with a 1080p display or higher. If you have a smaller phone, you will see the edges and is not nearly as immersive. I did try to use many smaller smartphones, and I can tell you that this definitely did come as a problem.Overall, I would totally recommend Merge VR. There are a lot of nice implementations that make this more than just a basic headset. If you have the money, and you want a great phone VR experence, you should totally pick one up for yourself.
