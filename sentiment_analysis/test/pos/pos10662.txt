I bought three of these little toys to keep my 8 nieces and nephews busy and happy at a family Christmas party this year. Not only were they a huge hit with the children, ages 4-11, but once introduced to the kids, the adults at the party were suddenly interacting with the children, tossing the Fuzzies to the kids and having a great time. Nothing was broken in my house at the end of the day since the Fuzzies are soft and don't really roll at all. The only problem was deciding who got to take them home at the end of the night! (we decided on one per family). A great interactive toy.
