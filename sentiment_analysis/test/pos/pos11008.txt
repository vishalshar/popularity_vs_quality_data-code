We really wish there wasn't so much in one little packet. We have found that we need to accumulate the things that need Sugru before we open one of the individual packs, because once it's open, you either have to use it or lose it. Other than that, this stuff is great! My boyfriend used it to "seal" up his tennis shoes, I used it to add grips and heat-resistant knobs and handles to my pots and pans. We've used it to fix chewed cables from the cats. It's great stuff to have on hand.
