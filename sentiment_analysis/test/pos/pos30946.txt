I got my LUMA device a week back. I must say the package of the device is awesome. Luma device look n feel is also great. It has very nice sleek design.  I feel that this is a perfect replacement to my wireless router. It took only 15 minutes to complete the setup of the 3 devices.The setup procedure was pretty straight forward and the app guided me very well. I live in a 3 story home. I placed the 3 devices in each level.the speeds are very consistent. The one next to the modem gives me the highest speed and remaining 2 devices gives me a little less but definitely much higher than my previous wireless router. I liked the features like pausing the internet, last time a device was connected to LUMA. Restrict usage based on time limit works nice. I have few  suggestions to make here, It would have been good if the app would have told me the devices connected to each LUMA. And It will be nice if we had an option to wall mount them. Improve the software/hardware to have the same speeds across all 3 luma devices.Over all a great product to have in every home ...
