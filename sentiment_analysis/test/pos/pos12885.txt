UPDATE:  After a month with this mount, I'll confirm again how well it works. I like it so much better than the suction-cup mounts I've owned in the past.  I've just ordered another one for my wife to use in her vehicle with her Galaxy S3.I'll add my vote for this product. the other reviews have covered it all so I imagine people will skip right over this but here goes...The mount is very sturdy and fits firmly into the CD slot without any play at all. I've used some suction-cup based mounts which seemed flimsy even when firmly attached to the glass or to another surface. The entire mount is heavy-duty and despite appearing clunky and bulky in these photos, if you mount it with the screw facing down, it looks and works great once your phone is installed.I use this with a Galaxy S4 in my 2013 F150. I never use the CD player and find the placement on the dash doesn't block anything vital. I dislike the windshield mounts for use in the truck because it puts them out of reach if you need to use the touch-screen. Mounting on the dash keeps it within easy reach and the solid feel of the mount holds it firmly so the phone won't move when you're pushing buttons. It also keeps it closer to the USB and power ports so  I don't have the USB/charger cable hanging there.This all aids me in using the full features of the phone with ease. I'm using the voice commands extensively for navigation, music, messaging and phone calls on this phone. I employ the voice commands in my Samsung Galaxy S4 by 'double-clicking' the home button on the bottom of the phone. The mount holds the phone rock-solid and the phone doesn't wobble and move. Compared to previous mounts I've used, this beats them all for usability.The mount comes with extra foam cushions which you can use as replacements in the event the originals wear out.  I haven't had the mount for long so am unable to comment on wear. This is working out well for me but each of us have our own needs. The quality of the mount has been great and I expect it to last.
