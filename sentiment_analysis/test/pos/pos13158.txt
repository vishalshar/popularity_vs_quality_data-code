I normally do not write review but I am more than thrilled with this product. It is very accurate with my sleep % and my daily activity. Since we are getting app updates on a frequent basis, it will keep getting better. I have been telling everyone about this. Their customer service is amazing and I cannot wait for more accessories.Update: I have had this for a few weeks and I still love it. I had my first glitch (software) this week but my leafy updated within 2 days- I wasn't heart broken  that I had 2 days of "bad" data. It works best for me on my wrist, even though I like the idea of the necklace.I am told that more assessories are coming out soon - I wish they rolled those out with the beat so I could have options.This is a very "me" tracker.... Couldn't be more happy
