This is a really good 3D pen for a starter. The filament is special and you cannot get just any filament. I purchased a ton and realized it would not melt with this Pen. My 8 year old really enjoys making things with it. I can see an upgrade in his future and this being passed to the younger sibling. It does not get too hot for the little ones. It charges so no cords for the kids to deal with. It really does well for a starter for creative kiddos.
