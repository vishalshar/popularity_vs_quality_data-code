My original review was less than positive because the weight of an iphone 6 plus easily pulled the sticky pad off my dash.  I mentioned that i loved the mount itself but it failed at the primary function of staying afixed to the dash.  I mentioned that I planned to return the product.Before I even managed to get the mount back in the mail, I was contacted by Customer service, who promised me a thicker, more efficient pad and apologized profusely for the trouble I had with the original mount.True to their word, I have received a placement unit.  This time I decided to try affixing to the dashboard WITHOUT any of the sticky pads and just with the suction cup itself.  (It works fine that way with my older iOttie models, so I i'm giving it a go with this one as well.)  So far, so good.  No need for the sticky pad and the mount holds the weight without issue and has stayed on the dash for a few days now.  If it comes loose I may or may not try again with the sticky pad.But in any event,  I love the versatility of this mount and even more I love that iOttie stands behind the product, 100% and goes the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction.  You can't go wrong with this mount.
