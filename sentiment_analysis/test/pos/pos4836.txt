I ordered this speaker for my mother-in-law. She was wanting a portable speaker and I ordered this one for her because of the neat design, easy use and very cool carrying handle.The Bluetooth pairing is super easy and the sound is really great. It has a surround sound type sound when in use which is amazing.She is very happy with this speaker and loves it. I spent just a few minutes with her on how to use the controls and she was off and running in about 5 minutes.Great buildSolid soundExcellent carry handleTremendous battery lifeEasy to read and understand instructionsIt comes with a micro usb charging cable and an AUX cable.I would order this again and recommend to anyone.This item was delivered very fast with Prime Membership and there were no shipping or delivery issues or hassles.Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.Thank you for taking the time to read my review. I really appreciate it and I hope it was helpful to you.
