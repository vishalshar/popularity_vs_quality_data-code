I ordered two. One for myself and one for my husband.(I am 5'6" and he is 6'4") The step count is really accurate for myself. For my husband it likes to give extra steps to. Example: If he coughs into his arm, two extra steps. However, over all the step count is pretty accurate.The sleep tracker is nice. It seems to be very accurate for my husband but for myself not so much. I have literally woken up, and gotten out of bed but the tracker states I never woke up and was in deep sleep all night long. I've tried putting the band on tighter and looser, nothing seems to work. But my husbands sleep is being tracked rather accurately.I am ordering one for our son who is 8 but small. He tried my band on and it will stay around his wrist. The kid tracking bands are way to childish and he doesn't want a bouncing frog on his tracker screen. He walked with mine on for a few steps and it had tracked him fairly well. When he runs though the tracker doesn't work so well. However, is he going to enjoy having it and is excited to get his own.
