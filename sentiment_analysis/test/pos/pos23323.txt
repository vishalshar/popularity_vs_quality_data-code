Let me make it very simple, I have been in the tech industry since the invention of the Apple and have installed and used every type of wireless router and extender. Eero was the easiest to install of any I have used and solved the problem I had of getting consisted strong signal through every corner of my house and basement, where I have my office, even with the modem located two floors above. I purchased the 3 unit solution. Finally, my signal strengths and speeds allow me to do everything I want at any location on the 7 devices (including an Echo) I use. I also love the ability to add guests to my system without giving them my main password.
