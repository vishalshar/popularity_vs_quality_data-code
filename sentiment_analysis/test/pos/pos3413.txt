UPDATE-I was really hacked off when I first got this.  However, after my initial post (below) I was finally able to get in touch with the Growlerwerks customer service.  It took a couple of weeks but they sent me a replacement neck and a special wrench for installation.  After that, it worked pretty well. Perhaps they will get the bugs worked out on future production runs.  I still think they need a little more quality control but overall, I like it.Original Post-This fell apart before even getting one drop of beer in it.  First, the tap didn't work, then the entire tap assembly fell off the gooseneck.  All it had on it was a GLUED on steel washer (yeah, steel right there with your beer flowing over it).  It didn't even have a proper flange fitting.  I can't comment on anything else because it fell apart before I could even charge it up.  What a waste.  Beautiful idea but it's nothing but a figurine to set on a shelf.  Really  disappointing.
