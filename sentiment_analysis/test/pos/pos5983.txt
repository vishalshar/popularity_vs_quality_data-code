My daughter works in a high end beauty salon where the products are unlimited to me for a great discount but I always like to branch out and see what products work at a price point where I can continually keep up and afford.  I've not ever tried this line before and have not been paid to review it. My skin is normally not tolerant to Vitamin C (I tend to break out from it).  I have very nice skin for 52 and I attribute it to always being mindful of using good products.  So I didn't expect much from this very affordable cream.  I must say I was absolutely thrilled at how my face and chest looked after one use!!!  My skin was tight and absolutely glowing ! - unfortunately for me, I have always worn tons of sunscreen on my face, and neglected my chest so I'm anxious to see if this brings it back to a healthier looking decollete!  So far, I'm impressed :)
