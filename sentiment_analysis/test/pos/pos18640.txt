I bought this for my parents and they loved it. They had received a mushroom kit many years ago that turned out to be a dud. This kit was not. The mushrooms grew quickly and were plentiful. They had enough mushrooms to use in several meals and a mushroom beef stew. The grandkids loved the experience as well.
