You know a game is good when you continue to play it over and over again even though you keep losing.  I kept this game on the table for about a week.  I played it about 14 times and it never got old.  The game comes with 3 bad guys,  of which I am still working on the terrorist (easiest one) and have only won once.Hostage Negotiator is a fun mix between a deck-building game and Ameritrash with dice rolling results to card planning.  There is a definite strategy to defeating each hostage taker, but the dice rolling will dictate the success of your planning.  The game is easy to setup and simple to play with a game lasting no longer than about 20 minutes each.The only negative that I have is that this game is quit luck driven as the results of your planning are dictated by dice rolls, which can often go very wrong.  I played once where the difference between victory and defeat was the result of a dice roll.
