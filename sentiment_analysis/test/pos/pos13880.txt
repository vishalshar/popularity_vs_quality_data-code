Bought this for hubby as he works around radars, warehouses and airplanes and can't always hear his cell phone ring. He has an HTC phone that's about 3-4 yrs old. Had a little trouble getting the Ditto & his phone talking to each other, but after a couple of tries they connected. He has had this since Christmas, 2015 and it's very helpful. He can wear it in a shirt pocket where he can feel it vibrate. He's misplaced it a few times, but has always been able to find it. The phone and Ditto sometimes quit talking and it takes about a day, even with updates for them to get back together.I would recommend this as an option for additional notification of cell phone calls and messages you may miss due to noise.
