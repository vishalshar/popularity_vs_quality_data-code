Wow. Just buy it, trust me you won't regret it. My dream was to just find a way to simply upgrade the sound from iTunes music through my iPad with minimal fuss/connections etc. Well, it CERTAINLY met that goal in a way I would not have expected. It isn't just a little bit better - it is ridiculously better. Everything sounds far more liquid, far more lifelike than what I was using before (Apple lighting-to-30 pin connector, audio quest golden gate 30 pin to 3.5mm going into a Ray Samuels Predator amp). In terms of sound staging, imagine a balloon. What I had before sounded like a flat empty balloon between the earpieces. With this dac/amp, it's like the balloon is now fully inflated - 3 dimensional. And keep in mind this is just with low res  iTunes music files! I have the following headphones: Sennheiser HD650, B&W P5, Beyerdynamics DT1350, Monster Miles Davis Tributes. It drives all of them easily, which surprised me. I figured it might trouble with the 300 ohm HD650's, but not to worry - it drives them with authority. Particularly interesting was what it did for the B&W P5's - it really told hold of them and really transformed them. Added at least an entire octave of bass that I never knew they were capable of. Give it a day or two to fully break in and after that, I really can't imagine anyone not loving this dac/amp (except for competitors!). It even beats my non-portable setup that i have attached to my PC (Dragonfly/FIOO E9). Very impressive!! The only downside was that the shipment was late (probably because they are using USPS now). BTW, if you go to Peachtree's website it only lists it as being compatible with iPhones & iPods (for Apple products), but I'm listening right now on an iPad Air 2 with no issues. I couldn't be happier with this.Update 4/25/16 -Just wanted to report that I now have far better headphones JH Audio J13v2, SE 535 and Westone Pro UM 50 and the Shift scales beautifully with these high end IEM's. You must hear DSD files through it - incredible! I couldn't possibly be happier with it!
