I got this set up and experimented with it before I left for my vacation in a remote area of Ireland ...which is a must because you need wifi to do so and also get a basic understanding of how it works before you are trying to use it on vacation with no wifi back up.  You have to be patient with it and give it time to connect and work when not connected to wifi.  You have to be somewhat techy to get it up and running...not really the easiest thing to understand.  The reason I purchased this is what it was most valuable for...those times where you are in a remote area with no close wifi and there are small things you need to accomplish on your laptop or smartphone.  It worked perfect for this!  On the other hand it was super expensive!  I tried 2 different buying plans and the data was used up very fast!  I spent about 30 Euro on a 5 day trip using it very sparingly.  Overall I would buy this again for the convenience without thinking twice!  It was a great relief to know I had it and great to have around in your house or car for emergencies.
