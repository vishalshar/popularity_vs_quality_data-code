Bragi - The Dash Truly Wireless Smart EarphonesOn Day 2:I'm not sure what all the negative reviews are for- saddens me not knowing if they've purchased used headphones that were defective [maybe thinking they were new] or perhaps just don't have the patience to interact with the little earphones, but I hope my review sways any discouraged minds.With any piece of technology, first off, buy it from a trusted source.If it's not, for example, Amazon or Bragi [the actual website], shipping your product, make sure to educate yourself and read the reviews of the seller. It would be an amazing world if we could all be trusted, but, that's not so. So, you want a quality product? Do some quality shopping. :)I promise it'll be worth it in the end.Design of Product: Well, you can be the judge of that. Personally, I enjoy the look of the Bragi as it doesn't stand out too much but still looks stylish.Design of Boxing: Eh. So, so. It was nicely done, but I found the book like flipping part of the packaging a bit much.Fitting: I believe it comes with the XS sleeve already on. At first, it takes some time to get used to how to place the product in your ear but when you get it, you get it. It's just an incredible fitting product in my experience. I have my left ear tragus pierced and I was a little worried about the unbalance that may occur, 'Will I have to take it out, put it back in, take it out...etc', it was never a problem. Both ears fit VERY well even with the piercing in.Sound: Nothing amazing, but nothing cheap either. I'm not great with 'how things should sound' but it definitely gets the job done.Battery Life: Seemed pretty decent to me. Just ran out as I was writing this review and i've been using it on and off these past 2 days.Functionality: This part may take more than a few days to get used to. The touch pad on the earphones are small I assume, so the taps and swipes that are required to control things sometimes don't register like you think they should. Just takes patience though, I don't consider it a faulty product.Bluetooth: This part I fully understand the negative reviews. It's not amazing, to say the least. If you turn your head a bit too far of a distance or if the phone is on the left side [because it pairs with the right] the sound will drop, but I haven't tested it in full detail due to the OnBoard Storage Space that I place my music on in place of using Bluetooth. Much more convenient, no problems.The Bluetooth glitches are why I dropped a star, but Bragi, in my opinion, has created an amazing product that I hope will last me for years to come.Small Tip:Follow the instructions straight out the box, just to make sure there's no chance for problems.Open it up, DO NOT just use them :) Charge first, and always make sure to disconnect the device from your computer safely [Eject the file/disk].
