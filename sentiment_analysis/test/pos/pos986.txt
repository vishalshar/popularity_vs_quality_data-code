As an athlete with a sensitive stomach, I am very mindful of what I put into my body pre-workout. From bars to gels to goos to caffeine shots, I have tried them all with various success. TruEnergy Sport Shots did the job!!! Taking this product right before a long run or hard workout made me feel fueled up, energized, and able to go longer and harder -- without feeling jittery as I had after taking other caffeine shots. Awesome product, will definitely buy more. Now a staple of my gym bag!
