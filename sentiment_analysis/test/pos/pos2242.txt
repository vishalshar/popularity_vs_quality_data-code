Leah here (Nick's wife, I used his Amazon account to get the LEAF to me via Prime shipping),I've gotta say that this thing has been everything I wanted it to be when I picked it up.Recently I've been struggling with my sleep schedule, and I really wanted a way to track my sleep and perhaps figure out what any problems may be.I also have insanely sensitive skin, and have an allergic reaction most times when I wear any kind of metal jewelry, which was a big part for me in deciding on something that I would be wearing to sleep. The hypoallergenic metal that it's made of hasn't bothered me at all. I love being able to switch it around and wear it on my wrist or on my shirt - depending on my activity.I had read some reviews that said that the sleep tracker wasn't working for them, so I asked someone I know who uses one about it, and she had never had a problem. I figured it doesn't hurt to try, and I was happily surprised.The sleep tracker has shown me what times I'm struggling with sleeping, and I've been able to narrow down some of the root causes.As far as I can tell the pedometer is really accurate. My husband has a Gear S2 smartwatch, and he says that his is never accurate. Because of it's accuracy, it's been doing a great job of tracking my activity, and also tells me when I meet my goals, which is really neat!A part of me really wanted to spend the extra money for the gold version, because that's the color of jewelry I usually wear, but this piece is so striking that it has brought me out of my comfort zone with gold and have switched over to silver in my outfits :)I had read some reviews about how in order to get the most accurate readings out of the LEAF, you have to shift it around several times from your wrist to your neck, etc. I don't like wearing anything on my wrists or around my neck when I sleep, so moving it from the necklace I wear during the day to the hem of a shirt really isn't a big deal. I actually enjoy the versatility of the product. It's a bit larger than I had expected, but it's incredibly lightweight, given it's appearance.I think the only thing I dislike about it is that the vibrate scares me most of the time - I forget that I have an alarm set and it suddenly starts vibrating, but the app/my phone don't show any alarms.I wish it had come with a cute chain for the necklace portion, but I've been making due with a spare chain from home.I'd like it if the cycle tracking were little more discreet, and I'm a bit bummed that it's not waterproof, but other than that, I really have no complaints. It does what I need it to do - tracks my sleep and overall activity.The breathing exercises are a nice touch. I haven't really gotten into using them, but I can foresee that they'll be useful in the future.
