This works great!  My brother and I got some football gloves a few months ago for when we play catch together.  I was disappointed when they started to lose their grip.  We tried using hand sanitizer and it worked, but not very well.  This gel certainly fixed our problems and has made our gloves as good as new.  The bottle is smaller than I had imagined but it doesn't take very much for each use so it seems like it will last for a long time.
