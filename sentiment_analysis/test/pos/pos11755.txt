I take my cord back and forth with me each day from my home to the office and back. I wanted something that would protect and organize the cord in my travels. This is great so far (I've only had it in use about a week and a half). I like how it neatly holds my cords and takes up little space in my purse and the blue color and whale/fish shape make it easy to find in the clutter. I would recommend this to friends and family, especially those that travel a lot.
