I like these vitamins overall. Taste wise, the flavor is pretty good, the texture is a bit sticky for me though, and the sugar coating makes me forget I'm taking vitamins, and its all natural sugars. They look like little gumdrops. A dose is six gummies, which I don't mind at all, since they taste like candy. I would advise to be careful where you store them with children around, cuz if adults want to snack on these (I know I have had extra before, and have seen other reviews say they have to), and kids could overdose more easily. Another reason I feel good purchasing this product is that the company does a 1-1 matching nutrient grant to a child in need through their partnership with Vitamin Angels.  I love that they are made locally here in California, too!
