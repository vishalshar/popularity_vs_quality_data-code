I am notorious for losing sporks. I've managed to lose three titanium sporks while backpacking, so I decided to try these instead. They worked great. I was able to carry two of these at less weight than a single metal spork. I do miss a serrated bit on the side so it might function a little like a knife. Outside of that, I arrived back with both sporks intact and no more titanium sporks for me. The color helped, too as it was easy to spot.
