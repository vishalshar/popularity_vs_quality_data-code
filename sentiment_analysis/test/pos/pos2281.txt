Pros: Put it this way, I never thought there'd be a mouse that could replace the snappy responsiveness and comfort of my Razer DeathAdder and Zowie EC2-A till I got this mouse. It feels great and it just feels right in your hand. A very light mouse, but not too light, just right. Combined with a decent cloth gaming mouse pad, this mouse is awesome. It also has on-board memory, so you won't have to keep booting up the software just to get your settings memorized (that was one of the ONLY drawbacks I had with the Razer DeathAdder). The mouse buttons have quite a nice feel to them (oh that Omron switch goodness, I tell ya!).Minor Cons: If you're a palm gripper, this mouse might not be for you. It caters to my hybrid clawgrip style quite well. But if you have huge hands, this probably isn't for you. Also, a light mouse might not be to your liking. I'm not a fan of heavy mice and this mouse has no weight management options. You either get used to the weight or you don't with this mouse. The thumb padding is great, BUT, it's a lint magnet. It's no different than the lint magnet grips of the DeathAdder, but it's a minor chore. The slope of the thumb grip might take a little getting used to, but after a while, this mouse does start to cater to your hand like a comfortable glove.UPDATE - 02/09/2016: So, I did notice the left mouse button was a lot stiffer than the right mouse button. At first, I thought that was by design. Then, the tactile 'bump' became less and less apparent to the point where the left mouse button was not working anymore. I can't believe I've owned this mouse for less than 2 months and I'm already using the insurance that I paid for this thing to send me a replacement.UPDATE - 2/17/2016: Mionix returned my messages regarding the defective Castor I had. They said that they'd be more than happy to replace my mouse. But the RMA process was horrible! They wanted the following: a) Provide a VIDEO regarding the issue b) Ship the defective product to SWEDEN. You know how much it costs to send a 1lb box to Sweden? Approx. $115+ USD! I was not happy with this proposition as a customer at all, especially when I was trying to see if they honored their warranty policy.UPDATE - 5/05/2016: So why did I change my rating back from 1 star to 5 stars? The mouse is fantastic. It just so happened that mine was defective. I respect companies like this that reach out to you to try to make things right. This is rare. A gentleman from Mionix reached out to me to (goes by the name of Christoffer) to see what they can do to make the RMA process for U.S. customers easier. Initially, I was told that I had to ship the defective product to Sweden. Shipping a 1lb box to Sweden isn't exactly cheap. So my initial experience involved Amazon refunding me my money while I ended up with defective Castor (the LMB is now completely unresponsive). Thanks to Mionix and Christoffer, amends were made and the option for U.S. customers to exercise the warranty, return or RMA process has improved drastically (you can now ship the product to a U.S. location!). The final resolution involved fantastic customer service (after my initial experience of course), a change in the return process for all U.S. customers who buy Mionix product and most importantly, they replaced my defective Castor with a fully functional and brand spanking new Castor. This company rocks and I hope computer accessory companies like Mionix keep up the great work. Thanks Amazon and thanks Mionix!
