Bath time used to consist of us telling our son, "keep the water in the tub please" every 30 seconds to now...we never have to remind him of this because he has his shelf to pour water onto or to pour water from one container to another which he loves to do... & never a spill out of the tub now that we have this!  It's wonderful!  I wish we knew about it sooner & may even get another to sort of span the whole length of the tub.  Highly recommend.
