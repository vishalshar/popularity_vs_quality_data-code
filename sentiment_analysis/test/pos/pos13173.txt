I am a special education teacher and I just had to write to you to let you know how wonderful Osmo has been for my students this year, especially my students with ASD. Because of fine motor difficulties for most of my students, writing out and practicing spelling words with paper and pencil is often a traumatic therefore extremely nonproductive way to learn our words so, we practice our spelling everyday using Osmo. I simply load their lists every week and then they can work on them everyday. A few of my studentÂ’s actually have Osmo at home so I email the list to their parents and they also work on them at home.The kids love it and have really learned how to spell their high frequency words!!! Numbers has also been a wonderful way for everyone to practice their addition facts and learning how toBut the greatest moment for me using Osmo came just today. One of my students with ASD was in art class and the project had all of the kids holding mirrors and drawing a picture of them. For my little guy, this was all but impossible. Not only does he have face blindness, he does not recognize familiar faces even his own, so just trying to see himself in the mirror was difficult then combine his fine motor weakness and this became an insurmountable task. Unfortunately he then broke down into tears, crying and refusing to stay in class. The art teacher called me and when I got to the art room, through tears, he explained to me he could not stay and could not do the drawing. Once we got to my room, knowing how much he enjoys using Osmo everyday, I asked him if he was willing to try using the Masterpiece game to help him sketch himself. He hesitantly agreed. He told me to take his picture and he would try it that way. I smiled and took his picture with the ipad and then we uploaded it to Masterpiece.  As soon as it came up, he giggled and clapped. After playing with the settings to determine how much help he needed with the lines, he quickly drew himself and was then able to use the watercolor crayons to create an absolutely wonderful self-portrait. Had it not been for Osmo Masterpiece, my student would not have been able to access the curriculum and join his peers to participate in the art show!!!!I cannot express to you the joy and overwhelming gratudete I felt for everyone at Osmo when my wonderful little first grade friend was simply a first grade student today because of the wornderful work you have done!!!
