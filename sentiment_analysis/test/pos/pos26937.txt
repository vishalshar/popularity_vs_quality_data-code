This is my favourite hand soap OF ALL TIME. It smells INCREDIBLE. Seriously who knew you could be so passionate about a liquid hand soap :) It smells of bergamot and lavender... super premium. You could even use it as a shower gel because the bottle is big enough and the soap doesn't strip your skin.
