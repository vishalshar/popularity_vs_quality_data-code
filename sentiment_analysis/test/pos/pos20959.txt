Wow!  We have cooked a thick pork chop seasoned with garlic and rosemary; a chicken breast with lemon pepper and rosemary; and a tenderloin steak seasoned with wooster, salt and pepper.  All were excellent!  Never heard of it before I got it for Christmas, but I love it!  Can't wait to cook even more...
