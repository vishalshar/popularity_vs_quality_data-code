Let's me have full and easy control of my system.  No controller that I've previously had was easy to control.  So much so that you end up not making seasonal corrections or making any changes once you believe it's set up correctly.  With this, any adjustment that you want to make is so easy to do no matter where you are.  So you end up tweaking your controller and system to optimal performance.  And it's fun.The company is based from Denver, Co which I like.  They are VERY responsive to emails and no less than Exceptionally knowledgeable on their product and on the topic of lawn and plant watering.  Installation was easy.  I also added a wireless rainbird rain sensor to my system.After I got mine, two more neighbors replaced theirs.  My neighbors have theirs set to water every 3 days no matter what.  Mine runs maybe every 3 -5 depending on how much rain we received.  They also have mow their faster growing grass more than I do because they water more than needed.The company is continuously working on adding new features.
