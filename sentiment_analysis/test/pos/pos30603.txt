I think the spire is great at achieving what it promises, but it's not perfect. I was a long time fitbit user but I eventually got bored with the basic functions. The spire excels at behavior change.Spire does nice tracking of breaths and steps giving you a summary of your current state (focus, calm and tense). They give notifications like take more deep breaths, which does a nice job of changing behavior in the moment. Just counting steps didn't necessarily motivate me to change but understanding my habits does. They track your breath and steps in minutes and with a time stamp so you can see where in your day you made progress.If I could improve it I would make the spire smaller (though it does wear nicely on a bra) and improve the accuracy. If I wear it on my pants I track as more stressed but it seems unfounded and I would assume, a function of poor readibility at the waistband versus wearing it on you bust.
