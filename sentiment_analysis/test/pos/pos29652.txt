Bought this for my husband (an IT) to have a mug at his desk that won't knock over and ruin his computers.We've had it for about 2 weeks now and He loves it.His co-worker liked it so much he's talking about getting one for himself.Single or double hits are fine, but batting it around quickly and repeatedly will cause it to fall over. My husband and I tested a few scenarios to see just how well it stuck and what it would take to knock over.
