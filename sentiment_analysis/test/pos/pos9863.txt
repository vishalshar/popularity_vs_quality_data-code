My wife LOVES popcorn. Our house is never without a box or two in case of movie nights or random munchie attacks. I purchased this pack for her as a Christmas present, and it was probably her favorite gift of the year. The size is perfect; large enough to use generously a few times, but small enough so that it doesn't become clumpy, moist and unusable before you reach the bottom of the bottle. Most of the flavors are wonderful, with her favorites being Ranch, White Cheddar, and Bacon and Cheddar. The spicy ones, especially Jalapeno Cheddar, are a bit much; not overly spicy, but because the powder is so fine we ended up inhaling it and sending us into a minor coughing fit. The Butter and Kettle Corn were both fairly boring. Aside from those quibbles, this is a fun pack of flavors that are great for having around the house (or sneaking into the movie theater! Shhhhh!)
