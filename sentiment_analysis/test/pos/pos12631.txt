I'm trying to reduce my sugar but still enjoy the things I love. I love nuts and nut butter, and unfortunately a lot of peanut butter products out there have a lot of sugar. I actually got into Wild Friends when I tried the chocolate coconut peanut butter, which is excellent. When I researched them online, I found they do a ton of other nut butters! I saw the vanilla espresso almond butter and knew I had to try it.I can't say it tastes strongly of either vanilla or espresso, but there's a good roasted almond flavor and only 2 grams of sugar per serving. The butter isn't overly sweet and compliments the taste of the wheat bread I smear it on every morning. Since the nut butter is natural, the oils tend to separate. Give it a stir and it'll be ok.
