This is a really fun game to play. If you played Cards Against Humanity and liked it, then this is the next game that you should get. We got it just in time for my birthday party and everyone had a blast. It takes a turn or two for everyone to really pick it up, mainly because most people don't play charades often enough. Once you get going though the game gets really fun.The only thing I can see being a little difficult is that some of the cards have multiple meanings and if anyone in your group isn't up on current slang they might have an issue or two. All in all though the rules are straight forward and there are so many combinations of cards that the possibilities are near endless.
