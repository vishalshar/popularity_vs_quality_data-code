I've been commuting for a week with it now on the SF Caltrain and it works really well.  From the train station I go 2 miles to the office on some pretty rough roads and Glion gets me there quickly.Setup and Takedown+it arrives in an unmarked box, the packaging is very basic and it looks like it comes straight from it's Chinese factory+it is easy to fold and unfold.  They use a simple locking pin that has two positions.  it looks and feels secure.  its not as slick as a one-handed release but in practice it takes me about 30 seconds to fold it down.  The folding handles are not as secure as I'd like - they work by pulling out the handle, then folding it down.  The manual warns you not to fold down without fully pulling "out" the handles and I can see how they might snap.  A little extra care is needed.+the charge port is easy to access and use+the scooter's frame and welds look and feel high quality- the handlebar controls, which feel like cheap plastic.Riding the scooter+The scooter is quick (~15mph) and has smooth power delivery+Its fun to ride, well balanced and easy to maneuver-The handlebars jiggle a bit and cannot be tightened down.  Doesn't feel like a security issue but its noticeable on bumpy roads-The brake needs power to work.  To test it, I run the scooter battery all the way down.  I found that it will stops going forward before the brakes give out, so you should never be caught by surprise without brakes.  I would have strongly preferred a mechanical break though for peace of mind.-there is about a 0.5 second delay after twisting the throttle or brake before the scooter responds.  In practice this is pretty easy to get used to, but there is room for improvement here (its not like the throttle on car or motorbike that responds instantly).+it holds up in drizzle - never lost traction and the fenders kept me cleanRiding the train+Here's where the Glion shines - the scooter stands vertically by itself.  this is a huge plus if there is only standing room on the train.  the short position on the handle is perfect to hold the scooter in place but also rest some weight on it.  The handle is sturdy enough to lift the scooter.+It is easily possible to ride the train in a seat with the scooter standing vertically between your legs.+it is short enough to easily fit on the luggage rack on a standard caltrain+pulling the scooter by the dolly handle is very practical when getting off the station platform+the Glion is a relatively light ~27 lbs and small, compared to most of its competitors which are over 30lbs.Range and Charging+in my test it lasted about ~15 miles, pretty close to advertised on relatively flat ground+it seems to charge within a few hours pretty uneventfullyit's too early to comment on the long term battery lifeSummary:Before I bought it I had hesitation as I was not able to find it at any local dealers.  I tried and liked the I-MAX T3 - it has more power, a more comfortable deck and much more secure feeling brakes, but ultimately I ended up with the Glion because it was smaller, lighter, less expensive, and easier to take on the train and around the station, stood up by itself for storage, had permanently inflated tires, and also undercut the competition by several hundred dollars.  Its made my commute faster and more fun and I look forward to riding it, so far I think it's a really good product.
