We ordered the grabber because of our klutzy penchant for dropping small things (you know - an earring, a coin, a French fry) into the tiny, impossible-to-reach crevice between the car seat and the center console, thus losing them forever. When the grabber arrived, we were so pleasantly surprised at how substantial and well made it is that we were tempted to drop something deliberately just to try it out. We feel certain that when the inevitable time comes, it will serve us well, and we're very happy to have it.
