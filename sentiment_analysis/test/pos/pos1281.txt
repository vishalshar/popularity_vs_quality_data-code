I love this case .... I gave it 4 stars only because as time goes on it is less effective; however, it will still stick to smooth surfaces mainly glass (Mirrors and Windows) ! I love this product because I only really need it to stick to glass! This little case has put the selfie stick to shame...... flip the iPhone camera and set the 10 second delay timer....... and you have full body hands free pics not taken at an angle! I took t his case with me to a friends wedding/ bacheloertte party and it was the talk of the party. It also was a hit in New Orleans on Bourbon street..... We would be taking a pic and random people would ask about the case......and we would stop .... stick it on the window of a store and take some pretty epic pics!  I woudl highly recommend this case if your looking for epic selfie action!
