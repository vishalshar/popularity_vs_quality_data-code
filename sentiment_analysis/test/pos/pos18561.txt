We bought this as a gift for my Dad. His turntable broke and he wanted a way he could listen to his records in his home office. This entertainment center is fantastic every music input method works perfectly. His music is spread between vinyl records, cassettes and cds and with him having this all-in-one capability, he is a very happy music fan. The speakers have surprisingly good clarity too. Whether you are using the turn table, cassette, cd, radio or aux in everything that played was crystal clear and the records maintained that nice vinyl sound that you don't get from digital music.This product is a great gift for any music lover at a great price.
