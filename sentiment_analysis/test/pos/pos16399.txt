I have only been using the MiniMD for 2(ish) months, but I can already tell an improvement in the texture of my skin. I don't seem to break out as often, my sun spots don't seem as noticeable, and my skin is so smooth! It removes so much dead skin it's incredible (and so gross)! I would definitely recommend purchasing the Precision Tip of you have a narrow nose though.  Overall, I love love LOVE the MiniMD!
