This is an excellent device if you like the type of item that you can just plug in and have it work.  Pros are  that it is easy to set up, 12 Zones, Auto zone find, Weather aware. Cons would probably only matter to a guy like me and they are: No detailed analytical data, Not many notification options, not much to the app, currently no Web control. None of this is really bad
