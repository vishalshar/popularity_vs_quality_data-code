My son loves his new early Birthday present,yes i gave it to  an early birthday his birthday,.I wanted him to ride it before it started to snow,i do not think it is going to snow anytime soon,sat going to be 60 and sun 65,But overall the bike is great and my son loves it by the time summer comes he will be taller and then he will fit perfectly on his new bIKE. Merry Christmas.
