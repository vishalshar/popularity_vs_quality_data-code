I bought this product for a family reunion trip to the lake. After receiving he product it seemed to be built well in terms of sturdiness and material types. We were able to use this mount on backpack straps, shoulders on life jackets and even the ski tow rope. The product held up tremendously. I highly recommend it as a great GoPro accessory to add to your collection. The only things I would add as things that would be better is if the screws came in like a torque screw something to use some leverage to make it toght since this what makes or breaks the product working or not. I also didn't like that I basically had to pull the screws out to change it. This led to dropping them multiple times. Overall I would definitely buy this product again though!
