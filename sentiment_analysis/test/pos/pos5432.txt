This stuff is awesome! I like it better than Great Tidings natural deodorant. I have 2 complaints however, #1: I had having to dip my finger in and apply like the old school deodorant "Tussy." It's no fun when you're rushing to work and have to wash your hands because you have deodorant stuck under your nails. #2- I am a dark-skinned Black woman and this stuff made my underarms look like black snake skin! I had the same issue with Great Tidings and I have seen pictures of other people's reaction to this product. There discoloration is red/pink, mine is literally JET BLACK. I did find that using an exfoliating loofah or heavier wash rag actually peels that blackness off. Also over time it, as my armpits have gotten used to it the blackness has lightened quite a bit. It's not a deal breaker for me at all, but to some it might be.
