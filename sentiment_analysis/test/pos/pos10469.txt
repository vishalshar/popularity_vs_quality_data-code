Okay, I've been searching forever for a phone that can keep going over a period longer than 24 hours at a time with normal usage, or at least 12 hours under higher-than-normal usage, and this is the phone. I was hesitant because of the mAh rating of the batter, but nexbit have managed to assemble a coherent combination of hardware and software to make a snappy phone that's just what you need, and nothing more.An average camera, average screen size and resolution, and average specs, the nexbit doesn't stick out in that department, but it is the most functional and CLEAN phone I have used in a long time, eclipsing the G3/4/5 and Moto X series (any of them) at often a fraction of the cost. The fingerprint reader is snappy and clever, and the OEM OS isn't weighed down by bloatware and wasted features. It is the most true-to-android system I have used in a while, and the performance and battery life prove that less is more.Charging is fast-- not as fast as some others, but plenty fast, and I often get nearly two full days out of the phone before I need to recharge.The finish is excellent and more comfortable than many competing phones.For the price there is no competition.
