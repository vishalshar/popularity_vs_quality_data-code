Actually this product does everything it says it will do and I highly recommend buying it. So why the 3 start review? Totally over packaging. Although it does come in a nice package, the ZUS is stuck to the packaging with some white, rubbery compound that does not peel off. I did take as much off as I could,and finally used both Goof off and lighter fluid to remove the rest. After an hour of screwing with this I gave up. I had removed the gooey crap, but was left with a product that still works exceptionally well, but looks like it has been in the bottom of a heavily used tool box for the past 2 years. In other words it now looks like crap!10/15/2016I never contacted the company, but they contacted me because of this review and kindly offered to issue a credit or replace it. The product works and I guess a credit would have been great, but I preferred a replacement which they sent right away. Same packaging and same gooey white stuff to make it adhere to the packaging but I was able to carefully remove it this time. A great product with a company that stands behind what they sell. So I changed it to 5 stars.
