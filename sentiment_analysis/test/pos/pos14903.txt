I have 8 cats. I know! Any way...some cats were fine on this and some were not. The couple of kitties that didn't do well on it are the same ones that don't do well on many foods. I'd buy this again if there was a sale. Pet foods have really gotten crazy in price, but this one is about average for the type of food this is and quality.
