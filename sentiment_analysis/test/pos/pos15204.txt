This is my second Kuna unit - a strong endorsement of this product.The quality of the video on the Kuna product is very high, and both the camera and light perform flawlessly in extreme weather conditions. (We had -30 Celsius temperatures from time to time last winter.). The installation is very easy, based on easy to follow instructions that come in the box.  Note: To set up and fully operate the light and camera, a bluetooth-enabled smartphone or tablet with the Kuna app installed is a must.  If you're using an older iPhone without bluetooth, you're outta luck.Here are the only drawbacks to the Kuna, IMO: the video data is stored on Kuna's servers rather than on the home unit, which could raise privacy concerns;  it costs $ (via monthly or yearly subscription fee) to retain and access back-dated video data on the servers. I do subscribe ... and will continue to do so as long as the subscription fee does not increase.
