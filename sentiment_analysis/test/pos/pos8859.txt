I ordered the iFamCare Helmet: 1080P Full HD Wi-Fi Smart Digital Home Video MonitorÂ  to keep an eye on my breeding Rabbits.  It was nice to just pick up my phone and check to see if they are kindling (having babies) without walking to the cage and disturbing them.This camera comes with a wall mount if you want to install it on the wall, I haven't used that as I prefer to have it movable so I can look in on specific cages.  It also has VERY clear night vision which is really great since most of my rabbits give birth at night!It also comes with a kitty laser which has a few different patters so you can play with your cat with it when you aren't home.  This would definitely keep MY cats from getting bored.  I haven't used this feature yet, but probably will when we have kittens.This unit offers both FREE cloud service and a Micro SD card slot for a 32 Gig SD card which you'll have to buy separately.It has remote movement so you can change where you're looking and 2 way voice so you can intereact with whatever you have on the other end, pet, baby, kids...Setup was easy!! I was up and running within 15 minutes of opening the box!There are actually endless uses for this, including seeing who is at the door if needed.Disclaimer.
