This is an excellent cooking oil, but it is also great as a lubricant for oven racks. You may have noticed that your oven racks don't slide as smoothly as the used to, especially if you have run them through an oven self-cleaning cycle. Just remove the racks and rub a coating of avocado oil on the outside rails and they will slide smoothly again. You can use other cooking oils for this, but the avocado oil will hold up better in the hot oven environment because of its high smoke point.
