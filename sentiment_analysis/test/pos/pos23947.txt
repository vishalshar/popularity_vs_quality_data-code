I am currently home after crashing my bike on the ice this morning - busted my lip - lost some blood and a couple lights. The TRAKK flew out of my water bottle hostler hitting the pavement; continued to play. Works great.I noticed on a couple of reviews and a video that mentioned they couldn't get radio reception - you have to hold down on the scan button for at least a second - I was just pushing and not getting anything until I held the button down for at least a second and then released - FM radio works great.
