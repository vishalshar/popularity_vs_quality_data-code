Very cute and also handy to have the little pocket in the back. I did have to remove it to get my money out of the back pocket. I wasn't coordinated enough to do that while keeping it on. I used a few bobby pins to keep it in place when my hair was particularly slippery (clean and shiny would be a better way to put it!) Those on the trip with me complimented me on it often.
