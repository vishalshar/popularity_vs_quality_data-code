Bought this several months ago. Easy to use, Large display, Easy to clean, Temperatures are constant. Use it several times a week! Highly recommend this product. BTW if you are new to Sous Vide cooking, invest in a good cookbook such as Modernist Cooking Made Easy Sous Vide or Sous Vide for the Home Cook
