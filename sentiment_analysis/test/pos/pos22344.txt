Used this for the first time yesterday. As other reviewers noted, it was very easy to pair clubs and tracked my shots well, not missing or mis-recording any.  However, editing a shot is not very easy.  Since they comply with USGA rules regarding reviews and corrections during a round, you cannot review a hole when it fresh in your memory, or edit very easily on the fly.  They should allow players to turn that off for friendly and practice rounds.  For example, there is no easy way to record an out-of-bounds drive (loss of distance and stroke).  A second drive isn't recorded as it must consider it a mulligan or practice shot.  I had to make a note on a card to fix the hole after the round, and even that proved unintuitive.  The edit button in the lower right corner of the App could be bigger so it is easier to find and push.  Battery drain on iPhone 6 was nominal.  I started at 95%, and ended up with 54% at the round's end.  Carrying the phone in front pocket is also a pain, as I prefer to use those pockets for tees, markers, etc.All in  all a good product but it will take a few rounds to determine the effectiveness of the stats it collects.
