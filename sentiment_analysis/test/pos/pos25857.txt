So I decided to venture into the world of wireless charging. There is a plethora of solutions out there from $8 to $80 and I purchased at least 4 different chargers. What makes PowerSquare standout? Well, I bought the "leader" in Qi charging, a Samsung device - it literally drained my phone battery. The single coil chargers (PowerSquare has 6 coils) require you to 'find the sweet spot', not true with the PowerSquare, you can place you phone anywhere on the device and it charges in any orientation. The powersquare quickly and efficiently charges my iPhone 6Ps (with a Qi case) and I never wake up in the morning to a half charged device. No other charger has achieved that consistency so far. Additionally, I place the Powersquare at my bedside, at night. There is a single white light that indicates charging has begun, non-instrusive. All other devices are designed to glow BLUE, flashing slowly and light up the bedroom at night. I even wrapped electrical tape around one of them and still had a very bright night light. Yes, you will pay a premium for the PowerSquare, and you get what you pay for - quality, well thought out design and expected functionality.I highly recommend the PowerSquare and leave the other single coil, cheap devices to others.
