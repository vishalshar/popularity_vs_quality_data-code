I purchased a Misfit Ray about a month ago as a replacement for a Fitbit Alta that was inaccurate in step counting (it was only counting 60-70 of every 100 steps).  The Ray has proved to be much more accurate, being within a few steps on 100 step counts and coming in very close to Map My Walk on longer known routes of mine.The Ray is very light and I hardly notice it on my wrist.  I had a small problem with notifications but Ginnie from Support was prompt in responding and followed up with me regularly until we got it resolved.  I like the gentle vibrations for phone and text notifications - they are enough I notice but not so noticeable that people in meetings are hearing them.I do wish you could get more information in the notifications but that is a trade off that would require a bigger device.  I am curious how interchangeable the band will be with a necklace once they come out with alternatives - it doesn't appear to be something you could switch back and forth from day to day.Overall so far I am very happy with the accuracy, notification features and Customer Support!
