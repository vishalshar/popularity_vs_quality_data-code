Lull is a very supportive mattress, somewhat firmer than was comfortable for me.  But I spoke with one of their sleep experts and then purchased the gel foam topper and have been more than happy since then.  To have both pieces so affordable, delivered so quickly and set up so easily is a wonderful bonus.  Now, if only Amazon, knowing I have made this purchase, would stop with the annoying pop up ads for mattresses...
