We bought this product for our 5 year old daughter for Christmas. As a toddler, she loved playing puzzles and continues to love stacking blocks and puzzles. She is a wiz on the iPad, so naturally we thought it would be a good option to expand her skills using the device she is familiar with. She is starting kindergarten which has focused us on working towards those simple reading and math skills. This product is exactly what we were looking for.I love how Osmo states "play beyond the screen." So often my daughter recycles Netflix, or watching videos on Kids YouTube. This to me isn't educational and doesn't foster expanding her creative thinking skills. This product does just that!She and her dad have been experimenting on the Xbox with Disney Infinity gaming toys, so I thought this would be something fun that I could do with her since I have an aversion to video gaming. I will layout the pros and cons for this product, which ultimately, I highly recommend for all parents starting with a 5 year age group.Pros:+ Packaging is simple, functional for use to store pieces once you are done using.+ Start-up is easy, simply download app from the App Store.+ Easy, Medium & Hard applications within the program which allows for children to grow into programs.Cons:- Only works with Apple Products (I hope the designers expand to other touchscreen devices.- Need a flat service for the "playing field," which means that this isn't an "on the go" product.Set-up: Getting started is simple, hassle free. The package came with 4 individual packaged boxes within the bigger package. The base box includes a stand and reflector which are easy to set-up. The base can be used with Apple iPad 2, 3, 4 and iPad Air and Mini. Since the device syncs with many products, the base has 2 options which sync to iPad 2, 3, 4 or iPad Air and Mini. We needed the Air sync, so had to do a quick adapter removal, extracting the adapter and swapping the ends. It was simple and took a second to understand (I am not technical).Another great option is to go to Playosmo.com to watch video and suggestions for games, setup issues, questions involving games, etc. This seems to be a really helpful feature, considering the total cost paid for the product.The Tangrem program has Easy, Medium and Hard applications to select from. Since my daughter is 5 years old, we were working with the Easy and Medium applications, but this allows for her to grow with the program, which is a nice feature. The program gives directions and provides confirmation when she was able to match the mirror image to the screen. She was able to work, free of our attention, for almost 30 minutes, exploring the different animal shapes and construction of the pieces.As far as the numbers and words games, we still need to explore those and I will update my review once we have had a chance to try these out.
