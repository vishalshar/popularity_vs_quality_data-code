I have been using this product for about 1 month now. Setup was easy. I chose to zip tie my magnetic sensors to the top of the chain near the unit. I then hot glued a piece of angle bracket to the top of the garage door unit and placed the other half of the sensor to that. Operation has been flawless so far.. and it immediately picks back up if there are any power/network outages. The only reason I have not given this product a 5 star review is because of the price. I definitely feel this product should be set at a lower price point for what it is.... but.. this is a great product produced by a small innovative company. Kudos to you guys.
