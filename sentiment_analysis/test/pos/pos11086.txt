Overall, I would say this is a pretty good product for the first of its type on the market.  It serves the purpose for which I bought it; I wanted to be able to communicate with my family at home on a video intercom instead of a phone.  The product could use some tweaking, but my initial impression is good.Positives:1. The product arrived one day after it shipped to me.2. Set- up was quite simple.  It took a couple of restarts of the Nucleus, but I had it up and working in about 15 minutes.3. Link to my mobile phone was quick.Negatives:1. Alexa did not work the first day, but yesterday evening it began to work.  The Nucleus does not support all of the Alexa features, but I was not expecting Alexa to be incorporated at all, so this is not a deal breaker for me.2. Picture quality is a bit dark.  I can see, but I expected something similar to the quality of my Canary security camera.3. The Nucleus cannot communicate with a mobile phone unless the app is open on the mobile phone.  Who would keep this app open to be ready for a call??  I was a bit surprised by this since most current apps can work in the background with the app closed.  This issue is a bigger problem for me than the first two negatives I list.  I'm hoping for a software update to correct this.As I state above, I am generally happy with this.  I have high hopes for later versions and app updates!
