Where has this been all my life. I am one of those who just left the remaining cheese in the original plastic wrap. It would dry out or spoil before I used the remainder and ended up throwing it away. This paper, made in France, does the job perfectly. The cheese stays fresh and tasty and with the enclosed labels I know what I have remaining.Buy and use this paper as fast as you can if you love cheese.
