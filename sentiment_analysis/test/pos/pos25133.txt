I purchased this ninty eight dlr case for my iPhone 6 (4.7") device.  I originally had a Spigen case (a good case) on it, but wanted greater drop protection, a magenetic/mechanical holder, as well as an aluminum frame.  I have the 128Gb device, so I wanted to protect my investment.After opening the box, I found the TPU case, the aluminum frame, a carrying strap, wiping cloth and the instructions. The aluminum frame covered less of the phone than I expected, but the TPU inner case was thicker and nicer than expected.  The outer aluminum frame popped right onto the TPU case.  ...and it add very little extra weight to the device.  When you begin to snap it on, it should first be fitted to the side of the case with volume up/down, and then onto the side with the pwr button.I'm trying the case with the carrying leash, because many times I have my hands full of things, along with my phone (I should just put it in my pocket), and that's the time when I can easily drop the phone on the floor.  The leash connects to the aluminum outer case.I was also concerned that the case would be extra thick-huge, like Otter Box, but it is still slender and fits easily into my pocket, even with the hand leash.  Rockform has their TPU plastic formula perfected, because it doesn't slip easily on flat smooth surfaces, but it also doesn't catch the sides of your clothes when pocketing it.Other reviewers are complaining about the difficulty in pressing either side pwr/volume buttons.  It is an issue, but probably will be fixed in the next production phase, for now, I will improvise with an insert between the device and the TPU case.  For those of you who can't press firmly, don't consider this case.I also own a business in the gourmet dessert industry (crumblescookies.com), so it works well for me to stick the phone to a piece of equipment while I manage production, so it stays out of the way, and what a better way to do it than with a powerful magnet built into the case.  Of course, the magnet will have to go once these devices upgrade to a new iOS with NFC technology in mid 2015.The TPU case conducts heat well, so that the iPhone will not over heat, especially when it's being used for an extended time frame with a program(s) that pulls a lot of device resources.  The aluminum outer frame also collects the heat, and disburses it.For the price, I was hoping that it would come with a screen protector (minus 1 star).  This case protects everything except the screen, so maybe their next production run will have them included.**** UPDATE *****I just received a free iPhone 6 replacement case from Rockform, because their first generation case was SO difficult to operate the volume up/down and power buttons.  The new case works like a charm, no problem pressing ANY of the buttons!  Thank you Rockform, you have awesome customer service.  I'm one happy customer.
