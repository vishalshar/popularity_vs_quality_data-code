Luma has made a world of a difference! The speeds that will blow you away! I have had one intermittent problem, which I waited several hours for it correct itself, but in the end I had to restart all the nodes for things to get back to normal. Haven't had the issue since recent update. I am looking forward to more future robust and granular software features.Customer service is a breeze and extremely responsive! Keep it going Luma!
