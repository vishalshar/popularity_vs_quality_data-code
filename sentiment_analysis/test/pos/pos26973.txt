After trying everything, literally dozens of products ranging from cortizone cream, anti-fungals,  powders, and prescriptions from my physician, I finally found Metaderm Cream.  I had had eczema around my belt line for months, and the itch was maddening. After a couple of day/night applications of Metaderm, the itch subsided, and soon thereafter went away completely. After about a month or six weeks, the skin redness had begun to diminish, and after five months, it was gone. No other product except Metaderm worked. Obviously, I'm delighted, and will be a lifelong Metaderm customer (it's also great for preventing small scaly patches on either side of my nose and at my eyebrows). Also a big "Thank You" to Metaderm Customer Support for  promptly and thoroughly answering several questions along the way. Terrific product, terrific people!
