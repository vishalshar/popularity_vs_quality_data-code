I got this case for my sister as her graduation gift and she loves it.The case is very well made and feels like a luxury item. Very easy to carry around and take prints of your favorite pictures on the go. The photo quality is better than most other competitors. The photos are editable and you add frames,filters, stickers to your photos before you take a printout. This makes you to have more control of what you are printing and get the perfect photo you want, unlike other instant photo printer where it prints every photo you take.But all that just 50% of what this has to offer, the best feature of this is the video feature. This is actually pure awesomness. It gives you a option to record a small 5 second video every time you want to print a photo from the phone, you can record the current moment of the picture or any personal message you want to add to that picture and it will stored with the picture you take printout off. After the photo comes out you can actually scan the photo and the video is played exactly on the picture frame. It feels as if the photo is moving, like seeing a video on photo. This truly is an awesome feature to have and widely used with every photo u print.I cant be more happy with this case and I highly recommend this product.
