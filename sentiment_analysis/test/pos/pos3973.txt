With so many options, these chia bars are a great snack, nutritious, crunchy, filling and tasty. I purchased 3 flavors for my family and gave everybody the opportunity to decide which flavor they like the most. Acai berry seems to be at the top of the list, followed by coconut and chocolate. Curiously, chocolate isn't as tasty as you may think, so you may want to keep that on mind but please judge yourself.All the ingredients are clearly marked except "natural flavors" and that is a problem. Most Americans will never realize or know what really is behind "natural flavors". Here something about it. Feel free to Google "is msg a natural flavor".The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations describes a "natural flavorant" as:The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or any other edible portions of a plant, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose primary function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional.Within this definition and among hundreds of others substances is MSG, aspartame and are all considered "natural flavors" and "natural colors".I have contacted the vendor to request their list of natural flavors; I'll post that information once I get it. I just hope they have not added MSG or aspartame, they last anyone should do is to feed their kids any of this highly toxic substances.
