This device was worth the money. It does everything I need and could do more then I use it for. The battery life is insane. I am taking a few college classes and can unplug it from the charger before my first class in the morning, use it for homework all day long, forget to plug it in before bed and still use it for a large portion of the next day.I have built several computers and love Asus products. In particular the uefi/bios Asus has designed for their motherboards and the router login page options. Asus is leading the industry in innovation in these areas and more. I was disappointed when I opened the bios on this device and found something other then an Asus motherboard had been installed in it. It has very basic and limited options (if any at all) in its bios.It is quiet and the boot up time is extremely fast. The screen resolution is great and I have used its HDMI port to connect to my television and watch movies and this also is enjoyable to watch.At first the position of the touch pad and buttons was frustrating. A few inches to the right would have been perfect but after a few weeks I don't even think about it. Everything about the keyboard is perfect to me. And I never run into the problem of hitting the touch pad while I am typing which perhaps is why it is located the way it is, and why I didn't feel the need to take a star away for it.Again, this device works smoothly and does everything I need. I would buy it again.
