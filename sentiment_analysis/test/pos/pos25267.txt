I bought this for my husband for Christmas. If you get it from their site, you can get the set and have the recipient send out for the plankton when they're ready. As for me, I got it off of amazon and had to give it to him immediately. He thinks it's the neatest thing ever. He just got it today, and they are lighting up when I swish them around! The handbook says it can take a few days before they start to glow. I'm totally amazed at this! My husband likes it so much, that he's getting one for his friend.
