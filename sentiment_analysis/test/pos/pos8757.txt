I am a former college athlete and current physical therapist who owns her own clinic and has started offering this product.  I love it!  I think it's a brilliantly simple and beautifully executed idea.  There are a lot of situations I can think of where you would like to shower but can't.  Or, maybe you don't want to for a 2nd or 3rd time that day (after you already showered that morning but did a pool workout, practice, and then a weight workout, like I often did in college).  My patients have given me nothing but positive feedback.  Its a great size and holds up well.  I expect nothing but success for this product.
