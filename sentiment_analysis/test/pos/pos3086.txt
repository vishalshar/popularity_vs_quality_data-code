Bought these to replace a three month pair of turtle beach headphones that literally fell apart within months. The  lucidsound headset is a quality headset with some great features and the build quality is way above the more expensive turtle beach headsets, wish I had bought these instead of the second pair of turtle beach thinking that my 14 year old son was just abusing them and things break. One feature that my son likes is that you don't need to plug in the boom mic, the built in mic works well and has good quality sound.
