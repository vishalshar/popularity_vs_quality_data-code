I had them all: a fondue maker, a culinary torch, a bread machine - all the expensive kitchen gadgets that people rave about, but that eventually end up collecting dust. My advice is that before you spend $200 on another toy and get in the mode of comparing the features of all the immersion circulators on the market, you should figure out if sous vide cooking is right for you.My experience is pretty simple. I always found cooking stressful, messy, and hit-and-miss. Since our family has a fairly busy life, we have long settled on frozen foods, takeout, snacks, and maybe an occasional pancake, spaghetti, or scrambled eggs. Our adventure with sous vide is a desperate attempt to undo this mess. I'm only getting started, but here's what appeals to me so far:1) You can experiment easily. Cut 8 small pieces of chicken breast, season each one of them differently, plop them into separate bags, and then come back an hour later to compare the results; voila, a week of painstaking trial-and-error done in one afternoon! (For the same reason, sous vide also makes it easy to cater to different tastes when preparing a single meal.)2) It keeps things simple. Since you can combine multiple steps into one - say, marinating, seasoning, and cooking - you will find most of the recipes to be surprisingly simple, especially for the results they produce.3) It keeps things tidy. When you're done, the kitchen (usually) doesn't look like a battlefield, and you don't end up with a heaping pile of dirty pots and pans. The bulk of the mess is contained in a sealed bag, which you then simply throw out. The smells (say, broccoli, cauliflower, onions) are controlled far better than with an open pot, too. The disposable plastic is a tad wasteful, but you save a ton of water, detergent, paper towels, etc.4) You don't need to spend your day in the kitchen. While it still takes 1-3 hours to prepare dinner, you usually need to be there only for 5-15 minutes. Beyond that, you don't have to worry about something overcooking, spilling out, or catching fire.5) Since the sous vide cooking process is fairly slow and extremely predictable, it takes much less mental effort to make sure that everything is ready to serve at the same time - and you're much less likely to have the entire dinner ruined by a single mishap.As to what can be cooked using this technique: search for "Anova recipes" on Google for a great online recipe book. In short, if you like poultry, fish, red meat, or baked or fried veggies (including potatoes), you will have plenty of cool recipes to play with. For desserts, you can try puddings, poached fruit, cremes, muffins, cheesecakes, flan, pumpkin bread, and several other things. The circulator is less useful if your dietary habits revolve mostly around pasta, simple salads, or rice.Now, as for the Sansaire: it's the cheapest, highest-rated immersion circulator currently available on Amazon. It does not have some of the bizarre features available on competing units (e.g., wifi), but I'm at loss as to why that stuff would be useful, since the only parameter you are setting is the temperature. With Sansaire, you just turn the silver knob near the top to set the temperature, and the always-on LED display shows you where you stand. The knob itself is a bit of a letdown - it feels cheaper and more clunky than the rest of the device. But otherwise, the unit performs admirably; it heats up quickly, holds the temperature extremely well, and just does what it's supposed to. It's very quiet and easy to clean, too.Other than this unit, you don't need much; you can use any large cooking pot, although it may be more convenient to grab this Rubbermaid container and a matching lid. Some folks also throw in an Ikea dish rack to hold the bags in one place. Don't fall for pricey "sous vide kits" that cost several times more.Much of the cooking can be done in freezer bags, with air removed using a simple submersion technique explained in the manual for Sansaire. That said, a vacuum sealer makes this task easier, and has quite a few other applications around the house. For cheap units, check out FoodSaver V2244. For a premium option, consider Weston PRO-1100.
