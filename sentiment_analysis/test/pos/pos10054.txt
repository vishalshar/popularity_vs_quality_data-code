I applied this to my ear buds & charger cords (several brands) and so far no broken wires. Even though I was careful to not bend the wire where it plugs into phone/ipad, it would happen sometimes- & this makes it harder to bend/break. But: I didn't find it to be very grippy on flat surfaces (as they show it to be used that way in examples: it fell off when I applied it to my (clean surface) tv remote...). It works as feet, but not super grippy, more like smooth plastic.
