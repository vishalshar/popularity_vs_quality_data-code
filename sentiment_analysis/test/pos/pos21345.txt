~~Robo review after 3 months of use and abuse~~Having come from building a prusia i3, which if you arent familiar is a DIY kit where they give you a link to poorly translated instructions that are inadequate at explaining what to do and that you will need a workshop full of tools to put it together and a careful eye whenever you will be constantly dropping any one tiny part on the ground, i can say with what i paid for it in both time and money i could have bought 3 robo's.Now if you are thinking about cheaping out on a prusia or its ilk, the key differences between them is that the bed of the robo does not level. This is a good thing, the prusia bed leveling is not only infuriating it is self defeating. Think about it, the bed's levelness is the core of what makes this type of 3d printer work, if your beds levelness is dependent on springloaded screws held in by a nut, and the bed is constantly jerking back and forth, what happens? The nuts come loose constantly unleveling the bed and the whole thing falls apart. There is no solution to this short of getting it level and gluing the nuts in place. Locknuts dont work, double nuts dont work, is a shoddy design.The robo however gives you the bed level enough but fixed in place. Well this can be a problem depending on the size of object you want to print. For my robo the front left corner happens to slump, so large base prints will fail when the printhead drops loose filament onto the bed, or runs into other parts of the bed, there is no happy medium.There are solutions to this however. I use PETG since it has all the good properties of the other common filaments without any of the bad properties, the only exception being that PETG cant be solvent smoothed since it doesnt react to anything. This has been my experiences with various print surfaces with PETG:* PEI sheet - You can print PETG cold with this, its flexible and not all that accurate with thickness, but if you are patient enough you can level it using double sided sticky tape. The caveat with this is that if you print anything larger than a cookies width it will pull the print bed up. If you try to use heat to prevent the print from shrinking as it cools then the double sided sticky tape melt off the bed. If you use that heavy duty 3m double sided sticky sheets then you will be unable to level the bed.* Zebra plate - Its accurate to +/- 0.4mm, thats about two layers in height, this is problematic when getting that first layer to stick is everything. Also during a normal print cycle the head will heat up then it will level xyz, z leveling involves pushing the print head into the buildplate, for the zebra the head will melt right into it.* MIC6 aluminum tooling plate - This stuff is super flat, its about as flat of a material as you are going to find without going into some expensive scientific grade materials. It also doesnt melt or ding easily when the head hits it. However its smooth aluminum, nothing will stick to it. I use blue tape @ 75c to get petg to stick to it, with a bit of double sided sticky tape at that droopy corner my robo now creates flawless prints. Only caveat to using this plate is that it takes 10-20 minutes to heat up and cool down, and ITS EDGES ARE RAZOR SHARP. Seriously i cut my hands up quite a few times before i learned to handle this with gloves on.----Other things about the robo:* Its hexagon hotend is junk. It works for a few prints and when it jams its done for, you can try drilling it out but disassembling it is impossible, the crappy hex screws that hold each part together come binded and will strip immediately. Go with the winner here and get an e3dv6, just dont get it from the amazon seller on here, he tried to screw me when their cheap thermistor fried in the first few days of using it and used some sleazy tactics to try to get out of replacing it. Get a metal stud thermistor from printedsolid (dotcom) and save yourself the headache of a tedious exercise. You will have to remove the fan shroud that sits over the hexagon to install any other hotend. Its also kinda tricky the first time to figure out how to remove the hotend. Look for help on the robo3d forum, theres guides on there.* You will need to print some belt tensioners (tighteners) for the x axis, it needs to be tight, like a guitar string.* Print a top down spool holder, there is a good one on thingiverse designed for the robo, this will take care of alot of issues from having the spool anywhere else.* The auto-bedleveling feature doesnt actually level the bed. What it will do is take z-axis measurements along certain points (defined in firmware), then it will adjust the z-axis leadscrews so that the x-axis is balanced. This will still produce shoddy results if you bed is irregular. Ideally it should create a map of the bed itself and adjust the print to account, this would resolve all issues arising from unlevel beds but this has yet to be developed by the marlin firmware team.* The robo comes with alot of loud fans, one of them is the cheap PSU that underneath the robo. You can get a quality 350w meanwell psu that uses temp controlled fans. The intake fan underneath it that cools the circuitboard is loud, replace that one. After you remove the fanshroud and replace the hotend fan with the one that comes with the e3d the robo will be 80% quieter.* Other reviewers are correct about the actual buildspace, heated bed is only 213x213 but rest of it is 220x245, you can get a bigger heater, there are silicone ones that are 300mm which is overkill and will probably require a 24v PSU to power. This is probably why they didnt put a bigger one on there.* It does have a SD card slot, if you run it from SD card you can remove the USB, but if you plug the USB back in it will kill the print.* I had to call customer service about the hexagon, it took a few days to hear back and they said they dont replace the hotend but i explained that i just bought the damn thing a week ago and they OK'd it anyways.* The robo3d forum has been helpful at times, at other times its better to figure out for yourself.-----I was surprised at the professionality of the product on unboxing considering that this started as a kickstarter, where most 3d printers end up unrealized. For what you get $800 is a steal, all printers use the same reprap 213x213 heating plate so build sizes across various price points will be <= the robo, any claim to larger is basically cold printed space that no filament will accommodate unless you are doing a bunch of small simultaneous prints on PEI. There arent really a whole lot of features any printer can lay claim to that would put it ahead of the robo aside from massive buildspace or super high resolution SLA, both which are extremely slow and expensive to operate. As long as robo3d keeps quality control and service up to par i dont see any printer competing.
