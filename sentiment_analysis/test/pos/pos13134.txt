This phone is great for its price, it functions at a fast speed and has great screen resolution. Additionally it has a front and back facing camera and can get all of the Google play store apps, like Snapchat and Instagram. Some issues with it is that it can't send videos over the text messenger, and can't do a lot of the camera functions(slow mo, pano, square) that iPhones can do. Other than that it is a very good phone for its price range.
