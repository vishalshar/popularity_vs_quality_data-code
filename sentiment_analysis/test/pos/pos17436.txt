Pro:*I exercise harder and longer than I would without the VR.*The bike itself is very sturdy and feels solid when riding.*Once you are in your VR helmet, you can switch from VirZoom games to other games while riding even though they don't correspond to the bike. I love doing things in VR Worlds game while pedaling away - London Heist shooting range and Danger Ball are so fun that I can pedal for a long time without realizing I've been working out the whole time.Con:*The VirZoom graphics feel 8 bit compared to the other VR games on Playstation.*The variety of games feels weak.  I only play three of them and kind of enjoy two of them. (That said, they still all make you exercise harder because you want to win or finish the goal at hand.)*It can be a bit glitchy. It may go dark for a few seconds then come back.Bottom Line:As someone who doesn't enjoy exercise, I will easily ride the bike for a half hour a few times a week, and ride it way more intensely than if I were doing a bike at the gym. At the gym, I can't last long because I get bored or I keep thinking about the pain. On the VirZoom I sweat and ride til I can barely breathe. If you need a distraction to exercise, then I highly recommend this.  I just hope the developers take their games to the next level in both graphics and playing sophistication.
