This is a great phone for folks that need a "yes/no" way to interact with their phone.  It has good clarity, big numbers and is easy to use.  Both my mother (with dementia) and my mother-in-law enjoy this phone.  My mother's on her third jitterbug and my mother-in-law is on her third.  All upgrades over time.  Great Product!
