super reflective. pretty much 100% visibility when I wear it at night.I found it cut very tight, especially around the arms, not giving me full range of motion. Also this jacket doesn't breathe at all, so I'm considering ripping up the side seams and sewing in some mesh for breathability.But I'd rather be safe than comfortable, so I'm very glad I purchased this for my nighttime jaunts.
