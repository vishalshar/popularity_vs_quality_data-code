This is a really cool device, although a couple of my friends felt they could make one as well. Could be a fun project. I'm connecting it to a raspberry pi and will probably push script outputs to it.To add to my previous review, I have connected it through IFTTT (If This Then That) to help open up the amount of automation I can do. I'm ordering a second one for work so I can play around with it.
