Overall it's pretty good. Relatively easy to install and get linked up with the app.  The app is just ok. You should be able to send temporary and or permanent keys to friends or family. Instead they have to scan a QR code on your phone while standing in range of the sensor. This sucks for emergencies when you're not home but need someone to get into your house. I did think up a work around though. I took a screen shot of the QR code and texted it to a neighbors phone and then had the person with the app scan the code from the picture on the neighbors phone while standing by the door.  Kind of a pain and if I wasn't an F-ing genius we would have been screwed.  The range on this thing isn't the best either. I bought this because I downgraded to a cheaper car for commuting and it didn't have home link. I also don't have another garage door opener and figure this would also be nice for going for a walk and not having to use a key pad or bring an opener with us.  We're like most everybody else who has an attached garage. We go in and out using the garage and rarely ever use the front door.  Don't et me wrong it totally fulfills a need (convienence) but it can be improved.  The developer should add the ability to send a "key" to friends and family and chose if it's a temp key with an expiration or a permanent key. Also add the ability to restrict keys to certain dates and times for say a cleaning lady or baby sitter. Add a "I'm home feature that puts a geofence on your home so the app knows when you're home and can open the door on your arrival.  Make it to where you can tell if the door is already open or closed.  Developer a wifi version instead of just Bluetooth.
