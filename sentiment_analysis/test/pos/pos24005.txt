As a mom with four kids ages eight and under, when my five year old started having night terrors three times a night I needed a solution! I had seen Lully advertised on Facebook and after two weeks of these night terrors we purchased Lully. It came late one evening but I decided to go ahead and set it up so hopefully he wouldn't have a night terror. I was incredibly surprised that within five minutes I had it up and running. With my little guy tucked in I was cautiously optimistic.  The app is incredibly user-friendly and I greatly appreciate the reminders. The first three nights he was night terror free. We did then go through a rough patch where he was having a night terror imediately after turning Lully off. The app kept adjusting his start time and within three days we were back to quiet nights. He has now been 2 1/2 weeks without a single night terror!!! If you're a parent of a child that has night terrors do not second-guess this purchase. The pain and sadness of watching my little guy crying, pacing his room and terrified something I hope I never have to see again. And I'm pretty sure at this point I can say Lully is going to make that possible!
