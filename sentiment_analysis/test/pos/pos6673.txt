Just got it yesterday, but I can comment on the following:The Bad:- The dimensions for the speakers listed here and on Enclave's site do NOT account for the little rubber feet that come pre-attached to the bottom. I had a very tight fit that I measured before purchasing and panicked a bit when I realized it wouldn't fit. However, the rubber feet were fairly easy to tear off (I used my fingers, but a butter knife would probably make it easier). If you do this you may opt to buy some thinner stick-on furniture pads from to prevent scratching, but the bottom of the center speaker doesn't seem to be particularly scratchy on my wooden console.- The remote control situation sucks. There's no display on the unit itself, so messing with the settings requires running an HDMI cable from the center speaker to the TV and switching your TV's input to see the menus. Normally you can control the volume easily with the remote blindly, but the really stupid thing is that the control system is "stateful", so if you accidentally hit the menu button on the remote, the volume up/down buttons don't work, because they're instead just moving the selection in the menu. So if your remote isn't working, you have to switch the HDMI input and see what the heck is going on with the system.  They have said that they're working on firmware updates and a new version of the remote control, but that doesn't really help now. I purchased a separate universal remote which they say will work better for controlling the device; we'll see!Setup:- was very easy: connect the center speaker to my TV with an optical cable (it didn't come with one, but I had a couple lying around), then plug in each speaker to power. I made use of tiny extension cables to avoid problems with wall-warts blocking other outlets:Â 6-Inch Power Extension Cable, 5-Pack, Outlet Saver, 18 AWG. When I turned the system on it automatically paired with all nearby speakers.- Upgrading the firmware was also very easy, but it didn't come with instructions on how to do it in the box. Basically, you just download the Enclave Audio app to your iOS/Android smartphone, pair your phone with the Enclave Audio system via bluetooth in the app, and click a button to install the update. If you don't have an iOS/Android smartphone, then I'm not sure what you can do...Latency: I haven't experimented much, but latency seems fine. I'm a gamer, so this is important to me, and I'll update the review if I notice any lag.
