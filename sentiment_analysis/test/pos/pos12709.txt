I love these bulbs. This is my second purchase of ilumi outdoor bulbs. We are slowly working our way around replacing every outdoor floodlight (10 in all). This purchase completes the front of our house.I love the amount of control we get beyond the typical off and on. Playing with the color around holidays and special events is simple and easy. Being able to control of the level of light output is really what I like. We live on a hill with a long driveway and about 95% of the time the typical flood light bulbs deliver too much light and probably annoy my neighbors. Because these lights are controlled by two gang switches, a dimmer is not an option for controlling the light output. Sure I turn these up to 100% when we are playing basketball or shoveling snow, but most of the time they are down around 25%. The brightness control is also a handy feature when we entertain. We keep the light low so people aren't squinting during the party, and turn it up when people start to leave so they can get to their cars safely.Another big selling point to me is the security of these devices. As hacking is becoming a bigger issue when it comes to home automation and the IoT, these bulbs will stand up because they use Bluetooth to communicate, not WiFi. That means no one trolling the Internet with malicious intent is going to find your ilumi bulbs accessible if they happen to hack into your internet connection because they arenÂ’t connected to your home network. Let's face it, do you really want one more thing connected to your wireless router?If you are thinking these bulbs are expensive, they really are not compared to other options. I got a quote from an electrician to have a switch installed in our 2nd floor bedroom that would allow me to shut off the outdoor lights when I forget to turn them off before getting into bed. One switch to control the lights just on the front of our house was going to cost over $800 to install. In addition, the lifetime savings in my electric bill and longer bulb life will more than offset the cost of these bulbs.Plus, I am a Michigan State grad living in Colorado next to a University of Michigan grad and there is nothing I like more than changing my lights to Green and White after a win.
