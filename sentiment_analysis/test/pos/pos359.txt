I have been using the Leesa mattress for about two weeks now and I have to say it's one of the most comfortable mattresses I have ever slept on. I am a side sleeper so I was a bit worried by some comments that the mattress is too hard but that's not the case at all. It is actually a good balance between soft and sturdy so it has been really great as a side sleeper. Fully recommend.
