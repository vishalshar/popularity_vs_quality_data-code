This is the first activity + sleep tracker that I've used, and I'm pleased with it so far. It's extremely stylish, like a modern piece of jewelry. I ended up swapping the wristband for the white Equator band and love the way that looks.The packaging was sleek and felt like a luxury brand. For that reason alone, it would make a very nice gift. The set up was simple, assuming you followed the instructions of removing the device from the band, placing on charger, and letting it fully charge before you attempt to pair. I was in a rush so tried to skip taking the wrist band off, therefore it was taking an extra long time to fully charge. Just follow the instructions.The features are basic. There are two improvements I'd like to see:1. Time - some way to tell what time it is. If I'm out for a run, I need to know what time it is so I can make it home in time to relieve the babysitter! I find I have to wear my Timex Marathon watch on one wrist and the Amazfit on the other. Would like to only wear Amazfit.2. Naps don't seem to register in sleep tracking. The algorithm seems to only monitor sleep during a "typical" night. If you wake up in the really early morning hours, e.g., 4:30, then return to bed even an hour later, it won't measure the next round of sleep.All in all, I'm pleased with the style and function and wear it daily.
