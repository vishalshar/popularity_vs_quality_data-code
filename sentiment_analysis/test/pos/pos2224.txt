This is a beautiful product and functions well. I have the 12 zone version totally customized for my front and back yard. Allowing me to upload a photo of each area of my yard that a zone supports is a very nice touch... I originally purchased in June 2015, but the device lost power on November 2016. I thought that I was out the original $200 that I spent for this unit because it was purchased over a year ago; however, I was super relieved when Hunter at Blossom notified me that there is a 2YR warranty and that he would immediately ship out a replacement. That makes me very happy. The Blossom is a very cool product for those that love both gadgets and gardening and I'm glad that Blossom stands by their product.
