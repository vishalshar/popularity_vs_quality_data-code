Purchased the phone through Amazon.  The phone was still under warranty when it stopped working.  Contacted POSH directly and they were very helpful in resolving the problem.  I explained to them that you could no longer hear incoming calls and that I had purchased the phone to use overseas while working.  The rep was on it and agreed to replace the phone.  Great customer service
