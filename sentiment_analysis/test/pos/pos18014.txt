This is a super sturdy pump that fits perfectly on the 1 pint Ball mason jars. This is for the regular mouth jars, not the wide mouth. I use these to make dealing with huge bottles of shampoo easier. I just prdered another one so I can use it for conditioner. This is a very well made pump that will not dent or rust like the metal ones. I wish they would also make these for wide mouth jars and in more colors.
