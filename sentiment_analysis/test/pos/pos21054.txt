I was a little hesitant to pay the higher price for these spoons, but decided to give them a try because I am trying to buy products not made in China.  As it turns out, I really do like them.  They are fairly lightweight but feel nicely balanced in the hand.  We can get fairly hearty spoonfuls in with less mess.  At first, the design felt a little chunky or off somehow, but, after using them for a short while, the efforts in the design become clear.  The edges of the spoons are so gentle and smooth on the little ones' mouths.  I do wish I would have come across them earlier.  I am going to recommend these spoons to new parents I know.
