Used it yesterday for a quick 3 mile run around Rice University while on vacation.  The information captured after the run is instrumental in the growth and development of my running technique.  Information such as cadence, range of motion, and impact will allow me to improve my running form and prevent injury.  My iPhone and Apple watch does not capture this information so I recommend the Moov for any fitness enthusiast.
