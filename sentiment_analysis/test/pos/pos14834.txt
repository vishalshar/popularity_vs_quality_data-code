Works very well and completely worth it. I have an adventurous dog and an invisible fence.  Most of the time the fence does the job. However, he is highly prey driven and will occasionally chase something through the fence line. He then enjoys a walk about.  He has done this once since we purchased the whistle.It notified us right away that he was out. We turned on tracking and were able to find him very quickly.We have not had any battery or connection issues. He is always wearing it and is outside often. The battery in our experience has lasted about 7-9 days between recharges.Exactly what we needed for out dog and glad to have it.
