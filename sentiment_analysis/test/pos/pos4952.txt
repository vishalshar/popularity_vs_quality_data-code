This is a first gen. robotic cat toy that my rat terrier loves. Yea I know its a cat toy, it's all over the box but, my little ratter can't read. He barks and, pounces, grabs and, paws at it. Wore himself out playing with it. So far it seems no worse for the wear. He carried it over to his doggie bed and has pinned it down in place. I would love to see a real doggie robotic mouse, I think some fur and a tail might give it more appeal perhaps some sound effects. barking at it again gotta go, thank guys good job !
