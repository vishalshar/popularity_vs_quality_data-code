There is one week since I have it and it really makes it part by monitoring the sleep and tracking steps. It is not heavy and I have a thin wrist. The app is super easy to use intuitive the only part that I couldn't find just by navigating the app is the part when you can set the wake up alarm which is on the band item and not on the sleep item which seem more logic, but besides that it is awesome. I read that for some customers the manual sync may be an issue but I don't see it like that you sync in the morning when you wake up to get your sleeping evaluation and then you sync a couple of time during the day and then before sleeping no burden at all. really for the price is excellent.
