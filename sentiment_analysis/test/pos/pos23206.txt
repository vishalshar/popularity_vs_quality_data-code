I'm a back sleeper and prefer a somewhat firmer mattress, so that's my point of reference.  I like this mattress far better than any previous mattress I've owned, despite it costing a decent bit less.  It is pretty firm, but that's a selling point to me.  It seems to offer quite good support across the entirety of my body - no sense of getting swallowed that some memory foam options seem to have.  There is no sense of disturbance from someone else moving around in the bed (unless they keep kicking you and have no respect for personal space...) which is great.  Overall, really love the mattress.Just wish it didn't way literally 100lbs - it can be challenging to move about
