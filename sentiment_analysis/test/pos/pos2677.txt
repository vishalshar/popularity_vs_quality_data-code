We have treid all the flavors and this berry spinach is the only one my kids will eat and I like it a lot too, I can eat the other flavors but I don't like like them enough to buy them again.  I'm on my second box from Amazon now but had been buying them at the local grocery store on and off over the past 6 months or so till they raised the price to 1.49 each.  I used them in the kids' cold school lunches and during the summer I used them while travelling to add some vegetables to everyone's diet on days when I know we might be short a little.  I ilke that we get half a serving of fruit and half a servng of vegetables (1/4 cupof each) in each leather, and each one has only 15 calories and 2 grams of sugar and one whole gram of fiber.  The ingredients are great too having only apples, spinach, strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and sweet potato, and all organic too.  No fruit juice concentrate here!  No "natural flavors" either.  I watched the documentary called Sugar Coated and one of the doctors they featured did a bit where he took a very popular strawberry fruit snack in Canada and put out on a plate one serving then next to that a pile of granulated sugar equal to the grams of sugar in the fruit snack and then next to that a bowl of  1.14 pounds of strawberries which was what one would have to eat to equal the sugar in the fruit snack.  By this method these Mountain Berry Spinach fruit leathers pass the muster equalling about 2 medium strawberries.  Finally something I can feel good about putting into my kids' lunches.  One word of warning though, I have had the misfirtune to end up with some slightly old and hence tough or downright hard Veggie-Go's from the supermarket, guess at their prices they can sit around a little too long.  This has not been an issue with the ones I have gotten on Amazon thankfully.
