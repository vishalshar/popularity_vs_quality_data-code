I travel frequently on business and started using Thrive Natural Shave Oil based on TSA regulations. I LOVE how this small bottle provides me with 50 shaves on the road. Makes the razor blade glide and my skin feeling smooth without any irritation. Also noticed that my razor blade seems to last longer so this could save you a few $$$. I also like THRIVE's eco sensibility.
