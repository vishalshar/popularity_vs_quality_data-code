So awesome! My computer is fine except for the memory issue, so this is a godsend! My advice for anyone installing is to take the extra few minutes to do step 4, I skipped that and spent another 30-60 minutes getting it working on it because of it. Had to call support today and Mu was awesome!!! Was as efficient as you can get for a tech support call. He had me up and going in about 15 minutes. So excited to not have to worry about that "your startup disk is full" error for a good long while. Yay!
