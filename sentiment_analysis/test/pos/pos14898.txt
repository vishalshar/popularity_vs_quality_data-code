Of all the Solid Gold recipes I have tried, this one seems to be the favorite, which is odd as this is a low-fat recipe.  My cats prefer canned food but this stuff they actually approach and eat.  This is crunchy stuff, with no added colors.  The only place I can get this stuff is via Amazon for now.  This causes no diarrhea, vomiting or other side effects.I've now bought several bags of this stuff.  It's been a lightning deal several times since my initial trial.
