In researching crib sheets I was unsure which ones to buy. I came across these in a Baby Bargains book that I was reading. Parents were raving about how awesome they were. Searched Amazon and read tons of reviews. My friends said not to buy them because they were expensive and they said they were worthless. They told me that it was not a big deal to change the sheet from the crib mattress so why buy them? I am happy to say that they were WRONG.As a first time mom, I did not realize how heavy a crib mattress is. We ordered ours on Amazon and when it came in the mail, I could not lift it. At all. It was super heavy. At that point I was happy that the crib sheets were in the mail. Once they arrived and went to put the bottom sheet on. What a headache. The mattress was so heavy and here I am, 5"1' trying to get this darn cover on. Once it was on, I placed a Carter's Flat Mattress Pad on top and then zipped up a sheet. OMG! So easy! Struggling with the bottom did not even matter, because frankly I have not touched the bottom since I put it on the bed. My daughter never touches it and it never gets wet or dirty because the mattress pad blocks everything. I cannot even imagine being up at 3 am trying to lift that mattress to change an actual sheet. The few times that I have needed to change a sheet in the middle of the night was a blessing because it took me seconds to unzip and re-zip with a new sheet.My friends have been complaining about their 1 year olds wetting the bed and drooling and having to lift the mattress to change sheets. I keep telling them to invest because these sheets are the BEST! I am so thankful that I bought them. I bought the sheet set in ecru and then a white sheet and a pink sheet (the sheet set comes with an ecru sheet and the bottom). Three sheets have been just fine for our daughter. I do wash her clothes once a week, so maybe that is why 3 is fine. If you wash less often maybe purchase more. She is three months old now and rarely makes a mess on the sheet.As a new mom this is an incredible product. When you are up at 3 am with no sleep and you realize that your beautiful baby has just crapped through their outfit and now you have to change the sheets with a husband that is sound asleep and a baby that is screaming, you will rejoice in the fact that all you have to do is zip off the dirty sheet and zip on a new sheet. Totally worth the money!
