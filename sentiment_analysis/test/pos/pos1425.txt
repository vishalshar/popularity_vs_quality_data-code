I don't take the time to write many reviews but I couldn't resist with this gem.  I have been wearing the Spire for a week and it is really remarkable how it can tell when I am focused, calm or tense.  It has been very helpful in my mindfulness practice.  I am hoping that there will be more features added such as being able to tell if I am calm, focused or tense while I am active. Also, I read a review in which someone mentioned that it was uncomfortable and pinched them.  I have not found this to be the case at all.  In fact, I often forget I am wearing it.UPDATE 4/15/15:  Downgraded to a 4.  Charged Spire overnight and now will not connect to iphone.  Seems to be causing a drain on my phone as well while it is constantly trying to connect.  I emailed tech support this morning but have not heard from them at all.  I know they say they will reply within 24 hours but I would really like to get this solved sooner!
