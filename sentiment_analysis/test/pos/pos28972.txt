So I've used this twice and I like it, my face does feel a little dry but not enough to put lotion on my face. It feels a lot cleaner, my face also feels a little lightened if that makes sense? Like it's brighter? Probably just me, but definitely like this stuff. It's not very big, but that's okay just means I need to limit my use.UPDATE: Still have the same bar seven months later, and it's the best my face and bacne has really improved. Cannot live without it. I have to use lotion because you still get a little dried out, not a big issue. It's finally almost done little bit longer maybe a month or two left in it!
