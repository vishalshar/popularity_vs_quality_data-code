Have never had a laptop with more performance in every way than this one. This is better than the UX model and the same price. Better GPU and twice the hdd size. To clarify the memory addition confusion, there is a spare memory slot underneath a piece of aluminum on the underside of the motherboard. I added a single 16GB chip which brings then laptop up to 24GB of memory. To put that into perspective, an average high performance SQL server has about 64GB which is 10x the size and weighs 50x more. Plus this is DDR4, the newest memory technology which blows the DDR3 memory away in raw throughput. Do not buy those more expensive laptops, pretty sure mine would crush a $2500 macbook pro.
