My son asked for a robot for Christmas. We decided on MIP and we are glad we did. My son loves this toy and it's very easy to set up and use even for a small child. We connected him to my 6 year old's Kindle and there are many fun things he likes to do with him. He especially likes the different moods he can give him. I would say the only con is that it is not rechargeable. It runs on batteries and you must use a screwdriver to open the battery compartment. If you play a lot, this can be annoying, but I made sure to buy those long lasting lithium batteries, so we don't need to replace often and that worked out great
