With a baby on the way - and being a bit of a sucker for smart device data - we decided to pick up one of the Withings Thermo Smart Thermometers.Setup was extremely easy. Download the app, link my account (I had one previously from a Withings Smart Scale), and link the detected device. It all went extremely smoothly.I added in my wife to my profile to be able to assign readings. It turns out my wife was already sick and running a fever the day it showed up, so we were able to compare readings (which they say not to do) and get a feel for the difference between this and a standard oral thermometer.To make the rest of this concise, I believe it's a useful device when used to track differences in recorded temperatures over time. Take several readings, and find your (and your families) normal temperature. Take several readings each time to make sure you're getting an accurate and repeatable reading. Lastly, don't outright get rid of your oral thermometer - if your reading is high, double check it with an oral thermometerI don't regret my purchase, but I'm trying to take t for what it is - a nice tool to take quick readings without having to wake a child or wait forever to get an initial reading.
