I can finally run without my ear buds falling out!  I use them with my new amazon buds and they work great! You can use them with Apple, and any other of the ROUND type buds.  I can barely feel them in, but they stay in for my entire run and at the gym.  I've tried a few different "exercise" specific buds and nothing has worked as good as these
