8/11/16 UPDATE::So I'm about to order my second jar and have some more insight. The complaints that it turns their armpits red is true. This did happen to me and lasted about a week and then went away, so I'm totally fine with this temporary side effect. I first got the jar on June 17th and I've got about a week left of use so one $10 jar lasted me 2 months!! This stuff rocks and I'm ordering one for my stepmom who complains that she has to use regular deodorant because no natural deodorants have worked for her!ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW::I have tried probably 9 brands/types of natural deodorants. Maybe more than that, but all the most famous brands, most talked about, most reviewed, I've tried them all and NONE of them worked. They would smell great for the first couple hours and would stop working around noon. This primal pit paste in Jasmine is the ONLY one that literally works. I mean I smell my armpits like every hour because I'm so impressed. I don't even smell the NEXT morning, it literally lasts 24 hours at least. The jasmine scent DOES fade after a couple hours, but even with no scent to mask a body odor smell, there is NO body odor.I am forever converted and won't be looking back. My search is finally over.
