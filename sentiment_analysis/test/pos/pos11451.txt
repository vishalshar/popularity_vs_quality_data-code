Really great product.  I can't believe how simple it was to set-up and to use.  After having used it for four rounds of golf, I'm starting to see a couple of areas of my game that I can focus on the significantly bring my scores down.Initial set up is easy.  All you do is attach the sensors to the grips of your clubs,and install the free Arccos Gold app on your phone.  After the app is installed, you go in the app and designate which sensors are attached to which clubs.  It only takes a few minutes.The BEST thing about the system is that you really don't have to do anything with it other than keep your phone in your pocket when you play.  So, once you start a round, keep the phone in your pocket and it will keep up with your score, track which clubs you hit and how far and where you hit them.  You can pull the phone out of your pocket to use the GPS for distance to green or distance to targets.  The GPS has been very accurate with my range finder.In a round, if you hit two balls from the same spot, the system only records one of them and treats the other as a mulligan.  During the round or after you can edit your score to add penalties, gimme puts etc that might not be scored automatically by the Arccos app. I've found the scoring to be so accurate that I hardly ever pull the phone out of my pocket except to check a yardage every now and then.The only shortcoming with the system is that it has no means of keeping up with your partners' scores.  None of my playing buddies yet have Arccos so the data and scoring is only useful for me.
