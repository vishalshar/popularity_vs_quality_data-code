The Subaru Forester's mirrors are inset and surrounded by plastic, which makes them difficult to clean with the snow-brush's ice scraper.  These Mirror Mittz work well to protect those mirrors from ice and frost.  Apparently they were popular, so out of stock for awhile in winter, but once arrived, worked well.  Generously sized on the Subaru.  Would also work well if car mirrors are affected by dense pollen, or sticky droppings from fruit trees or birds.  Recommended.
