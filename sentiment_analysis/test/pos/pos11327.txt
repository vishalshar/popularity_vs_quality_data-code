***EDITED*** So I just want to make note and edit my original review. While I am still unhappy with the color, my daughter honestly didn't even notice. She loved it regardless. I think we as parents put a little too much pressure on making them happy when they'd really be happy regardless. The case has worked really well in protecting the ipad so far. She has dropped a couple times and there has been no damage. It's been easy to put on and off the ipad...which has caused some issues because my daughter likes to take it off. The silicone material does act as like a magnet for dust and dirt a little bit. But it wipes off. All in all I am happy with my purchase.Definitely not pink at all. The colors do not even come close to what's on the screen. So disappointed. ? its more of a purple color.
