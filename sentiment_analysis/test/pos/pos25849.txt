I bought this building set as a gift for a friend and was thrilled with the response.  The whole family played with it with gusto, adding a variety of things from their recycling bin: toilet paper rolls, paper towel tubes, peat pots, etc., and their college student son even used it to model a sculpture project!  It reminds me of the classic Bauhaus building block set - the individual pieces are sturdy cardboard in wonderful bright colors, well finished, and in a variety of shapes that stand on their own or serve as infrastructure and connectors for the construction pieces you add yourself.  As various projects took shape the influence of gravity and physics became clear - definitely both creative AND educational!
