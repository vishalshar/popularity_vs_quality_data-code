This is a good product to conceal some bald spots or places where your hair is really thin . It applies easy and blends good-make sure you choose the right color for you. The only complaint i have-is that doesn't last for very long. it is not waterproof either,so beware if you sweat or god forbid is raining outside-it can transform into messy muddy look. The best way that works for me is -i apply it on the particular parts,blend well for a natural look and use it occasionally(only because i don't like to have product in my hair for more than a day),also choose days without humidity or rainy daysOverall it is a decent product, i do recommend it ,just wish it was waterproof :). I received this item at discount price for my honest review.
