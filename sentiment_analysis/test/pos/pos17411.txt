These are working. Finally.Christmas morning was a little rough.  These worked - and then they didn't - and then they did.  And I'm not sure why.I was (very) easily able to download the app to my new iPhone 6S and connect to one car and drive it around the living room (carpet) and dining room (wood).  Then later, my kinds downloaded the app to their iPad Minis and within 10 minutes they had put them away because the app kept crashing. I tried for 20 minutes or more to get it to work properly, disabling WiFi, closing other apps, disconnecting all other Bluetooth accessories, etc.  Then they finally worked fine (with WiFi and other Bluetooth accessories back on). So, they work now and the boys like them (they're still trying to figure out exactly how they work - playing two players or against the AI - but that's part of the fun!).They work on carpet and hardwood, but definitely better on smoother surfaces.
