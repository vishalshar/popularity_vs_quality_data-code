Feeding 3 active sport dogs can be interesting at times. This food is even helping to put weight on a very hard keeper that was way too thin when we got her 2 months ago, shes slowly filling out (on 6 cups a day lol) I cant even imagine how much she'd have to eat on less nutrient dense foods. The other 2 are eating half what Badb does & holding great weights, good coat & skin, not too bad on tear stains (AM Bulldogs...) & good stools that are easy to clean up.
