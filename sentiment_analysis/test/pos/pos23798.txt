Our therapist recommended we buy these cards for our in-home ABA (Applied Behvioral Analysis) program.  I think they are WAY over priced at $150.00 and was glad to find them a little cheaper on Amazon.com.  As long as you don't let your child play with the cards, they hold up pretty well for therapy sessions.  We use them every day and we have two children with autism so it's been worth the investment. I give these cards 5 stars for function and 2 stars for price.
