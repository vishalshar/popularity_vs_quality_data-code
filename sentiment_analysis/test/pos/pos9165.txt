I am a minecraft addict and my mother had no idea what to get me for Christmas. She found this while searching "minecraft". She bought it not knowing what it was. I, on the other hand, saw this when it came out and had been wanting it for a long time. It is great! You can program whatever you want to show up on screen. I have redstone, time, mc sword and my YouTube name flash across it. It also has my backup worlds on it. It comes with a few popular YouTubers worlds on it, but I haven't used them. They are quite a bit outdated.  All in all I LOVE this device!  I usually wear a medium size watch/bracelet. The large fits well.
