Was told by my vet that an immunity supplement would help with my dogs joints and overall health. She has had a couple of cancerous tumors removed when she was younger and since switching her diet and starting her on the Superfood Immunity supplements.... so far so good! She's happier and healthier at 6 than she was when she was a young pup.
