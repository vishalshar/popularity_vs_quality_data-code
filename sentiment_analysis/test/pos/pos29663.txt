After my MacBook Pro crapped out on me for the third time, I decided to give up on it and give something else a shot. I was looking for a personal computer to work on some writing projects and surf the web, but I also wanted something that met the recommended specs for some games I play casually such as The Sims 4. I went back and forth between this computer and a couple of others, similar models from Dell and Lenovo, finally choosing the ASUS because of the price, the graphics card, and the look of the brushed metal finish.I am so happy with my ultimate decision.The processor is lightning fast, my games look fantastic, and I'm loving Windows 10. (I have never been a huge Microsoft fan, but they may have won me over with this one. If it weren't so devoid of apps, I might even get a Windows phone.) I haven't had any problems with the computer itself and I am impressed with how well it works. Transitioning from a MacBook has been a very smooth experience, and after using the ASUS for a month or so, I'd even say I like it better than my old Apple computer. And that's saying a lot!The computer looks and feels so high quality. The top and the palm rest areas are a nice brushed metal and the bottom is made of black plastic, but even that feels nice. Though it's a strictly personal computer for me, it would be perfect for someone on the market for a classy-looking laptop they can play games on and then easily take along with them to a professional setting. You'll be proud of this one -- it seriously looks great.Overall, this was an excellent purchase and I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for something in this price range. You won't be disappointed. It's probably the best laptop I've ever owned.
