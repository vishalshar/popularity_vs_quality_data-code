5 stars because it is very rugged, almost military type rugged. Did not really work for my application, which was from a port on my motorcycle to the phone mount because the loop is very rigid and only able to flex into a certain radius. Put too much stress on my iphone. But, that is not an issue with the device, it is very well made and I would recommend it to anyone, just something to be aware of.
