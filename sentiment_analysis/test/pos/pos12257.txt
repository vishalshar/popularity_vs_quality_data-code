This was money well spent! We are having a blast with this item! Our Cavalier King Charles loves to play fetch. She mastered this in 2 sessions and is so entertained by it that we have to get her to take a break! Her brother likes to run after her.  We bought a soft sponge with a handle that's used to clean glasses to clean the chute. With all the doggie slobber and grass, it tends to get soiled. I dampen it and wring it out and use it to clean the machine. It takes 2 seconds after every playtime. I would highly recommend this so it wont collect bacteria. Remember to also have some fun interactive playtime with your furbuddy too.
