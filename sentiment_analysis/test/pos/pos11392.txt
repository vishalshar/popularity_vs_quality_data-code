This is everything that I was looking for in a docking station for my devices.  it's heavy so that it doesn't want to come up off the counter or table when you're removing your device. It's stylish and easy on the eyes.  The only real criticism is that for two devices it requires two cables that again require two electrical outlets and USB to outlet adapters in order to function as intended. I ended up having to buy another cord for external battery charging (when I'm on the go) and a surge protector so that I could use the wall outlet for other appliances.  It would be great if someone would come up with a dual lightning to single outlet adapter for this device.  If the two cords could be manufactured as part of the docking station that would be even better.  Then you'd have only one cord going from docking station to outlet.  Anyway, well worth the price for its attractiveness and functionality.  I'm buying another one for the bedroom!!
