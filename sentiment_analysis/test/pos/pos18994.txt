Fantastic product.  Sound is much better than anticipated.  I find myself using by audio system much more than I have in years.  Only downside is range of the connection but this is a bluetooth issue.  I have tried wifi solutions before like airplay with slightly noticeable improvement in sound warmth and depth but was plagued by drop outs.  If you want to stream apple music or another music app from a phone or tablet, this is the way to go.
