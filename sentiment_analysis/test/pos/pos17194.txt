Although the device isn't totally perfect, given its innovation and features I have to give it 5 stars.Some background - although I have T-Mobile which provides unlimited international data, it's 2G which is good enough for texting and (slow) emails. Web surfing is nearly unusable.I was traveling to Singapore and China, and wanted to use local SIM cards, but didn't want the hassle of having to fumble with my phone or burn it's battery in hotspot mode.Enter the G2.While you do get "virtual SIM" features where you can buy packages, handy in a pinch when you don't have a local SIM, the true value is in having 2 SIM card slots for local cards.For example, in Singapore, they sell at the airport a 4GB "tourist" SIM which gives some talk time and data. The card was already activated, and just by inserting it in the G2, turning it on and selecting the appropriate SIM card slot it just worked. Simple. Same for a Hong Kong/China SIM. I tested and set it up at home in the US before traveling and the virtual SIM worked fine.Note for mainland China you want to do all your surfing through a VPN as China blocks Facebook and Google.The device also has a long battery life and acts as a battery bank, which I haven't used yet. It runs Android and is simple to navigate through the touch screen.The only minor, and it's truly minor, negative is that some of the prompts are more like machine translation of English so a little refinement here would be helpful. However, as a technology device it works really well. Recommended.
