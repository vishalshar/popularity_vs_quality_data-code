This is the activity tracker watch to have!  I had done a ton of research prior to purchasing this Withings Steel and it was worth it.  Prior I had a misfit in a watchband and in the end I wore that and a watch... pretty silly.  German makes a lot of good products, but not a watch like this.  My son-in-law has the apple smartwatch and i asked him, "What do you do with it most?" and he said he looks at it to se what time it is.  I like wearing an analog watch and this fits the bill just right, professional and not overly large.  The band is ever so comfortable and now I just leave it on as I shower.  I also appreciate not having to charge it.  That seems like such a pain, I do it for my smartphone, but it is so nice to not even think of for my watch.  As an added bonus, the activity tracker does help me to manage my activity.  I see it all the time and can see my progress.  The ap works fine and as it takes care of syncing by itself, it is another thing i don't have to think about.  I have my watch on in all kinds of rough environments and the crystal doesn't show any scratches.  As can be easily noted from all of this... I am more than pleased with my Withings Activite Steel Watch.
