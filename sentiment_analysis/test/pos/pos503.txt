Great phone holder. Went for the CD slot model so I wouldn't have to block the air vents. No more trying to balance my phone in the cup holder to use navigation apps. Fits my iPhone 6S inside a case with no issue. Phone jiggles a bit on the bumps but that's to be expected. I was worried the adjustable swivel would loosen over time and the phone wouldn't stay at correct angle, but it's been a few months now and absolutely no problems.
