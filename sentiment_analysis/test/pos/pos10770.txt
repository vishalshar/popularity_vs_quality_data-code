Super easy to install and setup. My wife is a developer and I'm an IT Engineer, so we have quite a bit of tech including Microsoft, Android, and Apple devices. It's great to be able to connect to the Oco with all of our devices. The sound & motion detection are particularly impressive - I love that I can get notifications on those triggers! The streaming and camera control is nice as well, it's so easy to control and I was surprised that it even has night vision. Overall - Awesome Camera!!!!!!
