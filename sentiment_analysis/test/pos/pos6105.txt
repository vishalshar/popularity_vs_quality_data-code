Purchased the DayOne Response waterbag to keep in our disaster relief kit. Arrived quickly, and was well packaged. The 10 liter capacity bag comes with a filter and large syringe for backflushing, P&G purification packets, a tool to open the packets, carrying straps, and a strap for hanging a full bag. The excellent instructions are illustrated and easy to follow. Everything is made from appropriate and excellent quality materials and components. We now have everything needed to collect, transport, purify, and store water in the event of an emergency. After carefully checking this item out, I realized how useful it could be in other applications. Am thinking it will make a great gift for hikers and hunters, and could be very useful on a boat. I hope we never have to use it for it's intended purpose, but am comforted by the fact that we have an efficient, high quality water purification system on-hand if it's needed. Highly recommended!
