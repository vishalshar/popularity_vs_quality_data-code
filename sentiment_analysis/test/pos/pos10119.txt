A truly amazing toy that must be seen to be appreciated. What is it? Here we have a robot that a child can learn to program and have fun at the same time. I promise if there was a little video screen in the store showing what can be done with this thing can do it would fly off the shelves faster than they could be produced. This is no exaggeration, probably one of the most amazing toys that I've ever seen. No that's not true. It IS the most amazing toy that I've seen. Sphero is similar in context to Lego Mindstorms, but is far more approachable and ready to use out of the box. Very simple to set it up and use. A small child can take advantage of the basic features very easily, but an older kid can learn programming, game design, and more. This could easily entertain and instruct a college age student or adult. Look for more great things from this company in the future. After I started using this thing and helping my kids get set up with them (we bought two), I immediately looked to buy stock in this company because I think this is going to explode in popularity soon. Unfortunately it's still a private company, so I couldn't buy their stock, though it is well-funded by venture capital including Disney and Hasbro, who were very wise to invest in the geniuses who conceived and built this produce. An amazing, unlikely and creative toy. It looks simple and fairly silly in the picture, doesn't it? Just a "billiard ball" by outward appearance. Trust me, it's not! This thing is packed with science and advanced technology. Your kid will have fun and learn about robotics at the same time. I would give it ten stars if I could. And no I don't work for the company or have any financial interest in their success, though I wish I did. Here is the toy of the year, probably of the next several years. It's a remote controlled "car." It's a drone. It's a robot (you can program it to do things autonomously and even respond to outside inputs). It's a single player game. It's a multiplayer game. It's an "augmented reality" video game (this you have to see to believe - see the "Sharky the Beaver" app on YouTube). It's a programming platform. It's a learning tool. It's a course in computer programming (see the "SPRK Education Program"). It's a course in mechatronics...to close I can only say "WOW!" I want to work for this company! Be a hero to your kid and just buy the thing, I guarantee this is one toy that won't get toss in a corner and forgotten! The guys who invented this thing are the Elon Musk/Tony Starks of the toy industry!
