Simply put, YoCam is the best small action camera on the market right now! I've been a GoPro fan for many years but their prices for both cameras and accessories just keep increasing, so I saw YoCam as an affordable alternative and boy does it pack a punch! The YoCam's quality is unbelievable and I love that it's waterproof without any additional housing. I bought the small adapter from YoCam's website (it's only around $10) and now my YoCam is compatible with all the GoPro accessories I already own. Very happy I gave YoCam a try!
