I am addicted to these apple chips. The cinnamon ones are my favorite.  I ate them the whole time I did Weight Watchers and now that I'm at my goal, I keep eating them and I've kept the weight off for a year.  They are a great snack when you need something crunchy.  The cinnamon blends with the apple to give you just enough sweetness to satisfy you.  I crave them so much that I often have to get a second order during the month.  I wish they sold the larger bags.  I can't get enough of these.
