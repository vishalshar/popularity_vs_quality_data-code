We went from a night terror every night to maybe 2 nights a week without night terrors.  The severity of the night terrors may have slightly improved.  This is after around 5 weeks of constant use.My daughter always wants to stay up forever which means I have to stay up forever plus 20 minutes.As we have had some improvement I am going to stick with it and hope she will show even more improvement.UPDATE:  after another week of using this we finally had the results we were looking for and she stopped having night terrors.  We stopped using it after that and we were night terror free for 3 months or so.  Then they crept back into our nightly routine.  We are now starting round 2 of using Lully.
