I literally cannot function without espresso, I need to drink three or four every day otherwise I'm grumpy. A year ago I got the Minipresso GR for Christmas. It's been with me around the Oregon coast, Grand Canyon, Koh Phangan, Yosemite... always making great espresso with loads of delicious crema, comparable to what my Krups machine at home makes. The MiniPresso broke after six months, so I bought another. The second one also broke after six months, so I decided to try the competing HandPresso instead.It's a bit more expensive than this product, and on paper the HandPresso sounds like it should be better -- 16 bars pressure versus I think 6 bar on the trusty Minipresso, plus you can tamp coffee for the Handpresso whereas you can't tamp with the Minipresso. It also looks a little fancier, although when using it you look like you're working out with a ShakeWeight, if you catch my drift.After a few uses, I returned the HandPresso. The coffee it makes just wasn't up to my standards. To me, it's like a strong filter coffee, or something from a French press, and it never produced much crema. Like going to a backwater tea-house and asking for an espresso, and you get a sort of thin, slightly bitter giant cup of dark brown water with bubbles on top, versus going to a downtown coffeeshop where every time you get a tiny, intense shot of smooth black tar topped with shining golden crema.Whilst it breaks far too often (and the US importer is unresponsive to its warranty obligations), I still recommend this product instead of the HandPresso, if you're trying to choose between the two.
