We looked everywhere to find a large, non-toxic, non-slip playmat that was all one piece for easy cleaning and not a total eyesore for our living room.  There's not a lot out there that meets all those criteria, but this one does. We've had it about a month now and we love it.  Comfortable for us and for our little one, easy to clean, and we like the design. No complaints at all, fantastic product.
