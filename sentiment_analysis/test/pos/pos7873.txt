I love these socks! They feel great, look great, and the quality is top notch. I was surprised by how much I liked them. I'm used to buying inexpensive socks that come in 6 packs at a big box store. Galiva socks cost more, but I feel that they are easily worth their price.Galiva socks are made from pre-shrunk cotton which is very soft. The knit has a lot of stretch, making them easy to wear. I was surprised by the thickness and the fine terry loop weave on the inside. I have attached a picture of the inside of the sock, after one washing.A band is woven under and around the arch area of the foot. It's not strong enough for support, but it helps keep the socks in place. It feels very comfortable. The under side of the toe area has the brand GALIVA in a slightly non-skid material.I received the large size, which fits sizes 9 and up. They have some wiggle room on my feet, but still fit okay. I thought they might shrink a little after washing, but they didn't! They are made from pre-shrunk cotton, and they really mean it! My big box socks shrink quickly and the ankles wear out. There is a very noticeable difference in the quality.I just purchased a few more pair because my old socks feel uncomfortable after wearing these. I ordered medium size, white, and hope they feel as good as these. I would absolutely recommend these socks.
