These are great tire monitors for motorcycle riders. The app sends alerts to your phone if the tire pressure is too low or too high. I wear a bluetooth headphone, so the alerts notify me right thru my headset. Without a doubt best air pressure monitors out there.** Only downside, is you need to keep your location setting on for the app to work. It drains my battery on my phone pretty quickly, and sometimes I forget to turn the app on or turn the location setting off when I'm done. If they can modify the app, its a sure 5 star.
