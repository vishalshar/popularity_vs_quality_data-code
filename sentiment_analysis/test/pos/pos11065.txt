This thing is AMAZING!! Great for shooting large groups without standing a football field away from the group!! Love this thing, plus the ergonomics and feel in the hand is comfortable. I think for the next gen version, another tripod mount hole in the portrait position and add-on strap mounts would be great, but for what i use it for, its outstanding, so good I bought another one as a gift!!
