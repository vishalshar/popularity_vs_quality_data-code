Perfect for home made salad dressing or marinade. Am sure there are plenty of other uses you could use it for, but these are my 2 favorite.  On weekends I sometimes make pancakes for 2 of us, and this is perfect size. I prepare the mix the night before and am ready to cook them after the bacon is done. Works very well.
