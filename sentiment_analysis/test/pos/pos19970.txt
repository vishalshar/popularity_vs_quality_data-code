So I bought my fly trap in early September when the heat and flies were driving me nuts here in san diego. I installed it in my trash can, I'm handy so i have all the tools. It's not hard but you do need the right size bit for the hole, then it just snaps right in basically. I put it in and frankly forgot about it, I also forgot about the flies because apparently it works great! I just took the fly cartridge off  to check and replace it since I haven't thought about since i put it in. I was disgusted by how many flies were in it, which is why I did not notice them in the house because they were dead in there. I am not sure how long it's been that way I will try to change it more often. But this thing lives up to claims and it is way better than the sticky hanging paper, I'm over 6 foot and so i always run into those.If you hate flies fruit, regular house, or any other kind the garbage can trap won't let you down.
