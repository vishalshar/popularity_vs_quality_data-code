I saw these on Americas Test Kitchen, and couldn't resist. Best. Purchase. Ever. We have several large blocks of cheese from Costco that are weeks old and still as perfect as the day they were purchased. Nothing: not foil, plastic, parchment, wax paper--nothing has ever kept cheese in such pristine condition.
