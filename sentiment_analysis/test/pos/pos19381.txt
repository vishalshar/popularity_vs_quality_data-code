It didn't grow for a long time so I gave up on it, then it sprouted a mushroom forest madly overnight one night! Unfortunately it was right before we went on vacation, and everything was dead when we got back. I think these are rather finicky, but fun to play with if you have time, are patient, and try different spots with different amounts of water, sunlight, and temperatures.
