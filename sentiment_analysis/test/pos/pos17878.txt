Product feels well made and looks slick.  Nice to find an item that looks like it was made in the 21st century.  I like the features such as multiple alarm sounds. The ability to control the volume was a huge home run for me and really opens up the number of places I can put this. Programming was a but tricky and did require multiple tries before succeeding. More thorough trouble shooting information would have been helpful.  As on example: The app keep indicating the device required a reboot. I had no idea how to reboot, other than unplugging the item, and I am not clear if that is even correct. Maybe a reboot button or reboot option (ie..hold button for 5 seconds) would make sense. Took me three tries to get the product to install the update. Once it did, it would not connect without a "reboot".  In an arena with few options, this item is top of the class.
