I really like the Rokform case for a few reasons.  Primarily, it is tough, tough, tough.  Yes, it increases the size of your phone, but I'm clumsy and need to protect my phone.I am also a road cyclist and it has a very sturdy bike mount kit; yes it is a bit pricey but you're talking about having to replace an $800 phone if it falls off your bike (without the upgrade discount from your carrier).  The bike mount that I use is the "bicycle phone mount".  They have a newer motorcycle handlebar phone mount which looks like it could easily be used on a bicycle but I have the one which connects to the bike's steer tube.  The bike mount can be adjusted to a number of different angles and it is rock solid.  I was worried that the phone could fall off when I hit a big bump or pothole but I have had no problems.  I ride a road bike but I think it would be equally secure when riding on mountain bike terrain.Finally, I really like the magnet in the back of the case.  I don't like to put a huge suction cup on the windshield of my car to hold a phone; I find them ugly and cumbersome.  The optional magnetic car mounting kit works great.  I get in my car and just pop the phone onto the dash.  I simply have to get the phone near the strong magnet and the phone attaches easily.  The magnet is very small; about the circumference of a nickel so it isn't an eye sore on your dash board.  The phone is easily within reach, easy to attach and detach, no fumbling or distraction of having to take your eye off the road.  Rokform also makes a adhesive dash mount which clicks onto the back of the case but I much prefer the magnet mounting system.I guess I bought the Rokform system rather than just the phone case itself.  Some final thoughts: Rokform also offers different color combinations now so you can personalize the case to suit your own personality.  It has a rubber bumper grip that is quite easy to take on and off.  The case is designed to use be functional with or without the bumper.  Don't want the added bulk or need the added protection?  You can just use the case without the rubber bumper.I hope that helps!
