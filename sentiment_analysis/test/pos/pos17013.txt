This is a fantastic little device.  I have a problem with periodically holding my breath when I'm stressed out, and Spire reminds me not to do that.  I also have a tendency to hold tension in my abdomen, and again, the little buzzes are great to remind me to stop that and relax.  It has been helping me a lot, especially since December/the holiday season is always pretty hectic and stressful for me as a musician and student. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to take control over their breathing in order to live a healthier life, while putting forth minimal effort. I've found yoga and meditation helpful in the past, but I don't have time for it right now, and Spire has helped me achieve almost the same results.
