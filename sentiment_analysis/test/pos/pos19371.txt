I heard on NPR radio audition about stimulating brain by 9v battery. I found this  very interesting and I started my research  but did not find anything available except home made kits. Then a few months later I heard on the same radio station about thync. Two days later I had it. Let me tell you I love that think. It took some practice to get this to work but it it is amazing. I remember talking with my parent on Skype and falling in sleep. I said I call you back in 10 min. After 10 min. They asked me if I took something because I wouldn't shut up. Fist time I used Bliss mode I was amazed I felt like I had glass of scotch. Notice when drinking a lot of coffee and drinking alcohol will minimize effect of thync but you can easily replace old habits with thync.
