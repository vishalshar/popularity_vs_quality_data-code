This is a nice small version of the product.  I love the invisble fence that we have, but I re-did my yard so I had to run a new fence wire and it changed the location of where the dogs could go.  The 'retraining' of them to the new border has been challenging.  I ended up returning this and getting the stubborn dog version.This one worked fine, but my one dog still did not pay attention to it.  So, give it a try, this is certainly the cheaper location to purchase the product from.  It was significantly more expensive in the local retail stores.
