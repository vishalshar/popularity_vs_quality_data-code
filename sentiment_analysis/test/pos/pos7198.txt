Wow, these products are brilliant.  I have the following:PHONE CASE: as a phone case it isn't the sexiest, but it looks like some products and the locking mechanism on the back of the phone doesn't protrude too badly.  Given the function/utility of the case, and the fact that you'll never need to remove it in order to mount it to your bike, car, or arm, is a phone case that I'm very content with.  It slides easily in and out of my pocket, is easy to grip, and gets the job done.BIKE MOUNT: the way the phone mounts to the bike mount device is great.  The raincoat thing isn't the nicest.  Mine came a little warped on the bottom and in any event, isn't the easiest thing to get on an off of the phone.  It'd be nice if it were more flexible/rubbery.  The way that the mount is attached to the bike is also a little strange.  You use (included) rubber bands and zip ties.  It mounts fairly securely, but could have been more intellegently done.  I've had similar products that had rubber liners that went between the mount on the bike, and a circular screwing decide that allowed a super tight and secure connection.  This one is just OK in regards to how the mount is attached to the bike.  But in the end, the most important category is how the phone is attached to the mount, and in that department this thing gets an A+CAR MOUNT: This is by FAR the best car mount I've ever owed and I've probably had a dozen of them.  For one thing, the phone can be snapped in using only your peripheral vision.  So while this may not be ideal, it's possible to mount your phone onto this thing while you're driving without taking your eyes off the road.  Second, when the phone isn't attached, the mounting device is minimally obtrusive.  Many other mounts obstruct an area the size of a smartphone even when the phone isn't attached.  This one, if mounted behind your rearview mirror, only blocks an area about the size of a quarter directly below your rearview.ARMBAND: Very comfortable, good flexible fit, and secure phone connection.  Just about perfect.  What more can I say?The products are brilliant in how they work together.  If you want a series of mounts that work well together and a phone case that you'll never have to remove, this is a great system.  That said, if you don't plan on using multiple mounts, I'm not sure I'd get these.  For example, if I only cared about having a car mount, you could probably find much sleeker and sexier phone cases that'd be compatible with other acceptable car mounts.  The value I get in these is the fact that I use the car, bike, and armband mounts, and they all work in the same way.
