Take a bit of getting used to but great idea.Cons: they slip around on the ear bud so you have to constantly realign/adjust them. Easy to pop off and lose if not paying attention. I can't get them to seat completely flat or into my ear well enough so I lose a lot of the limited volume on my little pocket radio. Still considering an over the ear model.Pros: cute. I got pink, pretty color. Not easily broken or ripped considering how thin the plastic is (or whatever it's made of). Comfortable. Does stay in well once seated.
