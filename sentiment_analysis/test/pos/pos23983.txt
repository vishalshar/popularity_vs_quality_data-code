Long time user of Tagg products.  Whistle has gotten lot of negative feedback for its recent software update.  For tracking dogs the software is fine.  I only use these products to track my hunting dogs and for that it does a great job.  I like it better than the Garmin Astro products.  I did get some false e-mail updates - tracker is out of home zone type thing but I don't need that and turned it off.
