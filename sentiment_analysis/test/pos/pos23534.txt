After seeing the rave reviews this product received, and the ingenious placement of putting the mount in the CD slot, I ordered it immediately.  However, I failed to realize that due to the placement of my radio's volume/power control (dead center and directly underneath the CD tray) that this wasn't going to work.  I went to the company's website to leave feedback and in the product description I realized that I could also use this in any dashboard grooves!  Seeing this, I went back to my car and wedged in the groove between the A/C vents and center console. This solution worked perfectly!  I'm extremely happy with my purchase decision; it really does seem like there isn't a setup that this won't work for.
