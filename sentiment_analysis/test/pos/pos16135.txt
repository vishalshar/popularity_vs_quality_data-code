This thing is pretty cool, and keeps getting cooler.  The dev team behind it is quite active, adding functionality often.  It takes a bit to get used to, and there are still some quirks, but almost everything is configurable through a simple GUI, so you don't need a dev background to put limiters on The Force.  My amputee friends from the military love that this technology is being developed on a more commercial basis, and hope that use of such devices will not remain a novelty, but become mainstream.  I have to admit, I'm almost to the point in Outlook where reading my email with this thing is faster than my keyboard.  Which means it's almost ready for mainstream.  I think the price tag is worth it, and I think the configurability from the GUI allows anyone to really love this thing within a few minutes of putting it on.  I have to say, it was a cool reaction I got in my first meeting where I made a fist and a blue pointer showed up on the wall screen to underscore the service flow I was trying to demonstrate.  I was wearing a long-sleeved shirt, so everyone was looking for a device attached to my computer, and couldn't.  It was great.
