When I bought my Elchim 2001 blow dryer the store told me that Elchim did not make diffusers.  They sold me what they said was a "universal" diffuser that would "definitely" fit the Elchim.  It did not.  It kept flying off.  So much for brick and mortar stores.  A little honesty would have been appreciated, as in, "sorry Elchim makes them but we do not carry them."  This diffuser is just perfect.  I can now blow dry my curly hair without frizzing up or blowing out the curls.  The fit is very snug.  My recommendation is that whenever you are putting on or removing the diffuser from the blow dryer do it when the blow dryer is warm from use.  Same thing if you have snapped the two parts of the diffuser together and want to pull them apart  - do it when the diffuser is warm from use.Could this be any better?  Yes, it could come with a genie who would blow dry/diffuse my hair for me whenever I needed it.  Other than that, it is perfect.
