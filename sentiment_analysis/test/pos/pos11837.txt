I was looking at RAM Mount no-drill stand but didn't want to spend too much, beside their base unit design would not fit for my seat. Then I came across Mobotron and thought I'd give it a try after reading a lot of positive reviews plus I was more comfortable with their price compares to Ram Mount's price. I'm glad I made the right choice. At first, I ordered MS-426 not knowing there was another model MS-526 for van. MS-426 was a bit shorter for my van so I replaced with MS-526. The base unit fits perfectly to my under-seat bolt. It took less than 15 minutes to set it up. I'm now using it for my daily work and loving it.
