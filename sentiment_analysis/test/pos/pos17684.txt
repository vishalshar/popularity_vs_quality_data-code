These gummy vitamins taste great and have everything I need to fulfill my nutritional goals. When it comes to supplements, I only look for two things: how is it to consume? and does it have all the nutrients I am looking for?These multivitamin gummies easily pass both tests. They taste sweet, but not too sweet, and you don't even need to eat them with food. I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a high-quality multivitamin.
