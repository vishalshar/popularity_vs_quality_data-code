I am really loving my ShotBox and definitely think that it is worth the $$$.  I am a card maker and have struggled for years in taking photos of what I make, I even made a box myself which kind of half way worked but I could never get the lighting correct.  Finally I said "enough is enough" and wow what a difference, wish I had got a ShotBox years ago.  As an aside I'm retired and make cards to send to my family and friends, I am not a professional "anything", it was very easy to assemble.
