Bellabeat LEAF Health Tracker/Smart Jewelry, White Ash/SilverI have been using Fitbit fitness trackers for about 3 years now, but I was intrigued by the Bellabeat LEAF. The LEAF seemed like a much more female-friendly, holistic wellness product and I was excited to test it out. Overall, the LEAF and app did not disappoint, they were stylish, user-friendly, functional, and useful products that helped in my wellness journey. I would recommend this to any woman who would like an alternative to the wristband style trackers, and who doesn't do extreme physical activity.Pros:(1) Inactivity Alarm: I have a sedentary job, and I appreciated the reminder to get up and walk around after a few hours of sitting. The vibrations were a little jolting at first (and loud), but it created added incentive for me to prioritize activity throughout the day.(2) Battery: I loved the fact that the battery life is 6 months. Other trackers on the market last 3-5 days max, but with the LEAF's longer battery life I didn't need to remember to charge at night or worry that I wouldn't capture some activity(3) Style: The wood look is very natural and compliments most outfits(4) Reproductive Health: I liked the focus on holistic health. The period tracking came in handy for me to plan out my week and understand my moods/energy levels betterCons:(1) Size: I found the tracker itself - albeit stylish - to be a bit larger than expected. I found it uncomfortably large to put on my wrist or between my bra straps. Due to the size, I often wore it on the waist of my pants, but the clipper didn't seem that strong so it often fell off (twice into the toilet, but it survived!). The size also made it difficult to wear during long or intense workouts.(2) Functionality: I would have liked the LEAF to track heart rate or temperature to link to my overall calorie count and reproductive health. Other products on the market track heart rate at least which I find helpful for more intense physical activity.(3) Syncing: I would have liked the app to sync my steps automatically vs. manually. It was not difficult to sync (double-click the LEAF), but I found the extra step to be frustrating, especially with prompts to accept or refine the data (e.g. "is this accurate?"). The sleep sync seems glitchy as well; for example, my app reads that I got 42 hours and 39 min of sleep on a single day.Overall, I look forward to the next iteration!
