I bought this for my husband who commutes rain or shine or snow.... Year round. I've always worried about visibility of him on the toad, this jacket seemed the perfect solution.While he is extremly, visible the jacket is cut in a interesting fashion so that the sleeves are not as long as he normally wears in a medium. But the rest of the jacket is true to size. But when he reaches out for his handle bars to ride there is just not enough length or give. When we laid down his well worn  Showers Pass jacket on top of this one we found that the cut of the sleeves is very different.It's so difficult to know how something will fit in amazon so for this product you should go to a store to try it on then find a display bike and reach for the handle bars. And make sure you can reach them comfortly.
