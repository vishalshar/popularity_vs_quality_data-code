If you have a smart house - this will make it smarter. Inexpensive and easy to set up. You control everything from your PC or/and app. Your 'circle of friends' are for whoever you want to add - your control completely. If there are any problems or questions - the customer service is quick and knowledgeable. They are a top notch company with a top shelf product. I am highly recommending this to my friends and family.
