This dog food is fantastic. I buy the Lil' Boss type for my Pomeranian.My dog was getting sick eating the brands commonly found in grocery stores, so I searched the internet for good dog food for small breeds, and came across the Solid Gold name several times. It's a little pricier than other brands, but it's worth the money - my dog is happy and healthy!
