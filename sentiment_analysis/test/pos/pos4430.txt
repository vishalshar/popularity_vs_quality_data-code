Just got mine and I had to get it setup.  I did the update, claimed it or connected it to the cloud, Linked LIFX in the Alexa app, then enabled the skill in Alexa.  I now have total control from my phone, my Echo and my DOT.  I can easily tell it to turn on or off.  It's a little more to change brightness by a % or change the color but it is so cool just to say it and it happens without getting up and finding my phone.  The family thought the echo alone was cool, this year they get to witness all the light and garage door control.
