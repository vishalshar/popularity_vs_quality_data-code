I have thought about getting Myo for a while. I finally decided to order, and it arrived less than 24 hours later! It was easy to sync and get started with the Thalmic video tutorials. I have a small arm so I use a couple of the sizing clips that came in the box, and it fits very comfortably. I've just started experimenting with Myo, but so far it is very promising. I can't wait to see more apps developed for my iPhone and iPad. Will keep checking Myo Market for new developments!
