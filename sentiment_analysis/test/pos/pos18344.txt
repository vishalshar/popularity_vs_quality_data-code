My grandson loves this robot.  I bought it for his 7th birthday.  He is still learning new things to do with it. He was effectively playing with it right after I installed the batteries.  You will need a small Phillips screwdriver.  The only issue I had was getting it out of the package.  It took me a solid 30 minutes to get it open using a knife, scissors and lots of muscle and patience.  The robot was well-packaged and arrived in perfect shape.  It was delivered on time.
