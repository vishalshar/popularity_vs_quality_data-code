It takes a while to get the hang of applying this stuff. Less is definitely more. My only dislike is that sometimes the stuff gels in the applicator and you have to stick it to get it to flow. There is also a tad bit of waste because if you only are concealing a major scar, you still don't need a lot. Worth it when you really want to feel more confident.
