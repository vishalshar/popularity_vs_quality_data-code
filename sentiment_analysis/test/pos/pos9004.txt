LOVE this thermometer.  We get excellent cooks on meats every... single... time...The minus-one star is for the app.  There are now many thermometers similar to this on the market, but what sets the Supermechanical apart is the app.  The way I view it is, in that case, that app should really blow it out of the water, otherwise, I could just buy a cheaper thermometer that monitors what I'm cooking without the app.The app uses obnoxious sounds for the alerts (with no way to change, as far as I can find), and is not very intuitive.  For instance, if you launch the app prior to plugging the thermometer into the headphone jack, it requires you to take a tutorial.... every time...  Also, when you set a temperature, whether a preset or your own setting, it doesn't remove the other set temps.  I get why maybe this needs to be in place, but much more often than not, if I am setting a different temp than the one I previously set, it is because I need a new one altogether, not because I'd like two alerts.All in all, I (we, really - husband and I) love this thing.  I would definitely recommend purchasing, just know that the app takes a lot of getting used to.  (note to Supermechanical - let's work on this).
