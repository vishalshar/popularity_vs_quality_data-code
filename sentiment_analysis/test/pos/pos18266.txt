I like the strap design of his headlamp. The front piece gives it extra stability for the larger light. The light can be rotated up or down to illuminate whatever you need and is really bright. You can also twist the light housing to extend the light which focuses the beam. The batteries provided with this are standard 18650's, the same generic ones I've bought and received in other flashlights. They can be charged on a charger (such as a Nitecore Intellicharger) or charged directly in the headlamp using the included charging cord or car charger. This is a nice complete set and was packaged in a plastic storage box.Product provided free for review purposes. Review is my honest opinion.
