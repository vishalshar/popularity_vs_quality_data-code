First SmartWatch. Setup was pretty simple. Several interesting features, for example you can use your watch to ping your phone (make your ringer go off if you have misplaced your phone). Several different watch faces downloaded onto the  watch right off the bat. Surprisingly once your download the app store for the phone,  all additional watch faces can be downloaded for free. The watch came with a charge that lasted maybe two hours. After pulling it off the snazzy charging dock, i noticed the battery was draining alarmingly fast (appox. 15% per hour) but after adjusting a few setings it seems to be doing a little better. Came in a very elegant box. I would recommend this to any tech junkie that isn't willing to break the bank. As well as someone who would like a smart watch but doesnt need all the bells and whistles. Biggeat cons that i have found so far: very limited app store. When using the voice recognition to ask questions it normally gives a google page so word your questions accordingly. Pros: affordable stylish. Send texts and make calls without having to completely stop what you are doing.
