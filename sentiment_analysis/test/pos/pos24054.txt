I have been wanting Profession drone for some time.  Have been on the side line waiting for a company to deliver both a quality product AND customer service.  I.e Apple.  If I am going to spend 1k plus (incl. accessories) I want to know the product is good and the company will be there to support it.  Unfortunately, the industry standard at the time - dji phantom - has horrible customer support.....  Then this little gem comes along....I researched in early Jan-February this year....read reviews...  Called their customer support asked questions.  And waited.  Then more reviews on Amazon popped up...more positive.  Read more 3rd party reviews....read dji forum reviews of the xstar.  Finally made the purchase mid July....It is everything I was hoping it would be....and more.  Best part...say on a Sunday evening After I land...a question comes to my mind..it is 600pm my time.  Guess what?  I can chat with their customer support team....ON A SUNDAY...  Just used it this past weekend at my cottage...flew over the water...was nervous but it handled with surgical precision.Will update this review as I use it more.  Well done Autel!  Keep the CS going at same level as your company  grows..
