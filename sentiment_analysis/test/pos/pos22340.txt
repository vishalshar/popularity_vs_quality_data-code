I received Arccos 360 on Wednesday and put it into play today.  Pairing the irons was easy and total time from screwing the sensors into the top of the clubs, selecting the clubs in my bag on the app and pairing them to my Iphone 6S was 5 minutes or so.When we got to the 1st tee at the course I opened the app, clicked on start round and the course came right up.After hitting my 1st shot I checked to make sure a shot was detected.  It was.  I checked various shots every few holes throughout the round.  Arccos 360 did not miss a shot.  I didn't have any issues with false shots showing up either as I have read about from the 1st version set.  Adding gimme putts is easy and adding the dreaded penalty shot (2 shot penalty) was easy too.Playing with my phone in my front left pocket was a non issue.  I was a little leary of it to start, but after a few holes you are used to it being there and don't even think about it when you swing.A very cool feature I used was the pinpoint GPS.  Press on the screen on which ever hole you are on and a white circle pops up.  Then drag the circle over any point on the hole and get the exact distances to bunkers, hazards, or directly to the pin.  This is a great feature!I'm sure as I play more rounds and build a database with my stats I will see where I need to improve. After this round Arccos told me my driving was the weakest part of my game.  7 out of 14 fairways isn't that bad, is it?  It will be also good to see how far I actually hit each club.  I always thought the driver went 260-270.  Arccos said my average was 252 yards.The social link is also neat.  I found a friend who has the original Arccos version and am now following him and can see his scores and how he played each round.I had a great experience with my 1st round with Arccos 360.  Looking forward to many more rounds and improving my game!Arccos Golf 360 Golf Performance Tracking System
