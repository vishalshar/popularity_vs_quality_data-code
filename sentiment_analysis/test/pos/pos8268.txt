I so wanted this item but too bad they don't ship here in Canada. But that didn't stop me from buying it. I used Stackry's service to help me receive this product. Low and behold after a week of waiting i finally have it! And it is awesome! I'm so excited to try it out on the go, every wall in our house, and especially my bedroom ceiling! I love watching my kdramas (reason why i stumbled on this product saw a competitor brand on "you're all surrounded" but opted for this product instead) on my ipad before i go to bed but it does give me neck strain the next day and this is the solution for it! Now i can just lay in bed while i watch my ceiling :)I usually don't do reviews here on Amazon, in fact, i think this is my first review ever. But im just so happy about this product that it deserves the review.Here are my thoughts:- The projector was in a neat box with cables and accessories-The projector is really bright and HD for something so small(of course you can also adjust the brightness). I also haven't tried the max height of it but it was still looking awesome from one end of the room to the other.-I love how there's a remote for it but wished there was also buttons on the actual cube itself. But then that might ruin the actual design of it.- I was wondering why android or samsung cables were included but no apple cable. I find it unfair that i had to spend $40 for a cable so i can use it on my phone when android/samsung users cables are included. but then again, that might be Apple's fault for selling ridiculous priced cables- i love how it came in with its own clip mount and tripod! usually these extra accessories are to be added on top of the cube itself but thank you RIF6 for including all these! I wish there was a pouch/bag that was included also for safe keeping!- before buying this I wasn't sure if I can charge and watch at the same time. There was a question about it here too, and about 4people said it works while charging while a few reviews mentioned it doesn't. Well, it also doesn't work for me and it mentions that in the manual as well. (That you cannot use it while charging) I noticed the firmware is upgradeable, i'm not sure if it's possible, but if a firmware update can fix that flaw this would be really awesome. Other than that i have nothing else to complain about this tiny powerful cube.I simply love it!
