So far I have taken this for 2 weeks. I have noticed a change and increase in my cervical mucus. I started taking it after ovulation and missed my cycle that was due on Monday. So I am not sure if it's changing my cycle or not. It mixes very well.  I take it in my bottle water or my coffee. I will be ordering at least 1 more month as well as going to the doctor. I will update when There is a change.
