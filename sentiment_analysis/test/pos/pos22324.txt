The iBaby M6S is almost perfect. The device itself is easy to setup, allows you to control everything from your mobile and even access the feed outside of your wifi network (3G/4G/LTE required). I can move the camera with my phone, play music through it, take pictures, record video and do all of the things the typical baby monitor can do and more.The only place I fault it is with the mobile notifications. They seem to be a little flakey. Both my wife and I have accounts/phones that are linked to the camera and notifications seem to go off when they shouldn't, or don't go off when they should. Even after playing with the sensitivity settings. This could be an issue with something we're not doing correctly, however it should be fixable (i'm hoping) via a firmware/software update which you can also do on the device from your mobile.All in all the features are excellent, the video quality is excellent and I'm yet to see anything that comes close to this in the market.
