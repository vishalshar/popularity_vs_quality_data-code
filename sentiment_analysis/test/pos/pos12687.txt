This is the best filament that I have used with my 3D printer.  Awesome strength and very nice matte black look when you get the finished product.  I am printing on a PowerSpec 3D Pro, which is basically a 2nd generation Makerbot.  I set my bed heat to 90c and had found that the best temp to print at was 220c, which is on the high end.  I have basic painters tape on the bed.  I did try a print without heating the bed and it was a disaster - I know that PLA does not require a heated bed.  I used simplify 3D software.  The only downside is that I think it is a bit harder to remove the raft from the bottom with the carbon fiber PLA that with regular PLA.  Still - great job to the guys at Proto-Pasta, this is an amazing product and I have already ordered more.  Do not let the high price scare you away - You get what you pay for!!
