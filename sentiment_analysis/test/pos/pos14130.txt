I'll be honest, some of the reviews worried me as they stated some components did not function. I took a leap of faith and couldn't be happier!! This was a Christmas gift, and it was well received and worked perfectly . The sound is good quality and loud enough to be enjoyed in multiple rooms. The player itself has a solid sturdy feel.
