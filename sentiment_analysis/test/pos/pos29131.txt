A little loud, but it definitely is a pup-favorite! The 20 and 30 feet definitely go the distance, and it gains a lot of air! My 1.5 year old Yorkiepoo loves it! This is the perfect size for her, too. The balls can fit in her mouth, but they're not too small. I think it'll take some time to train her on how to put them into the shoot herself.
