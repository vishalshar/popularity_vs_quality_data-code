I really like this keyboard for my mini iPad 4!!  The best I've seen yet.  I scraped my old one that I bought at the Apple Store as the right shift key was not sensitive enough and the keyboard had a spongy feel to it.This one feels like a real keyboard!!My suggestion is that I would like to see some clips for the side to hold my mini in place horizontally.
