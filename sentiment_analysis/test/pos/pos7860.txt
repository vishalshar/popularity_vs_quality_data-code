Ordered this for my Mom (92). She had the older version of the same phone and we expected this one to work the same. Unfortunately, it did not. Something was haywire with it and it was frustrating to my Mom that is scared of new "gadgets". I contacted Amazon and was able to return it and order a second one that seems to be working like it should. Thanks to Amazon Customer Service!Kudos to Jitterbug customer service also for helping to set up both phones.
