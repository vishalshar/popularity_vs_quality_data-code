This is the 2nd or 3rd like product I have purchased for my Note 4 (and previously, Note 2); the size/weight of my phone(s) have always been a problem for the different models that I've tried, but this one is perfect! The base fits snugly into my vent (Dodge Durango), and it places my phone at the perfect angle, keeping my phone accessible without interfering with my stereo/heat controls.I have a TMP cover on my phone and decided to use both metal plates under the case, on the phone (they provide one for under the case and one for above)  to provide me some flexibility on where the phone is placed.I can't recommend this enough if you have a larger phone!
