This is a sad review (even as I give 5 stars). This is a really great product that is no longer offered (the company has been bought by Fitbit and will not be continued apparently). It is sad as this watch is a great in-between for the people who want a smartwatch that offers more than what fitbit offers (yes, even the more expensive ones), but don't want/need the high-cost watch or various android smartwatches. The watch is extremely functional, reliable, watertight, robust, and comes with many great as well as many quirky watch faces. The health app integrates nicely and provides the information that is needed (and not unnecessary stuff) and so on. Having had the prior (bad) experience of multiple fitbit products (all of them dead about 1 week after the warranty ran out) I was happy to find the Pebble. In fact this was the third Pebble (after the original Pebble and Pebble Time) that I bought ( and all are in active use in my family). I only hope that Fitbit does not only use some of the software features, but also adopts the hardware too (or at least the quality!!!). I also hope that Fitbit did not just by this company to get rid of a  competing product that is clearly much better than anything that they offer at this point. I am somewhat sad to have bought a watch that is now slowly dying due to lack of any further support by Fitbit. Fitbit could really gain significant positive vibes from the few million pebble users by continuing to provide some basic support of this fantastic product and it's features.
