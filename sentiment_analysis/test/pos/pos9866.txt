These are tiny! I suppose I should have known that since it says they are .9 ounces, but without a size comparison I just didn't realize how small they really were. I bought these as a Christmas present for my step-dad since my mom got him a popcorn maker. I still think they are great because they will allow him to decide which ones he likes and which he doesn't without having to spend $50 on the assortment of regular sized ones. Plus- with the ones he doesn't like he won't have to feel bad for throwing out an entire canister of something. The company also threw in a few sample packets of flavors, so I have a little jar and a packet, which was unexpected and I thought was nice (and they were flavors that are probably favorites, like ranch).I will update after we try them all to let you know if they are worth the try, though I expect they will be.Oh- also, the box they came in was awesome. I mean, it was a cardboard box, but it was marked "hassle free" and it really was! Not that that REALLY has anything to do with the product, but just another observation :)
