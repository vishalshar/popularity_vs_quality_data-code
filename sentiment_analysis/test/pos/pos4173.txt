Purpose of PurchasingI play guitar, sing, write my own music and perform (not professionally). There are many event locations where getting AC power is not convenient or the power is unreliable. I think this is great technology that has applications far and wide of the items tested for this review.Full Disclosure: I received a discounted priced unit with the agreement that I would write a review. There were no other stipulations as part of this agreement. My review is my opinion and not swayed by the discount or opinions of ChargeTech. I originally emailed support several times before suggesting the idea of testing and reviewing this product. The communications were and continue to be excellent.For this review, the devices tested exclusively use an external AC->DC Power Supply Unit (PSU) with an AC plug on one end connected to the ChargeTech and the other to an AC->DC converter that plugs into the equipment. Since this covered nearly 95% of every piece of electronic gear I own, it seemed a reasonable approach. Keep in mind that before deciding on what to test, I needed to do the math to determine what I had that could be powered by the PPO AC side.Before receiving the unit, I did a fair amount of research; downloaded specs and the user manual and read-up on the differences between a True Sine Wave (TSW) and a Modified Sine Way (MSW).The AC output of the ChargeTech PPO is a MSW and my initial concerns were that an MSW might cause issues with sensitive electronic gear. Unless the PSU specifically says TSW only AC Input, you have no concerns. All of the gear tested with the ChargeTech PPO for this review, have PSUs supporting MSU AC Power. You should always check for this before plugging it into the PPO or youll likely brick your electronic device and void the PPO warranty.Important NumbersEvery modern Power Supply Unit (PSU) comes with the power ratings on the AC Input and DC Output sides  the numbers are stenciled or embossed on the PSU. Both the AC and DC information is important to understand first before you plug anything into the ChargeTech PPO. You do not want to void the warranty the ChargeTech offers on their devices. There are a lot of conditions to that warranty so it is recommended that you do your homework first.You need to understand how to calculate the Power Demand on the PPO AC side (the one powering your equipment). There is circuitry on the PPO to warn you about plugging something in with too much power demand, but its not going to prevent you from voiding your warranty or bricking devices. These tests did not challenge the overload circuitry as part of this review.[See Attachment]Pros:The 27,000mAh unit is rated at 500 charges. From zero-to-full takes about 2.5 hours. Thats fast to me in 2016. This will degrade some as the batteries lose efficiency. For this review the unit recharged seven times with no measured difference (to the minute). Sleek design. I like the black unit and it looks great with my pedal system It does what it says it does I can perform on battery with all of my pedals for almost six hours.Con: No replacement battery packs. Once they stop holding a charge, you need to purchase a new unit. Perhaps an altered internal design to support plug and play battery replacement would be more palatable to the wider potential customers who presently DIY DC battery supplies.ConclusionIm enjoying the ChargeTech PPO. It certainly has applications for me beyond music too. I travel so having a great battery for the laptop, tablet, and phone are generally what the PPO was designed for, except in this case - it can do a lot more and for longer. I didn't do a review the USB performance because I cant think of anything new to say about USB Power other than it works, and it works well with this PPO. You can charge a lot of USB devices.List of products tested with this 27,000 mAh PPO Antares ATG-1 Floorboard AutoTune System Boss GP10 Guitar Processor iPad 2 iPad 2.1 Kindle Fire 7 TC-Helicon Voice Live 3 TC-Helicon Voice Live 3 Extreme TC-Helicon Play Acoustic HP M1212nf Laser Printer Intel NUC i7 Intel NUC i5 Dell Latitude E7440 Laptop Toshiba Satellite Laptop Linksys AC3200 Tri-Band Router HP1410 Switch Cisco DPC3010 Cable Modem
