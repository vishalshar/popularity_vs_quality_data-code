This digital tape measure far exceeded my expectations. The ability to find the middle of something is extremely useful. As an engineer, I find the ability to change units of measure to and from English/Metric invaluable. I use the ability to read out measurements in decimal format all the time. No more trying to do fractions in my head. The tape measure is very accurate and can be re-zeroed with the push of a button. The memory feature is a plus.
