I chose this shampoo because I was looking for something gentle and unscented. Most products aimed at naturals contain loads of fragrance. Most of the time I don't want to smell like a tropical paradise (or anything, for that matter) or have fragrances that conflict or clash! The rest of my bathing routine was fragrance-free so I tackled what remained: my hair care. This shampoo lathers pretty well for it to be sulfate free. The unscented version smells like bubbles that little kids blow. It was a strange, yet pleasant, experience to not smell anything as my hair came clean. It contains oils that many naturals already swear by. I am tempted to buy the matching conditioner after I finish up my current one. I follow up with a fragrance-free leave-in. At last, my dream of a scent-free hair routine is coming true! The only thing I'd like to see next is an unscented styling pomade.
