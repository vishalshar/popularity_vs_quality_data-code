I'm in love with this little robot. I've read complaints about having to connect to it's WiFi each time you use it. To me it's a good thing. I like knowing that when it's not connected to a device via WiFi there's no way to turn it on to activate the camera. I had a little trouble connecting to another device. To view the Wifi password you have to lift his arm up and down. I hope they continue to improve the features of the app. We've almost unlocked all of his games and tricks and we've only been playing with it since Christmas day. I guess that's where SPK comes into play. We'll be able to spend sometime trying to program it to do more things. Overall it's really fun and it's like having a Wall-E as a pet.
