I wanted a basic thermal camera that would take good IR pics in the dark, while out hiking at night.  The Thermal SEEK works fantastic, and is well worth the money for my purposes.  I have a Samsung Note 4 and it works perfectly with my phone.  The still shots, and video came out excellent!  It has numerous features and seems well made.
