Starting with the packaging, I must say, I am impressed. I felt like I was opening a box holding a product that is worth twice as much. Inside contains the camera (soft touch plastic camera body... feels more premium than plain hard plastic), like a display case, and underneath it, holds the accessories:1 USB wall plug1 USB cable1 Magnetic and locking base for mono/tripod mounting1 Micro SD to SD card adapterThe included 16GB card is pre-installed, and I immediately checked how difficult, or actually, rather easy it is to swap out (to a 64GB), very easy, no sticking, nice little recessed area for depressing your finger and then using that same recessed space to give you a little more grip on the mSD card while taking it out. I spent a good 10 minutes just fiddling with the parts and checking the fit and finish, and I felt there was no faults to be found, the magnetic base made it effortless to attach, and a simple twist locks it in (it covers the micro SD card slot, so there is more than just a press to get it out, but all parts play well together). Okay, enough about the physical appearance, packaging, and design, lets get down to business.-Connectivity, no issues, everything works great, really. I can't think of much to say here. No random drops, no interference, nothing (so far). I wish my mirrorless camera can just connect to the damn app so I can transfer some photos to my phone sometimes...-Sound, I would rate it a good solid step above using a phone, the sound recording is pretty clear if just a bit muffled, and do well recording voice (only thing I tried). Background noise seems well controlled. I haven't tried out manually adjusting gain and left it alone in auto gain and felt it just works, good for helping beginners like me get some audio that isn't all distorted and blown out in situations where the sound level may change drastically. Is it perfect? Uh.. probably not??? But its good and satisfying to know that the mic is constantly adapting to the situation.-Camera, I remember when 4K video recording first came out and there was a huge deal about cropping frames out to use as photos, that was an incredible idea, not sure if it ever took off though... I feel Mevo's concept is very similar, or coincidental, not sure... It is a 4K resolution sensor, that means you have a huge canvas to play with and zoom, pan, crop whatever you want in a huge picture, live. I think 720p is fine, some may disagree, but I am not sure if there is a real advantage here going to 1080p many platform compresses the videos anyway dont they? I wonder if Livestream can release a firmware to allow 1080p recording/streaming and leave it up to the user's digression.Its not a large sensor, and it doesn't perform like one. It performs like a good small sensor. This means it's not design to work well in the low light or dark, if lowlight recording is your goal, you are looking in the wrong place. Most small sensor cameras (including action cameras) in similar price range won't do much better IMO. Maybe Livestream can make some light attachments in the future as accessories?-Battery life... Guys, seriously this thing is a size of half a can of redbull... you don't really expect more than a hour of battery life right? I didn't, but at the same time, I wasn't WOW'ed by it. Keeping things in perspective, I think Livestream did a great job on size/weight and capabilities vs battery life. One can always grab a battery brick (who doesnt own one now a days?) and keep it hooked up for longer streams/recordings.I don't think I've tried everything Mevo camera has to offer yet, but its on to a great start for me. Anyway to wrap things up since I know I went off tangent and kept talking about random things... but this thing makes videos fun and easy! I love the idea of putting the camera in one place and just adjusting framing with your iPhone or iPad. It can make a decent video/stream with minimal effort, and you look like you used some decent rig to make it happen too! But in reality you used a camera that is half the size of a can of redbull and 1/10th the cost of pro gear... to deliver hopefully cool content.I'd like to see Livestream release some light accessories, maybe a lens protector of some kind, and maybe a firmware to try out 1080p if possible?Final Verdict: I would recommend this product since it performs well within expectations if not slightly exceeded.
