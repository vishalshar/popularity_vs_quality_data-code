This product is the best litter system I've ever used.  But you don't have to buy these cardboard cartridges.  Go to e-bay and look for "forever cartridges" there's a guy that makes these out of pvc and you can buy the crystal litter to fill them.  It costs me about 1/2 as opposed to buying the scoop free cartridges.
