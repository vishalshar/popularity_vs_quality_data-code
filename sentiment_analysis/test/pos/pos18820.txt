These things are great.  I did attach the little case to my iPhone and always have them with me.  I also got a pair for my wife.  She is 5'6" tall, 115 lbs.  I'm 6'5" tall, 230 lbs.  They fit both of us perfectly.  The reason I originally bought them is that I wanted glasses to read lying on my side in bed without a conventional stem digging into the side of my head.  They work perfectly and stay put.  Everything about the design and the function of these including the barely there but totally secure case is ingenious.
