The dog likes em and he is pretty picky. He is very picky about his treats, he is 15-16 years old and we have been giving him glucosamine chondroitin for many years, cutting up the tablet, hiding it in cream cheese and according to my vet will give him the same dosage. Our vet did say to make sure to give them the treat according to their weight. These are not "good boy" treats so don't over do it. But my finicky dog that thinks hes a cat loves them. Even though he missing quite a few teeth he can still break it up and eat it without the risk of him swallowing it whole. We had to stop giving him his favorite jerky treats because he could not chew them up. These are soft and can even be broken up by hand so no worries there.
