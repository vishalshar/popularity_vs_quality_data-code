We first saw one of these at a lodge we stayed at while in Oregon.  We decided that a coffee maker like this would be perfect to take with us on our travels because of its size and ability to make a good cup of coffee (something very hard to find with hotel coffee pots).  We were delighted to find it on Amazon.  It has lived up to our expectations.
