For security for an apartment, this can't be beat.Install took about 10 mins for 3 sensors.  I suggest you use a butter knife to pry the cover off the sensor before you stick on the door or window.  Otherwise it's a pain to remove the cover once it's stuck on the door/window.  I used an adapter run a CAT 5 cable from the router to the "stick" so that i could place the "stick" where I wanted.  That way if it's beeping, the burglars can't just find my modem and router easily and unplug the whole setup right away before my cams catch them in action.Sensors work perfectly and I haven't had any false alarms yet.  I use the Kornersafe in conjunction with the Yi Cams and when the cams alert I check to see if Kornersafe did also before I review the footage.  The app itself is easy to use and keeps track of all activity whether it's armed or not.  You can make all adjustments via the app.The only downside is that they cannot change the audible alert on your iphone so when the alert comes in, it just blends in with all the other alerts I get.  I know other apps can tailor their notification sounds (Facebook, Groupme, etc...) so something shrill would be nice so that I know to check it immediately.I love this product and would totally buy it again if I had to.  Thankfully I can just unpeel the sensors and take it with me when I leave the apartment and buy a house.
