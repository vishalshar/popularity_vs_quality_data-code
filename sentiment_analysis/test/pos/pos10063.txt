I ordered one of these Brush Guards and unfortunately it got lost in the mail. When I contacted the company that I never received my order, they quickly sent me a replacement. The shipment came very fast (3-5 days) and I couldn't be happier. As for the product, it does a very good job at keeping my brushes in shape. Before I got this, my brushes had strands sticking out, dents and sometimes the strands would fall out. With this product, I noticed that my brushes were neater, more dense and had little to no fall out. Another thing is that when I wash my brushes, the brush ends up smelling really stingy and fishy from the water drying. Using the Brush Guard helps get out the water more quicker so it won't produce that odor. I just place the water brush into the guard, turn it upside-down so the bristles are facing down and I place it in a cup so all the water will drip without having the brush touch the cup. I highly recommend this.
