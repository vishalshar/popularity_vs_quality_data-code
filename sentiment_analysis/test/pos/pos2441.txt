I buy these gummy vitamins on a regular basis for my daughter.  She isn't super picky, but most kids do not like the taste of fish oil, and who can blame them?  These vitamins are a complete gummy vitamin meaning that they are a multivitamin & omega 3 DHA/EPA fish oil, methylfolate, methyl B12, vitamin D3, These vitamins are not cheap.  The bottle is 120 count but that is only a 30 day supply.  The serving size is 4 gummies per day.  They taste awesome and my daughter looks forward to taking them daily.
