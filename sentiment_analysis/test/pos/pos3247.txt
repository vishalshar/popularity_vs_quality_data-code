Unit is amazing. Features are amazing. Build quality is amazing. I've been a DJ for over 15 years. Started on turntables, then moved to Ableton, then Traktor, then Pioneer CDJ2000 and DJM800, and now the MCX8000. Going against the grain here but like it better than the pro CDJ Pioneer setup. I went to my local Guitar Center to try out all the controllers. I intended to buy a Pioneer controller and tried them all, but this won hands down over their overpriced plastic. This unit wasn't even really on my radar until I tried it. They gave me $190 off list price so I couldn't pass it up. Not only is this unit a great controller for Serato, but it's a standalone unit where you can play from one or two USB flash sticks. Just like if you had two CDJ's and a mixer, but for a fraction of the cost. I've created a mapping for Algorithm DJay pro software as well which allows you to play from Spotify. Hopefully, Algorithm will release a native version for the MCX8000 soon. There is a reason it won DJ Tech Magazine controller of the year and Amazon just listed this as an "Amazon Choice" product.I've seen some complaints about the symmetric mirror design, where the play / cue button is on the inside on both deck controllers but just like if you're using a different mixer at a club, how long does it take you to get used to it? Maybe a minute. The design is beautiful and the buttons and knobs have plenty of space. It just doesn't feel crowded with buttons at all.I believe the updated firmware has fixed any of the early issues when it first came out. Where people were saying it glitched and shutdown on them. I've yet to have any issues.I've yet to dive in to the Engine software for analyzing tracks or setting cue points, but it's super easy to set cue points on the fly. It would be nice if there was better cross functionality between cue points on Denon, Pioneer gear and all DJ software. I guess we can all dream.Can't give enough props to Denon for creating this well thought out, well built, reasonably priced unit.- Poor Ragged Rascal
