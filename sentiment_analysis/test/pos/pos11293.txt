A great experience since we purchased the BP monitor from Blipcare.  We purchased our unit about a year ago for parents who have reached the age they should be taking a reading frequently but won't reliably record the results.  The next visit to the hospital the doctor was able to access previous readings, which was invaluable.After some time we found out from mom and dad that they were not seeing recent readings.  I did a quick check, called Blipcare in Chicago and was pleasantly surprised to receive very personal and concerned service.  Blipcare was equally concerned about the unit's performance given the critical application.  I shipped the unit back to them, and after a couple days received a personal call noting the wireless electronics module was not working.  The nice lady with this small personal company told me they would repair the unit and have it returned within a couple days.  Wow!  Sure enough, we received the BP unit back a couple days later, again professionally packed, and it is back in service.I will gladly patronize Blipcare again when I need one of their products.  It is a good feeling to know caring companies like this are still out there.
