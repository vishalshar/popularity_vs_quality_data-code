I love the bags; they're very well made and aren't flimsy at all. So far, they seem to keep everything fresh. The one thing I don't like is after washing them, it takes so long for the inside to dry, and it's hard to find a way to keep them propped open so that they do dry completely. I recommend these bags to anyone who doesn't like throwing money away on plastic bags, as well as anyone who is conscious about throwing plastic bags away to linger in our landfills for 500+ years. One more thing; if you let your kids take these bags in their lunch boxes, you probably won't get them back!
