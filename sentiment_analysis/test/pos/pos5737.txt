The first thing my wife and I noticed when we unboxed the MEVO is how beautiful it is. We decided on the black version and it truly looks and feels like a well-crafted piece of hardware.We originally purchased the Mevo so my wife could live stream her final presentations at school, as part of her grad school project. When we started playing with it, we immediately thought it would've been a great idea to use it to live stream our wedding, but alas, we were late to the game, so will have to use it for our honeymoon instead.The app you use to control the camera is intuitive and easy to use, it really makes you feel like a camera director in no time. We even used the camera underground to film a group of subway dancers in NYC. While filming, the WIFI signal that connects with your phone was a bit glitchy, but the recorded video was smooth and crystal clear. Oh, and that's another thing... the video quality is fantastic, with fast internet access the quality is really superb, the camera changes and pannings are seamless and your videos end up looking very professional.We haven't used the Mevo with a pro livestream account yet, so we don't know how the experience is enhanced, and the battery life could improve, but it seems that problem could be fixed with the Boost that's sold separately.
