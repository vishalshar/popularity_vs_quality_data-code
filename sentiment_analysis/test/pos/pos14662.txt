I bought a crib sheet set (and extra sheet) for my daughter a couple of years ago and she has raved about the ease of changing sheets without having to wrestle with the mattress, so, now I am buying one for my son's soon-to-be-born baby.  I hope they will love the sheets as much as my daughter has.  BTW, she has used the sheets for two years and they are still in great shape!
