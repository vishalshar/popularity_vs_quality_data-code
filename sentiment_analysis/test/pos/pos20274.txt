I stumbled upon a video of the drone/loop artist Noveller experimenting with one of these and immediately started desiring one. I've just received it and played around with it for a solid hour and I'm already impressed with it, although my technique still needs some work. I was able to come up with some ideas off the cuff that I quite liked. For one, I enjoyed  finding a pleasing chord progression and thwacking the Triller against the strings with both stereo tremolo and stereo digital delay (with both effects roughly synced up via tap tempo)the percussive attack of the Triller gives you a sound you can't get with a pick or your fingers alone. Lots of great possibilities in "lead" mode as wellgot some cool "one man gamelan orchestra" soundsalthough I haven't gotten a feel for the picking as of yet. Also lots of interesting sounds when you rub/scrape the Triller against the strings. The lightweight plastic Triller also seems to be much better as a musical implement than whatever household items you might have lying about for this purpose. I would recommend this to just about any player.
