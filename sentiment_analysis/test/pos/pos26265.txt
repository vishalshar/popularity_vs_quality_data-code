Oh yes, I can see all my multi acre wooded property - finally.  Sadly, I also found places in my house needing insulation, grrr, thought I had that covered.Updating to 5 stars, this is really helping me monitor my yard and find places in home that need improvements, the black/white mode also helps to identify studs and joists, the iron mode can be used if within short timespan to see warm paw print trails through a room, in case a critter looks guilty, ha ha.  It is amazing how long a couch shows a heat trial after it is vacated.  I get text messages for help when someone's pet is missing at night.
