I have had the August lock now for about a month and am very impressed so far. The lock works as advertised. Most people don't have a need for such a device but I live alone in a 1 bed condo and am on the road frequently. I constantly need to allow access to my place to others for various reasons so the August lock is a perfect fit for me.  The installation was easy and only took about 10 minutes. While smart looking, the lock itself is a little bulky.  Everyone whom I have sent a "key" to hasn't had any issues getting in  When I am home, I find I never use my traditional keys anymore. While approaching the door I usually just open the app and unlock the door as I arrive. Takes all of about 3-5 seconds.Again for me, this device solves a lot of my problems. If u don't have a need for such a device or the $$ to spend then it is probably not for you. Mine works perfectly and I am very glad I finally purchased one
