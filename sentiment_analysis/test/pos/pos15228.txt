So far I have been very happy with both of my Canary products. The flex was incredibly easy to set up and required no re-wiring or confusing instruction manual. At first I didn't think I would trust the strength of the magnetic base but it is incredibly strong and when mounted high enough there is little to no risk of theft. In the future I may opt for the secure mount accessory if I plan to mount another flex near my front door where it might be easier to reach, however I don't feel it is necessary at this time as my current flex is out of reach.The camera itself in very clear day and night in any weather condition. I mounted my flex at the back door angled down so that all the camera sees is about a 15-20 foot radius of my back patio and yard. So far I have no received any alerts that haven't been real. I have a different security system in the front and I actually had to turn off notification (which defeats the purpose of a security cam) because it alerted me every time a car drove by or the wind blew. The Flex won't send you these false alerts but WILL send you alerts when a person is within view. I have not caught any animals on camera yet so I can't speak for animals.The battery life isn't quite as long as some of the other wireless cameras, however you can keep the Flex plugged in thanks to the extra long power cord and then you don't have to worry about the battery. The good news is, the battery charges quickly and I got it back in place in no time. I think the reason my battery drained as quickly as it did was because of the unusually cold weather we were having which drained all my outdoor wireless devices, not just the Flex.The overall look of the product is very sleek and well designed and thanks to the magnetic swivel you can achieve any angle or radius that you may need.I will definitely be purchasing more Canary products in the future.
