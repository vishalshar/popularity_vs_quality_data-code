I am amazed with this repair kit. I have tried many other companies for screen replacements as I do this on the side in my down time. I decided to give iCracked a shot. I was amazed super professional packaging and the product was just like OEM. I will continue to buy from iCracked from now on. I would recommend this to everyone doing a screen replacement on any iPhone. The quality of the tools were super impressive. Also used the detailed book and YouTube video from iCracked. They were both super helpful. The screen replacement was a breeze. And not only that they give you a recycling box with a prepaid shipping label. Overall experience with this product was an A+++ couldn't ask for anything else. Thanks iCracked!
