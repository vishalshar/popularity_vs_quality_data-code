I am not positive I would buy it again because of the high cost. The program it runs with 'Paper' is in its beginning stages and kind of clunky. But I can see potential in it. I think overall the stylus is pretty responsive. But it might not meet all your needs. It comes with a replacement tip, because I guess that wears eventually. It is certainly better than a lot of other stylus out there.
