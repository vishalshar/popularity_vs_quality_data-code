I am very happy with the product and its HomeKit support. Installation of the switches was easy.  The design of the switches and remotes take a bit to get used to. Bought the wall adaptor for the remotes so the simulate 3way switches.  Fired up the AppleTV and now I can tell Siri to turn the lights on,off and dim to a certain % from anywhere there is Internet access. Wanted to stay away from Insteon, Wink, and Samsung because they use the "cloud" for control leaving you vulnerable to security breaches.
