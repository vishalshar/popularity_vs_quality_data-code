They are initially a little snug but the site has instruction on several different methods to tighten, loosen or neutral. I used the loose method and they were a bit tight but after a couple day they were perfect. I am a sailing guy so flip flops and barefoot is how you will usually find me but in the winter months and certain surfaces demand a good sneaker. These are great . My shoes slide on and off easily but are snug while wearing. unlike laces that are almost always tight at the top and loose at the bottom these give a consistent fit I have never experienced more. Well done HICKIES.
