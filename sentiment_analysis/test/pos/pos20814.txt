Great product.  The kiddo (9yr old) was up and running with it in no time.  Easy to put together and the walk throughs were easy for him to pick up on.  Only 2 knocks on it 1. Needs a power switch  2. Could use more learning apps.  #2 is the only reason not to give 5 stars, but hopefully the community grows and contributes more.
