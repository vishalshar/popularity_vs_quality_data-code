I rarely leave reviews I am extremely please with my Kuna purchase. I purchased the annual plan today. There has been a rash of home invasions including assaults on the home owners. I compared the price of the Kuna with the price of installing a video camera system with included an electrician installing wires and plugins for semi wireless systems. The Kuna is the answer for my budget. I am please with the picture quality, alerts and the features. I am the lead person for our neighborhood watch program "Nextdoor". I have shared my experience with everyone in my neighborhood. Thank you, Kuna for an exceptional product, easy on the budget!
