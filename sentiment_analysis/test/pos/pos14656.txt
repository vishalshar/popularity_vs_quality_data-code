These are the greatest! Whoever came up with this idea is a genius. I have them on the back of my iPhone so I can whip them out at anytime. I can now go into stores without emptying my bag for my readers. I actually have about 5 pairs of readers stationed all around the house. But now that I have thinOPTICS, there's no need. I am so happy about this product I'm willing to be their spokesperson!
