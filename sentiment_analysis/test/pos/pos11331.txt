I love this product! My daughter has cracked her Ipad about 3 times and with Apple care we have just gotten it replaced. Well Apple care runs out this year so I needed something that would work but wouldn't be to heavy for her (The otterbox was just too bulky and heavy) This case is awesome! No cracks after several drops. I have no put a screen protector on it yet but my daughter can carry this much easier with the handle so less accidents happen. She has figured out how to take it off but we just put it right back on. I would recommend for anyone with young children. My daughter is almost 4.
