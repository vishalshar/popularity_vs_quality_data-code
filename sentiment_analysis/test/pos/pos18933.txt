My boys are loving this gift (Kindergarten and 2nd grade). We haven't even gotten into the programming features yet and they are having a blast just driving it around and having it dance to music on the iPads. It can balance a surprising amount on its tray. Yes, it does fall over some times, but it is easy to sit back up. I was worried on the first day because they would turn off sometimes, but that was only because I hadn't screwed in the battery compartment tight enough. After I tightened those screws the robots have been working great. These do so much more than robots when I was a kid.
