Very nice not to need two individual coffeemakers on my desk in my home office. And very nice to have an automatic two-hour shut-off (although you still have to remember to turn the switch itself to the "OFF" position at least ten minutes before starting to prepare the next pot). The manufacturer was very prompt and courteous in answering my question about replacement pot lids in a different color (such as green or orange for the decaf); they're not available in anything other than black. I'll figure out a different way to label the decaf pot if we have to move both pots away from the coffeemaker for serving.We've had several instances of overflow or backup of some sort, which gives us 1/3 to 1/2 pot of coffee with grounds all over the place. After the first instance, we've been very careful to make sure the switch is turned off, the filter basket is seated properly, the pot is situated correctly under the basket, and we're not using too much water (all of which are possible causes listed in the manual); sometimes it still misbehaves.The manual says to use "a paper cone filter #4" but the machine actually takes standard-sized basket filters, not cone filters.
