I chose this rating because it is working great for me. I gave it four stars because:It works for dogs of various sizes.It makes walking easier because they help each other stay in check while I help them. Sometimes walking two dogs means that one is going one way and the other wants to go a different direction. The dog coupler makes it easier because they pull each other which means they pull me less.I only gave 4 stars though because there is a clip in the middle that is hard to snap closed.Otherwise, great product and even great for training new pups by using your older dog to help guide them!
