I'm spoiled, I will admit.  Prior to the iPhone 7 I used a Rhidon battery case that could charge my 6 S Plus two and a half times on a charge.  It also had a USB port so I could charge my wife's phone and she didn't need to carry a battery pack.  That case does not work with the IPhone 7 Plus, at least if I want to be able to take pictures, and right now I do.  The Universe case fits well enough and doesn't block the cameras.  I have ordered the iPhone 7 Plus version.Anyway, the battery does what it says which is provide 3/4 of a full charge to the Plus.  It's convenient to keep attached to the phone.  I just miss my Rhidon!
