This is the best fence ever. It did take a lot of time to install but was worth it. We have a wrought iron fence and place the yellow wiring with zip ties around the top of the fence. My husband did have to dig under the cement coming around the side of the house by the attached garage. There is no way to get around this because you have to open the gate. Our two kitties now stay in our backyard and we are not looking for them for three hours in the dark. They only went outside when we came home from work, but they kept disappearing and I was a wreck. They were trained in two days. Our cats were suppose to be indoor cats but my husband kept going behind my daughters back and mine and would take them outside. We would come home from shopping and our kitties would be gone, mind you this is my daughters first pet. Even though our kitties are micro chipped, they doesn't mean they are safe. I get emails every week from Home Again(The micro chip company on missing cats and dogs).After reading these emails I KNOW we made the right choice on buying this fence. It took are cats about five days to get used the collar. They were only shocked by the collar twice and never tried to go though the fence again. The collars were set at level 3. If you are still undecided , please don't be, losing your cat is so much worse!!
