Super comfortable and with a nice stretch for after a big meal. ;) This nicely fit my passport, money, and would have fit a key or small cell phone as well. I didn't want to be that "lumpy" walking around, so I just kept the essentials. Great for exploring a new area and keeping your personal items safe.
