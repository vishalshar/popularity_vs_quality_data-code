Got this for fun. In our high plains desert (read: extremely dry) climate, it didn't grow initially. (Also, I found the directions to be crazily unclear for something that is, in reality, exceptionally simple!) I ended up basically drowning it daily and letting it sit on a cookie sheet in water. Now it's taking off, and it's been fun to see progress while we're out of the house. Really kind of fascinating. Would be fun for kids.
