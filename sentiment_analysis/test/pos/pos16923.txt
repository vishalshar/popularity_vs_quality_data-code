I tend to go camping/hiking alot, which is why I purchased this. It's un intended use now is mainly in my gym back and onto the shower floor after my workouts.. rocking in celebration of another workout. The bass is sweet.. especially in a shower environment. crystal clear and large sound, much larger than the small rock is resembles. I can't say enough about this,  great find.
