I hope they stock this on space missions. This stuff is almost magical. Some folks might be sensitive to the "delicate aroma" as it cures, or might find it a skin irritant. It doesn't bother me."PC" right now notwithstanding ... it is perfect for making down-to-the-pinkie-wrinkle perfect customized competition grips. It adheres to rubbers, plastics, etc. and is easy to trim and even shave with a scalpel after curing.I also have one spot on one instep that gets messed up by any hiking boot made. No more. Custom blended-surface cushion ... end of problem.
