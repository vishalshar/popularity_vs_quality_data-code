My miniature poodle loves the iFetch. It stimulates his mind and keeps him active.  I looked for similar toys and can't find any.  It is a one of a kind! It is the best...Highly recommend it for dogs that love to fetch with people who have busy lives. He is a happy boy.  I did get the mini-kong balls with a squeek response - these are more durable.  Overall, the IFetch is expensive but really worth it. He gives it a 5+ rating!
