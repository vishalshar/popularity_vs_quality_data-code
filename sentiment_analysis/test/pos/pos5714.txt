It appears like a USB Disk on my Mac.It's fine for me, 'cause, sometimes my Mac would run into zero battery, and it shows that the TarDisk was not ejected properly.(I didn't eject it).Actually, I am willing to set the TarDisk as an internal disk, but.. considering above issue, I decided to keep it this way.(This was not the purpose I bought it, although)---Updated on 20151216:After my above comment, I am glad the supporter from TarDisk contacting me to help me to have my TarDisk being pared with my Mac Book Air.I am glad that they are very supportive, keep replying my questions one by one and eventually, Ding-Dong, my Mac is pared with the TarDisk completely, (although it needs to take some time to do the process, but not only just one finger pushing your TarDisk into your Mac)Anyway, I am now 100% satisfied with the TarDisk's professional support. Thank you very much.This is the Best Buy, definitely.
