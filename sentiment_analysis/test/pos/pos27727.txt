These are pretty cool. You know you think you know cheese and how to store it, then you read a few quick articles about proper storage for decent/quality cheese, and the next thing you know you are buying artisan cheese storage bags. Storage bags. But, it's a more appropriate way to store the cheese and it's easier than wrapping it with cheese paper, which isn't just unique to this company, other companies sell it as well, but the bags are easier.I wish the bags had a longer life span. This company, which also has a really cool informative website for their products and their uses, claims that these can be reused, until fats and oils start to seep through the bags. I noticed this happening on one cheese in particular after it was in the bag for a week. These bags aren't cheap, and I'm eco friendly, so ideally, I'd like to be able to use a bag for a few months, personally at least.But these are still a great storage option and seem to work well. I have noticed very slight improvements in quality while storing cheese in these bags as opposed to storing them in plastic zip bags, which was my old storage method and apparently a big cheese connoisseur no-no.
