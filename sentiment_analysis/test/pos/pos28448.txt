Purchased for a whitewater rafting trip so that I could film the adventure hands-free. Everything worked great and it held my GoPro to the LifeVest without any issues. The only thing I would change it to cut little slots into the sides so I could slide the LifeVest strap into the strap holes for a little extra security. Not a deal breaker, though, because the thumb screws provided enough squeeze to hold everything in place.
