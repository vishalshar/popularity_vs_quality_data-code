I love these because they're super crunchy. Two of my kids however are not a fan and prefer a different brand that is less crunchy and more soft and chewy. Just like cookies, some people like crunchy cookies and others like soft-gooey ones. To each his own :)  I love the crunch and I love that these are organic!  Very sweet too.  Fuji is the only apple I buy.
