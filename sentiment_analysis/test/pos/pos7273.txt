I was a very early adopter of Tile, having ordered a handful of them on Kickstarter.  I have since tried several other brands of thing finders (TrackR, Hiro), but keep coming back to Tile on account of the user interface in the app, the range, and the form factor.  Tile really is the superior thing finder on the market right now.Tile slim works just like regular tile, only it is, well, slim.  Super slim. They are not joking when they say it is as thick as two credit cards. It looks like someone ran over a regular tile with a steamroller. It is way thinner, but also a bit bigger on both sides than the regular tile. It is exactly as long as the height of a credit card.There is no hole for a keyring (this is a bit big for that), and there is a single button in the center (rather than a hidden button buried in the e).Range seems to be about identical to old tile, and time will tell on battery life.Set up is simple. Just open the app and press the plus sign in the app, press the center button on the tile, and it adds itself. That is it. Simple. Just like regular tile.  It took maybe 5 seconds to set up.The finder alarm is loud enough that you can actually find what you have linked to your tile, and is simple to activate. Just go into the app, tap find it on the device you are looking for, and walk around listening.And like regular tile, this goes both ways. Press the button on the tile and your phone will start to ring.So bottom line, if you like Tile, you will like Tile Slim. I have often wished that Tile would fit in my wallet, and Tile Slim has answered that wish.  My only gripe is that it would be great if it was a little longer on one side, perhaps exactly the dimensions (at least length and width, thickness is already perfect) as a credit card.  It feels a bit off balance in my wallet since it is not quite as long as a credit card.  So tile, if you are listening, make a credit card sized tile that fits seamlessly in a wallet. OR, make a super cool credit card holder that this securely inserts into. I would pay for that to have it not offbalance my wallet.A word of warning. Regular tile did not have a user serviceable battery. When the battery died, you had to send it in and get a replacement at a decent discount from retail price. This thinner version appears to have the same issue. Assuming battery life is similar to regular tile, you are looking at a yearly re-investment.  The battery thing is why I moved away from Tile for a short period, but the reliability of Tile brought me back pretty quickly as the other products could not compete.
