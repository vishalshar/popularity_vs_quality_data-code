Mobscenity was a total win on game night!After 3 years Cards Against Humanity was getting a little stale. This was certainly refreshing. At one point I had the most powerful laughing fit that I've had in years... to the point where I had to excuse myself and go splash water on my face. More on that later.The rules are simple: One player draws 6 cards (the cards are each a single "G" rated word from the English language). Of his 6 cards he chooses 2 and uses the words to create a unique phrase. Then all the rest of the players invent a definition for the phrase, and uses the phrase in a sentence in the context of their definition. The player who created the phrase chooses his favorite. That's about it! There are a few "special" cards thrown in the deck and a couple optional game variations, but in my humble opinion keeping it simple was more than enough fun.Here's what you need to know: What you see is what you get; it's a deck of cards (the instructions are printed on 2 cards). There is no game board, no score pad, timer, dice, chips, tokens, etc. You'll need your own timer, pens/pencils and pieces of paper (I got a cube of plain scratch paper from the dollar store). Players have to be at least somewhat creative and preferably not timid. They should also be able to write in a manner that someone else can read what they wrote without too much of a struggle. The words are completely innocent. It is the players' dirty minds that make this game so totally bleeped up.Finally, the phrase that had me choking on my own laughter and blinded by my tears: "Hot Swallow." Every response had something to do with some combination of cinnamon or hot sauce and oral intimacy... except one. "Hot Swallow - The sexiest bird in the tree. 'The cardinal was checking out the hot swallow.'" I lost it. Just. Totally. Lost it.
