My husband loves this little thing. He says it is the best he has had --BUT he has already lost two as the unit flies out of the watch band when he is hitting!  Now we have 2 watch bands and 2 belt loops  and no electronics to put in them.  There must be a way to make the band more secure around the unit! Please!
