I'm big on safety and I love the idea of these things.  I like teh flash then steady brake light and would have gotten it just for that.  The part I've had a bit of issue with is the feature where it flashes the brakes when decelerating.  Ther is no sensitivity adjust - you basically adjust the inclination and/or orientation of the unit to "adjust".  My V-Strom frame is sloped so I had to make a front spacer to raise it up to make it level enough to where it would operate correctly.  Setting the front "uphill" decreases sensitivity and sloped "downhill" increases sensitivity.  I've been told that going downhill sometimes it flashes the brake light as if I'm decelerating and braking.  Supposedly offsetting teh unit left or right of true center will also reduce sensitivity.
