We are a vegan family, who likes to let our little guys enjoy in the Halloween festivities. This was our first year with the switch witch and I have to say We loved her! I thought for sure my boys (age 7 & 5) would be skeptical...but they loved her :) This will be our new family tradition for Halloween!
