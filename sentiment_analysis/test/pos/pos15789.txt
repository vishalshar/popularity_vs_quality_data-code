These are brilliant. They have completely replaced my other air locks, and I ferment a lot. I like them so much I give them away as gifts to my other picking friends. They are always a hit. They eliminate the need for overhead space when I am pickling, and allow me to smell my ferment easily without removing the lid. They are also very easy to clean (you can boil them!). I only wish they also made them in slightly more natural looking colors, but that is purely an aesthetic preference. They work like a dream.
