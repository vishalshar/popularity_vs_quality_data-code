We have had the doorbell cam and lock installed for about four months. August FINALLY released an update that allows motion detection and recording. I'm overall pleased with the doorbell. We have had no trouble with it connecting to wifi. Occasionally I get alerts that it's gone offline but it always comes back up within minutes. The motion sensing seems to work very nicely and accurately. The doorbell always works and we never have trouble connecting to it remotely when the need arises. The camera quality is good. My biggest complaint as others have shared is the time delay!  When the doorbell rings it takes what feels like forever to pull up the camera image. I have not timed it but it's probably at least 30 seconds. This is obviously a major annoyance when you have someone standing on your doorstep.  I'm not tech savvy enough to know what needs to be updated to fix this but it is a pretty big annoyance.  however, it does record immediately and I've not had any issues with viewing the recordings after the fact. If the delay was fixed this would be a five star device. Also, please fix it to work with home kit!!
