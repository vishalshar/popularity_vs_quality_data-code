I've used a PC media center 5.1 sound sound system for a long time, but my situation changed and I needed a headset with good audio quality for watching movies, listening to music etc., plus playing games (Fallout). I read a review for this headset on the PC Gamer website in which they used high tech gear to test the audio quality of about 26 headsets, scoring for audio quality, comfort, mic quality and a few other criteria. Overall this set ranked right at the top in areas important to me primarily being audio quality. On other sites, I read very mixed reviews and figured those reviewers had far different criteria than me, and decided to get them anyway. I'm really glad I did.  They are very comfortable, well made and the sound quality is great. They don't have some of the frills other gaming headsets have like Bluetooth, a detachable mic, cool buttons and lights but those headsets seem to prioritize bells and whistles over audio quality. This company put their money into quality sound drivers, good design choices and high quality construction. I don't really use the mic but it folds up out of the way and I don't even know it's there. A reviewer out there indicated the total volume capability is weak but I disagree, unless you want to destroy your hearing. This headset spec doesn't claim to be "surround sound", but researching the subject revealed that unless you have a number of individual speakers in the headset speaker "can" they synthesize surround sound using software anyway. Individual speaker headsets with true surround sound have a reputation for muddled sound quality. Listen to the Youtube video "Virtual Barbershop" and you'll see that stereo headsets can deliver the same surround sound quality because it's something that happens in your brain anyway. Long and short - for about $85 and change you're getting high quality audio gear that's great for gaming, too.
