I own 2 Canary devices which are set up in different locations.  I was looking for Flex to be a supplement to one of them and I looked in the right place.This little device will fit ANYWHERE--inside, outside, all around the place.  It is small, blends in with everything, wireless (just charge the battery), and can be placed literally in any location.  It certainly can work alone (without my other unit) but it blends perfectly with my main unit.Setup was a snap.  The app allows me to flip back and forth between the two units with the ease of a finger swipe.  The picture is clear and the sound is amazing.Best of all is the way I feel with this device in place--SAFE and SECURE.
