I love this thing. I've been using it for about a month, and it's brilliant. It holds my iPhone 6 with ease, I love that I can use it in either landscape or portrait orientation. It fits perfectly into my CD slot, is easy to mount, and easy to remove. The pads grip my phone securely without damaging the case or the phone. It holds the phone in perfect viewing position, so I can see at a glance what's going on, without having to look down. I particularly love the snap shut button. No more fumbling around trying to get the phone in the holder. Just push the phone against the mount, and it snaps to hold. The one-handed removal is nice, too.So far, I'm very impressed with the quality. The ball-joint which holds the phone gripping part to the CD mount has an adjustable ring, so if it ever loosens up, you can tighten it up with no problem.All around, an excellent product, in my opinion.
