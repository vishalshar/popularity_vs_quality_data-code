Its hard to find a children's vitamin with omega-3 that my children will take. The other brands I have tried taste terrible and my children simply will not take them. The directions say children should take 4 a day which can be add up to be more over time but because the taste is great we are happy to pay more for them. The bottle has 3 colors/flavors inside and the gummy vitamins stay soft in the jar until the end. I am very pleased with this product and have given them to friends to try who all have great results as well. I give 5 stars from this mom of 2.
