Have been using lighted makeup mirrors for 30+ years and have never been happy with their clarity or illumination. Was blown away with this mirror's clarity, size and illumination!  Saw it browsing a major luxury department store but reserved my impulse buy due to its price.  Investigated many reviews (some unfavorable, which gave me pause) but decided it couldn't be any worse than the rest I have purchased or that are available at present.  Amazon's return policy and the mirror's 5 year warranty gave me the insurance to at least try it.  It arrived within one day of ordering it Prime.  Wow.  Great service.  Perfectly packed, too.  Easy to set up.  Charging cord is a bit short so that's a modification to make it better.  App was easy to set up.  Had trouble linking the mirror to my phone, but think it was my internet as it linked an hour or so later.  Did call the customer support center to inquire about replacement bulbs.  Turns out they're LED's so should never need to be replaced with routine use. Love that the lighting intensity can be adjusted however you wish via the app.  It truly is as good as putting on makeup outdoors, something I routinely do when staying in hotels with deplorable lighting.  If it outlasts its warranty, this mirror's cost is $0.21/day.  Figure that's the cost of a really good investment piece of clothing and great makeup app makes even the worst outfit look better.  Vanity wins here.  I LOVE IT!
