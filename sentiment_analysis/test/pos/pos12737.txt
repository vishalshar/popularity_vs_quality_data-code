Although the tip doesn't last that long, the rest of the pen construction is sturdy. I like how it weighs and feels whenever I draw. Perfect with the "Paper 53"app. I'm not sure why you need the bluetooth connection. It works, even without it.I really enjoyed this. See samples of my "EYE" drawings. :)
