Thick, creamy product.  Great partner with same company seaweed body wash.  Also unscented.  I have "treated" skin (burnt, radiated, etc) and have developed weird sensitivities to products I used to enjoy.  I now do a little "patch" test whenever I try something new for me. My skin loves this product, it seems to absorb deeply and quickly without sticky residue. It feels moisturizing and rich, and since I'm using it everywhere, I wish it were a little less $$!
