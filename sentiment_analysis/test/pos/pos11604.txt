I was barely receiving any Wi-Fi in my new kitchen, so I needed to look for an extender. I saw this listing, did some research and I took a chance on this product and was very pleased with the product. I did some research on it and found that the design, execution, methodology of it was absolute genius! Even my friends were fascinated by it.The design:Simple. Clean. Modern. There's nothing I love more than something I can put on my counter-top that looks great with any environment. The led ring light gives it another aesthetically pleasing feature.The way it worksIt works as an extender for your existing ISP. There is a default WEP key on the bottom or you can hold your device to the it and wait for it to beep (accept) your specific device that you want to connect and it remembers it! That's the genius part. Next time you have a party or some friends over, they don't have to ask you for the password, which may be long and cumbersome to type it. Instead, they can just scan their phone and connect in as little as 30 seconds.Technical issuesI did have some technical issues setting it up and sometimes the extender would need to be reset. However, the technical support for this product is stellar and friendly.OverallI really like the overall design and smarts behind the product. This is a great piece to have in your house or apartment that is well worth the money.
