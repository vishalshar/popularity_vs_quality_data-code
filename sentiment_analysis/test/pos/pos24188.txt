I actually had a big doubt and thought that this is pretty lame idea, but my son actually loves it a lot and I see a HUGE difference between SPUNI and other spoons, my baby's face is much cleaner while he eats and it looks more convenient to him, Never though that such a small change in the spoon's shape can make such a big difference.
