I travel tested this product over Europe and Asia and love it! It will save you from over packing as well as laundry expenses. The twist cap is what prompted me to buy this, it's not so awkward to use in the sink and you can see your wash from the clear plastic while it's soaking. Construction is solid but there is minor leak in the creases of the fold because of the stiff material so it's not completely waterproof and the blue seams gets this annoying fuzz. Overall, it's good for the price and it seems it'll last long. I'd highly recommend this over the Scrubba.
