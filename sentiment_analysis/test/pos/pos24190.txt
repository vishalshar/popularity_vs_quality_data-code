Perfect baby spoon for my 6 month old. Great for pur√©ed baby food. The shape is really easy to hold and deliver just the right amount of food into his mouth. Like all silicone it does stain a little, especially with sweet potato and carrot. But I used the orange spoon for orange foods and blue spoon for green foods and the staining doesn't bother me too much. Really like this product and would recommend!
