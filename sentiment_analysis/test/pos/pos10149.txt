These are awesome, I was turned onto them by a family member. They're a great multivitamin. I originally took them because I had difficulty swallowing pills - that's no longer an issue, but I'm still going to use these as my multi. They just taste so good and supplement my diet very nicely. I can definitely feel the impact they make. I had one minor issue where the seal was punctured one time after I took the lid off to inspect it (can happen to any manufacturer I imagine, not a big deal), and a replacement was sent out immediately. Great customer service! I take the lid off of all of them now when I receive them and make sure the seal is fine just to be safe (I usually buy these in bulk). Good habit to get into for all vitamins and supplements. Great product, great company, stands by their products, and takes care of the customer!
