I have been using the scoop free fresh step auto litter box now for over 6 months with no problems of leaking.  I have a 7 year old Maine Coon weighing  approx. 12 lbs and like Maine Coons he is a big cat.  The box is always clean, and litter refill lasts approx 4 weeks.  Something people with leak problems might try is to place a plastic bag between the lid and the box.  I suggest buying the 3 pack because if you are a prime member shipping is free.Shipping on the 6 pack is not, so any savings are lost by freight costs.  Also the 6 pack box is huge.  Storage is easier for the 3 pack.
