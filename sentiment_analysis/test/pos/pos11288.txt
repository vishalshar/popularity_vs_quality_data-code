This monitor makes so much sense, I can't understand why the bigger companies don't have versions of their popular models that link directly to their web sites as this one does. This monitor could not be more convenient since every reading is sent almost immediately via the WiFi connection to the Blipcare web site, where it is stored and can be accessed and plotted at any later time.  This makes so much more sense than most other automatic monitors that just give the reading on a screen.  The next best thing would be a Bluetooth connection to a computer but then you have to be sure that the computer is turned on with the correct program running when you take the reading.  A second major advantage of this monitor is that it is battery operated and so can be easily moved around to what ever location is convenient for taking a reading.  So far, I have used the monitor taking readings several times a day for over a month on one set of four AA batteries that came with the monitor.I have only two complaints about the monitor and the method of connecting it to the WiFi router and they are the only reasons for not awarding five stars.  The first is that the pressure cuff you put around your arm is of the standard type with a Velcro fastening.  This is fine but not as easy or convenient as the preformed cuff that came standard on my old Omron monitor.  The second is the clunky way that you have to get the monitor to connect to the router.  The procedure is to first remove and then replace the batteries and wait for the letters "AP" to appear on the screen.  You then have only three minutes to connect to the WiFi network site called "blip" using your laptop/phone/tablet, go to http://192.168.101.1 on any browser, scan for your network name, and enter your network password.  If you complete all of this correctly, the monitor will be able to connect through your router to the Blipcare website for ever so you only have to do this once.  However, the process can be very frustrating, especially if you have the wrong password as I did for a while.  Apart from that, once I got through the process on about the tenth try, everything has worked flawlessly ever since.I have been able to measure my blood pressure several times a day and have noted the variations and the effects of medications that I have been taking.. Hopefully, the readings will allow me to get a better handle on my health and help me and my doctor decide how to respond to the new recommendations of the American Heart Association concerning the trigger levels for taking statin drugs.
