I really love this gadget!  It saves me so much time when tuning a guitar compared with tuning using a clip on tuner.  I cannot live without this.  It takes me about 20 seconds to completely tune up and the tuning is painless.  It requires an app on your phone to work and I thought that it would be a bother, but it turns out that since I always have my phone with me, it's not an issue at all.Setup couldn't be more simple:  The Roadie comes precharged, so download the Roadie app (Apple or Android), make sure bluetooth on the phone is active, open the app, press the on button on the Roadie and voila, instant bluetooth connection, click the plus on the app to add a guitar, Uke, mando, banjo or any custom stringing (sadly no bass guitars allowed), proceed to calibration which takes about 2 minutes and then tune away.The Roadie is not perfect, but it's pretty damn amazing.Here are the pros and cons:Pros:  Fast, accurate tuning.  Supports guitars, ukuleles, mandolins, and banjos. Supports 8 alternate tunings and you can easily add other tunings.  Easy to change from 440 to other pitches.  Does not require going into bluetooth settings.  The Roadie app is fast and smooth.  Very long batter life.Cons:  Most of these cons are basically just wish lists, but here goes: No bass guitars (but I would be OK with a bass only Roadie!).  Unwind/rewind button on the Roadie is easily pressed when tuning  (this results in the string being completely unwound).  I wish the Roadie blue connected light was moved from the top of the unit to the front, because in the complete dark it would be nice to have the Roadie light the tuners.  Different icons in the app would be nice instead of just a single 6 string guitar icon.  The app cuts off long guitar names under the icons.  This is a problem when all your friends guitars are in your app.  There's no way to attach the Roadie to the guitar, I used velcro tape, but that's an awkward potentially guitar damaging solution.Over all the Roadie is excellent!!!
