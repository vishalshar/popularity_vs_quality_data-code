1.  I like how the cushion would auto detect the phone with the app is near and auto connect.2.  I find I have to recalibrate cushion on a harden flat surface to get best result. The cushion is always in the same place and makes recalibration much easier.3.  The cushion could be a little longer to match the chair length better. It sits a little far back on my thighs. I am only 5' 7" so I am not a big person. However my husband likes it very much.4. The width of the cushion is good. Materials feels good in touch.5. I like the fact it buzzes me to stand and gives exercises.6. I like the leaning notifications. I knew I was a forward leaner but did not realize I leaned to the right a lot too. Good to know.Overall I could live with sit on it every morning and buzz me many times a day (however it is sometimes annoying).That is my honest opinion.
