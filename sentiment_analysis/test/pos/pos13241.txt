The bluesmart suitcase is super easy to carry around thanks to it's long handle, all-direction wheels and smart sizing. Useful stats are reported on the bluesmart app on my HTC One like it's weight, battery %, and notifications when I'm not near it. The two charging ports in it are a killer feature! Even without all the smart features, it stands on it's own as an ideal suitcase; the front laptop case, easy to use compartments, and it's smooth design all make it a breeze to use, especially during last minute packing. Highly recommended and I'm looking forward to seeing more products from this company.
