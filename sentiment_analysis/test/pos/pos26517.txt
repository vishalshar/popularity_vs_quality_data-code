When we were in LA in April, Costco was giving out samples of these apple chips and they were awesome. I bought a bag (should have bought more !!) and brought them back to NY. I couldn't find the 14 ounce bag here locally so I decided to spend a little extra and buy them online. One bag was crushed and the seal was broken so they were not as fresh as they should have been and I probably should have returned them, but I didnt. In any case the other bag was fine and they are amazing. No added sugars, crispy and very tasty. In my efforts to eat healthy this really meets all my criteria !! If you like apples you will love these chips !!!
