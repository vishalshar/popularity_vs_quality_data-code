I have only been using it for a couple of weeks but so far so good. I like how compact the Orbitkey is compared to my old key chains that were heavy and cumbersome. I don't fear that my keys will fall off which used to happen with my old one. The package material indicates it holds approximately 2-7 keys. I was able to place only 3 keys on there which was okay since that is all I have for my front door. If you have more which I do for another door you may need to purchase another one.
