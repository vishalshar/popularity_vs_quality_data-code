By having a digital display it takes all the guesswork out of measurements.  It can do inside vs. outside, metric vs. imperial, fractions & decimals.  Being able to "hold" a measurement from time to time is quite handy too.  I've used it as my "go to" tape measure in my shop since receiving it.  Highly recommend this item.  It may be a little pricey, but for the accuracy and convenience it affords, I believe it is worth the few extra dollars.
