This case has EXCEEDED my expectations by a considerable margin.  Not only does it stick to every surface I want it to, but the "nano" surface is surprisingly comfortable to hold.  I used to accidentally knock my phone (in the old case) off tables with embarrassing frequency.  Now it just sticks there.  On my computer screen. On my car dash.  The kitchen table.  Wherever I need it to.  I'm looking forward to whatever these guys make next.
