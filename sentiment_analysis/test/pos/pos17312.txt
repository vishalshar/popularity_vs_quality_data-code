I like this phone a lot, and it's much better than the Moto G3 I had been using previously.The good:This phone is quick, as you would expect from a Snapdragon 808 and 3GB ram.  It's attractive and unique.  The screen is bright and replicates color nicely - it's actually a very attractive display.  I love the unlock button placement, and the fingerprint reader is quite accurate.  Camera issues look to have been solved with Android M.  The phone is generally very attractive and enjoyable to use.The bad:This phone is all-plastic and it feels like it.  It seems pretty delicate, and I would be scared to sit on it without a case, so I'll be investing in one of those.  The speakers also don't sound as great as you would expect from the size and placement.  Volume buttons are positioned awkwardly.  I was initially excited about USB-C but the connection feels a tad rough and prototype-y (there's no satisfying click, and the glide is pretty rough).Bottom line:I bought this device on sale for $199 and I wouldn't pay a penny more than that for it. I'll be keeping it for that price, but if I were spending a full $399, I would not hesitate to buy a OnePlus 3 instead.
