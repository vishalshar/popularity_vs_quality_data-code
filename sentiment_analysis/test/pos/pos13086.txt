I love Quadlock.For years I've been hoping to find a system that would allow me to change only the case on the phone and not the entire system every time I upgraded.The solution is here.Pros:1) Case is nice, thin, and light even with the quadlock "lock" on the back2) Build quality feels good3) The amount of accessories is nice.  I've got the car window mount, armband, and bike mount. Love being able to go from one to another so easily!4) Easy to use, fast mount and dismount5) Unless I find something better, no plans to ever switch away.Cons:1) Expensive. Almost a bit too expensive.. but considering you don't have to keep buying mounting systems, long term it's less expensive I suppose :)2) I'm not a huge fan of the bike mount. It doesn't fit any of my bikes correctly (I have 3) and it's a bit difficult to remove (with that said, it's solid and I don't feel like the phone is going to come off the mount)3) Wish there were more case options for other brands of phones4) Difficult to find stuff for iphone 6 plus (like the splash guard)Overall, a great product and great idea.  I had this same idea years ago and darn, could have made some money :) Oh well, thanks Quadlock!
