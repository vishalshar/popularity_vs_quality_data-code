Depending on your intended use, this could be exactly what you've been looking for, or an expensive toy that's a let down of your expectations. For the drone pilot who wants better clarity immersive HD video for flying fun or for photography and video, I believe this is a must have. However for gamers who want that all immersive experience or anyone who intends on wearing this for long periods of time, I would pass on this product.The Glyph isn't particularly uncomfortable or heavy, but I wouldn't want to wear it beyond 20-30 minutes at at time. For any pilots out there, this fits like a pair of old fashioned David Clark headsets, meaning there is a lot of pressure trying to seal the headphones to your ear. They work, but not the most comfortable over time. I'm sure this will be addressed with the next generation of these, but for now long term comfort is not something the Glyph has going for it. That is why it's not well suited for gamers or those thinking of wearing this on a plane to watch a movie or do computer work. That shortcoming however is not a concern for drone pilots who only wear the headset for shorter durations at any given time. I have flown dozens and dozens of drone flights with the Glyph and absolutely love them for that purpose.The Glyph is far more comfortable that my Fat Shark Dominator V3's that I have previously used. The image is crisp and the resolution is excellent HD clarity. Initially I was a little concerned with the openness of the Glyph and whether or not sun glare would be a problem. My worries quickly were put to rest as there are zero issues with glare. In contrast I feel the openness of the Glyph is one of the biggest advantages for drone pilots over any other goggles on the market. You can easily takeoff, land, adjust your tablet / phone, see your surroundings and have conversions with people all while flying and having the Glyph on your head covering your eyes. All you do is look down with your eyes and you are open to the world around you. That means you can adjust camera / video settings, set up various smart flight modes or even walk to a different flying vantage point all while wearing the Glyph. You simply can't do that with any other product. Then when you're ready to focus back on flying, just look straight ahead and you're back flying through the Glyph.Since the Glyph is not like a traditional headset, you may be wondering what the image is like. It's similar to looking through a pair of binoculars. The first time you put them on you'll see one image, but with darker circular boarders at the edges or center of the image. You use the sliding adjustments and different nose pieces to get the best fit for you. Once that's done there is still a circle effect similar to binoculars, but inside that circle is a nice rectangular 16:9 image that's about the same perspective as watching a 100" tv from the couch 6'-7' away. It provides a great perspective free of glare that allows a serious drone pilot to see nuances that would otherwise not be visible. This is great for photography and videography and also allows the pilot to fly closer to terrain with confidence. Personally they can't make the image size big enough for my liking. I would love an IMAX like immersive experience, and hopefully subsequent versions may eventually go down that road. Keep in mind this is gen 1 product and just like how the first iPhone began to change the phone world, it was the second and third generations that made even greater jumps forward in usability. If you're a serious drone pilot, you need this. If you're just getting started with drones or fly just for fun, then you can probably wait unless you enjoy spending significant amounts of money on a cool toy.One other thing to consider is that your drone must have an HDMI output for the Glyph. For DJI products there is a module for $99 that replaces the one on your transmitter and has HDMI out. DJI Phantom 3 Professional / Advanced Quadcopter FPV Double-screen Display 720P Real-time HDMI Output Module (Pro/Adv) Part 54 You'll need an HDMI to mini HDMI adapter as well since the Glyph uses a standard size HDMI cable to plug into its video source.
