Hears the deal I have the phantom 4 the phantom 3 advanced and Autel xstar premium---  the real only difference is the phantom 4 if u own it  has obstacles avoidance- big deal if u need training wheels to fly your drone they u don't deserve to fly one anyway ----- the Autel has better customer support -- the remote is better lcd screen --- they all fly great but the Autel flys better cause it's easy and on your wallet much better product for the price.  If they both where in the air at 300 ft u wouldn't tell the difference except for the name on the drone when it comes down.  Dji waste of money to expensive and the case on the Autel is amazing not like a beer cooler case the dji gives on the phantom 4.  Be smart and get the Autel much better all around for the money.
