OK. I admit I am doing this review for the free data. But that also means I plan to keep it. Our family recently traveled to Japan and we used this device for 10 days.I will start with the pros,1, Easy to use. The screen information is straight froward.2, Fast enough. 4G speed is good, sometimes better than my LTE in Japan, same as my LTE in US (I bought an AT&T international package just in case).3, Good coverage. We traveled to Tokyo, Osaka, Sapporo, Furano, Noboribetsu. All 4G except Noboribetsu.4, Power bank is really handy. I can charge my phone in the backpack since the iphone's battery dies so quickly.Cons,1, Consume data like crazy. One day when my wife used her phone through wifi to look up some address, 300MB were gone.2, A little bit heavy.3, Logging in takes some time. Every time I turn it on, it takes about 30 seconds to log in.My advice if you want to keep it,It took me a while to really understand that this is wifi, not cellular data. A lot of functions will operate in wifi environment, not LTE. Such as background refresh, software download and update, etc. My biggest problem is that we have all the pictures and videos stored in the icloud. Whenever we took a photo, it will be automatically available to all our devices. So once that devices connected to the wifi, it will start downloading or uploading. It so happens we love taking photos... That was what happened when my wife connected to the wifi the first time.Also, I don't think topping up is worth it considering the risk of burning data. Buy packages if they are available in your staying country. If you are careless as I were, try to buy a sim card with unlimited daily plan and use the sim slot.
