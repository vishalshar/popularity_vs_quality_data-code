I purchased this because my puppy tested positive for demodex mites. Since mites are on all dogs and only cause problems with animals with compromised immune systems, it only made sense to treat the problem from the inside just as much as the outside. I managed to avid the costly, toxic treatments recommended by the vet by feeding him this every day and washing him with Jason's brand dandruf relief shampoo every week.
