This is a really cool device. I have managed to make some pretty incredible steaks and salmon with it. I haven't had as much luck with eggs, they never seem to come out as described by the manual. But it does make cooking steak really easy. I had trouble with my first one getting stuck in "reset" mode and had to exchange it for a replacement. They gave me no trouble about replacing it, it just took awhile to process the return and get the new one. I've also used it to thaw frozen meat quickly following America's Test Kitchen's guide of using 140 degree (f) water for 8 minutes. It hasn't replaced every other cooking method but it certainly has its place in the kitchen. It doesn't take up much space in my already-over-full kitchen so for me it's worth having it around.
