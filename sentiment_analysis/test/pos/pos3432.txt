I'm on my second bottle. My little Maltese had cancer and was going through chemo. I purchased this in the beginning of 2015 with hopes of boosting her immune system and get her through the chemo treatments. She has recovered and  she is like a new puppy now. (knock on wood). I am now giving it to both of my dogs daily.  I would highly recommend this product especially for ill dogs.
