I had read that Sichuan peppercorn flavor couldn't be preserved.  Apparently that's not the case.  These have a wonderful, dose dependent, Mal La flavor.  One or two peas yields only the slightest tingle.  A dozen or so brings it on full tilt.  Since I live 100 miles from the closest credible Sichuan restaurant and since I often crave the sensation, these are perfect for me.  But, judging from some of the other reviews here, people don't know what they're in for when they order them and that's a shame lest their down votes keep someone that's into this sort of cuisine from trying them.
