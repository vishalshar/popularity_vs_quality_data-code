This speaker sounds as good as my Bose Sound Link speaker, but the vertical format, with its small footprint, works much better on my kitchen counter.  I don't know how useful the zippered covers are, but since I'm using mine in the kitchen, it may turn out to be very valuable.  I got the charcoal gray cover, and it looks great!
