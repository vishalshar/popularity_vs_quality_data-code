I really do like these, they're different. I took one star off because they have limited stretch, which is fine except at the top.  If your feet are wide, or high at the instep, these might stretch beyond their ability to not break, especially after you've taken your shoes on & off frequently.  But, other than that they're great!  I love that each is separate, so if one does break you don't have to replace everything (like you would with a single lace), and you could still wear your shoe until you replace the broken one (not so with a single lace), and being individual "laces" it gives you the ability to mix and match colors!  :-)  These are fun, very functional, and I recommend them.
