I'm having a great time with my new Mynt.  I've tried lots of other trackers including Tile and Stick-n-Find but so far I'm very impressed.  SetupIs quick and easy, and the bidirectional tracker lets me find my phone or my Mynt - tagged devices.  I'm just starting to explore the extra functions, I used it as a remote shutter today and look forward to trying it as a presentation remote in the future.Clearly I need more of these to track my keys, my bags, and everything else.  The small size makes this more convenient and less noticible than other trackers I've used.
