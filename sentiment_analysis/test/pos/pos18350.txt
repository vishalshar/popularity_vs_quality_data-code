opened the box with my 4yo who was just smiling ear to ear to get at the pieces. We read a lot about space so within about 10 min he counted out the right pieces and put his first rocket ship together. As a parent I loved1. It gets him thinking about problem solving.2. When put together each structure is sturdy (he immediately crashed his spaceship into... well everything, and it didn't crumble)3. It wasn't just another licensed superhero or branded set4. He already is thinking about what to build next because it comes with multiple suggestions, a website and app.5. Most of all it keeps him engaged both in the building and creative play after. His spaceship landed on Mars before continuing to the outer reaches of the Milky Way.Great product, the packaging is smart and looks sharp, bonus it's all environmentally friendly!
