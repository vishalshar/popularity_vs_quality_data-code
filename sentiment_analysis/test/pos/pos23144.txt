I bought this to take with my on my paddleboard and specifically wanted the square design so it would stay in one place and not roll all over the board while paddling. This is the perfect bottle! Just a great design! It's easy to keep clean also since both the top and the bottom come off. So far no leaks. Very pleased with this bottle.
