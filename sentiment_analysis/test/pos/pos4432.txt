I was really skeptical about specialized bags for cheese...  After purchasing some larger quantities of nice cheese, I figured spending a few dollars to try to preserve it wouldn't be a bad investment.  Especially after losing cheese to ziploc bags and plastic wrap.  I was really surprised at how well the cheese held up, and for how long!  Our cheese was in great shape, even several weeks later!  No moldy spots, no soggy or dried out cheese, just ready to eat, yummy cheese.  I used this on firm and semi-firm cheeses and both worked well.  I have not tried this with softer cheese.
