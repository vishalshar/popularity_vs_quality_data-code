I'm sure that the Pono isn't for everyone as the features are specifically for those who actually listen to the music. If music is just background noise to shut out the world - and that's OK - the Pono is too much work. But as an engineer and a musician, this is exactly what I was looking for. A little work is in order to get the full benefit. First off, get rid of all MP3's. Out of 1200 albums, I have about 300 that I'd downloaded from Apple or had imported from a CD using MP3 rather than loss less compression. I copied over a couple dozens clips at random to the Pono Player and was able to identify the MP3 copies within 10 seconds of playing each. The difference is that  profound. That's when I realized that the iPad simple beats the hell out of all formats, so everything sounds mediocre but homogeneous. This also explains why I stopped listening to music from the iPad and iPhone. After the MP3s are gone, CD quality should be the minimum level for all material. The Ayre Digital to Analog (D to A) converter is vastly superior to anything in the standard commercial world. This is a manufacturer that deals exclusively with high end audio and it is really amazing what they've done in this little package. So even CD quality is pristine and well above what you'd get from most CD players. Next, it doesn't support blue tooth or WiFi and that is a good thing. Blue tooth is another technology that negatively impacts audio quality. And Wifi isn't much better. The USB interface works great and it's easy to add a library by just copying to Micro SD chips.  In your car, get a really good 3.5 mm cable to plug into the AUX input that hopefully you have. The sound system in my Avalon finally sounds impressive! And get a good set of headphones. If you record your own material in the studio, it plays WAV files and sounds as good as any reference monitor. And speaking of active monitors, the Pono supports a balanced line output configuration that allows you to connect directly to powered studio monitors. My monitors sound unbelievable with this unit plugged in. So this is definitely my "toy of the year"!I wanted to add some additional comments: for those who mention the power issue, I understand that can be annoying. However, I finally read the little manual that comes with the Pono (don't tell anyone) and turning off the screen does help substantially. And I bailed and bought an external power unit that can also charge my phone, iPad, etc.I know this seems like a big failure on the part of the designers, but from an engineering standpoint, I'm guessing that this is a result of not cutting corners so that quality is preserved. When you cheat to make the thing work for longer periods of time, there are deficits somewhere, so I'm glad they didn't go that route.The other thing that people mention is the speed at which the interface works in transferring files.Once you start adding material to Micro SD chips (versus the on board memory), you can do that directly to the memory stick and it's all a matter of the hardware at that point. Plug into a USB 3.0 compliant port and buy Micro SD chips that support the highest bandwidth. I haven't found much of a difference using different USB to Micro SD adapters aside, obviously, for the differences between USB 2.0 and USB 3.0. So make sure the adapter supports 3.0.A few people have mentioned that they hate the JWorld PC application. I've found that it allows me to do everything I want to do with re-arranging my Library and is significantly better than iTunes. But it's powerful because I already know a lot about how they handle their file system. That may not be something for everyone, but for the knowledgeable, it rocks!So I'm still loving it and having loads of fun listening to music that doesn't sound damaged.
