Had serious, serious doubts about this product after reading all the reviews and numerous articles, etc. Totally took a chance with it when I bought it but I'm SO happy I did. I love it! Awesome product, great, vivid colors, and totally awesome functionality. Seriously, this bulb is the bulb of the future. It's my first dive into smart home tech and I'm addicted. Awesome product, would DEFINITELY (and have) recommended this to friends and family.Don't let the horror stories deter you from purchasing. It is kind of expensive in comparison to other Bluetooth bulbs out there, but this product is far superior to them and much more cost effective than the others that require a centralized hub. For this one, you phone is the hub. Great product!
