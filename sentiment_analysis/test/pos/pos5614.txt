I read all of the reviews both on Amazon and those by cnet and pc world, that being said we knew what to expect as far as things that others did not like about Triby and decided to give it a try anyway.  After having it for a few days I can honestly say that we love it.  The sound is great for listening to music, the call quality is clear, and not even our youngest has experienced any problems with Alexa not understanding commands.  The selling feature for us was the two call buttons even though our kids know our cell phone numbers, I liked the simplicity of just pushing a button as opposed to dialing a landline (yes we still have one).  The little text feature isn't that great but the kids do like that I send them little notes even if we are all home.  Lastly Alexa playing any band or genre on request is really just the icing on the cake.  Overall I think if you are looking for something super techy this probably is not it but if you want a good speaker with some other cool features Triby is for you.
