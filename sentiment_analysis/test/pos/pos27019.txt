I absolutely love these!! I tried them on as soon as I pulled them out the box and man are they comfortable. My biggest gripe about headphones is sound quality. I watched the beginning of BVS at full volume and assumed the head set was limited, volume wise. Then I got the bright idea to go into my ps4 settings and turn the device volume up....OMG! Damn good product and would recommend to anyone looking for a new pair. They dont feel cheap either so I dont expect them to break like others I have purchased.
