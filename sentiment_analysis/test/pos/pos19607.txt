Gone are the 5AM feeding calls. The webcam is a great feature too, because it gives me the freedom of knowing that my cat eats in the evenings while I'm at work.  With the Feed and Go Smart Pet Feeder I was also able to put my cat on a wet food feeding schedule; which has helped with his weight gain and improved his health. If you're looking for a pet feeder that's worry free and a sleep saver-this is it!
