I really wanted to keep this case. The magnetic feature is great and its mounting port feature was appealing. However, I would have preferred if the edges of the case was raised a bit, in the event that the phone fell on its face. I was not interested in purchasing a screen protector. I used a competitor's product in the past and my phone fell a few times ( on the train platform and in the street, etc) and the screen NEVER scratched or shattered. I am returning this case for the reason that I don't believe my screen will be protected.
