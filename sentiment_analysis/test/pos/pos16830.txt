This is a nice watch. The only drawback in my opinion is you need to have decent light to read the time. Since there are no traditional hands, one has to be able to see the numbers. It would be interesting if the manufacturer were able to apply luminous material to the halo's and cardinal positions. Watch is on the heavy side and pretty thick but it is an automatic so it's expected. I've had the watch for four days. It keeps good time so far. I'm happy with the purchase.
