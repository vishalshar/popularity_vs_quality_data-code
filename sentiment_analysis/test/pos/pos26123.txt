His review answered one of my own questions. I was sent this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and the first one I received did not work and the company responded and sent me a replacement soon after receiving my support request. The second product worked like a charm and was working within 3 minutes of opening up the package [this includes rooting around for 3 AAA batteries since they are not included]. The video I attached shows the cycle through of the colors and then at the end it shows where we had the lights on and the IllumiBowl lighting up within a second of darkness. I think I am going to love this product because I'm super sensitive to light when I'm tired and usually the bright lights of the bathroom wake me up.Con: I think the suction cup is on the wrong side of the illimi-light part of the product. As you can see in the photo of it attached to our toilet the wire is twisted some to get the suction cup onto the bowl because the cord itself was not long enough to go anywhere else. I can see where you'd need to sanitize and clean this product often especially if you have boys like me.Overall, I think this is a super neat product and I hope it stays working continuously for a long time to come! If for some reason this product stops working after a few months I will make sure to update this review accordingly. I would suggest that if you have had issues with this product to contact support because they sent me a replacement for a product that didn't work and I'm sure they will do the same in other cases. I was not compensated for this product in any way nor was I requested or required to rate this product as 5 stars.
