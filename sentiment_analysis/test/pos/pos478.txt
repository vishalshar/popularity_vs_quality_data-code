This refill pack saves us a ton of money. Normally it cost $20 for 1 pack (it also comes with the special tray) at the store where we bought the ScoopFree self cleaning cat litter tray. The system works great and there is no need to replace tray and crystals for about 2 weeks. Instead of tossing the tray with its own lid we just dump the crystals. Scrape the bottom with a pooper scooper then refill with new. Exact same crystals but $15 for two of the same size. Compared to $40! Reordering right now.
