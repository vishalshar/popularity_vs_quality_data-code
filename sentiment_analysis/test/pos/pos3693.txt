The portion of this food is clearly for tiny dogs but my dogs can't read.  Anything with poultry as the primary source is a big hit with my pack.  I can use this to top off my finicky GSD's dry kibble.  She won't eat kibble any other way.The stuff has a lot of broth and looks like something that would go in a chicken or turkey pot pie. Small carrots, peas and potatoes are visible.  There are no annoying aromatizers in this food.  The plastic is not recyclable.Pictured is the Turkey and Hearty Vegetable Recipe in Gravy
