Surprisingly nice phone. First of all it's huge but that's what I wanted. But it's very well built not cheap at all. It connected to T-Mobile LTE no problems I didn't have to adjust APN settings. Display is bright and very nice, not galaxy amoled bright but a nice screen anyway. Except for the typical IOS annoying launcher this is stock lollipop. Changed to Nova. Of course battery lasts well over a day, I had 45% leftover by bedtime. I was happy the phone came with its own screen protector and case.  I wish it used microsd card but 32GB internal was ok.  Overall an excellent phone hopefully posh will come out with some competition for these $800-$1000 phones on the market.Added: Amazed how good this phone is for $200!!! Its not a gaming phone (obliviously) but it is as good as any Samsung or LG out there.
