In my opinion anyone who is serious about their X-Star Premium drone should get at least one extra battery. I personally ordered 2 additional batteries. When you are flying your drone somewhere in nature one battery is just not enough to get all the footage you planned for.This battery is the only option available for the Autel Robotics X-Star Premium Drone replacement battery. The battery is the same as the one that comes with the drone. Officially it provides about 25 minutes of flying experience however for safety precautions and responsible flying I recommend landing your drone at 15-20 minutes and swapping the battery out. It takes on average an hour to charge. In order to preserve your battery's charge its recommended that you do not keep it inside your drone when not in use. The hard case that the X-Star Premium drone comes in has cutouts for 4 extra batteries. Every new battery you purchase should get a firmware update prior to use to maximize flight time and optimize battery use. The firmware update for batteries only takes 2 minutes. When charging your battery it is best to not overcharge it. So when the battery's LEDs go off - your battery should be disconnected from the charger. Don't forget to pick the right color of this battery to match the color of your drone.The price for Autel drone battery fluctuates on Amazon from $115 to $130. Amazon does not provide price adjustments anymore. So if you are not in a rush just wait until it's $115 again.Overall, I'm satisfied with the product.
