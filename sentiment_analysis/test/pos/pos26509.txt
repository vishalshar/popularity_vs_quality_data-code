I recently reorganized my pantry and am storing a lot of my baking supplies in stout, wide mouth, Ball pint jars. I needed a lid with a spout for my vanilla and this fit the bill. The seal is excellent and it met all of my expectations. I would definitely purchase again if I have a need in the future. My one and only complaint is the price which seems steep for a lid. With that said I found no other option available and it functions excellently!
