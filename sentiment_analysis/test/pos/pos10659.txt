My 10 year old daughter and 8 year old son love playing with Chirpie! They love to hold her as she is so soft cuddly, and also toss her in the air as she makes lots of funny interactive sounds.  The technology for the games is amazing! The toy knows when it's in the air or when it falls on the ground!  It's voice is cute too and easily understandable.  Makes a great affordable Christmas present.  So happy we bought it!
