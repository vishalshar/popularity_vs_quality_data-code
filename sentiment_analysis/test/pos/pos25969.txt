I previously had the wireless Line 6 body pack. The plug on that became an issue from going in and out of my pocket and whatever else happens during playing a guitar and eventually it would only give intermittent signal. This is great because its straightforward no moving additional pieces its plug and go. the only downside so far is that you have to be careful when you put your guitar into a stand or set it down (right now I just unplug it and stick the transmitter in my pocket when I'm going off stage. Obviously its a rigid connection so there's no give if you set it down or if you run in to something or someone it's either going to break the transmitter or it's going to break the guitar...thus far I've been able to avoid both. Functionally though the range is amazing, the charger works great and I haven't seen any signal quality loss.
