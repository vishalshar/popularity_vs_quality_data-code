Love it!!  It arrived in a timely manner.  Good Spread is indeed very easy to spread and very tasty.  I like the fact thatsome of the money is donated for a good cause.  I first tasted a sample of Good Spread while at a Christian conventionwherein they were giving away samples.  I was not able to purchase the Peanut Butter there and knew I would be sendingfor some.  I am not disappointed.
