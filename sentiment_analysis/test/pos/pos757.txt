I just purchase this and washed and put it on the bed right away. It is soft and doesn't make noise when you move around in bed. It washed beautifully and looks and feels great!I haven't spilled anything on it so can't say about the waterproof part yet but if it works a well as it is quiet and comfortable it should be great!
