Needed to get this because my wife's phone (Galaxy Note 5) will NOT work with the Smart LockGreat addition to the August products (probably should be included with the lock due to the finicky Bluetooth issues with the lock).  Works good, easy to set up, however:1) Even when people are clearly setup in the system with codes, the log shows them as "Unknown User"  when using the keypad2) Why doesn't the keypad connect to the angled Doorbell Cam block?3) Sometimes there is a couple of second pause after entering the code before the lock responds.  Just enough to be annoying and make you wonder if you actually entered the code4) $79 is wayyyy to expensive for this.
