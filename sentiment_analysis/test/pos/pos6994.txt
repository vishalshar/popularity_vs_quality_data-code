Our dog was diagnosed with anal gland carcinoma in August. It was removed. We tried her on a medication prescribed by the vet - but it upset her stomach too badly so we took her off of it. We found this and have had her on it since September. Her checkup this week did not show any signs of new nodes etc. Our belief is that anything like this is more helpful for their immune systems and will gladly keep her on it. She loves it also, so that is a plus!
