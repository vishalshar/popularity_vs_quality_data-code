Built like a tank, sounds great, and it gets way louder than I could ever need it to.  I bought this with an Amazon Dot so I could have hands free music in my workshop.  Sound quality is great, and connecting to the Dot was quick an easy.  The waterproof claim is no joke.  Left it outside behind the house all night during a heavy rain storm to test it.  The next day, it was still on, and still had battery life in it. Hosed it off and put it back in the shop.  I'm confident this will be a great addition on camping trips.  Its not going to fit in a backpack, but for what you lose size wise, you gain in sound quality, durability, and battery life.
