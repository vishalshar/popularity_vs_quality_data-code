We have two sous vide units: the Sansaire which we bought first, and the Anova WiFi which we bought later so we could do two cooks at the same time.The Sansaire heats faster, and is really easy to set in the container and forget. But I prefer the Anova because of the ability to connect via bluetooth and Wifi and control the cook remotely. It's great to be able to put the food in an ice bath all day and then start the cook from my office mid-day. Get home, and the food is cooked.Now I use the Sansaire for those longer multi-day cooks.
