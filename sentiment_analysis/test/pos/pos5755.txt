A wheel that can both grip well and slide is honestly a must have. I cruise down the main avenue of my town and all eyes are on these unique looking wheels. I would love if you guys made larger sizes like 80mm or 90, it would really make the wheel more sustainable to cracks or pebbles in sidewalks or roads.
