So far, so great! I was a bit apprehensive prior to this purchase. I am not really fond of pushy advertising (there are subway adds for these mattresses everywhere), and I have never purchased a foam mattress. This mattress was worth every penny. I have always spent small fortunes on mattresses, and was happy to pay less. Really comfy, no shifting for the other person in bed, and a great price. It would have made for a very comical Youtube video, but I managed to unload and place it onto my frame, the Zinus 14 inch SmartBase Mattress Foundation, by myself. It's pretty darn heavy, and instructs team lifting which I would whole heartedly support.I did some research and asked a number of friends which foam mattresses they recommend. The Casper and Tuft and Needle both got consistently good reviews. The Needle was a bit to firm for some. Both have 100 day money back guarantees, so I really couldn't go wrong. I am very happy with this purchase.
