Four Month Update.So far I have had to use this to recover my pups 11 times.  All eleven times i have been successful.  Gets me within 20 yards of my dogs every time.  The last time, which as this morning was after them escaping into the woods and me not being able to physically get to them.  I tracked them occasionally overnight, and at 6 this morning Whistle gave me a location near a church 4 miles away.  I drove there parked retracked again, and took 30 steps, and there they were.The device does not detect a zone break right away, seems to be within 5 minutes though.  It is not a big deal for me since they run so fast, away from the house that 5 minutes does not matter.So four months later still satisfied.  The battery life for my tracker is great.  I can keep it on the pups around 4 days between charges (though i like to charged more frequently so i can track longer if they escape)Having had this for a month I'll give my thoughts.  I set it up with a pretty wide zone for my two dogs to be in.  When they get out they run fast, and thinking I can catch them close by the house is impossible.  When inside the zone any try at location only says they are neat base station.  But yesterday the dogs got out, and I immediately started tracking them.  The tracking every three minutes was ineffective, so I started just requesting GPS updates.  Long story short is that within 10 minutes I had recovered both my dogs, The had went about 1/2 mile away.  Well today they escaped through the front door when the kids left it open, 15 minutes later I had tracked then down, as they were  running along a ditch.  Pulled up to a crossing street and there they were.  So perfect no, but able to track and recover your pet, absolutely.Fyi, I think if you think this will work in apartment with your cat getting out and going down hall, I would be doubtful, but outide with good GPS and cell coverage its dead on.
