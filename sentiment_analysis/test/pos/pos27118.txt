We started off with this brand for a new puppy from a rescue center and it was what they had him on. he did well on it but they do not sell this brand locally in my area so we slowly switch our dog over to another brand of a good quality. He end up with inconsistence poops while on the other brand and it seem to be getting worse. We switch him back to this and he now back to normal.
