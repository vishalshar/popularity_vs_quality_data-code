I've given it five stars because it proved my expectations to be incorrect.I received the product on Aug 14, 2013. I'm still in the middle of my 12 week usage period. At first, I was a skeptic, but I was also desperate. I needed a product that could reduce my eczema to the point of either completely restored skin or where it seems that I don't even have eczema.Having eczema is a disqualification that is (or was) preventing me from joining the U.S. Air Force. My friend recommended this product to me from Amazon (yay, amazon). I saw all of the positive reviews and thought that this would be worth trying. Additionally, there was the possibility of part of the 15% of people who didn't benefit from the cream. So, I spent the money, and gave it a shot.This was truly my first test of patience. Within a few weeks, I started seeing results. It was still itching here and there, but with continued use came the exponential relief. Within the second month, it's as if I don't even have excema. Air Force, here I come. :)I strongly recommend this product, and if you're a skeptic, just try it out anyway. It's better rely on something promising than to continue using petroleum-based lotions.
