It's the best mount for the MstickÂ—the only alternative I can think of would be to use the tripod mount on the Mstick with a camera mount for bikes, but then you don't have a quick release for your ~$70 light that you don't want to leave on your bike.My only complaint is that it has no tube-mounting alternative. It can only be atttached in two positions on the underside of a bike seat. I would like to put it on my rear cargo rack, but there's no way to do that. I would like to put the Mstick on my handlebars, but this mount won't do that either.
