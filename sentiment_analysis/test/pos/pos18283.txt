I have very thin hair and have tried everything to give it some volume. My hair stylist tried this product on me then just gave me the rest of the bottle. I used it all up and ordered more here on Amazon. I love this product so much, it is one of my three favorite products I use all the time. Just shake the powder onto your roots then rub it in with your hands, you can bend over and mess with it upside down for even more volume. The powder changes the texture of your hair, making it more coarse, making it plumper. My hair stylist has short hair and she uses it to get crazy volume and she told me that she just runs her hands through her hair and messes it up a little to reactivate, for lack of a better word, the powder and get the volume back. I recommend this for anyone with thin hair or who just wants to give it more volume without the stickiness of hairspray and the lack of hold hairspray has. Also, package came quickly.
