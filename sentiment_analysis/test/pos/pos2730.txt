With the new firm ware update this thing is awesome. I just used this on the back of my bike with the DALMAC. It rained everyday and the speaker kept right on playing. When i first purchased this product i took it on some 4 lane roads with my bike and was disappointed that I could not here music at all. I tried the firmware update and the difference was day and night.  In loud mode this speaker is easily listenable on a four lane road in the rain with semi-trucks driving by.It connects to my droid razr max very easily as well as the laptop.The battery last a long time. I had the speaker turned up all the way on "loud mode"-which comes with the new update. After 9 hours of bike riding the speaker playing full blast Pandora bluetooth streaming it still was at 50% battery.The sound quality is great, in normal mode or in loud mode.  I had so many people impressed with this tiny little box, many thought it was Bose just from the sounds quality that they could hear on there bikes as they rode 50 ft in front or behind.JSYK, the Beatles really kick out of this speaker!
