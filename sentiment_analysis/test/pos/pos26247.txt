I got this as a gift for a friend who definitely should have been born in the Viking Era. What I like about this horn is the included stand, strap and clean look of it.While it would be nice to have an extremely natural aged look, from what I could tell other brands that tried that had weak horns that cracked or fell apart. However, this horn looks like it will be there for the long run.I'm definitely considering getting one for myself.
