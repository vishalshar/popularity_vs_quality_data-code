Tangy, right amount of flavor (not too salty,  a lot of snacks in the market are really too salty!) Initially came across this item at Thrive Market. Ran out of it, I was gonna buy it from Thrive but I didn't have any other items I need from there (normally its free shipping with $50 order over there). So I bought some from here, although it is a lil bit more expensive here, but only by around 25 cents.
