Contrary to people who have bad experiences, I have had nothing but the best out of this product and the customer service is excellent. I did not need customer assistance but I was contacted to ensure I was happy and to ask if I had any suggestions for future versions. Awesome!This treat cam does everything it is advertised to do and IT DOES IT SOOOOO FREAKING WELL. This is the best $170 I have ever spent because my pets mean everything to me. To be able to interact with my pets when I am not home is heavenly.  I have been pushing this product and suggesting it like crazy to all I know with pets. No, I am in NO WAY affiliated with the people who make this product but any pet owner will love it and your pets will too. Just need to control the treating factor so you don't fatten up your pets! LOL!!!The speaker clarity is really nice. We tested different volumes for our speaking voices and set it up so we can be heard like as if we were actually in the room.The snapshot feature works great too. That's a nice feature and we use it often.The EVO cat treats really do fly about 3-4 feet outward on a bare floor. We ended up putting a rug in the line of fire so the treats would stay localized to one area. I attached a couple of photos, but resized the snapshots to not show the entire wide angle of the lens, which is a pretty good lens.The performance, functionality, operation, set-up all deserve 5 stars. You seriously will not be disappointed and neither will your pets!
