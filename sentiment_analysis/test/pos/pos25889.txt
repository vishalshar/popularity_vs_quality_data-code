Great device.  Wish I could design my own watch face with time, date, and battery, nothing else.  Also could use a longer battery life, but it's not bad as far as smart devices go.  Two and a half days means I can do a weekend camping trip - leave Friday and it still displays time late Sunday in low battery mode.  Otherwise, great non-scratch face, and I know I've definitely tested it.  I wear it on my inner wrist (more accurate HR, I think) and the face rubs on anything I lift (rocks and trees mostly).  Definitely worth every penny, in my humble opinion.
