I got these in one month's Barkbox (which is great, btw) and my dog absolutely loved them. I think we taught him six or seven new tricks using these alone. However when I ordered more, I received the chicken flavor, albeit in a timely fashion. He likes those well enough but I prefer the peanut butter ones for their squishiness in stuffing toys. So, a little disappointed there, but these are great dog treats and Amazon wasn't slow with my shipment, so ok.
