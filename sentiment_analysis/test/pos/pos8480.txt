I'm not guitar pro, but I know sound quality.I replaced a 75w spyder I picked up a while back.I have an EMG 81/85 set up, and the quality this amp puts out is amazing. Tone is crystal.As a stand alone, I'd say it's competitive.The gimmick is the AMPLIFi. The app let's you customize to your hearts content. Honestly, it's overwhelming how much there is to play with. I've found FANTASTIC set ups for what I like to play. You can also go online via the app and download presets other people have made, which is hit or miss, but a great starting point.The only thing I didn't like was A. Not being able to use the amp with Android out of the box. You have to update the firmware via a USB Type B cable and your PC, OR, you can use an iPhone to update it, then it's compatible with Apple & Android.There aren't a WHOLE lot of quality presets available... I mean if you look for something obscure, it's gonna be hit or miss finding an uploaded tone. And even then, a lot of the tones, to me, aren't quite there. Trying to match the riff from "Comfortably Numb" via the Tone Finder gave a lot of hopefuls but only 1 or 2 were close enough for comfort.All in all, I love the amp. If more people actively used the app and they keep working on the tone matching, there wouldn't be a lot of reason not to grab this vs $500 in pedals.
