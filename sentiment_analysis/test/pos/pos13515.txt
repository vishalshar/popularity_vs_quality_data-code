This fit the mason jar soap dispenser I bought just perfectly.  It's very basic and not terribly stylish, but at least my soap no longer comes out green, which was happening with the original mason jar soap dispenser I bought that came with a brass pump that quickly oxidized and ruined my soap.  This pump saved me from having to buy a whole new dispenser.  I only wish it came in different colors to match my toothbrush holder.
