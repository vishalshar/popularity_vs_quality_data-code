I wanted  a "made in USA" honey jar, which I couldn't find, so I made my own with a Mason jar and this cap.  I fear China made products these days and buy USA whenever I can.  I store nearly all my dry goods (beans, rice, flour, sugars) in Mason jars and the set of 4 caps means I can find other creative uses.  These caps seem to be high quality and I will most likely purchase more in the future.
