I love all my click n curl brush sizes. Then help create a voluminous blow dry style and I recommend a brush size appropriate for my clients length , texture and/or desired result. The red is good for short to medium hair no longer than 6-8 inches in length. These are made for a professional blow dry at home but I also use them daily in the salon. My clients love the results.
