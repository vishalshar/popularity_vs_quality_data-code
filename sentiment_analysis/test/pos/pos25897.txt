The only thing it needs is dedicated volume control for the blue tooth connection, and that's nit picking.  Does exactly what you think it will.  Go to a video website and search for guitar backing tracks and pair it up!  I would definitely buy again or even upgrade to a larger model, or add the footboard.  The app is nice and easy as well.
