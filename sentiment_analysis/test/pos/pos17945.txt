Smart and beautiful! The best gift ever!As usual, Amazon reviews use to demonize the product, so I was a bit skeptical about buying this for my girlfriend. I decided to give it a try after watching some youtube reviews and I can say that this is by far the best gift I have bought her!I have to say that she is pretty outdoorsy, but she tends not to have enough time for workouts, or at least, regular exercise. Also, she is pretty busy running her errands during the day, so I needed something to keep up with her. She tried to use her friends fitness tracking bracelet, but she found it inappropriate for using on business meetings or festive occasions (she does a lot of them). Thats why the Leaf performs brilliantly  it is discreet if she wants that, but also can be real eye catcher  depending on how she wears it (I was with her on several occasions when she was complimented). I dont know if that applies to all purchases, but the seller included the leather bracelet (really good quality), what was really unexpected and nice add-on.Installing and syncing went smoothly, even after she replaced her old phone (she used the same account). Period tracker is something couples will appreciate, and she especially likes the sleep monitoring function. We compared it with my (more expensive) watch tracker and she got almost the same results. The great this about the application is the it gives you some kind of personalized encouraging and motivating messages on your fitness progress. I also love to see how my girlfriend cares about her fitness shape as she just started joining me on a morning runs. I look forward to seeing the future mobile app progress. Perhaps, they can add the possibility of calorie intake or more weekly/monthly statistics.
