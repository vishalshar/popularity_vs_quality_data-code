If you don't have this already, you need to get some. I switch from the expensive MAC cleaner to this. It does the same or better job as the expensive ones, but you get a bonus, the brush guards and drying cup. This left my brushes fresh and back in new condition. They looked like new brushes after the first use. Also, this product is pushing a much need message, "Clean your makeup brushes, keeps your makeup contaminate free and last longer". In exchanged some of the breakout you're having will disappear after you start cleaning your utensils after each use.
