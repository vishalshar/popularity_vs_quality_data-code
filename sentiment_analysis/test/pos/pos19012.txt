Nice product, it is amazing how technology has advanced! It took me less than 5 minutes to set up the camera and iPhone application and start to use it immediately. This camera is neatly designed to go alone with my Apple devices. It has good resolution and relatively wide angle too. Really great product for reasonable price, I am now able to visit my home virtually and watch my kids play from anywhere in the world or just from my bedroom upstairs. Need to buy a couple more to install on my patio and living room! Great product!!
