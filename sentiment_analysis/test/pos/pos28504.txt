LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this phone!  I purchased this phone for my elderly mom who was in the hospital for 8 weeks.  She had absolutely nothing to do but watch tv and talk on the phone.  In 8 weeks she talked almost 5000 minutes!  One of the great things about this phone is that when you are setting it up you have the option to set it up to regular smart phone mode or "senior" smart phone mode.  The senior mode is larger.  Very large.  It has a lot of features that we have not used yet, such as health advice, etc.  One of the things I really like is the brain games.  It comes installed on the phone so you don't have to download anything.  My mom has had several strokes and these games are really good for her to work her brain.  The one she likes is simple matching colors and shapes.  It starts off easy and gets a little harder.  I also like that you don't have to "swipe" to turn the phone on.  My mom can NOT swipe!  With this phone you turn it on by touching 3 circles.  Circle 1, 2 and 3.  They are big circles and easy for her to touch.To get minutes on this phone you just sign on to Great Call. It was easy to set up an account and sign her up for a monthly minute package.  They offer several different ones and they were actually cheaper than what I am paying for straight talk.  In fact, when she gets out of the hospital I am thinking about stealing her phone and making it mine!
