I absolutely recommend the cheese bags, especially for those of us who are lovers of a variety of cheeses. Cheese lasts for weeks. As a single person, a chunk of Parmesan or cheddar has gone bad before I can use it all. Now I have no waste at all. This is a great product and reasonably priced for its value.
