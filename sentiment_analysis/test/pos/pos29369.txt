This is one of the best pet products I have ever purchased. It is well designed and it's worth every dollar. For the quality and function of this product, the price isn't expensive at all. Think about it, a well-built automatic feeder with built in web cam, how much would you have to pay if you bought them separately? let alone the online app that allows you to schedule the feeds, and being able to call your pets via the built in speaker. By the way, the feeder setup process is much easier to setup than many of the baby cams I bought somewhere else !I also need to praised their amazing customer service that's extremely knowledgeable about customers' need and willing to help you make the most out of this product. Rest assure that you will never be left in the darkness if you had any questions or concerns about using this product, and that makes me a 100% satisfied customer.
