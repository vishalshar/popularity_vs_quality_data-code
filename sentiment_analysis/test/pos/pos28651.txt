The Trophy Skin Red Light Therapy light is easy to use, and the fact that this treatment only takes five minutes is a big plus.I used it at least 5 times a week as directed for four weeks, and do believe I see improvements in my skin. It enhances the skin's overall plumpness and elasticity, and gives my skin a healthy glow. Enlarged pores were never much of a concern for me, but they do appear smaller now. Now I will continue with maintenance treatments a few times per week, as suggested.When I received the device, I emailed customer service with a couple of questions, and they got back to me quickly. My only complaint is the white rubber goggles that came with the device let too much brightness in, even with the eyes closed underneath the goggles. It might be better if it came with a darker goggle that blocked more light for enhanced eye comfort. Overall, I'm very glad I purchased this device.
