I've only recently started playing Anki Overdrive, and it's been fun, but it was missing something. Namely, a car that was red. Well, predominantly red. That was why I got Thermo. The metallic red fading to black with the gold-plated grill looks amazing. Which is all well and good, but we want to win races, too, don't we? Fortunately, Thermo is alarmingly fast, faster than any other car at the time of this review, and able to quickly put distance between itself and any other car. And even better, it has excellent weapons. The Flamethrower is a nice area-of-effect weapon, but my preference is for the Radiant Beam, a weapon which has seemingly unlimited range, affects objects in front of it within a narrow cone, and has terrifying damage if used correctly. For the ultimate devastating wombo combo, however, you must pair the radiant beam with Retro Rockets, which make you briefly go backwards.How is that devastating, you wonder? Imagine: You're on a straightaway and your opponents are some distance behind you. You want to seriously ruin their day. So what do you do? Get a good charge on the Radiant Beam, hit the Retro Rockets, fire the Beam right into their faces, then release the Retro Rockets and continue on your merry way while your opponents' cars are melting into piles of slag. It's *great.* But watch your energy!Thermo is far from unstoppable, however. Indeed, with his wafer-thin armor, he is quite stoppable if the other racers nail him with their attacks. Tractor beam attacks are also a serious problem for Thermo, perhaps moreso than the other cars since he relies so much on his speed. To avoid all of this, you'll need to maneuver carefully and use your abilities to the fullest. It is better to let your opponent briefly take the lead than let him disable you, so don't be afraid to ease up on the throttle.If you're wondering if Thermo is a good pick for an expansion car, the answer is "Of course!" Just be aware of his limitations and you should do fine with him.
