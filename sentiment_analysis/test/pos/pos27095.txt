I though these might be a gimmick when I purchased them.  How can a paper bag help protect your cheese?  But they worked!  Cheese stayed fresh and pretty much mold free when stored in them.  We were amazed.Will but again soon but still consider them a bit pricey for basically a throwaway item.  Lower the price to get 5 stars
