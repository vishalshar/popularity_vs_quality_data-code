Love this phone!  The design is top notch and for the price of $299 the specs are pretty good. I am really interested in the company's approach to using cloud storage to offload unused apps as well as photos. Couple that with the commitment to Android updates, and I am very interested in sticking with my Nextbit Robin! ??
