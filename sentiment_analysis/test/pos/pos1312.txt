I have used Canary in my home for several years, and couldn't wait for this product to release.  I like the duality of use that comes with the camera.  It's durable for outdoor use, yet blends well into interiors. The unit itself has a very clean looking shape. Flex has all the functionality and looks great too.I really like the magnetic base. It's very easy install and move the camera to your needed angle.Flex is a great size. It's very discreet and works well for keeping an eye on those coming and going from our house.Overall I am very pleased with Flex and plan to purchase another one.
