have been using for a couple of months. i like it very much, i have a iphone 5s with an otter box case and it fits very well. i had been putting a rubber band on it to hold the phone in as a bit of cheap insurance but i find that i do not need it. i was not able to fit it onto my bike stem, i wanted it there so it would be more centered and free up space for my hands but no go, had to mount just a bit to the right and am used to it now.i'd like to give 5 stars but i find that it rotates as i ride due to bumps on the road, were it not for that i'd give a 5.
