This product worked very well for my smaller brushes. For my bigger brushes it took way to long for them to completely dry, maybe and day and a half to two days. That's a little ridiculous. For $5 it's worth it and makes it easy to dry most brushes. It's worth the investment you'll just have to play around with the larger brushes.
