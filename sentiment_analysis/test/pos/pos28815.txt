This has been so much fun! I have been wanting to get a mushroom kit since I was a teenager (ages ago!), and I finally bought one. It's been a blast to see how much they grow each day.  We started seeing little teeny tiny cauliflower looking things on day 3, and from then on, they just really took off!  Notice in the photos the difference in size from day 6 to day 7.....CRAZY!!! I live with my brother and elderly father, and my dad said he was almost scared to sit next to them at the table, lol.  I guess he thought they might eat him or something.  :)  It's now day 9, and time to harvest.  I'll get out my digital kitchen scale later when I harvest, and see how much they weigh.  We have some guesses going in this house as to how much it'll weigh.  My brother thinks only a few ounces.  I am going to say 9 ounces. Dad has yet to decide....he's "mulling it over".I will say that the spray bottle that comes with it, is really tiny, but they probably couldn't fit a bigger bottle in the box.  I sprayed mine A LOT.  I used at least one sprayer bottle full each day, and sometimes double that.For those who had trouble with theirs......I hope they kept them and try it again.I wonder if they:*scraped some of the white like it says to*soaked it in a large bowl or bucket of water cut side down for a full 8 hours*sprayed it a minimum of 2x's each day*had it where too much light got to it*waited a reasonable amount of time to see if it was growing (minimum of 3-5 days with ample watering)*or if they really got a "dud", and if so, did they contact the company for a replacement because they DO guarantee it.I'm very curious to see just how many harvests I can get out of this kit.  I am going to try for as many as I can.  The current record is apparently 10! That is hard to believe, but I am going to see if I can beat it.  If I do, I'll share how I did it.  Those who've done multiple harvests past the 2 they claim one can get, never post how they did it.Did they do the same side over and over before going to the next side?  Did they do both sides simultaneously? Did they open it all up, and put it in a long wide container? Did they do it outside?  So many possible variables.  Same with those that claim it didn't work for them.  There is a reason.....so, what did or didn't they do? What climate was it kept in? Lighting? Humidity? Heat? What kind of water did they use?I kept this next to my Aeorogarden 7 LED the first 2 or 3 days, but not facing it. I had it to the side or turned the box away from it.  Day 3, I moved it to our bay window area next to the table in our kitchen, but faced it inwards towards the kitchen so it wouldn't get direct light.  I sprayed it multiple times a day a full sprayer bottle usually, sometimes more.  I used water from our Berkey system that filters out 99% of contaminants with 2 charcoal filters, and 2 fluoride and arsenic filters.  The water is very pure, but leaves minerals.  I am curious as to how adding a drop of fulvic acid to the water from Optimally Organic might affect it. Not sure if I am going to try it just yet for this next harvest.I am going to try to grow these again on the same side I think. I'll update again with the next harvest.It's been a blast, and so very fascinating to watch these multiply so quickly.  I think it's a great gift for anyone of any age.  My grandparents live next door, and grandpa said he always wanted to buy a mushroom kit too, but never did. I never knew that, so it was nice to find that out when I told him I bought one. He's thoroughly enjoyed watching it grow, and he's 91.  Glad I was able to provide this for him to see, since it's something he's also always wanted to do. Check this off the bucket list. Hope he's around for many more years to come! Stay tuned for more harvests I hope!
