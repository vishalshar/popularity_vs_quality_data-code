I thought this would be a great coffee maker to have in my RV because of it's compact size.  I just received it today and couldn't wait to try it.  On the first fill it was only water so I tried with coffee on the 2nd.  The temp was hot and the coffee tasted really good.  I will say it is kind of noisy while brewing but for my RV the size is perfect!
