I have purchased this router because my cisco linksys EA4500 is getting old, and after a few year use, the wifi signal of my old linksys router become weak in my 2 story townhome.I have installed the router first as an extender to the EA4500 at downstairs. The configuration is very simple and the steps listed in the router is well written. It took me less than 5 mins to get the extender configured. The proximity authentication is a cool feature and it worked very well with my Mi-Box and my android phone. No password is required anymore and security is also guaranteed via locality.Later, while I went upstairs, I forgot to change the wifi to the linksys router and kept using it as my wifi. I didn't noticed any wifi signal degradation and it seems performs even better than cisco linksys EA4500.I am supper happy with this router and extender overall.
