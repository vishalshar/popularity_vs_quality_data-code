This device is awesome! I put this on the passenger side of my Subaru Outback to use with my Acer Aspire One (Z5G). With a load of other items in the car as well, I can put the laptop where I need it and lock it down. If I need to move the computer, it is as easy as moving a couple of clamps and your done.  The only thing I don't like about it is the options you have if you need to remove the computer. First option is to rove the pivot assembly for the platform which makes the laptop bulky. Second is to remove the four screws under the platform which is used to house the USB fan. If you loose any of those screws it is going to be difficult to replace them. I am planning on building a locking slide plate assembly which will make my particular mounting extremely user friendly.CAUTION: This system is very easy to remove quickly from your vehicle. If you plan to make it a permanent installation consider changing out a bunch of knob screws with security screws as well as changing out the clamp assemblies to nuts and bolts to make it harder to disassemble.NOTE: if you have a vibration issue I recommend getting the extension support.
