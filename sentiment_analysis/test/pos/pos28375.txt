I truly love this thing! I was initially just checking out how much a lock that doesn't require a key would cost. After thinking about it, I think if the only option was typing in a code each time then that would be aggravating. Plus, many of them require at least 8 digit codes oddly enough. I quickly started to realize most of the "smart" locks on here looked very questionable and not worth taking a chance with the only thing between my house and someone that wants to get in. I got lucky and got this one used on here for a little less and took a chance and bought it. I wasn't initially looking to spend over $100 on a lock but the more I looked at the more I realized I wanted a fingerprint sensor and a quality lock. It was easy enough to install. I'd say maybe 45 mins. From the other reviews I was expecting the install to be seriously complicated but it's really only 1) drill a couple holes with the included drill bit using the included stencil 2) screw in about 8-10 screws 3) plug in a plug 4) put the batteries in and you're good to go.(FIX for people having trouble with it not recognizing your fingerprint)As far as the actual use goes... I found the fingerprint sensor to be pretty dead on. My girlfriend did have problems with it and it would take her several tries. THE FIX for this problem is to program your same finger several times each in a slightly different position. Since it requires your finger to be in the exact same position as it was when you programmed it, programming the same finger several times in slightly different positions works like a charm (Since every time you put your finger on the imprint reader you're likely to do it differently each time). You do this like you would to add a new user except instead of a new user its your finger in a different position. You do that about 4 times and you're good to go.The lock looks really nice and very high quality. The parts seem to be pretty solid. I like that it doesn't light up until you touch it. Someone seeing it for the first time would be confused as to how you get in with no key hole (which is a good thing). I was really happy that the handle was able to be facing either left or right. I found that wasn't something all of these locks offered. It lights up fairly bright so you shouldn't have any problem seeing the numbers or the fingerprint sensor. It states that when the batteries start to get low it will give you a warning but even then you can use it another 1000 times before the batteries actually die. It comes with 3 keys (the key hole is under the lock, bottom side), the option to program up to 99 different codes, and 99 different finger prints. You also have the ability to delete users as well. I program it each Thursday so my cleaner can get in to clean my house and then on Friday I delete it.Truthfully, I didn't think I'd like having the fingerprint sensor but now that I've had it for over a month I couldn't imagine not having it. It's so convenient plus other people think it's unbelievable when they first see it. I really couldn't find any CONS about the lock. I have basically given up on reviews with all the people getting paid to write them so I decided I will start writing real reviews. Hopefully real people will start doing the same since it's what made this site so amazing.
