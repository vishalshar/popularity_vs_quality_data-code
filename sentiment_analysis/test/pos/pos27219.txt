I've been learning to play acoustic guitar for a while and remember seeing the first version of this. I didn't order it because some people said there was a noticeable delay over wi-fi. The new version is bluetooth and the reviews have been great so I ordered it from Amazon. It was Prime eligible so I got it in 2 days. I had already updated my iPhone and iPad to IOS 9 so I followed the warning and did not try to update over the bluetooth connection. I plugged it into the iPad (per the alternate instructions) and it downloaded the latest firmware. Everything looked good. It installed it to the jamstik and it powered down. When I turned it back on, the power light came on but it stayed red and the unit would not turn off unless I removed the battery. I went to the manufacturer's web site and found instructions for doing a factory reset. That didn't work either so I sent an email to their support staff (no phone number listed). I was surprised to hear back from them within 30 minutes. Long story short; they worked with me and could not solve the problem but asked if I would be OK with sending the unit back to them instead of Amazon so their engineers could evaluate the problem. They emailed me a FEDEX label and informed me that they would immediately ship me a new unit with the current firmware already installed. They did exactly what they said and rewarded me by sending it with the optional carrying case and an extra battery( a $75 bonus). Now that, my friends, is customer service at it's best. The customer service rep (Jeremy) could not have been any nicer or more professional.As others have said, it takes a little time learning how to hold it and play it (the strap is a must for me) but once you do, it is wonderful. My son-in-law is a professional musician and has a pretty slick home recording studio setup. I let him plug it into his system via USB cable and after using it with his expensive software/hardware setup, he didn't want to give it back! Being that it is a MIDI device, he was able to use it to input several different instruments; a process that he said takes much, much more time the way he does it now.My wife and I are retired and have been traveling a lot the past few years. It's a nightmare for me sitting in airports for hours and then getting on those 8 to 9 hour flights. I love to travel but the coming and going is so boring that it stresses me. When practicing/playing the jamstik at home, I lose track of time and am surprised at the length of those sessions. I believe that this wonderful little instrument is going to relieve my airport/airplane blues and it's size will certainly not be any burden at all for travel. Who knows, I may become the next "big thing" overseas (insert laughter here). I would be glad to answer any questions about this device.
