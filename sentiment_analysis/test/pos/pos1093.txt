An awesome little gadget - carry everywhere without a fuss, amaze your friends, and then depress them by pointing out overheating power-strips in their poorly-insulated houses. Freezing at work? Show the building manager that the vent over your desk is the only one blowing 45 degree air, because your boss closed all of the other vents and wants you to get hypothermia. Noises in the yard at night? Scan for warm bodies in the darkness and hope to not see anything. Reenact "Predator", and get Arnold before he "gets to the choppa".Gadget works well, and the software for Android is updated frequently. However, they lose a star for the "ticking" sound the shutter makes while in use, and for charging fifty bones more than they were on their site and originally on Amazon. The tech is a year old, so the price should be dropping, instead of going up.
