These bulbs have made turning on the lights a thing of the past. It's often a hassle to have to hit the light switch when your hands are full, or turning on the lights in the middle of the night when you need to use the restroom and blinding yourself in the process (that's half the reason why it's hard to aim at night). The Stack lights are easy to install and the app makes controlling the temperature (color) and brightness of the bulbs very easy. Everything has its drawbacks, and the drawback with this system is that now when I walk into people's place's where the lights don't turn on automatically when I walk in, granted it's unreasonable, I get a bit frustrated wondering why the lights are off and where the switch is.
