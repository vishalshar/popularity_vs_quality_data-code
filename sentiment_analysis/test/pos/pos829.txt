I ordered these as sort of an impulse buy,after watching so many YouTube tutorials claiming these guards were "key elements" in keeping your makeup brushes maintained. They arrived in a small envelope,which was weird. Contains 6 brush guards : A Kabuki/face guard. 2 blush/concealer guards,2 eyeshadow guards and a small lipliner/liner guard. They do shape your brushes and make it easier to dry them,so i would recommend this to any makeup junkie like me (:
