I have used this now for approximately 20 rounds. At first it takes some getting used to. Golf is a game of concentration, at least for me , and one more thing added to a pre shot routine brought some confusion to me and my foursome who noticed it was throwing me off my regular swing on address. So I solved that by hitting as if game golf was not attached. Then I would tap post shot. I can recall most of my shots on my home course so posting a round even when I forgot to tap was no problem. I understand that now some improvements have been made by game golf in this area should you forget to tap a shot. Overall I would give this a 4  only becausethe club selection inserts require me to fudge around my hybrid clubs. Game golf appears to continue to improve on performance due to player feedback. It's fun once you get past initial training
