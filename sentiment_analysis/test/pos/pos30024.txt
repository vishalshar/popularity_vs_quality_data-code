I was worried that I would have the problems others had calibrating it, but it worked straight out of the box. Loading and unloading filament could be easier, though. As others have said, the entire build plate is not heated. The part that is measures about 8.5"x8.5". The printer also isn't as loud as I expected it to be.I've printed in both pla and abs. The medallion (already painted), was printed in PLA at high resolution, while the barrel is ABS at medium resolution.
