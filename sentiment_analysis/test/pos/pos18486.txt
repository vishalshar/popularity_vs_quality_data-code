I got Blumoo to control IR devices (TV, DVR, Bluray, Roku). My nurse was helping me set it up. First, it says it works with an Android or iOS app to do the setup. HOWEVER, to use voice control with the Amazon Echo you MUST USE an IOS device. So keep this in mind if you don't already have an iOS device.We installed the Blumoo app on my iPad Air. Plug in the Blumoo device. All the setup is done on the app. You use the menus to add the devices you want to control. You select the type of device, manufacturer, model. Blumoo sends IR codes to turn the device power on. At this point you now have a virtual remote for each device and can use your iOS device as your remotes. You enter your zip code and select your guide.You can setup macros to do multiple functions with a single press.For the Echo setup, you first enable the blumoo skill on the Echo. Next on the Blumoo app you enable voice, then ask Alex to register your Echo, she gives you a pin number to enter in the Blumo app. You then have to setup voice commands from a fairly large pre-defined menu. We did not see a way to add a custom voice command. Something that worked without programming, "Alexa, tell blumoo to watch channel six five five" and Alexa tells you she is changing to channel number and what program is currently showing.We added voice commands for "volume up" "volume down" "mute" "watch roku".We had to move the Echo to a new location so it could hear my voice over the tv sound. Once doing that it worked good, that is, when Alexa understood me. A few misses and have to repeat. One thing I found is instead of saying "Alexa, tell blumoo power tv" it seems to work better to "Alexa, tell blumoo" Alexa then ask to do what then say "power tv".
