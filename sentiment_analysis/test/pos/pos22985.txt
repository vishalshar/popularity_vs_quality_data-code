This stuff is amazing, it will take some time to perfect the technique, but as they say practice makes perfect...the key is obviously use the right amount...if you need to error...error on the "not enough side rather than too much"....I have two small pock marks on my nose and its amazing when applied correctly I cannot even notice in a magnfying mirror..The right skin tone for the perfect match is also key, DF customer service is willing to make it right for you...this is an awesome product when used correctly...not sure about the make up thing as one review stated but if the color matches your skin tone you should not have a problemThanks again DF...a real confidence booster!
