This is my second purchase of this device. I bought one for my wife, and for me. I bought it as simply a security blanket, a back up in case I ever needed it since I travel, climb mountains, hunt and hike deep into the wilds. Did I mention travel. I have never needed anything like this, BUT a week after I had gotten it I had a car break down in the Wilds of PA. After using up my phone power, then what was left in my car battery...I plugged this in, put it in my parka pocket...and was able to finally get a tow truck, etc. Geez, when God sends a message about something, ya gotta sometimes look into the future about what the now is telling you.
