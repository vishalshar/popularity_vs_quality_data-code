I just love this thing.The UI will never be confused with an Apple design (that is why I deducted one star), but it does exactly what I want it to do; play digital music files with a minimum of hassle. Sorry I am not going to wax poetic about how angles dance before me when I play music over the Pono, and my wife yells from the den to ask if Bob Dylan is strumming an acoustic guitar in the front room, but I can say that everything I have loaded onto it sounds very, very good. Is there something to the Ayre designed electronics? Don't know, but it has never disappointed me. Feed it some well mastered recordings, and it is a pleasure to  listen to.Battle lines have already been drawn for the Pono and hi-rez in general, and minds will not be changed, but suffice to say that it serves my needs perfectly and I could not be happier with my purchase. I am not into streaming, so my goal was to get a player that could play my lossless CD rips and hi-rez downloads as is; no burning to disc, no down-sampingjust download, load to the player, press play. I would note that I only used it connected to my home audio rig.it just does not seem like it's a shape that lends itself to portable use, although many use it for that purpose.If something happened to it, I would buy another tomorrow without hesitation.
