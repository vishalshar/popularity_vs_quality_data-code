Works great and maintains connectivity.  I tried the "Ankuoo NEO" before I got this one.  To be brief, the Ankuoo was unreliable.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  This d-link is on when it says it is on, and off when it says it is off.  The app has worked every time which is great because I use it to cycle power on a device at a remote property (~120 miles away).
