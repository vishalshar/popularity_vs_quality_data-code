We love this mat.  This replaced a decorative rug in the nursery.  It's very high quality and i can leave items on it for a long period of time without any significant indentations remaining.  It's easy to clean, too.  My spouse wants it as an exercise mat, so we may end up ordering another one soon.  This is a bit pricey but worth the money for quality and look!
