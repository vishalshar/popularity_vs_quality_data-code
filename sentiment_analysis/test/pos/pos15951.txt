I first tried this snack (different brand) when a package came in the Universal Yums box from Thailand. What a treat! I ended up subscribing to this without trying this brand, but it didn't disappoint. It's a nice, light snack with a slight chocolate fix. My only complaint is that the bags don't have a zipper, so you either have to put any unfinished chips in a ziploc or just eat the whole thing. Rolling up the top tightly doesn't keep it crispy.
