I have to start with the scent - I just love it! It's sweet and refreshing, it just puts a smile on my face every morning.Washing my face has become my new favorite pass time :)In terms of the scrub itself, it provides a proper deep exfoliation. If you want a basis for comparison, I've used Neutrogena's Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub with similar results.Peter Lamas' scrub however is a lot more gentle. With the start of the winter and the cold weather, my skin has become hyper sensitive and highly irritable. Neutrogena's scrub is causing irritation, especially around my nose where as this one is specifically designed for sensitive skin and doesn't case any problems.I have oily and acne prone skin so I have to be very careful with the products I use. So far, I haven't had any issues with this scrub.My skin looks healthier and I get fewer breakouts even during that time of the month.Finally, this scrub is 100% vegan and cruelty free - all the cute little bunnies are safe :)
