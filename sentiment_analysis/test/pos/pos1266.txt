When you see the bad reviews you will notice ONE thing, NONE of them come from people who own or have spent any amount of time on an URB-E to make a review. What they are doing is making opinions NOT reviews. There is a difference.The simple definition of Review is as follows. "an act of carefully looking at or examining the quality or condition of something or someone : examination or inspection"The simple definition of Opinion is as follows."a view or judgment formed about something, not necessarily based on fact or knowledge.If this was Amazon OPINIONS section it would be different, but its not. So maybe look at both understanding the above and make your own educated decision. I think "Fact" overrules anything else, but thats just my opinion , below is my review =)First off. I rarely make reviews. I should make more but Im very busy. I can say Ive made over 2000 purchases from Amazon. I dont get free things to review and if I get something thats bad Id send it back. I depend a lot on reviews and usually only get a 4.5 star or above product and Ive never gone wrong. That being said, Im honest about what I type.$1699 is not cheap. It could be a lot cheaper if they decided to have this made in China with cheap parts that will fail in a few years just like the Chinese scooters that break down months after you get them. So Kudo's for it being made in the USA. It is VERY well made. This is going to last a long time for sure.Im not the targeted demographic for this scooter but I still like it and think its worth every penny. Do I wish it was $500, sure. I also wish I could buy a Lambo for the same price as a Kia. You get what you pay for. I have this as something to have fun on at the beach and around the neighborhood.PROS ---Very well madeGreat design. ( its clear a lot went into this design, its a simple motion to open and close this. )Comfortable ride. ( I thought this would be REALLY bumpy with these small wheels, BUT with the spring under the seat its surprisingly comfortable  you dont feel the bumps )Compact and convenient. ( very small foot print, can take it anywhere. )Ill add more later Im sure.CONS ---It has 3 lights for the battery indicator. Full -  Half - Empty  ( I wish it had a more detailed battery indicator as I drive a mile or 2 away from my house and when its getting close to empty ( from previous use ) I have no idea how much longer I have and will I make it back home )I wont lie I do wish it was less expensive, however I still think its worth it and probably a lot more worth it to anyone using this as their last mile commute.***Note. I was not part of the fund raising for this and I was not offered any discount for my review. I saw it on Amazon Launchpad as I love new toys.
