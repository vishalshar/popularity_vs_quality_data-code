Took a while to receive the product, but wanted to try after seeing an interesting video online about them. Better than expected in terms of fit, even though is 54mm which is smaller what my partner would usually use. Can't say it increased pleasure for either of us, but I'd say that you are paying for the fit, stayed in place the whole time compared to trojans which I find slip down all the time. A little expensive for a condom but would happily pay for these over cheaper due to the fit, not sure if the hexagon had anything to do with that. Also read online that the hexagon help to contain breakage, but didn't say that on the pack.
