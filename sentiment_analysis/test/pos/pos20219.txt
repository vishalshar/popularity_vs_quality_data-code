These toys are made by a great company, founded by a great woman. I'm so glad I found these, my daughter loves them. My daughter has two sets of the magnetic dollhouses. They are able to be used together to build one giant dollhouse! They provide endless possibilities for mixing and matching that are only limited by your children's imagination. My daughter, 6 and son, 4 like to think up the silliest scenarios when they're playing.Each set includes interchangeable tiles to make the houses. Some of the sets even include magnetic tiles that you can stick accessories on to personalize even further. There are dolls, doll clothes, pets, and numerous accessories as well.This has become my go-to birthday present for my daughter's friends. It is well-made, unique, and appropriate for most any child in that age range. There are little box dolls included in some of the sets. While it is my daughter's toy, my son loves playing with it too.My most recent purchase was the Fairytale Theater for two birthday parties in one weekend. We took the gift to the first party on a Friday where the girl opened her gifts after the party at home. The next day at the next party the birthday girl opened her gifts with her friends. When she got to the Fairytale Theater the girl that had received it the day before exclaimed "I got that too! It's so cool, you'll love it!"
