Ok, so my little story goes: I wanted to buy a comb of my own. At my workplace, I'm so used to throwing a hat on and going about my day. But, at home, I'm always using my son's comb or brush, because the cheap plastic one I keep on the counter mysteriously keeps disappearing. I had a few things saved in my cart already, here, at Amazon and needed to buy something to offset all the individual shipping charges (because I'm my mind, I'd rather have a product than end up paying for non-prime member shipping). My first thought was 'where in the world can I buy a really well made metal comb?'; that turned into 'where can I buy an American-made comb?'. Chicago Comb Co. has beautiful combs with leather sheaths for each style of comb....but they are really really expensive, like 4x more expensive than Go Comb. Then I stumbled across this little bad boy and honestly fell in love with all the stock photos. The idea that this is compact enough to fit in the back of my Trayvax metal wallet (which I use to secure my folded cash against my credit cards) makes me really happy. I bought the 3 pack, so that in time, I can give the other two as gifts. The quality and feel of my new comb is honestly legit. I've already gotten several compliments on it, within the first week. And most likely won't have to buy another comb again for many years!
