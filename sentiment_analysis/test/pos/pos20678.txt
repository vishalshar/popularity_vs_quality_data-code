All selfie-sticks are the same, right? WRONG! I (honestly) have 5 other selfie sticks. I thought they were all fine, until I ordered this one for a trip.... This one is NIGHT & DAY better than all others.* COMPACT - this folds up to fit into my coat pocket or purse, or to wear on my wrist with the strap better than others. The end that grabs your phone literally folds in, which I've not seen before. This protects the spring clip, and makes it smaller than all others. The 'pole' is telescoping and compactly telescopes closed with little effort.* GREAT BATTERY & PAIRING- the battery on this thing is great. I needed it for a huge trip across Canada with tons of photo ops. So, to be safe, I never went more than 3-4 days without charging it to be safe. However, I never saw any indication the battery died or was low. Additionally, it stayed paired to my phone usually. We swapped it between two Iphones (my phone and hubby's phone), so we had to re-pair at times, but it was easy and quick via bluetooth. You turn it on, and off, by holding the button down. It blinks to show you it's on, and again to turn off. Also, if you forget, it automatically powers itself off to save battery, and to un-pair from your phone preventing battery drain. You charge it with an included micro USB cable. To prevent the awkward angle of charging it while on the stick, just slide the remote off then plug it in. The remote it the ONLY part that needs charged!* REMOTE - Don't you hate when your arm shows in a selfie? You can better hold this selfie stick for photos, without worrying about accessing the button with your thumb. Just remove the remote and use it with your other hand to take the picture. It works for photos and videos, and bursts too.* GRIP - THE BEST! You can adjust the tightness of the angle of the clamp to point more upward or downward using the twist on the side. This keeps it from flopping. The grip is automatic and springed. There are thick rubber teeth that grab your phone like no other selfie-stick, it's awesome!!!! It's so strong and reliable, we were in the Rockies and I wanted to take a pano with my Iphone RIGHT ON TOP OF THE WATER at a lake. Basically, I wanted the pano to include the water's reflection, which required me to take pictures holding the camera out from the shoreline, and an inch from the water. I did this many times, and it never once dropped my phone... I would NOT do this with any other selfie stick. Ever.Also, you can put this on a tripod if you'd like (see the bottom of the selfie stick). We did this, and angled it upward to take photos of the northern lights - we needed something to put our phones on a tripod, and that could angle our phones in a certain way without ANY movement, and we used an app for slow exposure (you can't do that with your free hand, zero movement...). Check it out...So... do I recommend it? Heck yes! Especially at the discounted price I ordered it at, $29.95 with Prime Shipping.  I hope this review is helpful to anyone contemplating this purchase. I really wish I'd just bought this one a long time ago - it's way better than ALL of my others. Really... you probably won't understand until you get one, but it's that good. Hope this helps.
