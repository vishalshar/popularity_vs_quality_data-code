I am the quintessential crazy dog lady and I work long hours, so I've been looking for a device that would allow me to check in on my pup when I'm gone. Petcube seemed to fit the bill, so I thought I'd give it a try, and I have been very pleased with the device.Pros:- Great wide angle lens- Easy to use iPhone app that opens up and connects quickly- Less than a second of lag time between real time and what shows up in the app (I tested this out by walking in front of the camera myself while holding my phone)- Device itself seems sturdy and does not take up a lot of spaceCons:- 720p video (wish it was 1080p)A lot of the other reviews complain about the cord length, but I didn't find this to be a problem (I would guestimate it is 10 or so inches long). If it bothers you, the cord is just a standard micro USB cord, so I'm sure you could find a longer one on Amazon very inexpensively.I haven't used the voice feature much (my dog is very skittish, and I didn't want her to go looking for me if she heard my voice and couldn't find me), but it is nice to have. The red dot laser feature is also fun, and I have enjoyed watching my little girl run around chasing it while I'm at the office.Would definitely purchase again.
