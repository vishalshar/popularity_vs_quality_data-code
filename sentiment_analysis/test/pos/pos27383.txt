This review may be different from most as I purchased them for a different kind of earphone. I purchased the 812887014670 jlab bluetooth earphones from groupon. These earphones are excellent in every aspect apart from one... They never stuck to my ears and fell off even when I used the treadmill for less than a minute, let alone being on the road for a hour or more! So, I resigned to fate and only used the Bluetooth earphones with a skullcap.- I had seen these earhooks before but I decided to purchase them for the Jlab earphones. If they didn't work for the Jlab, I could always use them for my regular earbuds.- when I got them, I replaced the original Jlab earbuds with these earhooks and voil≈ï; they stuck to the ear! What joy! Not only did they not fall out on the treadmill, they have stayed put for my long runs! They also feel comfy and do not aggravate my ears at all after a long run, which I feared would happen!They come in two sizes and even though the smaller ones fit my ears, I decided to use the large ones for maximum grip to my ears.- Hope this helps someone who purchased the above Jlab Bluetooth earphones and was looking for a way to get them to stick to the ears!
