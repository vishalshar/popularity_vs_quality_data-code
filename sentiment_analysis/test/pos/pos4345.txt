The only thing keeping me from giving the fifth star is that it doesn't do IFTTT with a dedicated iHome channel.  But since it's compatible with Samsung SmartThings Hub- White, and that has IFTTT, and I already had the Samsung hub and motion detectors, this ended up doing the trick.  My use case is two IFTTT applets that turn my DeLonghi TRN0812T Portable Oil-Filled Radiator with Programmable Timer on or off based on whether my Samsung SmartThings Motion Sensor detects the room temperature has dropped below 68F or risen above 72F.BTW, I tried this exact same setup with a Wemo Insight Switch, Wi-Fi Smart Plug, Control Lights and Appliances From Your Phone, Manage Energy Costs, Works with Amazon Alexa which failed miserably even after at least a dozen tries over a span of weeks.  The iHome got it right the first time.
