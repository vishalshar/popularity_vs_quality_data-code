I've only had it up and running for a few days but so far it's my favorite bedside safe. I've had many of the gunvault and sentry safes in my time but this is far and above all of them in quality and function. The smartphone app is also very good and makes setup and personalizing the settings a breeze. The app also allows for monitoring the rechargeable battery but the fact that it's built in proprietary makes me not look forward to the day it needs replacing. According to the manufacturer the battery will last a year without recharging but time will tell. Fingerprint reader seems a step above the average requiring a firm press to activate and can be adjusted for sensitivity should you choose. RFID dongle and cards work flawlessly as well. I chose the matte black and it looks like a high end piece of tech on my bedside table. Even my wife likes how it looks and that's a first! Fit and finish is perfect and feels solid as a rock. I'll update the review as time goes on but so far I'm very happy with my purchase.
