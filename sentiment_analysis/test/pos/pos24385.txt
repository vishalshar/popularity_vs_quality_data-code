Not only is Bizzy Cold Brew Coffee Concentrate delicious, it's super convenient as well! Just store in the fridge for nice, cold, yummy coffee any time you want it. I mix mine with almond milk and splenda. The serving size is 1/3 cup of coffee. It's pretty strong, so taste it before making a whole cup of coffee with it. I love strong coffee, so it works perfectly for me. The price is a little more than I'd like to pay, but if I went to a coffee shop, I'd spend $10 on 2-3 coffees. You get at least 3 times that with Bizzy. I'd recommend this product for sure!
