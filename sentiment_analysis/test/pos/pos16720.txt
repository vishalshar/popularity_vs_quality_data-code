Fits the jars I expected it would fit from the description. The long plastic tube makes it flexible whether I use large (quart) or small jars (pint) - in which case I cut the tube. The nozzle also locks closed which is useful! And there's a foam layer on the inner side of the cap that helps with cleanliness. All around exactly what I was expecting plus some perks.
