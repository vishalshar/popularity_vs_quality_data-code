Well, the Petzi Treat Cam is the best thing that's happened in a long time!  Now, when we are out of town and the puppies are with the pet sitter, we can "check in" with them and make sure they're ok.  It's so reassuring to see them and "shoot" them a treat.  We can make sure they're safe, and that's worth a million bucks!  Thank you Petzi.....
