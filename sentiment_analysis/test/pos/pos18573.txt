I have had this product for 1 day. The installation was easy, however when it comes to any other wall that is not flat such a vinyl, there is a good chance there will be a small gap behind the light where the wires are leaving potential for a bee nest so I will be getting something behind there to help prevent that. Kuna should provide some sort of ring that sticks out and covers it. The camera quality in the day time is really great. The live feed has little delay and the sound quality is very good. For example, I could very clearly hear my SO light his cigarette in the garage(door open) that is 100ft from the house. The notifications are almost instantly sent to your phone and what I really like is when it send you a recorded video, the recording does not start as soon as it sees motion, it's always recording and sends you the video 10 seconds before the motion was captured, records for exactly 1 min unless there is still motion, and stops after the motion is gone. So even if someone ran through your yard it still captured it. Other than the gap behind the light I have two more complaints which almost brings my review to a 3. The first is the night time quality. The distance in the dark is very poor. You can only see maybe 15-20 feet out but it's very grainy. It does see someone pretty clearly and almost focuses on them when they are within 8ft but that all the further you are going to be able to see so I would suggest getting another yard light or something because if I turn on the lights that are on the garage it actually sees pretty well. So my tip is to get another light. My second complaint is the glare. Kuna came out with a video that their products now come with a small black guard that sits below the light and blocks out the glare but I must have been sold an old one because mine does not have those. There is a little clip that is on the camera itself for glare protection but that does not help as much. I am using the recommended per Kuna standard A-15 LED light bulb but I found I almost have to keep the camera pointed straight down. It works because everything is still in view but I would light to turn the camera to the right a little and the requires it to up some and bringing back some of the glare. I'm still happy overall with the product but will update in a few months.
