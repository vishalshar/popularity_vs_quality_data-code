This was by far the easiest remote I have ever setup. It was connected and working in under 10 minutes. It's connected my Cisco cable box, Sharp TV, and Pioneer receiver like a champ. Android so is great let's you program the buttons you use the most easily with drag n drop. I just ordered two more. Great product.
