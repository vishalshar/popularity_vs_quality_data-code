I generally workout at the office or directly after work and was looking for a stylish and not overly bulky bag that would allow me to carry my everyday essentials to and from work while commuting on public transportation. After months of looking I settled on the Tom bag, which is almost perfect but doesn't fully meet all my needs. The bag looks awesome and easily fits my lunch, wallet, phone, kindle, waterbottle, workout clothes and post workout clothes. And some of extra touches like the removable liner and the bungees on the bottom of the bag make it really special. The main downside for me is the lack of exterior pockets, as I often need to get in and out of the bag quickly for my metro pass, work ID, and phone. It's also a little annoying to have to go into my bag with all of my stuff to find my wallet. Also while the website description says the laptop sleeve fits 17 inch laptops, it doesn't fit my work laptop which is an older 17 inch Dell. So on days I need to bring my work laptop home with me I have to leave it loose in the bag. However, I think if you had a thinner computer the laptop sleeve would work well.
