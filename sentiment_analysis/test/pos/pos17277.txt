I have had the pebblebee honey for a couple of years. It works great but it's totally plastic. Where the key ring attaches is partially broken and I'm afraid I will loose it. The Finder does not have this problem since it has the stainless steel rim. If it works as well as the Honey they have definitely hit a homerun!!
