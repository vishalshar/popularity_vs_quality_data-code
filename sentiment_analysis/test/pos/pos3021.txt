Joking Hazard is absolutely hilarious.  It's played like Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity, except instead of building phrases, you're building a three-pane comic strip.  We were cracking up almost every single round, and it's astounding how well all of the seemingly unassociated panes fit together in sequence.  I often play with some more sensitive players, so I wondered exactly how obscene the game really is.  I couldn't find that information anywhere online, so hopefully this will help.About 20-25 cards contain swear words or obscenities that can be censored with a sharpie while still making sense.  For some sensitive players, this is a way to keep these cards in the game.There are about 50-60 cards that are particularly obscene/objectionable/inappropriate/offensive that cannot be censored and still remain playable.  If you're looking for a "cleaner" version of the game, just remove these 50-60 particularly obscene cards and you're good to go There are still around 250 cards remaining after the filtering/censoring, so the game is still completely playable without the obscenities, and is still absolutely hilarious.  One of the best games I've bought in a long time, and will probably become my favorite.
