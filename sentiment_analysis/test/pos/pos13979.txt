Finally got around to trying this out and it worked great - a lot easier to use than I was expecting and definitely better results than I expected.  We tried it on a variety of guitars - electric and acoustic. We even used it to tune an electric guitar that I had gotten from my mom that I know hasn't been touched in the last 15 years that I have had it and it tuned it perfectly and it actually sounds good!  This tuner took a lot of heart out of tuning for us, no guess work, just following the instructions on the app and listen for the beep on the tuner itself.  I get where it would be great for a musician on the road but also great for a newer guitarist to get them on the right foot starting out.
