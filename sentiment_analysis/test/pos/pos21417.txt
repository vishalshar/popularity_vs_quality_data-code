**Let me just say that i own several LED projectors, and have a good base for comparison.I will cut to the chase. This is a fantastic product, if used for only certain applications, for some it might be a more of a gimmick. Let me explain: PROS/LIKES.... There are so many things I love about this product. Size is almost stupid small, this little guy is really amazing to hold and it is so impressive when you turn it on, its bright compared to the size. Built quality it top notch, aluminum casing, with piano black hard plastic on the sides.Even the box is impressive, inside there is high density foam that holds the unit and its accessories...Speaking of Accessories, it has it all: HDMI cable, Power Cable, Audio-Video Cable, Remote, Projector Octopus stand, even a Tablet Mirroring cable (it was compatible with my Samsung Tab Pro tablet). Everything you will ever need for this projector!.... Performance (I will review this from a positive side for now, for its size performance is stellar, but with size there are downsides, and I will place them under cons section). Again-For-it's-Size image is bright, best used in low lit rooms (Like most LED projectors), any sun will wash out the image.I tested this unit on a 92" projector screen, and found the projector to be most effective around 50", anything more than that will lower picture quality, and make it less bright. Color saturation is good, sharpness is good for its size. With most pico projectors speaker is crap, low detailed quiet mess.The unit has a MicroSD Card slot where you can directly play back Video and image files. Some movies did not play, mostly less common file formats, or 1080p low compression video files that need more processing power. Same goes for images: Highest megapixel images either failed (not all), or took a long time to load. Overall SD card function is very useful, and menu has a good navigation.Fully chargedninternal battery lasted 1.5h. CONS/DISLIKES. My biggest complaint is image quality and brightness Projector's native resolution is 854x480 (WVGA) which is stuck between Standard and HD resolutions. Text really suffers on this projector, its fuzzy and not very sharp. I browsed on amazon through my projector and at time I could not read descriptions (see my closeup photos). Company claims up to 120 screen, that is total exaggeration, anything above 50 will diminish very quickly. I work with half of that and in my opinion this is the best this projector can do!Another little annoyance is that you cannot power on the unit from remote, you physically need to press the power button on the projector. For some reason I find that weird. CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATIONDespite the cons mentioned above this projector is a marvel of technology. You literally can put 50-120 TV in your pocket or purse. For general use, it is great, but don't expect deep black levels, sharpness, HI Def. We have come a long way, and this gadget is a living proof!* I chosen and received this product at a considerable discount in exchange for a honest unbiased review. My goal is to credit or discredit a product to my results and observations.
