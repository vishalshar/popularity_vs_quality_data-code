Love This!!  Use it primarily in the Kitchen and Garage/Workshop. The magnet on the back holds it securely to fridge,  toolbox,  and metal door.  It works with Alexa,  but have to push the button on the side to wake Alexa Up.. not voice controlled UNTIL you push the button on side. Like the message feature and ability to make phone calls without my phone.  Enjoy listening to whatever I want.
