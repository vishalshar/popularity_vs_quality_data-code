This is a GREAT product.  The ingenuity of the design is second-to-none.  I use it in one of the cracks in my dashboard and it's not blocking anything.  It is sturdy, and the phone doesn't shake or feel like it's going to slip out.Reasons for 4 star instead of 5: It's nearly impossible to put something in this with one hand, especially with the bottom shelf taken off (which most people with large screen cell phones will almost definitely do).  So, it's a two-handed operation...I can live with it.  Also, a little tough to pop it open with the button on the back sometimes, but I think that's just a product of it's strong holding arms.  Secondly, you have to clamp the arms down pretty tight to get a good hold, which it does then provide, but it's got to be squeezed ALL the way down for my phone to not move around.
