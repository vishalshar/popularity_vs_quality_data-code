Juggling the applicator takes some getting used to, but once you have the hang of it Dermaflage covers up pretty good. I have large sun spots and apply very little over the darkened areas to conceal them, before I apply my usual makeup. IT works pretty good, although I wish the company would come out with a better applicator. There can be waste and you really have to watch not to squeeze out too much.
