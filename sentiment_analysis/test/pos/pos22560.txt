Best backpack for Phantom 4 I have seen.  Plenty of compartments for extra's and the Phantom 4 fits very well also the motor cap guards are a must thank you for throwing them in with the bag.  What sets this backpack apart from others is the anti-theft 3 combo security code and fits nicely on a plane.  Very comfortable to wear, went on a 3 mile hike thru the forest up hills for that perfect Phantom 4 aerial video and never once stopped to readjust or to rest.  I am a huge polar pro fan best aftermarket products to help protect your drone, I have the ND filters CP thru ND32, gimbal lock cover which works nicely with the ND filters so you don't have to swap out filters when done only thing I am missing which I am ordering is the gimbal guard.
