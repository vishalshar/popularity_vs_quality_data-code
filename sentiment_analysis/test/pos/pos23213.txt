We just received our first order of Skeeter Snacks today, and they were absolutely AMAZING!!  We tried the mini chocolate chip and the triple chocolate ones.  Our triple chocolate ones were all crumbled, due to shipping I am sure, but still tasted great!  Will definitely order again.  Thank you for making something my severely peanut allergic daughter can feel safe eating!
