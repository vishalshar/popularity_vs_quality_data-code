I love this shine. I had the old one previously but returned it because it wasn't what I was looking for, and the band broke. The band on the shine 2 seems sturdier, and I like that it's a bit bigger. The product doesn't fall off my wrist like its predecessor, so I won't be losing any money.I wear this 24/7 as the battery lasts 6 months. I love the colors on the face, and that it vibrates when I get a text or phone call. I haven't used it as an alarm yet. The vibration was hard to feel at first but now I'm used to it and can feel it every time. The shine 2 is also GORGEOUS.
