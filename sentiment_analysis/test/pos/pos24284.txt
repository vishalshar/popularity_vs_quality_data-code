First off, I just want to say I've used PS Golds, Turtle Beach Elites, and Astro A50 and I usallay go through headsets every 6 months due to bad craftsmanship. I have high hopes these will last longer.First impression I was amazed how well crafted these headsets feel. They're sturdy and comfortable, sound great, and very easy to set up and use. Only part I personal think feels a little cheap is the outer rings on the ear-cups that control the volume. Wish these rings felt a little smoother when I control the volume. I've only own these headset for a couple of days now so only time will tell how well they will hold up and if there are any issues.Comparing to other headsets I've used, the LS40s blew PS Gold out of the water. They seem to be more comfortable, sound and built better then the Golds.Compared to Turtle Beach Elite and Astro A50, I would have to say they have pros and cons. The LS40 is more comfortable then the TB Elite but don't measure up to the comfort you get with the Astro A50. Sound quality is a personal preference but I would give game/music audio to TB Elite, LS40 comes in 2nd and Astro A50 in 3rd. (This could of been due to a defective A50 I owned. I had the A50 for about a month before I took it back because there was humming in one of the ear-cups and the headset would keep losing connection to its paired transmitter). The chat audio on the LS40 seems better then the Astro and TB. I can hear and control the LS40 chat audio so much easier then the others. When it comes to functional use of the headsets, it is sooooo much easier to use the LS40 then all of the other headsets I've mentioned.The only think I wish the LS40 would have is Bluetooth to connect to your phone and could play music in the background when playing your video game like the TB Elite. Overall I think the LS40 is a great headset and worth giving a try. Like I said before only time will tell if they hold up but I do have high hope that they will last longer then all previous headsets I've own. (PS Gold I've own 2 pairs both broke at 6-7month, TB Elite broke at 8-9months, Astro A50, 1 month)
