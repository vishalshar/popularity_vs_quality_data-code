I wear this all the time. I like being able to look and see how many steps I have taken and being able to tap it for the time is great. We own several withing products, scale, blood pressure cuff, and another activity tracker. I love the size of it as it is not too large for my petite frame. It's great to be able to track my sleep too. I highly recommend the GO.
