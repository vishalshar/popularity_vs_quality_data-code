My son really liked these spoons at first, but now that he has learned how to eat off of a spoon he gets frustrated because they do not hold a lot of food.  The fact that they don't hold much food was great at first.  The spoon is a good weight and feels natural in your hand.  It does help with the natural latching process, but I did not think it reduced mess (some babies are just messy eaters).  Overall, I thought the spuni soft spoons were good as a first spoon.
