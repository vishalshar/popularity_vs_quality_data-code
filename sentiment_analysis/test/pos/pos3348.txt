By and far, this is the better QuadLock bike mount. It has a lower profile than the stem mount. It looks better on the bike AND the release lever is easier to operate. What may not be immediately obvious is that you can also mount it facing the rear, meaning that the phone sits above your stem: the big bonus is that you can make it sit *really* flush with the stem. The adjustability comes courtesy of the fact that it is attached to your handlebar and you can rotate it to match your stem angle pretty easily. This is something you canÂ’t do with the QuadLock stem mount, which is butt-ugly and forces your phone to sit an inch or so above the stem.If you are new to the whole QuadLock system, the case is a bit bulky. It won't win points for appearance but it is extremely sturdy and does its job well.
