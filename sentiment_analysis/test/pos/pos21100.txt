I have some middle age related sleep challenges. I love this thing to help me stay focused and understand my patterns relating them to what I do and how I feel. Also using the Withings scale and BPM monitor. All integrated via the Healthmate app, Other activity tracking is via my iPhone and Watch.I am motivated by data analysis and tracking to reach better understanding and transformation, but this is not for everyone.I like not having to wear a bracelet and never have to think about it doing its job. The data is on my phone a little while after I get up.The sleep programs and smart alarm are a bonus!
