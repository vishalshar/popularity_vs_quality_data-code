I can't say enough about the promptness, courtesy and professionalism of the Now Computing/Gameband staff. We had a problem on registration that corrupted files and prevented the full installation from taking place, and NC worked through several tough issues, going so far as to give me access to the files I needed via quick download, with good instructions from English speakers, within hours of the issue. They helped turn a bad situation into a happy birthday, and the kid in question wound up stating this was his favorite present from a huge pile. Thank you!
