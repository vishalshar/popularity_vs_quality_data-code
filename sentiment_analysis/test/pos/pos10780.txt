My Mother is 89 and has a Parkinsons related disorder (PSP). She is losing her mobility and we are caring for her at home. She came home from the rehab nursing home with a bed sore on her shoulder. Her hip looked sore, and she developed one on her hip. She weighs 94 pounds and sleeps on her side. We purchased this and the chair mat to prevent any further sores from developing. She is not one to give out compliments but she loves the way this mat eliminates her pain at night in bed. We removed the side pieces, and covered the mat with a pillowcase because she sweats at night. With the mat placed lengthwise on the bed it protects both her shoulder and hip at night. She is sleeping through the night and her sores are healing rapidly. Worth every penny!
