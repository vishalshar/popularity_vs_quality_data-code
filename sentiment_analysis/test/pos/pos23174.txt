This is a great concept and overdue in tradition sport(s). As it relates to design, everything from the box to the hardware is stylish and practical. However, as it relates to the operating system, both the Android and iOS apps, crashed often. Unclear if it is a hardware or software issue. So, the product is still in-development. As for the company, it was a challenge to communicate with them and have questions answered. Please improve customer support.Hopefully, ShotTracker can fix the problems, because the idea is truly brilliant. The technology is simple so a Coach or Athlete is empowered to collect and analyze performance data. Also, and hopefully, ShotTracker thinks beyond basketball and applies these technologies to other sports.
