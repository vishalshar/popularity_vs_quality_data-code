I work shift work and with that comes sleep issues. Most sleep aids will leave me feeling groggy or hung over. This doesn't give me that '"in the fog" feeling. With that being said I would make sure you can get a full nights sleep if you drink the whole bottle. The beauty of this product vs. a pill is that you don't have to take the whole does. A lot of times I will drink half a bottle just to put me over the I can't sleep edge. I'm also drank a half of bottle just before boarding a red-eye flight so I could sleep. Works like a charm! I've shared this product with so many people I should buy stock in the company!
