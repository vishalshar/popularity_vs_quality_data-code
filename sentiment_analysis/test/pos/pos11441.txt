This is my first drone and I love this it. It is very easy to fly either by Auto pilot or on manual mode. The video/pictures are top rate. Most notable is the customer service. I called the support number with a question I had and was told to leave a message ( not unexpected the week after Christmas,). In less than a day I received a call back. Unfortunately I missed the call. In less than another day, I received another call from the Autel support desk.. The problem was immediately resolved. The support personnel was very well versed with copter! We have all had other products unrelated to a quad-copter, and it is very rare to get such helpful prompt service. I recommend that if you are in the market for a premium quad-copter, consider Autel. It is not an inexpensive hobby to get into (though the Autel products are considerably less expensive than some of the alternatives) and the product support  for something in this price range should be an important part of the decision making process.
