As a mom who limits screen time but also understands the value of technology for young minds, this learning set with accompanying app is absolute perfection. First, the packaging is so lovely, this could and should be the "IT"gift for all toddlers and preschoolers for holidays and birthdays. When you open the box the letters themselves feel super luxe. They are solid wood with soft sponge-like receptors on the back that glide on your ipad's screen seamlessly. The apps themselves are excellently made and I could see them being useful for years to come. I love that it's also an app that will engage adults as well as children allowing for the best kind of screen time.As far as how my son enjoyed it, a little background first. He is 2 and a half and has never been a big fan of iPad games. We haven't trieda handful (including Endless ABC's and a Sago Mini game) but they've never been "fun" or a great learning opportunity from my point of view. This was not the case with the Marbotic app. Immediately after seeing and holding the letters he was eager to dive in. After 20 minutes he was still excited to be playing and I actually had to say we were taking a break. It's been a few days and he asks to play every day. I think they have truly found a way to make learning the alphabet, phonics, and vocabulary fun and engaging.Overall I think this is a must have if you want your child's screen time to be as purposeful as possible and a great investment toy. I also bought the number set but haven't opened them yet.
