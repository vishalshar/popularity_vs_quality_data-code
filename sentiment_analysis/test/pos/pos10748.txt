My 1970s Kenwood receiver and my CD player both died this year and although I wanted something up to date that could play digital music as well I was amazed at how complicated and expensive the receivers were. When I came across the ITCDS-6000 I was skeptical, I had an all in one stereo I bought in the 80s and it worked great and lasted up until 2 years ago, but this one seemed smaller and flimsy. The receiver is so light I thought it was empty.But I easily connected it to my 3 foot tall speakers and the turntable and tried it out. It works great, the sound is clean and clear even with vinyl records. I do need to turn the volume way up to get it loud, but it does get loud enough and sounds best with full bass. I don't know all the lingo for this, but the sound isn't as full bodied as it was with my big Kenwood receiver, never the less it sounds very good and I enjoy the music.I haven't tried using the small speakers that came with it yet, I was hoping I could connect those and my old ones, but it doesn't have enough connections to do that, but that's okay. Once I try out the speakers I will update this and let you know.The remote is VERY small, but works great.I also like that it has blue tooth to connect to my laptop. I haven't paired them yet, but once I do I can play music from my laptop as well and the kids love that they can connect their MP3 players to it as well.So over all this is a great little unit for the price and takes up about half the space of the bigger units.
