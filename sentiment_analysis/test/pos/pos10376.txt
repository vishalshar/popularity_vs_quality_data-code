Got it 30 minutes ago and was up flying within 5 mintutes after opening the box. Got a good 8 minute stable and steady flight. No issues except the battery compartment on the transmitter had some fit issues with the batteries.(Reason for 4 out of 5) The AAA's wanted to fall out and not hold into their slot. When turning the transmistter over to power on, the batteries would lose contact.Just adjusted the contacts with the supplied prop wrench and they fit snug as a rug now!Impressive machine!
