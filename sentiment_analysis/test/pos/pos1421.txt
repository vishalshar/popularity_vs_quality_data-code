I love this device. It's so simple and easy to use and extremely accurate. When I'm driving in intense traffic it buzzes at me because it knows I'm not breathing normally. It also allows me further insight into my state of mind throughout the day. How long I can stay focused or calm, or when do I get tense throughout the day.
