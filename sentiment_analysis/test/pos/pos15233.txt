On the daily this phone will meet your every need. The specs are solid and today with the June update the speakers have been fixed and work perfectly. I'm not a flashy person or anything, so the phone often gets compliments leaving me to think what about me lol? I have an iPhone and an apple watch, yet this phone has become my daily driver (with a pebble time), i would have never thought that when i bought the phone. The phone has lots of little touches from the software to the look that make it feel unique and made with love.My ONE DISLIKE is that there is no app drawer and yes i know Google launcher, but I'm a purest and hate installing extra stuff that drains even a sliver of battery. Right now at a price point of $299 there is no phone that can match the Robin.
