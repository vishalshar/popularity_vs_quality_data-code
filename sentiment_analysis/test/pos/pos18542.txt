This is both a really creatively conceived game and a game that enhances creativity. Players can make up their own rules. It challenges the players to view letters and words in a different way, and I have to constantly pay attention. The letter designs are great.  We had a lot of fun playing with our 11 year old daughter and it is a smart fun way for the family to bond.
