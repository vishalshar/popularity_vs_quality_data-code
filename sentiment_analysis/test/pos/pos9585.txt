I purchased this product after I got a nasty anonymous note from my neighbor explaining that my cat was bothering them.  I didn't want to be that neighbor so I installed this fence myself as I couldn't afford to do much more.  Pretty easy to install if you don't mind manual labor and works great.  One of my cats is instantly accustomed to it without the recommended training.  My other 2 are more high energy so I'm excited to get them into the routine.  Now I can have the piece of mind that my kitties are safe from traffic and haters.
