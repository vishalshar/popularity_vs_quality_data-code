Blown away with the quality!! I have a 2008 Dodge Ram 3500 Dually, and needed to have my MacBook accessible for viewing excel sheets, e-mails, etc. on the go. I bought this along with the telescoping support brace and from the time ordered, to the time Amazon had it in my hands was less than 24 hours, WOW!As far as the quality goes, I am very impressed. There is a huge range as far as adjustments to get it just the way I wanted it, along with fitting the laptop in the tray. I have a heavy truck, and that means stiff suspension. It does shake a bit when going over bumpy roads, but nowhere near unbearable. Another thing that may help some people, is that I was worried the bass (3 JL Audio 10" subs) would shake my laptop's internals. For some reason, everything in my truck shapes, EXCEPT for this mount which I was very pleased with. For the price of this thing, the set-up being so easy, and the add-on items depending on what you need, this is definitely worth the purchase!
