My Roadie arrived yesterday and I already cant imagine playing without it.  It took a second to get it paired to my phone (I was trying to pair through my Bluetooth settings menu) but once I realized it was automatic pairing I was all good.  Cool to watch it learn my strings when I calibrated my acoustic and getting into open D (and back) took no time.  My little robot guitar helper is awesome, good job guys!
