Very secure and firm mount in dash. Only very small issues. I have an asus zenfone 2 with a tpu gel case. The curved back of the zenfone means it has slightly less surface area for perfect magnetic grip. The smaller metal badge does not work as well so the larger rectangular badge does this trick. The other issue, when you remove the rubber guard from the magnetic mount face, I only had 4 small magnets in the recessed pockets. There is space for 6. The extra two magnets would have made it perfect especially for slightly larger or heavier devices. Still, pretty satisfied so far.
