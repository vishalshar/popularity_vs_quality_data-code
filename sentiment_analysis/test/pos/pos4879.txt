Used this to collect a urine sample at home to find out if kitty was sick.  (He was!)1. I wish ALL vets would recommend this.  It is MUCH LESS traumatic than having a vet "collect" pee by extracting urine from the bladder with a needle.  OW!2. Yep, it's kind of gross, but not horrible.  We put the stuff in a disposable aluminum pan so we could get what we needed and throw EVERYTHING else away!3. You don't need the whole bag.  Just enough for kitty to feel like he went in the sand.4. The cat attract stuff in this works very well!  Kitty went in about 10 minutes when we locked him in the bathroom with this stuff.  He clearly didn't have to go (not a full bladder), but he was drawn to it.5. I use disposable droppers and vials.  I bought a bunch because we were having problems; however, we have currently been pee free for a few months (knocks on wood!!).
