I thought I was just going to be "trying out a new type of average sponge" in my shower. I noticed this one came pre-moistened so I had to turn the packaging over and read the back of the label because most sponges do not come wet and I was VERY curious. The package says it is an "exfoliating konjac root green tea powder sponge".I had to go look it up to find out what exactly I was going to be using on my face. As it turns out Konjac vegetable fibre sponges are special. This particular sponge contains antioxidant-rich green tea that helps cleanse, protect cells and antioxidant-rich (I already know that as a green tea drinker). The sponge itself exfoliates and helps to refine pores. Nice!So basically this ONE product is going to replace/knock three items out of my daily skincare routine. Very gentle on my skin yet I don't need a separate exfoliant apricot scrub anymore, I don't need my loofah to try to get the excess dead skin cells from my face and also don't need a liquid cleanser because this product does the job of all three. I love it and I will be adding it to my daily routine!Also appreciate the handy dandy hook that comes with it...I have it hanging in my shower for sanitary purposes. Enclosed is a photo.
