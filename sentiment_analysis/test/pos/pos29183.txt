My kids, ages 11 and 14 love this!! It is a very fun, interactive toy. They have used it on the beach, in the  ocean, in the pool, on the grass, in the house, down the street, etc. There are a lot of fun apps that you can buy to make it do fun things. It can jump, dance, change colors, etc. Very cool toy! Highly recommend.
