I have searched far and wide for the Perfect phone mount and i have failed several times. I finally found one that works well for me. The mount stays firmly in the CD holster. The ball joint isnt so weak that it moves while driving and isnt too strong that it is a pain to adjust. The magnet connection to the phone is strong, but is weaker when a case is used. They say that this mount can be used for tablets but I think that may be a stretch. Overall a great mount. And you can still use the cd player
