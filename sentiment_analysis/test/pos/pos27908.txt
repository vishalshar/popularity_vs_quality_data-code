This is a great game. I especially love that it can be played by up to 12 people. I do not have very many games in my collection that can fit such a large group. Everyone I have introduced this game to has enjoyed it. We rarely play only one time. Everyone wants to take a turn as the clue giver. This game is deceptively difficult and yet not too complicated that my party-game hardliner friends won't take a try (and love it!).
