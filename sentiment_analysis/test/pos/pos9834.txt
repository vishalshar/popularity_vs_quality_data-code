I have been using this for a month (received Nov 2, writing this Dec 5) and my skin tone had evened out considerably.  I believe I have found the write combination of facial products, finally, for my oily, prone to breakouts, early signs of aging skin.  Twice a day I use a salicylic acid cleanser (Obagi), the Solscense, then a day or night moisturizer DermaE and noticed a difference in texture and tone within a couple weeks. The little 'underskin' bumps have all but disappeared.  I can't say it is all due to the Solscense but prior to adding it, my skin texture was not great. I do not notice a foul scent as others have pointed out and in fact there is very little scent.  It is light weight and absorbs quickly.
