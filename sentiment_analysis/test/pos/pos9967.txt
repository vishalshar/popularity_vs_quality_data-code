I always wanted a weather station that had indoor and outdoor temperatures and was easy to set up and use.  I also like the fact that you are part of the Netatmo universe and you can see the temperature of nearby stations and are contributing to a web of weather station data.  Originally my outdoor sensor was in the sun (even though I thought it wasn't) and was giving ratings that were way too high but I hid it in a flower pot and now the readings are much more reasonable.  I find the decibel meter indoors also useful because it is very noisy here in the city with the windows open and now I can get a feeling for how loud it really is.The view on your smart phone or iPad is very cool as well.  The app is intuitive and easy to use.Also - if you have older relatives - this is the kind of gift that they would like.  Everyone likes to talk about the weather.  There is also a rain gauge and a wind gauge (coming soon) which would be good although I probably can't get them to work reliably on my balcony because of the fact that we are partially shielded.
