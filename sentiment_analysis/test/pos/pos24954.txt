Keep one bag for each kind of cheese you use.  Write the name of the cheese on the bag.  Add a sticky note with the date you purchased the current contents.  When empty, remove the date and store the bag until you replace the cheese.  None of our cheeses have developed mold or spoiled since we initiated this system.  *Never touch cheese with your bare hands, which will introduce bacteria to the surface.  We use a paper towel to pick up the block for grating, shaving, cubing, etc.  If mold appears, dampen a paper towel with white vinegar and rub the surface.
