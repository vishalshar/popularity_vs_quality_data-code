I've had this for about a year, and have had no issues.  Clear picture, BRIGHT, and doesn't pixelate at longer distances. I've used it by the pool, on the deck, for work presentations, and even projecting movies on the wall in the bedroom. I now have a pinched nerve in my neck and can only work from a reclined position. I use this little projector to work from home, projecting my computer screen on the ceiling.  Now 7.5  months pregnant and it's helped me tremendously with reclining and working. Gave 1 to a friend for her birthday too.
