So happy I ordered the ampware case for my husband. He loves to go fishing and this time he actually ran out of battery and was able to charge his phone back up enough to use GPS!  I think it is a quality case as good as any lifeproof or otterbox and it actually can charge your phone.  I got the ranger which is the one with the green rubber edge.  So glad.
