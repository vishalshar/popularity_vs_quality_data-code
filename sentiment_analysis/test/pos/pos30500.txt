The story about good spread is just as great as the taste of their peanut butter. They are the TOM's of Peanut Butter, matching what you buy with goodness to a person in need. The honey flavor is spot on perfect, just enough to enjoy while tasting the peanut flavor. I suggest anyone try it. If you're concerned with the price, go find a Baron's or artisan product and compare, the price is actually cheaper though this bundle.
