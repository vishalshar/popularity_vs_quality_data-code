Please be mindfull of the phone you have before buying these. Alot of the comments on here are negetive twords the poor bluetooth connection but the dash is not to blame. I highly recommend connecting you phone to another bt speaker(ie. Soundbar, mobile speaker) then put the phone in your back pocket. Back up 3ish feet and face the speaker. If the sound cuts out dont buy the dash. My nexus 6P had this issue(soundbar and dash) but my new lg v20 works with the dash across the house(and in my back pocket). It became so annoying to have to walk around with my phone in had just to listen to music let alone go running with them. If you have a phone that doesnt have a strong bluetooth controller consider only getting these if you are going to SAVE MUSIC TO THE DASH not use your phone. And really most features for the dash arw built around playing music you saved to the dash. Its a tiny mp3 player.Just make sure they are fitted properly. They should feel extreamly snug like you have water in your ear. And make sure you installed the app ro adjust volume. The. They will sound amazing.Sorry not fitness tracking review I couldn't care less for that feature.
