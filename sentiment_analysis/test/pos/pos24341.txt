I love my Lutrom switches! A must for every smart home. Installation is fairly easy (if you know about electricity). I installed them in the bedrooms, living, dining and TV room (basically everywhere I needed dimmable lights). I used Philips 454363 50W Equivalent 3000K GU10 LED Reflector Light Bulbs and the dimming works perfectly! Only a slight flickering at the lowest level, but you reaaally have to pay attention to notice it.The pico remote is located right on my bedside table and saves me the hassle of getting up (yes, lazy!) You also have the option of using the Lutron App, Homekit app or Siri. Which brings me to my next point: the hub! It's small, discrete, and installation is super easy! You need this in order to control your house via homekit app and siri.
