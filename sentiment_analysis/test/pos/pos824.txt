I got a variety set for my brushes, and they fit properly on all my straight-angle brushes. It does slow down the process of drying, but you're not suppose to dry your brushes with this on them anyway. I feel in need of this since I travel a lot, and the brush guard helps to protect my brushes. Although personally I think it's just a net and shouldn't cost this much, it's still a very handy and useful tool.
