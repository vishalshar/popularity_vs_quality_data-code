My oldest has motor skill issues that make tying his shoes effectively a difficult chore.  These work PERFECT!!!  He can wear normal laced shoes and they stay on, even in gym class.  He's tough on them, for sure, but they have been holding up for months now.  It took a bit to get the right lacing so that we had more room at the top to get his wide feet into the shoe, but snug through the lower and middle portions of the lacing area to securely hold the shoe to his foot, but once we got it, it was set and forget.  No more spending hours looking for velcro shoes!  I've been fielding questions from other parents about them once they see that he's not wearing regular laces.  They really do sell themselves once you see them in action.
