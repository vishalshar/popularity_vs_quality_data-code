If you're buying a fingerprint lock, don't look anywhere else. Simplicity, elegance and security come together beautifully for what is truly an amazing product. No false reads or anything wonky like that. I use this on the doors of my business and my home and it is freaking awesome. In the future o hope to see an "Admin Only" mode, but until then, it's still a 5 star product
