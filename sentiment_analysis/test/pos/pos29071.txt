Love these! Super comfortable, very lightweight, easy setup, mic sounds great, audio is clear. I tend to accidentally hit the up button instead of the on/off/pause button, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.I always use this while on phone calls at home, running, or just doing things around the apartment in general.
