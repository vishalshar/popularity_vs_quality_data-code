A toy that has its place and earns 5 stars for what it does.In that place it is 5 stars.One PS4 or Xbox game costs more!As a serious camera I would give it a 1 star.You would need their newer generation at 10 times the price for printable image quality that is close to a point and shoot.But.......At the price a great opportunity to see the next genertion of 'camera'.You need to use the accessory collar with a mini tripod on it to hold the camera at interesting angles.Hand holding without the collar and tripod is next to rediculously impossible.The screen is SMALL so it is hard to see the effects.There is no flash. Forget shooting in low light.The software works great and the adjustable images are great for tablets, phones and computer screens.But.....Do not expect to make prints of any decent quality over 4" x 6".I am having fun with macro photography depth of field tricks.For printable everything else, I use my Nikon.Great toy.
