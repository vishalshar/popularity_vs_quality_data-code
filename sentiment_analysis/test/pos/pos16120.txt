LOVE this game...this isn't just a math game, it's a strategy game and a great game for Families to play together.  Read the rules a couple of times to totally understand the rules, but a great game.  .  The age range, a 10 year old or younger might need some help but what a way to help them with their Math practices!  I would recommend this game
