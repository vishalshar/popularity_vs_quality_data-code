I purchased this system to protect my tool shed / workshop.  I chose this system because it seemed like a good value / feature compromise for my situation.  I have installed other alarm systems before and compared to them, this was the easiest system to setup by far.  I am a network engineer during the day and a handyman on the weekend.  I think this system is the best low budget option available at the moment.PROS:1. No monthly fees.  I didn't want to be paying any monthly bills to monitor my tool shed2. Easy of installation.  The addition of the sensors and remote was very simple and easy to do.CONS;1. The modules use standard AA or AAA batteries.  I am not sure what is going to happen when they start to die.  I have had them operational now for about 3 months.  Better systems like the one in my home use Lithium Ion batteries in the sensors that last 3-5 years.2. The sensors didn't have screw holes to mount them.  They want you to use double sided tape.  No thanks.  I disassembled them all, drilled holes in them, screwed them to the wall and reassembled them in place.  The last thing i need is double sided tape failing causing a false alarm at 3am.3. The alarm panel is a vulnerability.  Because the power and Ethernet connect to the top of the unit, and the unit just hangs on the wall, it is kinda unsightly.  If you wanted to, you could break open the door, unplug the power and Ethernet to the unit in a matter of seconds and within 30 seconds you could have the AA batteries out of it to stop the alarm.  I tried it myself because i was curious.  It took me 22 seconds to disable it after coming in the door.  Granted, during that time it sent a message to my phone saying the alarm was going off, but ideally, the alarm would continue to sound locally to alert my neighbors or myself.  To help solve this problem, i cut down and mounted a piece of conduit to prevent the unit from being unplugged or removed from the wall.  Because you have to lift up on the unit to remove it from the wall, the conduit prevents your ability to slide it upwards off the screws as well as preventing you from unplugging the power or Ethernet wires.  In my shed, the conduit goes up in to a locked cabinet I already had there so you can't access the power cable to unplug it from the wall either.  You can see my conduit in the picture i attached.4. The APP is almost useless for disarming the alarm.  Every time you open the app it says the system is disarmed.  I have set my alarm off several times now because of this.  I will go out to the workshop, open the app to disarm the alarm, it says it is already disarmed, so i open the door to go in and find out it was armed when the alarm sounds.  I eventually learned that the app is always wrong at first.  So what i must do is open the app and wait 30 seconds to 1 minute and repeatedly go back and forth between the screens in the app until it finally shows the alarm is armed and lets me disarm it.  You don't have the option to disarm the system unless the app thinks it is armed so you just have to stand there and wait forever.  Because it is such a pain, now i mostly use the included key-chain remote to disarm the shed.  I just keep it by the back door andwhen i leave to go to the shed, i take it with me.5. - UPDATE 6-14-2016 - The stickers they give you to warn would be burglers that you have an alarm are TOTAL GARBAGE!  I put one on the outside of the shed and within 6 months it has faded to a totally white blank sticker.  It is not even in direct sunlight for more than 1 hour a day at the most.  Having the stickers to warn of an alarm is just as important if not more important than the alarm.  I have free bumper stickers on my truck that have lasted 10 years without fading and their sticker can't even make it 6 months.As a side note, i put a cheap battery backup unit in the locked cabinet and plugged the alarm into it rather than buying the available battery backup unit.  In my case, in order for the internet to function i need to keep the switch and fiber optic transceiver (i think i mentioned i was a nerd) powered in the shed also so it just made sense to plug them all into one backup unit.  If you want to protect an outbuilding like a garage, barn, or shed with this system, you will need to have an Ethernet connection available or use a wireless to Ethernet bridge device since the hub will not work on wifi alone.
