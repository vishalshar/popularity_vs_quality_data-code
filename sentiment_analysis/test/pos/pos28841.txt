Years n years n years men of all ages miss the bowl at night. Woman (moms n wives) for years n years n years hate it! Wow! What took so long to figure this one out.1 take out if package (30 seconds)2 insert 3 AAA batteries (45 seconds)3 walk to the main family bathroom  and install unit ( less the 1 minute)4. Turn lights out and play with it, changing light colors - choose one steady color or let it auto change. Done!Over last 3 days - no misses :0) motion works from 12 feet away stays on for 2 minutes after no motion auto off.It has a motion detector and a photocell to detect light so it does not come on if lights are on or day light from window. Nice! Auto off if you turn lights on while bowl light is on. Nice - saves battery life.Excellent product worth every penny - my son wants one for college dorm.One hitch - the 4 suction cups on the motion detection don't hold. It slipped down after a day - the cord to the light is longer then needed, I tucked the extra behind unit. I've stretched out the motion from the light and that has worked. No more slipping issues. I assume they made the cord so long for other applications (?)
