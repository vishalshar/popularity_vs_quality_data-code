ZUS is as good as your phone GPS to locate your car. I first used it with a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it was not too accurate. When I switched to an Axon ZTE 7 it has been consistently accurate. It is the phone GPS that made a difference.Zus works well for charging my phone but from my phone point of view it hasn't reached the charging speed of USB 3.
