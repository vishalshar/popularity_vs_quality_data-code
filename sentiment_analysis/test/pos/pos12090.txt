Currently, I have an iPhone 4S, and I plan on upgrading to the 6 or 6+ later this year. I wanted to get something that could adjust to the size of the device I have, but I didn't want to buy another mount within a year in order to accommodate a new phone. iOttie's mount appeared to be sturdy and adjustable. When I received the mount, I was not disappointed. The mount is robust and the handle bar clamp actually has metal female threads for the screw, so, it's definitely harder to strip out the handle bar clamp. The mount itself is very sturdy and will indeed accommodate a larger device (i.e. iPhone 6/6+).In addition to a well made product, iOttie, the company, reached out to me personally to see how I was liking their product. I expressed to them that I wished they had some sort of a medium thickness insert to make the fit on my particular handle bars better. They immediately sent out an insert they believe will resolve the issue. I am extraordinarily impressed with the proactive customer service of iOttie.
