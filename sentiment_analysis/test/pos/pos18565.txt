works as expected. this isn't a high-end turntable, so the sound isn't fantastic. it allows me to play my vinyl, I did have to use the standard penny on the arm trick to prevent skipping, but for this price I wasn't shocked. pairs well with Bluetooth, the sound is rich and has decent volume. if I wanted to fill a larger space (I live in a one bedroom apartment), it might be a bit quiet. all in all, it goes with the decor of my home bar and does what I would expect for the price. if you're an audiophile, you will want to go with a different unit.
