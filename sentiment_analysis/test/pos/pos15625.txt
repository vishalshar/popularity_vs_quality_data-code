My only regret in buying the Pencil is waiting so long to finally pull the trigger.I had been researching styluses for months and always came back to the Pencil by 53. After I saw it was on sale I decided it was time.I'll say first that they nailed the design. The carpenter style shape is much easier to keep a grip on when drawing and just feels nice in your hand.The Pencil is best suited for drawing and sketching however could be used for writing. I find it's not very accurate for writing text though. Sure, it's much better than your finger but from what I've seen and heard there are much better styluses for text entry.If your not familiar with this product it actually designed to be used with the Paper app, also made by 53. The Paper app pairs with the Pencil nicely using Bluetooth (the process used for pairing is actually pretty sweet, it's called kiss to pair and you just push your Pencil down into the designated area and you're done) and adds features like being able to erase using the back of the Pencil just as you would a real pencil. (Other apps do officially support the Pencil and are listed on their website. ) This is especially nice when drawing and much faster than selecting an eraser.The Pencil comes with one replacement tip and eraser and additional replacements are available from Amazon.I love the look and feel of the walnut Pencil, which is actually a little more expensive. It is also the only model equipped with a magnet so that it can attach to the Apple Smart Case. Convenient.Overall, I feel the Pencil at regular price is a little expensive but after using it, I would gladly pay the full price.
