Excellent product to extend your brushes' longevity.  The variety pack was just what I needed.  It included 1 large, 2 mediums, 2 smalls, and 1 extra small so there's a perfect size for every brush.  What I didn't like was that one of my brushes is, length-wise, a little on the small size; it's hard to slip it through the long guards.  I often have the scrunch the guard and inch it along the brush, or stick my fingers through one of the openings to pull the brush through.  Either method seems bad for the guard and messes up the meshing a little, but it's the only way to get the brush through.  I guess this is a good excuse to buy a new brush though.Also, it comes through USPS in a regular envelope, which I was surprised at, but the packaging protected the guards from damage/possible rough handling.
