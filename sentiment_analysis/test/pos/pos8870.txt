Awesome pen. Fits in the hand well, great variety of additional strand colours and types are available for purchasing, nice color (blue), and after some training (and a couple of rods) you get used to it.Odour, heating, and noise are quite endurable.The only drawback: strands are consumed extremely fast, hence the strands included are not enough for somewhat large projects.Advice: to get a better result, you have to press the pen tighter against the working surface.Attached pic shows the first results.
