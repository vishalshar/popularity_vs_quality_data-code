This is simply the best smartwatch made thus far (end of 2015). At least for my needs :). My experience is using it with Android (OnePlus One on Marshmallow). Other devices may differ, ESPECIALLY iPhone.After much research, I bought this at MSRP shortly after black friday. Took 3 days for it to ship, which is reasonable for holiday rush. The day it arrived, I checked amazon and the price had dropped a substantial amount (20%). One chat w/ Amazon customer support and two hours later, the difference was back in my bank account. 6 stars for Amazon, as always.I bought the 20mm black version as a taller 26 y/o woman, and the size of it is perfect. It's just watch sized, and you very quickly forget that it is there. I have never gotten clothes stuck on it, no issues reaching into bags, etc. This is vastly different from every other smartwatch on the market, and makes the PTR the best option out there. Style is important to me, and I enjoy wearing something modern but relaxed at the same time. Most people wouldn't immediately recognize it as a smartwatch, until they see you use it.Attached pic is my watch face (91 Dub v3.0). It's minimalist, someone could conceivably confuse it for a normal watch, while still having all of the info you need immediately available. Date, day of week, battery percent, and of course the time. The bluetooth symbol will also turn red if connection to phone is broken. 'Actual watch' functionality brings us to another one of the PTR's strongest points...Always on screen. The screen uses e-ink, meaning maintaining a static image costs essentially no electricity, and that it is visible without a backlight in any lit room. Updating the display however is expensive, avoid watchfaces with constant animations, especially including blinking colons. The watch being visible whenever is simply amazing, and is another core watch feature that other smartwatches lack. With the backlight off, the colors on the screen are surprisingly sharp and clear. But, with the backlight on...The backlight is very poor. It is bright and functional, but when it is on your colors will become immediately washed out to a drastic level. This doesn't bother me a ton, but it is a downside. The pink in my watchface turns a strong violet with the backlight on, even though it is very clearly pink. The automatic detection to turn the backlight on doesn't work, at all. It both turns on when I don't want it to (taking it off, or rolling over at night and have watch blind me, etc), and very rarely turns on when I actually try to. I might look into turning this feature off, as the random backlights waste battery.Segue into battery life! Compared to every other smartwatch on the market, amazing. Compared to past Pebble's, poor. I easily get 2 days of battery life from it, which is more than good enough for me. I simply keep the charger in the bathroom, and charge it whilst I shower and do my face. It's enough to charge it from 0% to 60-70%. Please note your battery life will vary based on usage. Using it often will drain the battery, including animated watch faces, apps running that constantly draw on screen, notifications, alarms, etc.Notifications work well. I just selected the apps I wanted notifications for, and it's done. I can perform any of the quick actions from the watch directly (for ex in gmail I can dismiss notification or archive email directly from the watch). It's a simple, but great way to be alerted to events. I use this a lot for various events on servers I maintain, integrated through pushbullet, and it works like a charm for 24 hour alerts of any issues.The vibration on this thing is strong, especially if you use the higher settings. The alarm feature can easily wake me up, and I'm a deep sleeper. Unfortunately, if you sleep through the alarm for 5 minutes, you will pay a lot in battery life due to powering the vibration motor. Best to get an app that can track sleep cycles and wake you up at the ideal time. I have yet to try this yet, but will tonight.Apps are meh. Several still aren't supported on Round, so it's hit or miss. I generally don't use a ton of apps on it, but the 2 factor auth one is really handy. App store is s***, it's just HTML in their app and runs very poorly.Overall, a simply absolutely wonderful watch. If you want a watch that is a watch first, but has notifications, basic fitness, sleep tracking, etc, then this is for you.
