Wonderful product. Primarily I use them for my keys but the possibilities are endless.I love fact I can replace the batteries (which are super cheap) when needed so I'm not waiting for a new one to arrive. I also like that this can send a notification to my phone alerting me I've left something behind when I walk away from it. Before I lose it! Who wants to lose something and not find out until hours later? The alert tone is much louder than before. Plus if I misplace my phone I can have an alert sent to it as well. Also when I'm at home I can turn off the notifications while close to it. It is Bluetooth so it's constantly active. If it's not there I just turn the notifications back on and search. Simple and easy! Saves so much time for me.
