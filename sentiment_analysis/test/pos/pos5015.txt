This may sound like a silly review, but I was blown-up by an antipersonnel mine in Vietnam many, many years ago, and I spent years afterwards digging thousands of small metal shards out of my skin as they worked their way up and out of the flesh to near the surface of the skin.  I'm also a woodworker, so taken together, I've had lots of practical experience in difficult metal and wood sliver removal.  You could find a better single tool out there for removing slivers than this one, but it would be some kind of professional instrument that would cost a dozen times what this tool costs.  I like the fine, slightly sharpened point which, either alone or together with a needle, easily gets into the sliver cavity to chase the sliver down the path it came in, and to lift it up and extract it.  I've used this model, or one similar to it, for many years and it's incomparably better than other crude instruments you might otherwise use, like eyebrow tweezers or the tweezers in your Swiss Army knife.  They used to be readily available in woodworking stores years ago as you checked out at the register, but they seem to be hard to find now.  I like the clip that comes with this model because it protects the tip, and it protects other things from the tip when you carry it in your pocket or first aid kit.  It's easy to hold and manipulate with great dexterity.  The tip grips the sliver securely during removal, and it's easily cleanable before and after use.  You couldn't ask for a better instrument in a small package.  These are always part of my outdoor first aid kit for removal of other nasties, like cactus spines broken off halfway down, bee stingers, and whatever else you might unexpectedly encounter in the boonies, a small fish hook being an example of what it wasn't designed for, but for which I've successfully used it.  Other jobs it wasn't designed for, but at which it excels, are manipulation of the tiny screws for eyeglasses, and manipulation of small, thin, delicate objects like precisely placing stamps in a stamp book.  I now have arthritis in my hands, and I find it easy to hold and use for gripping a variety of tiny things that my hands can no longer precisely manipulate without it.
