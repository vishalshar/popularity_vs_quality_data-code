If you love MATH, you will love this board game. My 8 yo enjoys math and she found this game a lot of fun. Although it is targeted for 10 yo and up, I think even younger kids who like basic arithmetic will find this game a lot of fun.The creator of this game, Dan Finkel, has given a TED Talk titled Five Principles of Extraordinary Math Teaching. I had watched his talk before but didnt know about this board game.Having played this game with my daughter several times, I can say without a doubt that this game definitely inspires kids to get into math. It provides kids who are learning to add, subtract, multiply and divide, a fun way to practice their skills. I use this board game as an educational tool and it has helped my daughter understand multiplication and division better.The only downside that I can think of is that if you want to use multiplication and division, 101 as the maximum number you can multiply up to can be very limiting so you are left with only addition and subtraction after you reach about 50 on the number board. But I dont count it as a negative against this game because going higher than 101 could make it somewhat more difficult for the younger players. It would also increase the amount of time it takes for each pawn to finish, making it less exciting for kids.Overall, this is a unique, fun, educational board game that the whole family can enjoy.
