We had bought this for our 2 and 1 year old for a plane ride.  It was able to keep them entertained and quiet.  It is big and we were not able to use some of the small pieces.  I have toddlers who are teething and they put everything in their mouth.  Otherwise it held up fine and many of the animals survived the plane ride.
