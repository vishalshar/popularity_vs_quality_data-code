Short review : out of the package they are average tweezers, good for picking up small doodads like beads, no worse than a swiss-army tweezer. A few laps with 1000 grit sandpaper and you can turn these into some very nice precision tweezers worth of being called "The Tweezers with Pin-Point-Precision" as they are stamped. Apparently Uncle Bill's tweezers have been around for years, and he used to bevel the edges of the tips to needle points. At some point he must have sold the biz to a company who mass-produce these with stamped metal and they don't bevel the tips. That, dear reader, is left to you.The keychain holder is what really makes these useful. You can put these into your EDC (every day carry) kit very easily. Like I said, a few laps with 1000 grit and you have great tweezers (5 star worthy). As they come, they are merely decent, but they have the potential to be great.
