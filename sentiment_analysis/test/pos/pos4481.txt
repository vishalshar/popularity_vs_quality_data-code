My children have been using Hello Toothpaste for about a month now and they seem to really enjoy it. I know for a fact that they love the flavor and the smell of the toothpaste which is one of the reasons that they "rush to brush" often. I love that Hello toothpaste is a natural and more healthier solution for my children in general. I have noticed that Hello toothpaste does a good job cleaning my 4 year old daughters mouth just fine, she even gloats about having a fruity smell when she gets done brushing. But when it comes to my 6,8 and 10 year old children it's not quit the same, a bit differ in results, as a matter of fact. They wish for a more minty feel, I don't know, I guess they like the minty clean feeling that really gets their breath smelling clean.  Shoot as a matter of fact, just to be sure, I even tried this toothpaste and I liked it!. I feel that Hello toothpaste really helped get the job done and I definitely will be  recommending it for younger children. I will continue using this product for my four year daughter. Thanks Hello for an amazing Product! "I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."
