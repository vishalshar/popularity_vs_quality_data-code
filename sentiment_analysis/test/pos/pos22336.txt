We have had the Whistle Tracker for about a month now and in that time frame our dog has escaped twice and the tracking system worked well but wish it updated the dogs location more frequently.  The one thing I do not like is the limitation on the shape of the GPS safe zone having to be a circular shape.  We have a fairly long rectangular property and in order to include both the front and back yard the circular safety zone includes neighbors yards on both sides.
