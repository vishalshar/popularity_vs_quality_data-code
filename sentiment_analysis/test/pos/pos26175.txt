I generally like it. I've compared its heart monitor wth another device and they match perfectly.My main gripes are wth the display and wth the app. On the display you see an icon for an item like steps which immediately disappears and is followed by the value. One item is completely mysterious, giving something measured in MI. The icon disappears to soon to identify it.In the app, some things like the scale for heartbeats is too light to read.
