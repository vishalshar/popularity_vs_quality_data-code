I was slightly suspicious at first, but I'm a dedicated user now. These are WAY BETTER than regular single use ziplock type bags. Even disregarding the environmental benefits, these are very handy.My biggest fear was cleaning them, but I've had no issues and no problems with lingering smells (after storing things like a cut onion).You'll need to be sure to dry them out, but that's minor compared to the convenience.
