Wild Friends Foods makes the best almond butter I've ever had, there's just no other way to put it.Some other reviewers talk about their almond butter being spoiled, which I'm surprised by -- I've bought at least a half dozen products from WFF and never had any quality control issues. Once I was shipped the wrong product, and I contacted them and they immediately shipped out the correct product (at their cost, obviously, and I got to keep the wrong one!)You have to stir it, yes. But the flavor of every jar is incredible.
