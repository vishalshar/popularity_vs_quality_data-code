I absolutely love my YoCam, it's the best camera I've ever owned. I recently took it on vacation with me and it performed fantastically well underwater, I was able to document my entire scuba driving expedition. I loved that it didn't need any additional housing/casing in order to be used underwater. The Mofily app is very easy to use and I love turning my photos into stories. Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase, 5/5
