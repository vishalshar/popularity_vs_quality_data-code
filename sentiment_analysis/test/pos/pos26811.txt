So to give a little backstory, I am a new dentist, and if theres anything you need to know about dentistry, is that musculoskeletal problems are the number one disability claims.  The job just wrecks your body, there is no easy way to fix someones mouth while sitting straight.  After working 6 days a week for about 18 months out of school I was already coming home with muscle spasms and back and shoulder pain.  If I didnt learn how to sit properly I wasnt going to last long.  Overall im pretty happy with the device once I actually learned where to put it (trial and error) though dentistry is not a static job, we twist and turn and do all sorts of crazy things to be able to see where we need to, and of course the Upright will buzz and buzz and buzz even though right now I just cannot sit up.  Thats not much of a problem.  Its still fantastic when i do cleanings, exams, write my charts up, things like that.  The one issue Ive had is that it will disconnect SEVERAL times a day.  And I dont realize that it's not working until Ive been slouching for a while instead of it reminding me instantly.  Other than that its great.  I wear it out, basically anywhere I think it will be helpful.  Its a little temperamental when Im doing a lot of walking, but other than that I dont regret the purchase at all!  Wish I would have had it sooner!
