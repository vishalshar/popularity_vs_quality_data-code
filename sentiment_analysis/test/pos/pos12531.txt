I have been a Canary user for a couple of years now. Adding the Flex to my account and pairing the new device with the app really couldn't be any easier (much simpler than the original model was when I got it).  Once paired, it took a few minutes to update its firmware, and then I was able to view live video. I currently have it plugged in indoors watching the backdoor entrance to my house, so I can't comment on the battery life as of yet, but it has been working reliably as I would expect it to otherwise. Completely satisfied so far.
