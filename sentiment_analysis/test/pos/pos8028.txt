Great product. Remarkably easy to use. However, the jack does not fit in ibanez SR basses with the scooped input jack.  It was clearly designed to fit strat style scoop inputs as well as flat. But it is Appx 1/8-1/4" too short to work on my ibanez SR 300/400's with the 'scooped' input jack.I tried using a1/4 inch extender adapter, which worked, but I experienced a severe drop in volume.However, I still rate at 4 stars because with my other basses (with standard flat jacks) this thing works BEAUTIFULLY.I've been looking for sometime for a wireless system to replace my broken old AKG 'guitar bug' I was spoiled by that system and did not want to go back to pack/cable wireless sytems. This fits the bil nicely.
