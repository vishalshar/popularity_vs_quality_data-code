So far so good.  Two weeks and everything is still working.  Love the nostalgic mood in creates just sitting in the room.  Electronics are good for the price.  One of the few that comes with a CD recorder.  Real wood.  Some are just veneer.  Parts are solid, too.  Speakers are average, but worth the money.  Comes with remote, aux/headphone extension and RCA to mp3 audio cables, and dust cloth.  Very well packaged.
