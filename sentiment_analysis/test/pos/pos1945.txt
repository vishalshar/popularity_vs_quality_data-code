I'd been looking into getting a webcam for my dog and an autofeeder -- this is the best of both worlds! At first, I had issues logging into the mobile site on my iPhone 6 but I was able to log in with the Chrome browser. Setting up the wifi was pretty easy. I'd recommend testing it out first while you're at home. I unplug it after I get home in the evening and I have no issues getting it back online in the morning. Love being able to feed my dog when I'm coming home late, and knowing she actually ate her food (my friends with regular autofeeders have this concern). Totally worth the money.
