My 13-year-old loves this gift from Santa! It is much easier to control than previous drones he's had. His chief complaint is that run time is only a short 4-5 minutes. The charging cable broke upon initial use, though. The connector that fits into the base to charge the drone separated from the wires, which my husband calls cheap manufacturing. Thankfully Amazon issued a partial refund to make up for the problem, and I was able to purchase another charging cable.
