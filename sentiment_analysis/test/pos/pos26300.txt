Two years ago I had a home energy audit. The contractor had a wicked cool FLIR thermal camera. He could point the FLIR at different surfaces and see a real-time color-enhanced thermal image showing places where cold air was infiltrating, where ducts were under-insulated, etc. For someone looking to make their home more comfortable and efficient, it was an amazing tool. Unfortunately, it also cost well over a thousand dollars. FLIR later came out with a device that worked with an iPhone, but because of it's snap-around design it would only work until Apple changed the physical shape of the phone, which they do regularly. So I settled for a thirty dollar Black & Decker devices that shines a blue or red dot on a surface based on its temperature. It was better than nothing, but not nearly as useful as a real thermal imaging camera -- not even close.Then I discovered the Seek Thermal imaging camera. It uses your iPhone for the processing, display, battery, etc., which means you're only paying for the incremental hardware. This means the device is only a couple hundred bucks instead of a couple thousand dollars. Brilliant!But does it work? I have to say that this is one of those devices that has actually exceeded my expectations. Installation is a non event. You just download the app, plug in the camera, and go. The thermal images are false-color coded so that hot and cold surfaces really stand out. Walking around my pitch black basement I could identify every pipe and piece of equipment just from their thermal images. Upstairs and in the attic, I could see areas that were leaking air based on the sharp color differences. The resolution is better than I expected. It really is amazing to see the world in infrared instead of visible light.The app turns your iOS device into the display for the device. The interface is incredibly simple and easy to use. It also has some very nice features, like being able to display the temperatures of the hottest and coldest spots in the image.One feature that the dedicated FLIR cameras have that the Seek doesn't have is image overlay. With the FLIR, you can overlay the thermal image on top of a regular visible light image to make it a bit easier to identify what's emitting the heat. I thought I would want this feature (although not enough to pay ten times more), but having now used the Seek I find the pure thermal image to be completely adequate.This really is an amazing device. It's great for any homeowner who wants to make their house more efficient and comfortable by identifying air leaks or under-insulated areas. And I have to admit it's just plain fun to explore the world in infrared!
