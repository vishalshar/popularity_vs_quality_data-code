Love this bag...well constructed, and surprisingly roomy for the size.  The cupholder fits a large Tervis or other large water bottle, which is rare.  Only complaint is that the shoulder padding, while really well padded and constructed, isn't quite positioned right if you wear this crossbody toward your back...the padding ends up offset from the top of your shoulder no matter which way you flip it.  Small complaint, it's still pretty comfortable to wear, and I've loaded it with books and things a lot heavier than gym equipment.  Totally worth the money.
