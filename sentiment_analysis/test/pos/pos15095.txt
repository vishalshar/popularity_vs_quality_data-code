I purchased this because the reviews were so good. It is fantastic!  It fits my iPhone, a credit card, and keys...all while not moving when I run! And it's not bulky.  I highly recommend.  I had problems with an old running belt that rides up...this does not.  It does not have a  place for a race number, if that is important...you could just use pins though.
