I love this product. I feel like a Pinterest fail because how they look on MY shoes is NOT how they look on the Hickies shoe models. But, I have shoes with tabs, not holes (see my photos). I bought them because my laces are always coming undone and tripping me at the worst times. I even broke my ankle a few months back because of that. Glad I didn't hit my head when I went down. I've tried double tying my laces, using short laces, knotting the laces...and nothing worked. I don't remember this being a big problem when I was a kid. I'm 60 now. Active, and I own more sneakers than heels. So....Here we go:PROS: very easy to install or lace into your shoes. Took me 5 minutes and I have tabs I had to coax the Hickies through. Very sturdy and flexible, but keep sharp fingernails away from them. They look like you could pinch them in half!! lol!!Lighter than shoelaces.You get three options for lacing - tight, regular, medium, so if you're not happy with the tension, just change the way they're laced. The instructions tell you how.If you like color coordinating stuff, they come in enough colors to do that. If you don't like looking like you're a 5-year old you can get plain old black. They won't make your feet look less fat, but no one will notice you don't have laces.Good, clear, easy to follow instructions, if you don't have questions and are a visual learner. Really, you can figure this out. If you can't, then maybe someone else DOES need to be putting your shoes on for you.Good packaging and arrived a day ahead of schedule. Under promise and overdeliver is always a good policy.These are the kind of things design and package wise Apple might make.There are 14 Hickies in a package - enough for most shoes and extra if something breaks.They won't get knotted when wet. In fact, water won't affect them at all. I sail and kayak and these are perfect for slipping my shoes off and on with one hand as I usually have a paddle or something in one hand anyway. They slip on and off easily.Your kids are going to love them. Your spouse is going to love them.CONS: INsanely, ridiculously overpriced. I can see $10, or would snap up a dozen boxes at $8, but $14.99!? And I see that price has dropped a buck since I bought mine. I'd have rated them a 5-star except for the price.There could be enough for two pairs of shoes, at first I thought there were. But, no such luck. You'll use 10-12 of the Hickies and then have a few spares to throw into a junk drawer where you can't find them if one breaks. I think if they'd include another four to six hickies for the price, so you get enough for two shoes with no spares, the price would be resonable. I am using one of the spares to hold my gym key to my shoe. I think as long as there is tension on it, it should be fine. You can also loosen a Hickey to thread a car key or even those key/money wallets to the shoe, so that's good, but I'm too lazy to move it up to the PROS. I'm really trying to find a CON, but I can honestly say the price is the only think I can see right now. I've slipped them off and on a couple of times, and walked around in them and they're really great. The "regular" tension is fine for me. I guess if you're a runner or you obcess about how your shoes fit you'll have to fiddle with the tension, but as one short, fat, old lady who mostly walks for exercise and spends a lot of time with her feet in the water, I love 'em.
