I had the quickzip sheets given to me at my baby shower for my (now 2 year old) daughter.  The mom who gave them to me said I would never use another crib sheet again.  She was right!  I still use them on her toddler bed for a quick solution for night time accidents!  So I HAD to get a new set for my baby boy!  These sheets save your back and sanity for those middle of the night bed changings and are just as convienient when you just have to pull them off to wash them.  One of the best gifts in my opinion.
