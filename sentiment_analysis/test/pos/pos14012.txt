Cute robot had us all entertained for most of Christmas day. Inspired by another reviewer, we had him delivering treats to our cat on his little tray. He spins and dances and you can download an app to interact with him from your tablet or phone (though the kids haven't used this much). We got the white robot, the black robot the Miposaur, one for each of my sons, and they played with them a lot for a few days, but haven't got much use out of them since.
