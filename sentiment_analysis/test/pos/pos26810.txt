It tells you what a really proper posture is. I just strained my upper muscles when tried to sit upright but, I now realized that I should strain my lower stomach intensively. Otherwise, upright doesn't give you a green light.However, it lacks some comfortability, for example,  it vibrates making audible noise. You cannot use it in office or library which opposes the commercial film....Also, I rarely do my maintenance training after finishing the 15-day workshop. It's somekind of boring...I think some incentives are needed for motivation.However, the product itself is very well-made and has few errors. I recomment it!
