It works well. Of course I did not expect it works like a regular Hi-Fi, but as a wireless earphones, it's really amazing. I tried to download the music with highest quality, it helps the dashes' performance. I like it so much and already purchased anther 2 as friend's birthday gift, I want to share with my friends!
