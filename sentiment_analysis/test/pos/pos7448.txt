Better than the primary alternative on Amazon because the Sideclick handles power AND volume AND channels AND input AND has two spare variable buttons which I used for menu and return. I appreciate being finally able to use a single remote.The only issue:  At first, programming the Sideclick's buttons wasn't working for me. But then I realized that I was aligning the Amazon fire stick with my remote rather than the aligning the Sideclick with my remote. The issue was resolved by moving the remote by half-an-inch so that the line of site was properly aligned for programming the buttons.
