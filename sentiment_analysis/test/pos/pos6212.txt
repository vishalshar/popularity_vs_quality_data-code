At first i got this and was just thinking comically, but once i got to using it i was thinking economically. It is a wonderful vessel for working around the house, always stays level, holds a fair amount,  and is comfortable to wear and drink from, not to mention durable. Getting a small silicone cover keeps your horn clean and dust free when it is sitting waiting for use. I love this horn and think about it ever time I'm drinking from some peasant's cup. If there was a version of this with some sort of lid, I would probably wear it at all times!I am blown away by this purchase and if i would have need for more, i wouldn't hesitate in buying this again.
