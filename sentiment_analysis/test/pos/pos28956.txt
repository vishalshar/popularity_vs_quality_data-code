I bought this product for a very particular purpose, to stream Pandora over WiFi at the gym. After searching for a WiFi capable MP3 or iPod, I realized there was no such thing. If there was, it was ridiculously expensive. Thinking outside the box I decided to purchase the smallest phone I could find, the POSH. It was difficult setting up the SIM card I bought from Walmart because of how small the buttons are, but it is surprisingly responsive. It does a great job for me at the gym with wireless earbuds linked (POSH is Bluetooth compatible). It is also a plus being able to make an emergency phone call whenever needed. The size comes in handy when you have little to no space. As an everyday phone, it may be a little too petite. Perhaps a young teenager may view it as quite the novelty. :) I hope this helps some of you in deciding. Thank you.
