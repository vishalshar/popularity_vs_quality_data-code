The only reason I give it 4 and not 5 is because I don't think it has realized it's full potential as a scanner/printer combo. There is a lot here to praise. The built in GUI, the enclosed build area, and the fast and clean prints are all very nice. The removable extruder cartridge is brilliant. Does it have issues and bugs? Yes, but it seems to reset and is up and running again in a minute or two. The scanner is not as good as advertised, but it has promise.  There are design flaws here and there, but are overshadowed by great design solutions other printers lack. This printer just gets better and better. It has not stopped running since I turned it on.October 2 update:  The machine is still running non-stop and the prints are consistently good. I had exactly one failed print that slipped from the plate. I have given up trying to print spheres for now. UHU glue is the ONLY way to go. Any other failed prints have been from human error, mostly from poor layouts.  The scanner gets occasional use. It's just not producing "copies" of items, but "blobs" that somewhat resemble the original. I have figured out how to clean up the scans in CAD, but it's time consuming.November 20 update: Scanning is working MUCH better now. It's actually useful. Printer is still going strong. My most reliable printer ever. When I compare it to the industrial printers at work, it stands up pretty well. Where it lacks in precision to the $100k and up units, it excels in speed and versatility. It's also insanely cheap to operate. Lastly, customer service is very good. Given the heartache I've had with other printers in this class, I'm changing my rating to 5 stars based on it's durability and overall usefulness to me.
