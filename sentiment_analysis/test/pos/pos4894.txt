This neat little thermal camera is ideal for troubleshooting or monitoring electrical systems. It's resolution is sufficient to identify several issues. Please Note this not a simple toy camera. It is intended for professional use and an operator must have the training and experience to use it. I am a level 2 certified Thermographer and at the price of 300usd, what a bargain!FYI almost every thermal camera will make a clicking noise to refresh the image on its sensor.  Those reviews which complain of this noise and the low resolution plus other petty issues not related to the field of thermography please find a Thermographer to donate this amazing tool. You all need to stick to playing with your cell phone visual camera and leave thermal technology alone.
