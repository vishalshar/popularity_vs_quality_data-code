In a new and different phase of my life and I decided that I wanted to learn to play the guitar.  Lessons were both expensive and hard to set up for convenient times.  Also, that's not always the best way for me to learn.  So when I saw the Jamstik, I thought it was my best shot at attaining my goal.  So far, so great!  The lessons are fun, the device was easy to set up and I'm able to go back to develop the basics that I know will help me to play guitar.  I'm getting better every time that I practice.  This is a well thought out product that is perfect for what I want.
