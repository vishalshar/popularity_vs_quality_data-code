I really dig this product. I purchased it after going through multiple monoprice cables every couple months.I keep this looped around a key ring, and it sits in my pocket all day. There's been a little bit of abrasion on one plastic part, with a small bit of outer plastic layer peeling off, but I don't think it'll be an issue. The parts of the cable that would be weak points on other cables seem very sturdy.
