What a great idea! This was an awesome introduction into growing your own mushrooms. They were very easy to grow. I will say I don't think I soaked it in water enough the first time around. I followed the instructions, but no luck. I tried again a week later letting absorb more water (longer than recommend) and boom! A few days later I had a bunch of tiny mushrooms! They grew very fast. Every day I was surprised at how much bigger they had become.It does say yields multiple crops. I haven't tried to grow another crop yet, so I'm anxious to see...but so far very pleased.
