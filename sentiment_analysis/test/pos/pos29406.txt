My year and a half old son loves these. They wiggle n jiggle without the use of the wand. He is destructive right now and like to throw and knock his toys around out of curiosity. These blocks are handling his rough play very well. They are a good size for his little hands. They are very cute and I find myself looking at them a lot too. They are fun easy to stack/throw/shake to see them wiggle around. The magnetic wand is a cute touch. I'd say money well spent.
