I just got this case for my husband for Christmas. It is beautiful-- I can't wait to give it to him. I'm a big fan of JimmyCases. I get a new one each time I upgrade my iPhone. I have not used a wallet in over 2 years because this case holds everything I need and protects my phone when it falls, which is often. The colors are great and the elastic band stays tight even after a year of use. I get a lot of compliments on the case, too. A couple of friends have ordered Jimmycases after seeing mine. All around great product: well made, unique look, great quality, and made in California!
