The Ollie is very fun and very fast, the controls are difficult though and need a lot to get used to especially in limited space. It is definitely more appropriate to play with in large open spaces with as little obstacles (chairs, tables and similar furniture) as possible. Unlike the sphero though, there are no games specially designed for the Ollie, so it's as much fun as your creativity allows. I'm certain you can find creative ways to play with Ollie if you google it.The Ollie is also fun with toddlers who like to chase it and be chased by it, and the flashing colours are a plus.I have currently only tried it indoors on smooth surfaces and carpets (so without the wheel covers and rubbers). It's excellent on smooth surface, it may go over thick carpets on full speed, but it's a little difficult for the Ollie to go from a stop over a thick carpet.
