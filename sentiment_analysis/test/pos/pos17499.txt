I love this little tracker. I do have a fitbit alta, but it is rather heavy on the wrist and I do prefer the light-weight feel of the Amazfit. My one concern is that the battery isn't reaching a 100% charge. It's only charging to 90% . Not a huge concern, but I'm curious as to why it isn't charging fully. For my needs, this little tracker is perfect! Couldn't be happier!
