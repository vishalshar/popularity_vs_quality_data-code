I bought this phone mainly as a music player to take on my bike. It works good,but the small screen is a little tricky. The Rocket music player app is the best of many I tried,to be able to see the whole song title and control the equalizer. It is Android 4.4. It has the ability to write to the sd card. It's good as a phone too. It is GSM which has a better signal I've found than CDMA. It is able to work with a Tracfone sim card. If you're wanting to text with this phone it isn't easy,even with a stylus. You'll need a bluetooth keyboard. If you want the smallest,lightest music player and voice phone this is for you.
