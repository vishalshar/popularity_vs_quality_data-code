Really wanted to love this but it is kinda hard when it will not be detected by my phone.I have gone through making sure I don't have any special settings on equalizer, rebooting, and ensureing that mono was off, but still the stick will not detect (or if it does it quickly disconnects).I have tried using it with a Nexus 5x (running 7.1.1), a Samsung Note 3 (running phronesis), and a Samsung S3 (stock lollipop) no luck on any of my devices.I got this to hopefully get quick temps and easily record them as my son has been getting sick lately and a quick accurate thermometer is a necessity, but this is exactly the opposite.Unless I can find a solution soon it will be sending back.  As of now my recommendation is don't waste your time...maybe it works better on Iphone.EDIT:  I really wanted it to work...found that it works great now on my Nexus 5X after downgrading to 7.0 (7.1.1 is part of android beta program), found a setting in my Note 3 that I didn't turn off and it now works on that.  I think I may not have actually tried the S3 so apologize for misinformation.  Will update to 5 if it is consistently working and able to get accurate temps.
