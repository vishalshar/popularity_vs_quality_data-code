I have been using this product now for over a month and I'm quite impressed. Due to my profession I'm in a corporate setting and always wearing a button up shirt. These neck stays are a must have. They are adjustable, fit nearly all shirts, and don't fall out. This is the perfect replacement for those flimsy and forgettable plastic neck stays that come with your shirts when purchased. Highly recommended!
