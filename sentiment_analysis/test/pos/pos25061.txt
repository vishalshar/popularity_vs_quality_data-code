Its a must have unless you want to go with the Permanent Scoopfree litter tray . I prefer the refills even though they are more expensive because they are less work . Just put the lid on and put it in a garbage bag and your done . I don't want to have to wash and clean a permanent tray every time I need to change the crystals .
