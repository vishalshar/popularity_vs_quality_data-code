My husband works out 5-6 days/week, and his gym bags become beyond worn...and filthy. I bought him this for one of his Christmas gifts, and he has been absolutely thrilled with it, on every level. There are so many pockets for clothing and all of his gear. He also likes the pockets for his shoes or for towels and washcloths. He said it is the best bag he has ever owned.
