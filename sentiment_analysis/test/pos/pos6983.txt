After reading the reviews I purchased the  Smart WristBand DZT1968Å½ Replacement TPU Band to go with this as I wasn't going to risk loosing it. I've had zero mishaps so far with either band. The band that comes with is much secure when worn as a previous reviewer suggested however there is an annoyance factor when trying to read the time sometimes. The TPU band remedies this issue and provides zero obstruction to the led interface of the disc. The product itself warrants no complaints. No short term charging needed. Waterproof. Makes it do I don't have to keep remembering to put it back on. I gave this 4 stars only because I have an android phone and we are still lacking some features that apple has had for quite some time; also the app doesn't automatically sync which is annoying (unless I'm missing something). I do however like the automatic sleep tracker and the fact that it automatically tracks my runs and other moments of 'intense' activity showing me my mileage and calories burned.
