We love this unit. The basil plants grew well in the pacific north west winter in the kitchen. No Mold. Great to use nearby a dark room (like a basement or powder room) as a bright nightlight. Or one should ensure it goes off for the evening if in an area seen by bedroom as it is a bright light. The light fades out for its 16 hours on, 8 hours off.The Basil is excellent! The smell and taste is nice and strong - me and my husband love it.  We have been using the basil for recipes and drinks over the holiday and all of our family want a unit now.The only con is the unit isn't a pure stark white, slight beige to it.
