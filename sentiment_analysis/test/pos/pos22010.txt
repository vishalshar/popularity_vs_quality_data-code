I live in a crowded apartment complex, with approx 20 different WiFi signals reaching my apartment. That much congestion means I don't reach the full speed potential that I am paying my ISP for, on either 2.4 or even 5ghz bandwidth.I enjoy streaming shows and movies, as well as gaming. Unfortunately I used to experience awful slowdown at times when more neighbors were home and crowding the WiFi around me. Then I got Portal.The change was dramatic. I never experience slowdown due to congestion. My PNG while gaming is at an all time low. Streaming is seamless. Even the cap of 2mbps I had while downloading steam games has jumped dramatically.The app is very user friendly and allows complete control of your network. Its easy to set up a guest network for visitors and monitor devices connected to the network.Additionally, the router itself looks pretty sleek.I would definitely recommend this router for anyone who wants a wireless connection that feels wired. Or if you just want to be years ahead of your neighbors and friends. Best innovation in router technology for years!
