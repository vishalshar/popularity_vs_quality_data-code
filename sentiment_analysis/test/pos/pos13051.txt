Surprisingly better then my BLU Phone . I actually ordered two phones one slightly more expensive BLU Phone . around $120. And this one . Turns out this one functions better then the BLU . price for this one is way cheaper then that phone . This is my second POSH phone and my third BLU Phone BLU always had problems with  freezing and restarting by itself but never once experienced this with anyone of my POSH phones .IPHONE / SAMSUNG over $600-$700 depending on what model u want . who in there rite mind would spend that much money on a phone .???Phones break get lost and sometimes just give problems including expensive phones. $60 for a phone thats it, if it falls in the Atlantic ocean while fishing I really won't give a rat's ass . It's $60 bucks .
