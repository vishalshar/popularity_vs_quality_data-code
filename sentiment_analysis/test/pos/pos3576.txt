Our family absolutely loves the BakerStone and the pizzas it makes.  I received this as a father's day gift and we have used it every week since, even multiple times in a week.  I see a lot of reviews here commenting on the heat up time being long, 25 - 30 minutes or more, but I have not had the same experience.  The trick is, assuming your grill is large enough, to close the lid as much as possible.  The BakerStone manual says to leave the grill lid open, but I'm not sure why you would want to just let all of the heat escape.  I have a 5 burner grill, but only use 4 burners (with heat plates) to get the BakerStone up to pizza cooking temperature in about 10 minutes.  Once the BakerStone is up to temperature, I even turn all of the burners to low.  Even though my grill is quite large, I still cannot close the lid completely, but about 3/4's of the way, which seems be enough to keep the heat in and the warm-up time much, much shorter.  Even though the grill lid is 3/4 closed, I still have access to put the pizza in, rotate, and remove without any problems or messes.  As others have mentioned, pizza cook time is very fast, 4 - 5 minutes fast.  At a recent pool party, I was able to cook enough for a group of 10 in a very short period of time with many stating it's the best pizza they've ever eaten.  We've turned pizza night into a fun event for our young children by allowing them to select toppings and prepare the pizzas for cooking with a little help from Mom and Dad.  The kids like to watch the pizzas cook and from these picky eaters, I have never received a complaint.PROS:- Easy to assemble and very sturdy- Heats to cooking temperature quickly (see comments about closing or partially closing grill lid)- Cooks pizza in 4-5 minutes- You have to stay on top of it, but pizza is cooked consistently throughout and crust is always perfectly crispyCONS:- Honestly can't really think of one, I love this product.
