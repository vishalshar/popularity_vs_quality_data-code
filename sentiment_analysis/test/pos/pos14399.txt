Together with my wife we've gone through quite a few suitcases in a last 3 years. They just don't last. So I have been searching for a more rugged one and normally those are more expensive, so it came down to additional features for us. And BlueSmart definitely made it to a leader board (my wife has abandoned her suitcase in a rush before, so GPS tracking was a must for us). Even though the reviews were mixed, we decided to give it a try as we love new technologies and were willing to help to improve the product if needed.First impression. Great packaging and a premium feel. Durable and stylish, it immediately made my wife excited about her next business trip. The connection was pretty easy and the app was helpful to walk us through the process. We loved the fact that it comes with the key set as well, as options are best: you lose the key for your suitcase, you got your phone to unlock and vise versa.Set-up process: download the app. Plug in your suitcase with a USB-charger. Turn ON your suitcase. There is a hidden switch inside the suitcase, towards the handle, that you need to flip to ON position. Overall, get in a right mind-set, read instructions carefully, and your suitcase will be up in running in under 5mins.Favorite features: phone charger from the suitcase and built-in digital scale.Be aware: the service of GPS comes with 10 free location tracking only, so use them wisely.Best usage case for us: short business trip and weekend vacation getaways
