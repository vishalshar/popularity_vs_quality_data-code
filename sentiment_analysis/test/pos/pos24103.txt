I have been a Mac addict for years, but I recently switched to an Android-based tablet, and I love it. The applications are plentiful, and cloud storage makes owning a full desktop seemingly unnecessary. Enter the Remix. Paired with a wireless keyboard (the GMYLE 2.4G Wireless Keyboard with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad for Computers sold on Amazon) and my TV, this thing is awesome. I can use the online versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel to do work, and use all the Google and Android tools for just wasting time.This is a great, inexpensive desktop, and it is much more usable than any Chrome-based laptop or desktop.Simplicity is best. I love this thing!
