The first time I tried Chaga, I was hooked. Now, it's part of a daily ritual during my nightly Epsom salt bath. The taste is earthy and unusual, but very soothing. I personally enjoy it with a bit of honey. Every since I've been drinking it, I've noticed more energy and vitality. My muscles also hurt much less after a workout. This could be psychosomatic, of course, but I have not plans to stop drinking Chaga anytime soon!
