I love the different colors and the way the light stays on for those 2 mins. Problem is the bottom suction cup that hold the light does not stick at all and I think because it is way to small to have any kind of suction, and I did get 2 of them and both of them have that problem. What I did do was put a little piece of double edge tape on suction cup and put the whole thing on the side of my shower. This is a great night light that goes on and off, also you can put in on a mirror or on any thing, doesn't have to be the dirty toilet. Second one's light also didn't work right and no problem getting a refund.
