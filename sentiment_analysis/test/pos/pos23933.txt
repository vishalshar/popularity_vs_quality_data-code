I changed to this food at the recommendation of my dog breeder. The dogs love the taste and it has the added benefit of less waste passing through the puppy. The other puppy had loose stools which have firmed up since he began eating this dog food I have 4 labs and have tried several brands of puppy chow , this is my best choice. I highly recommend this dog food.
