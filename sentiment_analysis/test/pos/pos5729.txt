These are the best water bottles on the market. Period. I have been using one of these bottles for the past 3 years and I ride approximately 4,000 miles a year. I was so impressed that I  just bought 3 more. You can unscrew the bottoms to clean them, they do not leak, they open and close with light pressure and are perfect ergonomically.
