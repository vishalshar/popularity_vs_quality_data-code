What a terrific idea!  We bought this book and the doll two weeks ago and have been reading it non-stop.  The story is cute and fun.  Our little guys are really getting into it - they nicknamed our switch witch "Ragnar" (!) and move her all over the house. The concept is genius - the perfect way to get rid of all the Halloween candy (and donate to the break room snack pool at work).
