This unit is compact, hose powered and really gets the job done.  We're using it to clean bikes after cyclocross racing and practice.  It's a muddy, sandy, fun activity and this gizmo make the worst part of it much Much MUCH easier.  Make sure to get two brushes, one for the greasy bits (chain, gears, and changers) and a separate one for the rest of the bike.Take it from me, in October, November and December, you want to take care of your dirty bike after racing, but you REALLY want to hit that hot shower fast.  This gets you there.Really great support from the owner too!
