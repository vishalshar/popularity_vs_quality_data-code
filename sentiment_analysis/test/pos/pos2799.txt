This is my first stylus so I can't really compare it to anything. That being said, I think Pencil is a very well build product, works flawlessly and allowed me to draw complex drawings with precision. I took off one star because I draw a lot so I can already see wear and tear on the drawing end of the stylus. Will have to replace it soon after having it for only 3 months. Overall, awesome, beautiful stylus.
