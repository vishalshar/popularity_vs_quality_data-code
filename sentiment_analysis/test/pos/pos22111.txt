I don't use activity trackers (as I really don't care how many steps I take or calories I burn), but this one is different. The swim tracking (although not perfect), does beat what I expected it to report. Also, the running mode shows how hard your feet are hitting the ground and reminds on technique (preventing injury from heavy foot strikes). Overall, it's a neat little gadget, and isn't obtrusively large like other bands.
