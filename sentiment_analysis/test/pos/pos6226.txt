I recently purchased a Back to the Roots kit and it was a very fun, simple project that our kids really enjoyed taking part in. They don't like mushrooms for eating (yet) but my husband and I enjoyed a pan saute of the oyster mushrooms with parsley and garlic just a few days later, and now we're growing a second crop on the opposite side of the box. Yum!
