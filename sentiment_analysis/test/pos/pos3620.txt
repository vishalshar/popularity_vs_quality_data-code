After seeing a video about the 3Doodler and what it could do, I knew I had to get it for my younger cousins 17th birthday. She is very creative.. loves drawing, crafts, creating things, etc.It comes with a sleek, metallic 3Doodler 3D printing pen, a power cable, various tools, two manual, and 2 packs of 3D printing plastics. It also comes with 50 strands of ABS plastic crafting strands. The pen is extremely user friendly and the instructions were extremely clear.In a short time, she was doodling away and enjoying herself. She worked with it for hours, while myself and others watched and took turns doodling as well. This gift was a total hit! She has been enjoying it so much and I am planning to give a few more as gifts around the holidays and maybe even treating myself to one!
