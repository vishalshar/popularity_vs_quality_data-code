We tried this for the first time on the Big Island in Hawaii. It was pretty effective! I'm loved by mosquitos and during a trip to the botanical gardens where the mosquitos were out in full force, we got bit on our feet where we'd neglected to spray. On another day, my wife had sprayed all of her exposed skin but was wearing leggings. The mosquitos avoided her skin but were on her unsprayed leggings! I'll be heading out to Indonesia soon so I'll see if the mozzies are any different out there.
