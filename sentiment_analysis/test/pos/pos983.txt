TruEnergy is as advertised. While TruEnergy does cater towards athletes looking for energy to allow optimal performance, don't write-off TruEnergy's ability to allow the cube monkey to perform at his or her optimal performance.  I am typically in an office setting relying on my morning and afternoon coffees to get me through the day.  I have been able to leave a couple of TruEnergy's in the office and forgo the afternoon trip to Starbucks and their forever inflating prices.  The only alternatives to coffee, that also don't result in a later crash, are TruEnergy's energy shot competitors.  I have found that TruEnergy far exceeds the taste metric of any of its competitors while providing an equal or greater benefit in energy.  I've also introduced the TruEnergy shot to my coworkers who have given TruEnergy a try and have raved about the immediate afternoon pick-me-up.  I think TruEnergy has really provided a solution for anyone who is looking for a quick energy kick that tastes great and is looking for a convenient, on-the-go solution for their needs.
