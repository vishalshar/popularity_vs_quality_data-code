I am Thrilled with my new Apera bag,I use for all my trips to the gym each week.lots of pockets with zips so I am able to to be organized with my spin shoes-padded bike seat etc.usually everything falls to the bottom of my bag.the fact that it is a sling tote makes it easy on the body to carry even if you pack a few extras thing .it would make a great holiday gift for a special person in your life.
