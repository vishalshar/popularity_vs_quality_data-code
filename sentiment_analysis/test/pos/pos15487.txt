Just received mine yesterday and immediately hooked it up. Super easy to setup, much easier than my old Linksys router. I love the fact that I don't need to put my email or Facebook account to pair Portal with. App is very simple, perhaps too simple but everything I need is there. (Not sure why some people were unhappy with the available settings, it's working perfectly fine for me)After setting up, I connected my Apple TV to Portal and I immediately noticed a big difference! Previously I wasn't able to get consistent HD video in my living room, now not only videos start right away, it got to HD mode immediately so obviously my kids and my wife are happy. Hooked up a few more devices after that with zero issue.GREAT WORK GUYS - LOVE MY PORTAL!
