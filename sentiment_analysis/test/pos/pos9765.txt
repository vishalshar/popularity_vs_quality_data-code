Pros:It's easy to hear my music on the slopes, and the sound quality is acceptable. No more discomfort from ear buds tucked under my helmet ear flaps! I like having the cord controls with volume dial and play/pause button that I can wear outside my jacket. This works with Spotify on my Android phone with Lollipop/Marshmallow. The ear pieces fit into my smith helmet with audio pouches, replacing some pre-cutout foam.Cons:I wish the dial and button were larger to make them easier to use with gloves on. The spring for the clip to hold the cord controls isn't very strong so it often falls off from where I have it clipped to my jacket.
