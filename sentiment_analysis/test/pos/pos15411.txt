Finished installation a few hours after receiving the screen and everything looks fantastic (I will note that I used my own tools, but these seemed nice and will probably do the trick)!!  The screen protector that comes installed is flawlessly applied and seems extremely nice; they understate it on the description - the protector is or is like one of the $20 glass protectors you can buy for your phone, rather than simple thin plastic.  The screen looks great (and fits the phone extremely well) and the touchscreen is responsive.  I will update this review if anything changes with the screen quality.If your phone was run over by several cars (as mine was), keep in mind you will probably need to buy a new home button separately (which will not be able to use TouchID) and at a new front camera assembly (though I kept my broken assembly in, that I will replace later, and my phone booted up fine).  My rear camera and light also do not work, but that is unrelated to this replacement (though I believe it is related to my phone being run over).Installation was not extremely difficult, though I will mention that I already have done a similar repair on an old iPhone - the hardest part for me was reattaching the screen to the logic board at the end (the cables are out of order and it seems like the video does not go over how to get them in order very well).  That said, the screen looks great and I'm really impressed with the quality thus far.
