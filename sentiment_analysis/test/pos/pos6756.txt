I love these! If you have a child who can't tie their shoes due to age or ability these will keep their shoes from falling off and helps them feel proud of themselves for putting their own shoes on. These are also great for the Elderly who may find it difficult lacing shoes or whom can get injured from tripping on a shoe lace. Such a great buy and can be used more than a season. Every time my daughters feet grow we switch them to the new shoes. They still look brand new. I highly recommend them!
