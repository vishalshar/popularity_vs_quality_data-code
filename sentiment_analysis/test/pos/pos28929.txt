This is the second RockForm case I bought. The first was for my iPhone 5s and it worked very well using the handlebar stem mount.  I had one accident that resulted in three cracked ribs and the phone went flying off of the mount, but no damage was done to it.The newer case for the iPhone 6 seems to have the same protective elements.  I have dropped the phone a few times without any damage.  The corners are especially fortified and cushioned.  I like that the case doesn't add that much size to the phone length and width.  It does double the thickness of the phone.The case comes with an additional, optional mounting system that wasn't included with the first mount I bought. It is a magnetic disk that can be attached using a double-sided tape to a surface, like a dashboard that will allow the case to "stick to it" using another, strong magnet that fits into a specific area set aside for it in the case.  If the magnet in the case is used, the case will also adhere magnetically to any iron surface, like a car body, refrigerator, etc.  This can be useful on occasion.  However, once the magnet is in the case, you need to be careful not to carry it in the same pocket as credit cards, room keys or any other id device that has a magnetic strip, as the information on the strip will be erased by the magnet.As a result, I removed the magnet from the case after I had demagnetized two hotel room keys,In my car I use a Kensington phone mount that has two spring-loaded sides that hold the phone easily.In summation, the case is strong, shields the phone from scratches and impacts, works as described, and is built of quality materials that will not deteriorate over time.  It is worth the price.
