Grip Boost Glove grip does a great job at reviving the Tackiness to grip gloves. I use Cutter gloves which have a good tack already but GB glove grip gives about 2x the grip. Only downside is that I have white gloves and GB leaves a little residue color (brown/red). But it all comes out in the wash. Good stuff.
