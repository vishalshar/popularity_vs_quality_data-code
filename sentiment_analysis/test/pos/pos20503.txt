Great product.  This is my second bike mount, as my first bike (and the mount) were stolen.  I use the twisty ties for a more secure fit.I had a small problem when I received the product: I locked the phone in, but the spring was loose so the phone vibrated as I was riding.  Drove me nuts on my first first ride.  Easy fix is to grab a hex key and tighten the bolt in the middle of the mount - this fixed the problem.
