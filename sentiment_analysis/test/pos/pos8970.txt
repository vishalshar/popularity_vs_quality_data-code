We decided to go with the Korner security option because we are renting and don't want to pay for a large scale security system in a home we don't own. After using Korner for 6 months, we will probably never purchase a large scale security system. Korner has provided exactly what we need for a price that is more than fair. The app is amazing and tells me any time a door or window is open- even if they system isn't armed. I love that I can see if and when my dog has been let out.This was one of our best home purchases and got a quick ROI when someone checked to see if our door was unlocked at 3am one morning. The alarm went off (it even knows if it has been shaken more than normal) and the perpetrator ran off. The alarm sounded before my dog even had a chance to get upset.Even with all of these benefits, I didn't do a review. Not until I needed assistance to re-setup my system did I really understand what a great company Korner is. I sent a quick email showing them the issue I was having and it was responded to within 5 minutes- by a real person. Turns out, there was a typo in my email address (my fault) and they updated it for me. I am all about supporting companies that use real people to deliver great customer service.So long story short- if you need a security system then this is the best option I have found for my lifestyle.
