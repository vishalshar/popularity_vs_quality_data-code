This suitcase is the perfect bag for a weekend getaway or short business trip. I used the bag for the first time on a 3-day weekend trip from SF to NY.  I used it all over New York City - plane, trains, subway, cars, walking around, etc. Worked great on all types of terrain. I have traveled a lot and it is the best bag I've used.  The best part of the bag is the general ease of use.  Fits a lot (more than it might appear), wheels are extremely smooth, and you can tell it is very high quality.  Highly recommend this bag.Pros:+) Wheels that spin 360 degrees are a highly underappreciated feature; this will be a must-have feature on any future suitcase I purchase+) Charging ability was very convenient and came in handy; nice to be able to charge bag while sitting on train or waiting  for flight (better than digging for external charger)+) Multiple handle heights were extremely convenient+) Good storage ability and layout; compartments helped to separate shoes from clothing+) Having large front pocket is great, very accessible+) Lightweight; for those times that I did want to pick up the bag (either due to a hill or avoid dirt), its lightweight design came in handyCons:-) Didn't really make use of the scale for anything; didn't really need to-) Some times app wasn't 100% synced with suitcase (that is, I had 1 or 2 instances where I would get a text that the bag was no longer nearby when in fact it was)Also just a cool looking bag. I had multiple people come and ask me about the bag. Very sleek!
