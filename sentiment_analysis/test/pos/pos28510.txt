Love this phone. So any easy functions and perfect for this techno dinosaur. Wish I had ventured here earlier. Now I can text my kids and grands and send photos. Even open my voice-mails in god time. The senior has graduated. I shuddered at the instruction book's 169 pages but they are so easy to follow now after I overcomin gmy reluctance.  A fine reference for my sometimes foggy memory. Perfect phone for seniors.
