PolarPro 3DR Prop Guard Set (qty 4)-Snap On DesignÂ These are pretty cool, built to tight tolerances, maybe too tight..I give a 4 star rating instead of a 5 because the fit is a little bit too precise, with very little spacing between the bottom of the propeller blades and the top sides of these guards. A little upward smack on the guards could force them up into the propellers.I would like to see a version of these that were not manufactured to be so close to the propellers that they are supposed to protect from impact. My view on the fit may change after I impact my first object though,,,
