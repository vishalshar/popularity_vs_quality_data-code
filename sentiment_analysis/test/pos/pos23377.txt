These are amazing!  No more baby wipes for me.  I used these during my Ragnar relay race. Oh, my. I truly felt refreshed and clean. No residue and no smell...none on the wipe...and no stinky smell left on me! LOL  I couldn't believe these wipes would be that different, but they were.  I will not run out!
