I really like the consistency of this toothpaste. Most non-floride toothpastes are a gel that's basically sweet flavored candy. My toddler won't stop trying to eat the gel-like toothpaste. So, I needed something safe but still works. I am very happy with this brand. It's white and seems similar to regular toothpaste. My toddler loves the taste and is proud of his paste that looks like the one the adults use. I'llbe purchasing this brand from now on!
