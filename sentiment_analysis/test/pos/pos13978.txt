Good idea and may be OK product if it works.At First: But mine does not even find my iPhone6 via Blutooth most of the time.(My phone does not have any Bluetooth problems with any other product. Only thing that works is winding and unwinding the strings. Unusable need to complain the manufacturer.The Product support contacted me and helped to solve the problem. I really appreciate the support. I turned my 1 star to 4 based on their work. The problem was with the mic sensibility. Surprised that it had to be set so exactly to make the device work at all. Now when that is done seems to be OK. Need to use it more to be convinced about the accuracy. Has to take 1 star out because of the lousy manual which did not really point out the importance of setting the mic sensibility so exactly.
