Perfect for a single cup.  Water is boiled separately so coffee is steaminghot.  Great alternative to my Keurig.  Only minor issue is that plunger mustbe pushed down very slowly to get all the water needed for a full cup.Too fast & water is left in reservoir resulting in less than a full cup.So easy to clean.
