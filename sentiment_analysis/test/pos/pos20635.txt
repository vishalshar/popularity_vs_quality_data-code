Got in touch with the Atlas folks after my sync issue, they fixed me up with a beta version of the App, now it sync's like a charm. (thank you Atlas for getting back to me so quickly) So, brought it out for a for a spin and like what I see, most exercises are tracked correctly, around 80% (love the extra info on power and speed) Look forward to new updates and perhaps in the future the applicability to sync my info to my other Apps like Mapmyfitness. So far so good, I will update you guys in a week . update,  I've taken it on a freestyle workout test drive, and at first it missed about 40% of the sets, but, after 30 minutes of barbell work it started picking them up like a charm. The device does learn your movements, but it takes time. Great detail on stats and I look forward to seeing swimming added in the future.
