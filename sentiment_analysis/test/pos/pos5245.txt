i'm hardly a technical person, and I've been holding off from buying this because of how complex it looked. i finally pulled the trigger, and i'm not sorry at all.setting up my tv and comcast remotes was simple enough, but then when i couldn't setup my receiver within 10 minutes, i emailed support. they were helpful and assured me that i'll get what i needed, and within a day they had added a new remote for my receiver that has the same buttons as my original remote, and a few extra ones (hidden features normally available only on higher-end models).since they were responsive, i took advantage and got them to help me create a custom remote that combines all the others, and the on-screen gestures control so i can zap through netflix easier. all in all, i'm happy with my purchase.
