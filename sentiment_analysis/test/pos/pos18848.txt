I have been searching for a savory snack bar and am VERY glad I found these.  The reviews were great but I kept my expectations low. The Sriracha flavor is spicy, but not overwhelmingly so. No weird aftertaste. It was surprisingly filling too, one bar a glass water took care of no breakfast hunger at lunchtime. If you are doing WW, I calculate it to be 5 points. Throw away your chips and pretzels - this would go well with a cold beer.
