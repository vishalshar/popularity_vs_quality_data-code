Like the product a lot.  Unfortunatly I can't give five stars because there are no good options to coordinate my rain sensor readings with the weather forecast.  I live on the coast and the local weather stations are inland.  The inland weather forecast is seldom accurate for my location on the coast of Florida.  Looking forward to future enhancements to the weather intelligence of the product.
