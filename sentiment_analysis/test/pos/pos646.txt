It fits my old iPad 3 perfectly, and was no problem to install onto the wall.  In short, it does exactly what I wanted it to do. However, I do have one question: what is the Allen wrench for?  None of the pictorials or other instructions show it or even mention it, but it was included in the package; I can see nothing in the assembly that looks like it would require an Allen wrench.  Perhaps a smarter person than I can explain...
