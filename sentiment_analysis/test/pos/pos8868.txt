I got this for my teenage nephew who loves to draw.  He and his brother had fun with it and ultimately were largely successful, but this does have a bit of a learning curve.  They didn't have any problems with clogging or jams, but it was incredibly hard for them to do anything three dimensional because any time they tried to go up into the air with the pen the plastic always crumbled and broke.  It helped to read others' comments that you need to hold the pen in place to let the plastic harden for a few seconds before moving your hand away, but they still were never able to do anything too intricate or freestanding.  They got the best success either drawing on paper and peeling away to make flat creations, or by tracing over pre-existing three dimensional objects.  Still, they enjoyed it and had fun making things.  He was able to create his own set of Pokeman based ornaments, so that thrilled him.All in all, this was a good find as long as you're realistic about your goals and abilities while just starting out with a 3D doodler.  The biggest drawback is how expensive the plastic strands are and how challenging they can be too replace.  My nephews ran out of certain colors very quickly, and with the replacements selling for about $0.40 a strand (and you have to order them all online) I just don't know that I foresee them continuing to use this long term for that reason.
