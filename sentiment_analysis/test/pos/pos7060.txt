We bought this replacement collar to work with our wireless fence unit we bought two years agoÂ PetSafe Wireless Pet Containment System. The original collar had broken a couple months ago and we didn't get around to buying a new collar for a while because our dog was staying at home due to being trained with the collar. Eventually he got wise to the fact he could go exploring, so we had to buy a replacement.This collar design is much better than the older original design. The original design had the shock points go through the collar and eventually they tore the collar and the shocker fell off somewhere on our property. This new design seems to have be designed specifically to fix that problem as it is now looped behind the shock unit. I think this collar will hold up much longer than the original. You have to replace the batteries every couple of months, but you can buy 12+ packs on Amazon and they are a pretty good price.One tip, make sure you have the collar on tight enough for your dog to feel the shock. I have to put the collar on pretty snug for my dog because he has thick hair. If it is not tight enough it will not be effective.
