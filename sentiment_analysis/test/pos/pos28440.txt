My first sous vide choice was The Original Rothfield and Stone Sous Vide (now discontinued, big surprise!).  Hated that one!  Sent it back and got the Anova.  LOVE this device!  Use it several times a week. Nice and compact when not in use.  I have a large, over-sized stainless steel spaghetti pot which I use with the Anova. It clamps on the side of the pot just right. Perfect size for me and my wife.  We do rib eye steaks, pork chops, chicken breasts.  Everything comes out perfect - juicy, tender, tasty.  We vacuum seal the meat when we bring it home from Costco with a little butter and seasoning inside the bag and then freeze them.  When we want a delicious, easy meal, I get the frozen meat out of the freezer in the morning.  Drop them in their jacuzzi bath at lunchtime and hold them in place on the side of the pot with a couple of clothespins.  What I love about sous vide, is the meat is ready in a few hours, but can be held in the pot for hours on end till we're ready for it.  Once it reaches the desired temperature of "doneness" it won't overcook.  When we're ready to eat, I take the meat out of the bags and give them a nice sear on the gas grill. Never fails to produce consistent delicious meals. Honestly, I've made some of the best rib eye steaks with this thing that I've ever eaten.  My biggest mistake when I first began with sous vide was cooking at too high a temperature.  I've found that for beef, I set the Anova at 126 degrees with a couple of minutes of sear on each side on the grill.  Gives us warm pink inside.  For chicken and pork, I do about 138.  The fact that the meat is held at this temperature for an extended time basically pasteurizes it.  You can enjoy rarer beef now without worrying about safety.As long as your bag doesn't leak, there's no cleaning to do.  Since we have super hard water where we live, I put a tablespoon or two of white vinegar in the water pot to hopefully prevent calcium deposits.  So far so good.The only thing about this Anova model I don't care about is the bluetooth option.  I played around with it when I first got the Anova, but it serves no purpose.  Since you don't have to worry about overcooking with sous vide, there's no need to monitor it or turn it off.  It'll hold in the water bath till we're ready to eat.  I don't find the need to monitor it from the other room and I won't be putting meat in room temperature water to sit and start later.  No big deal, I just don't find the need for that feature.
