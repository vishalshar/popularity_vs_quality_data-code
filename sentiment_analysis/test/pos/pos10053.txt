My dog is 11 and really finicky, Bixbi is the only superfood supplement that is tasteless. Unlike regular chews and treats, adding this to the meal provides concentrated active ingredients. My dog has been taking it for almost a year, and she has not shown any sign of slowing down. That Skin & Coat one is also great in the springtime when she tends to get allergies, because she did not develop her usual rashes. Plus it's made in USA!!
