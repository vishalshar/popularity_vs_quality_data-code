I've been wearing this every day for about five days now. Even if I turn off Bluetooth on my phone it remembers all the readings for that day, as shown once I sync the two later in the evening. It reads the current luminosity every minute,  as can be seen in the companion app if you use two fingers to spread out the time chart on the history tab.This product could be reviewed alone, since it does tell you without the use of an app what percentage of sunlight you've gotten that day.  But in my opinion it needs to be reviewed in conjunction with it's app.  The app is well written and easy to understand. It doesn't crash and I haven't had any problems with it.  I have a couple of minor areas in which the device and the app could be improved. For one, the battery in the device doesn't hold a charge for long enough.  This only shows itself, however, if you try and display the current light level in the morning before the device has been exposed to sunlight, enabling it to recharge.  Also, sometimes I forget to put the device on my lapel, resulting in inaccurate readings. Either I left the device in the shade while I was in the sun, or left the device in the sun while I was in the shade. In either case there's no way to set the percentage  in the app to 0% for that day.  You can do so for the device by disconnecting it from the app and re-connecting it, which will enable you to see your percentage for that day accurately on the device only. The device is a little larger than I would like, and unless I connect it to my lapel or V-neck vertically, it sometimes turns my collar over, resulting in the device not being fully exposed to sunlight.  I also ask myself just how dorky I look while wearing it.  And there are conditions where the device will be in sunlight but my face won't be, such as when I'm driving in the evening towards the west.  Since the science behind the device states that it's the amount of sunlight that arrives in your eyes, that would result in an in accurate representation of how much sunlight you received.  I would also prefer that the gamification in the app include motivations to gather sunlight in those first two hours of the morning after your ideal wake up time. These are the hours that are displayed in the dark green in the timeline in the app. Lastly, once I've gathered a week or so's worth of data, I wonder if it's really worth the effort to keep wearing the device, since I then have a good idea about how much sunlight I get in my normal routine.  But spending $100 to get that idea is worth it to me.  Also, I'm considering buying the company's  sunlight lamp, which would then considerably extend the usefulness of this device for me.But these are all relatively minor issues and mostly just improvement suggestions, and not enough to be considered as being compromising of the device's or the app's quality.
