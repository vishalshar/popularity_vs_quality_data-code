"Santa" got this for my 7 year old son for Christmas 2015. He has an iPad to control it. So far, he's so enamored with it that he brings it everywhere. He's played games with it at the table in a restaurant (a family game), around the house and outside. We considered getting him the BB-8 robot instead but we're thrilled we got him this because he's having such fun with it!
