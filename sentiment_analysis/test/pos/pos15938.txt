I love it 100% !! Stunning and has that "old fashioned look and feel" to it. I have yet to play it with the vinyl record or cassette tape. I've only used the CD part, Radio, Bluetooth, and the remote with it.. etc. I however am not pleased with the fact how they are advertising this item. It says 7-in-one but really you get an 8-in-one.. And NO, my order was NOT wrong and I knew what I was purchasing. I however didn't mind the fact that it has one more feature than the 7-in-one..Which really isn't a big deal.I am pleased with this purchase thus so far especially buying from amazon.com since awhile back I've had nothing but unfortunite luck when purshasing on this site even though I clicked I wanted a NEW a item and not something used or broken. I have steered clear from this site for a long time and was VERY skeptical on purchasing this Victrola online. I however decided to purchase it and other items as well. I am pleased that no items that I've purchased on amazon have NOT been used or broken by any means. I've been having much better luck from amazon.com. If you're looking for an older version of this that has the same features as these Victrolas then I suggest the Phonograph that you can buy here on amazon.com. It is very similar to this Modern Victrola but the only difference is that it's a phonograph. :)
