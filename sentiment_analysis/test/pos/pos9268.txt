Great activity monitor that doesn't look like a plastic bracelet.  I never liked having a watch on with another activity monitor next to it, and most other connected watches do too much and have short batteries . The fact that it doesn't recharge is a positive - don't need to worry about charging it every few days - just a very infrequent battery replaement.  My only want is a better alarm feature, I want to set multiple alarms during the day (maybe you can, but I have not figured it out yet).  Previously I have used both Nike+ (original and SE) bands, and a Fitbit, while those worked just as well for step counting (nothing is 100% accurate, if I get 10,100 steps or 9,800 steps a day it not a big deal, I want to know whether I generally got enough steps) the convinance of the Withings blow those out of the water.  Finally, I like round watches, most competitors are square.
