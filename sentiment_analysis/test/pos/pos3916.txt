Great stuff! I just switched my dog to this about a week ago, and he's not longer flatulent, nor do his droppings reek quite so much. He's also stopped trying to eat turds, so yeah, this stuff is great!  Judging by how much he eats now, he agrees. Also, the small kibble size is perfect for smaller breeds.
