Just received the product today. Though I ordered a black color, I received a white one from amazon. This is my first order on amazon and I was little disappointed for not receiving the product with color I chose.Anyways keeping the color aside, I started to use the product today just to see how it works. The product is as perfect as it was explained. A real theater experience is guaranteed. Easy to use touch controls. Awesome viewing experience. Sound was considerably great but not like a premium headsets with bass.Did not yet try the 3D feature as I did not connect a source yet except have watched the internal 2D videos. Not sure if it has capability of 2D to 3D conversion.I had prescription glasses but got no need of them when using the royole moon as it has inbuilt correcting lenses for eye vision.
