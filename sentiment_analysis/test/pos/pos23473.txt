I love this case but it is a bit on the small side. I had to take a second carry on bag. Also there is no way in the app to rename the carrier if you wanted. The battery charging port is not as snug as I would have like the battery died on my way home during flight cause I didn't charge it properly do to the charging wire falling out a few times. Over all I did love the case wheels super smooth through the airport. Charged my phone from 40% to 100% in no time at all. Loved the your leaving me notifications it sends when leaving behind. Very easy to get my MacBook out to get scanned. This bag is for the 2 day traveler not so much a 3 or more days
