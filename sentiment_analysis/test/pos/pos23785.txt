The software I downloaded for my droid phone and the Anymote IR blaster work flawlessly on my phone.  Im able to control my TV, DVR and create macros that string commands together. But just like all macros for universal remotes, you have to play with the timing and sequence of commands to get them to work properly.  I would say the functionality of the preprogrammed remotes is as good or better and any of the universal remotes Ive owned previously.Im able to control the DVR using my Amazon Echo by using the commands, Power on, Power off, Volume up, Volume Down, Channel up and Channel down for all the appropriate devices.  For the DVR, Im also able to use Alexa to issue the commands, List, Guide, Arrow up, Arrow down, OK, Rewind, Stop, Exit, Play, Mute, Info, Pause, Play.Issue commands using the format, Alexa, tell Anymote to Guide my DVR.  Guide is the command, DVR is what you called the remote.Make sure you enable the Anymote skill for Alexa.Once I get my hex codes working from my pronto and the macros working with Alexa, Ill post an updateGreat potential here.  Looking forward to the updates.
