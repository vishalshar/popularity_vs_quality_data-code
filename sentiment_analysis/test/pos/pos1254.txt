Pros:1) A great "wear-it and forget-it" product.2) Waterproof means you're not constantly taking it on and off... exercise, sweat, shower; leave it on all the time and forget about it!3) No charging with its 4-6 month battery; very convenient.4) Vibration reminder to get up and move around; great for when I'm sitting at my desk for too long.5) Good looking and small.6) Band adjusts nicely and is comfortable and stays on securely.7) App tells you how much more exercise you need to reach your point goal (e.g., 20 minutes more of walking).Cons:1) Without a display, it's a little inconvenient to have to get your phone, turn it on, start the app, let it sync, then get your data. Consequently, I find myself checking less often, which also means it doesn't motivate me the way my old Fitbit used to.2) Can't remember what any of the LED colors and blinking means.3) Edges of the cylinder portion of the product are sharp and will scratch wood and other soft surfaces!4) App is not as well designed as Fitbit's (touch and swipe interactions are not always reliable).5) Syncing with the app takes too long and it doesn't always work, requiring multiple attempts.
