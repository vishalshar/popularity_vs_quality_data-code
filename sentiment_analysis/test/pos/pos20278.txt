My Brother- in-law is a professional guitarist in an amazing wedding band. He hasn't used it on stage yet, but last time we visited, he wouldn't put it down. He said it puts a new twist on some old covers and he even wrote a new song with it. I look like a rockstar for scooping this up as a present, even though he is the real rockstar!
