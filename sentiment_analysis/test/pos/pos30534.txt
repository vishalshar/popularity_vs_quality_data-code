I would give 5 stars, but the plug on my new us is turned the wrong way to use camera and the camera can not be turned around and no usb cable was included. FYI you need to get a microvusb extension cable that is OTG rated other cables do not work.Having used the camera a bit now I think it's great, but it is really low resolution. It can not see thermal through glass or optics.Staped to iron sights, you can pick off coons and cats in total darkness..
