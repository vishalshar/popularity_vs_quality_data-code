Had this product for almost a month now and am very impressed by how flexible it is. I have attached it to multiple batteries to charge my iPad and IPhone and I love the convenience of it always being there when I need it. I attach it to my keys and just take it wherever I go. It was def smaller than I thought it was going to be (like literally the size an actual key hence its name) but it performs so well it doesn't affect my rating. Pretty sure I'll be eventually getting a micro USB one to match it and other products from Nomad cause their products are so well made. And the 2 year warranty if anything happens to it is such a comfort. Hopefully I never have to use it. Thank you Nomad for such a great product.EDIT: Had a slight issue with the product where the plastic around the connector did break from heavy force while it was attached to my key ring (i was at a concert and got slammed into). When i went to use it again the lightning connector part came out in one piece cause the plastic holding it was cracked. BUT i am not changing my rating because I emailed Chloe at Nomad about it and she sent me a NEW one with free shipping in a matter of days! Absolute great company! I'll be placing it in my pocket when i know i am in area where something like this can happen next time. Still love my Nomad Key!
