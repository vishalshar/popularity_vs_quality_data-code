Been using for a over a month now.  It is very handy as something to keep my phone charged when I am working on my laptop and don't want to get out a longer cable.  I use my phone constantly throughout the day and I am reassured that I have this available on my keychain to charge it.  Double points for the fact that it has gone through the wash once and been left in the rain once and still work fine after drying out.  Very handy gizmo.
