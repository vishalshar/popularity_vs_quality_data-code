It's exactly what I've been looking for ever since I got my Macbook 12". The passthrough charging isn't just a trickle charge but it's fast, not as rapid as direct charging but there's plenty of juice going through it. USB3.0 ports are prompt and effective, and the added SD card slot offers extra data storage. The object is slim and stylish, fits perfectly with the body of the Macbook and looks great. This is a fantastic buy!
