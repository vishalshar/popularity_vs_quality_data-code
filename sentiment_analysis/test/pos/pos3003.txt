I've had sleep problems all of my life and Dream Water definitely helps. If you're not sure if it will help I suggest you buy a few bottles at a local drug store chain...not sure if I can mention the name but the store has the color green in is name. It's more there but if it helps you then order through Amazon B/C it costs less when bought in 12 case quantities.
