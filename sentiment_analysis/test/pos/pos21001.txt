Great product! As a military member leaving my family dude to deployments, this product leaves me with ease of mind. I refuse to pay the hundreds of dollars of competing companies charge for more than I truest need. This provides the basic scare tactic needed to prevent intruders from taking more than a step into your home. The setup was easy though the range of each tag is less than I would like. They stick easily to your door or window. It would be beneficial if they offered an additional adhesive pad invade of need to change area of placement. Overall it has been a great product and creates a safe and secure environment!
