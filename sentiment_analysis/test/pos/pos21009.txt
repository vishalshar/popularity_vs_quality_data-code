Love the Cooler itself, working well thus far; however, I used a promotion code for a free second battery but have yet to receive the battery. I seem to be unable to contact Coolest Customer Support since there website sends you to a virtual dead-end when you select your reasoning for contacting them you aren't actually given a way to proceed with a chat session, email information, etc.. Haven't been able to get around it on their website regardless of my unput for contacting them....While I enjoy the cooler and think it's neat, not getting the second battery has made this purchase a bit of a bummer to say the least.
