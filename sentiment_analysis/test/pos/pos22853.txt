Worlds better than plastic wrap, and still much better than the parchment paper/foil combo I was using. And while foodsaver bags are good for freezing or cheap hard cheese, they don't let the cheese breathe and kind of result in creepy softer cheeses.I've used these papers for roquefort, aged cheddar, romano, brie, all with good results. Use the stickers to label the cheese but not to seal the paper. Instead, wrap the cheese and secure it with a rubber band. This will let you open and close your package easily  and to keep the paper tidy. This paper holds up very well through multiple openings and re-wrappings, something I would definitely not say for any of my previous wrapping attempts, from cling wrap to foil, to waxed paper, to food saver bags.These sheets are large enough for most hunks of cheese, even the big Costco chunks.
