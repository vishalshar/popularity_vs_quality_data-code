The spray hose pickup is long enough to fit into a half gallon jar, but is easily trimmed for any size.  I cut mine down to use in a pint jar because of weight.  It works great for the room and linen spray I made.  The sprayer creates a fine mist.  There is no stream option.The value for the money is a little steep.  If they were a bit more affordable, I would probably convert all my spray bottle needs to these.
