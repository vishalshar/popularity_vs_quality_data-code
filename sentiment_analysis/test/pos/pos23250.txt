What an amazing device. I completely wiped out a colony of chipmunks who were tearing up my lawn.Probably close to 15 kills. Additionally, my daughter who is volunteering at a mission in El Salvador was besieged with an infestation of rats. I purchased a device for her and within the first 3 days she had nailed 3 rats. This is a sturdy device and well made. You do need to clean the device in order to keep it in working order so follow the directions included with the package.
