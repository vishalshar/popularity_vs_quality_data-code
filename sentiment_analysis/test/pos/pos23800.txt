This series of flashcards, and this particular set specifically, have been essential tools for a number of years.  We have purchased 20 or so sets over the past few years and they have been essentia.  The pictures are edgeless which is a plus.  The images are clear, bright, and typically have little or no distracting background, which is really essential with kiddo's with autism in our experience.  There are 4 main sets in this series with this set "Nouns" being the one most frequently used with our treatment programs.  It can be augmented with additional nouns using the "Language Builder Nouns Set 2" in the same series.  Good procedures are essential but so are good stimulus (teaching) materials and these cards are an excellent tool to help children learn to use language!  We highly recommend this series of cards.
