The lock is really nice, it looked bulky at first but doesn't stick out any further than the actual door handle does. The lock is easy to install and set up, the only problem I am having is have multiple phones using Siri. I have done everything that is required but still can only have one phone that operates properly with Siri. I have not had any issues using the app on multiple different phones to unlock and lock the door. Just be aware of you turn the auto lock on that you always have your phone with you or you might end up locking yourself out!
