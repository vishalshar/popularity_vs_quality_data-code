If you have a dog who "sneaks" out occasionally and likes to roam, this device is absolutely the greatest thing ever!!  We have been using this device for over 2 years and we always know where our dog is whenever someone accidentally leaves the door open and he runs out.  It keeps great track of him and even sends us notifications every 3 minutes so we can keep up with him.  And they have the best customer service.  The reps are polite and know everything about the product.  We had a Tagg before the Whistle and loved it just as much.  I don't see what anybody could have to complain about this device.  If you don't want to use the activity tracker, don't use it!!  They don't force you to use the other things, they just offer them.
