This is my first gaming chair, though I have sat in a Maxnomic, and read up on many others, including DxRacer and Clutch Chairz brands.I have had this chair for approximately 3 weeks, and will update my review a few months down the line.ProsIt's sturdy and well madeThe stitching is even and symmetricalThe memory foam in the seat is dense and free floating (no wood beneath to bottom out on)The design is sporty, but not loud, unlike many other racing chairs out there. I especially like the diamond stitching.The structure of the chair is very supportive and ergonomically correct to help posture. I've noticed this.ConsThe assembly is a bit more difficult than your typical desk chairThe right side panel wouldn't snap on properly, and noticed the central nodule was broken. Had a replacement chair shipped just for this part, and same thing occured. Not a deal breaker, but very annoying.(picture provided)As many others mentioned, get this on sale. I'm not sure it's worth $400 after taxes. I got mine for $260 plus taxes for referenceNot sure which this falls under, but the neck pillow is especially dense, so it seems a little too firm for now, tho not especially so that it hurts, but there could be potential for breaking in over time.Also, I would like to note this chair is definitely not for larger people. I'm a 5'4 female for reference, and my bf who owns this account is 5'9 and where his shoulders rest is a little cramped.
