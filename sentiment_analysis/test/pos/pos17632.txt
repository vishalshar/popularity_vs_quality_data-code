These filters are great.  Extremely well made and the optics are clear and well coated.  The coating is even and the photo quality is perfect.  the thread on nicely and smoothly.  I have used other filters that make my skin crawl screwing them on where the drag on the threads but the go on easily and just a nice  smooth as the original DJI UV filter.  The CP is great over water and the ND filters are perfect for partly sunny days.  Will be buying the higher ND values for brighter days.  If you want clear photos, great build quality, and filters that will last, go with PolarPro.  I did and will not be looking at any other from now on.  A great balance between cost and quality.
