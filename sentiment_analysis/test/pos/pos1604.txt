The Vololight has easy to understand instructions, was easy to install & wire up. The calibration was also easy. Changing sensativity is simple. According to helpers it is working properly. I should note that Missouri Personalized License Plates are 1/8" over the standard 4" Ã— 7" motorcycle plate & I needed to trim 1/8" off of both sides & the bottom of the plate. Which was easily done.
