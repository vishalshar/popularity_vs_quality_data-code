I gave this product 5 stars because it does exactly what it says it will do - it links up to your iPad and makes noises when you wave your arms. Kinda cool - but some might think therein lies the problem - that is, you have to be pretty active and fairly close to the device. Might be more usable if it was also a watch - as is, it has limited usefulness as it's only good during heavy activity.
