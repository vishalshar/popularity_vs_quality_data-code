AWESOME!!  I bought this game last summer before school began in anticipation of helping out in elementary school math this year.  First, my boys, who don't have math difficulties, loved this game.  They found it fun and loved figuring out which operations would get them furthest along the board.  I had hopes because of the clear instructions that I thought would not be difficult for my tutor kids to understand and had some hope they might find it fun as well.Well, it has surpassed my expectations!!  I had three kids that I help stay back from recess by choice!!  Now these kids _do_ have difficulties with the basic math.  One commented that it's fun.  Another described the board as a 'cheat sheet' as she laughed and used it to help her multiply.So it is a cheat sheet, but in a good way.  The numbers are also surrounded by circles that are broken into the prime factorization of the number they surround.  For example, eight has three orange segments forming a circle around it.  These orange segments represent the number 2.  2 x 2 x 2 = 8.  There is a number key on the board showing the color key.I don't use this game every time, but when I use it, it's a treat and they love it.  Kids who don't like math, and find excuses not to do it, are learning math and having fun doing so.  What more can I ask of it?
