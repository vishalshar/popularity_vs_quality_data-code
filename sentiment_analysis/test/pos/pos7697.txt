This has really been a fantastic product, but my daughter just turned 1 and learned zippers!  I'm watching her (via babycam) dismantle her crib. While I'm quite impressed she was able to take this zipper sheet almost completely off (those corners can be tricky!), I'm a little unsure where to proceed from here. do I go buy regular sheets now?  risk her dismantling her sheets every nap?outside of this, they've been super helpful for middle-of-night crib changes so I really can't complain! still worth getting IMO.(also if you're wondering where I got the pink zipper sheet, I had my super talented mother-in-law change out the fabric with some custom stuff that matched the rest of my crib. she spoiled me ;)
