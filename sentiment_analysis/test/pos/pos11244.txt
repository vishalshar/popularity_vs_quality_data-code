I had been waiting and looking and waiting and looking for a GPS tracker for my kids (furry kids) for years. Whistle was just one of the companies in the running for me (I was watching two others).  I almost didnt buy it thanks to all the one star reviews on here until I realized they were all from prior TAGG customers.  Acquisition and changing platforms is never smooth (based on my 15 years of marketing experience) so I decided that since I was not a prior customer, and I liked all the features (basically combining a Fitbit with a GPS tracker), those reviews didnt really apply to me and I would give it a shot (with the exception of that Husky owner above, man Whistle should hire that dude as head of quality and assurance!). I am SOOOO glad I did. To break it down, Im gonna list what I wanted, what whistle offers, and what I hope they offer in the future (pros and cons if you will).What I wanted:- To keep tabs on my dog. This was most important to me.  I want to know where she is when Im at work, or on vacation. Or (heaven forbid) she got lost (or stolen!). She has some health issues that require specific management, so losing her, even for a few hours would be stressful (ok admittedly mostly on me, but still).What Whistle offered (Pros and things I thought were cool, but really didnt even know I wanted until I owned one):- I had no idea that my dog laid around and did so much of nothing all day.  As a new Veterinarian, this will give me a lot of clout when owners tell me he gets exercise, we have a huge backyard he can play in all day.  Listen folks, thats not happening, your dog is sun-bathing until you get home. Trust me, now I know.- (Putting my Vet hat on now) Probably the healthiest thing people can do for their pets is to keep them at a healthy weight.  And its HARD.  This app helps track that, takes out the excuses and puts right in front of you just how much exercise your dog is really getting.  Mine was getting, about zero.- It helps the human health problem too: I was going to buy myself a Fitbit, but decided to spread out the big purchases a little (yes $79 is considered a big purchase when you decide to change careers in your 30's and have been in school as long as I have).  So I bought the Whistle first.  Between my dogs Whistle and my handy iPhone, I now know how much I exercise too (Its a little more work of course  I have to subtract the times my husband takes our dog out, but if youre cheap, its doable). Mostly, it just gets me moving, for the sake of my dog, but still gets me moving.- The caregiver feature:  We dont actually have doggie caregivers right now, but what we do have is family members who have now found a way to get me to answer my texts! I ignore the hey hows your day going, what I DONT ignore is hey I see you and Guinny are out for a walk along the marsh! (Side-note: They can see info this if you make them owners  dont worry, not all caregivers can see this).  Its fun, they love it, I love it, and everyone wins. I also LOVE the texts from my mom that say hey I noticed Guin didnt get a walk today, if your busy I can come take her.  Yes please :)- Tracking food and meds: OK this part is key.  In one week, we uncovered 4 episodes of double feeding.  OMG! Not to mention this is the first time in years I have given my dog her heartworm and flea meds on the exact day they are due (yes, this is hard even for vets).- Its waterproof: Did I mention we live near a marsh?  Guinny swims, a lot, and the Whistle is still working. nuf said.- Text messages about her location and activity updates: Okay I have to admit, my heart skips a beat a little when I get a text that Guin has left the Whistle zone at a time of day when I dont think anyone is home.  So far its been a family member out for a walk each time.  Even though this takes a few minutes off my life every time it happens, I would rather know when she leaves the comfort of our home, then not. This is obviously a family issue and not a Whistle issue  in other words the text messages are great and timely (I just need to train my husband to warn me when hes home for a lunchtime jog!)  If she ever did get stolen or out of our yard, I would know right away and could activate the nearest person to go make sure shes safe.Nice to haves (in other words  cons):- I REALLY want to put one on my indoor/outdoor cat.  I cant seem to keep him in, and I stress every time hes out for more than a few hours.  But hes only about 9lbs (if he wasnt such a diva, it would probably work fine - see pic, it actually fits fine).  He also is getting a little kitty apron and making sure a cat gets exercise is next to impossible. If I could track him the same way I do Guin, I would start making a point to do some weight loss things (put food in multiple places so he has to move around, use food toys, get a laser pointer  I dont knowSOMETHING). But mostly I just want to be able to find him when hes outside. I hope they are working on smaller technology for this purpose.- Im still playing with the app and getting used to it so I dont think it would be fair to call out any cons at this point.  Apps evolve, and Im sure it will have added features and get easier to use with time.  So far Ive been able to figure everything out and its worked great. I only had to send an email to customer service once (I couldnt get a family member added) and it turned out to be something dumb I was doing.  They answered it in less than a few hours.- This next one is more of an idea then a con.  I think the collar should have a lost button on it that people can press if they find your dog and it calls your phone (or something similar).Okay thats all I can think of at the moment. Hope this helps people considering this product.  Im super happy with it! And sorry for the super long review, I take pet care pretty seriously :)
