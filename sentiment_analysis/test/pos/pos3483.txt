This is my third order from this company and I am still thrilled with the quality, taste and uniqueness of this product.  I'm diabetic and these "candy bars" only have 4grams of sugar.  I literally think of them as "candy bars".... just not sweet.  The flavors vary in hotness, but I have yet to meet a flavor that I didn't like!  Ships quickly, consumed even faster.  ;)
