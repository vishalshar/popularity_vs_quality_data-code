I was so excited to get this chair! As a teacher, I may not sit often during the day but after school I definitely need something that is equally great with back support and adjustable. Everytime I sit in the chair I feel like I'm sitting in my Camaro. The chair is very firm and supportive. It adjusts in every way imaginable and so it's perfect for what I need.My students also love it and now they fight over who gets to sit at my desk for the class period. Definitely recommended!
