We recently moved into a house with 14 circuits in our great room. This led to unused lights and dark spots. I first bought one of the remote dimmers for my movie room, and it was an instant success. I had severalModels of Lutron LED dimmers already installed and I took them all out and sent them back. I put as many circuits on the Caseta lights as I could justify at this time, so far 9. Installation was very easy, 3 way switches basically have you mount the pico remote in the switch hole. Without the wireless bridge set up was a little more labor intensive since I wanted a favorite button to make all my lights appear to be the same brightness. Once the bridge was installed this was a snap and adding additional switches and remotes is extremely easy to program and modify.  I have my outside lights on the sunset/sunrise timer, and have all my lights set to go out at 11 in case I fall asleep. The geofence we love. We have it set up to turn the lights on to our favorite scene upon arrival at home. Leaving I don't have it set up to turn the lights off because it can not differentiate if someone remains at home, so I have it set up to send a notification when I leave if the lights are on - works great. I'm obsessed with getting the rest of the lights connected!
