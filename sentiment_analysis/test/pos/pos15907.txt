It's a great product. We live in Seattle area, maybe because of the weather/temperature, it takes a little bit longer - about 10 days - for the mushroom to show up, in a form looking like mold.Then it grows, on both sides. One side is bigger the other side smaller.Give it a 4 instead of 5, because we get about 4 pieces of relatively big mushroom. We cut those 4 pieces in the hope that the rest will grow bigger. However, the mushroom stopped to grow and dried out, even we sprayed everyday.Anyway, we harvested, and kid loved it!
