What I love:-Very well built.- Lots of inputs/output options.- Simple to use.- Great sound quality.- Fun for inspiration while playing guitar.- The ability to use your foot to trigger a drum beat rather than having to use a computer.- The ability for the BeatBuddy to get future upgrades because it's more like a mini computer rather.What I Don't Like:- The inability to just play full songs without having to trigger all of the transitions, fills, and so on. This seems like a very stupid omission to me. Apparently I'm not alone, as there are dozens of requests in the forums for this very feature.- To me the software gets confusing. I never know if I'm suppose to be saving a project or a song, and I don't really understand where I'm suppose to be saving anything to. The instructions are meant to be clear, but I still don't get it.- I wish it was easier to find full drum tracks to songs. I spent hours trying to find midi drum tracks to some of my favorite tunes and was unable to find anything. Not a fault of BeatBuddy, but I find it a huge limitation.- The only way to get this pedal to "midi-synch" is to buy a $400 midi-sync looper (there are only a handful of them on the market). It doesn't sync with normal loopers like the Ditto looper. The workaround (while not optimal) is to record the drum track along with the guitar. This might not be a fault of the Beat Buddy, but a negative worth mentioning.Summary: fun device, though I wish I could use it to play along to some of my favorite songs. I also wish it was the software was more intuitive. I hope they add the capability to use the pedal as a trigger to play complete songs rather than having to trigger every transition.
