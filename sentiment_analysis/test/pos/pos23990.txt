After learning how terrible anit-persperant is for you, I decided to do away with the antiperspirant and have been searching for an effective natural deoderant for about 3 years!I've tried many different types of deodorant...I even tried making my own. I couldn't find any organic and/or natural deodorant that worked so I began using my husband's OldSpice brand deoderant. While it wasn't natural or organic, it was better than antiperspirant! It took me about 2 weeks for my body to adjust to not wearing antiperspirant and the funny thing is I actually sweat LESS without the toxic antiperspirant! Since then I've still continued to search for a nicer smelling, natural deoderant...fast forward about 15 trial and fails and A LOT of money wasted on ineffective deoderant later and I finally stumbled upon Primal Pit Paste's Lavender Natural Deoderant. It really works!! I used to be embarrassed when I would sweat through my tight fitting shirts. I'm happy to say that's no longer a concern. My sister-in-law and her husband also purchased some based on my recommendation (they got the unscented one) which they share) and they both love it.I also same room when I travel by scooping a small amount in as 1/2oz jar and throwing it in my purse or luggage. (I opted for the jar variety, not the stick).I'm not sure if they will ever see this, but THANK YOU Primal Pit Paste for being the solution to my pit-Dilema!Crystal
