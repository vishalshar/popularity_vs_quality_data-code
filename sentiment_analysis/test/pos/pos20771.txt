I happened to lose a set of keys 1 week into moving into a new condo. We turned the place upside down looking for them - I'm still convinced they are in the house somewhere! As soon as we got a new pair, the first thing I did was research what I could add to my keychain to locate them if god forbid I lost ANOTHER set. TrackR popped up on my search and I remembered seeing them in a Kickstarter - so i made a purchase, with custom engraving, and patiently waited for them to be delivered. I couldn't be more thrilled with my purchase! It took a little longer than expected to arrive, but they were clear from the start that they were dealing with a large number of orders, and because of the engraving, I should expect to wait a little longer than advertised - not a problem. I have since received another set for my boyfriend, and have raved to everyone I know about the amazingness that is my trackR - I have even used it to locate my phone! Fantastic reverse compatibility. I will definitely be purchasing more in the future - for our dogs, for our spare keys, for my computer ... the options of things to lose are endless!
