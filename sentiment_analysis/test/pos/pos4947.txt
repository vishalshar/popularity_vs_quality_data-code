Best bike mount I have ever owned. Unlike a previous reviewer I clamped the bike mount right to my aerobars. I used some stretch tape to build up the mounting area around the carbon fiber aerobars. I logged several hundred miles with no issues at all. The location of my phone for viewing is perfect and my phone is rock solid. I love this mount and it does not interfere with my arms or hands when on my aerobars for long periods of time
