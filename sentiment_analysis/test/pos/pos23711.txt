I bought the Airdog to primarily capture windsurf action. There is NO other drone on the market that even comes close to what this drone was designed to do (even with the latest new product releases from other suppliers). Basically, it performs as described and have managed to get some great action on the water. What also clearly differentiates this Auto-follow drone is that it works in winds unto 28Knots. I have used in 20Knots - and no problem.From experience - I suggest you spend lots of time experimenting with the settings, become confident and READ the manual and useful blogs. This product is at the forefront of technology - since it is essentially taking GPS and lots of other navigational information realtime (temperature, barometric etc) to both calculate the relative distance between both the Airdog and Airleash (since you are also moving) - and this is done at high speed. Clever engineering that although has some small glitches that Airdog are resolving quickly. Summary - if you are into adventure Sports - then go for it.
