These filters are easily the best compliment and accessory to my Phantom 4. the image (both photo and video) difference is immediately noticable, and allows for more accurate cleanup and grading in post production.the threads on the filters match with the phantom 4 PERFECTLY. absolutely no problem screwing them on or off.10/10 would recommend, and I will certainly buy the additional filters PolarPro offers for the Phantom 4. I havent been this happy with a product since I unboxed my Phantom.
