Pillow is amazing, but smells odd. I've got a couple bulging discs and have tried numerous traditional pillows but none worked well. Bought this because my wife got another brand cool gel pillow and was super happy with it.As clich√© as it sounds, there is not an uncomfortable position to sleep in, and I'm actually sleeping more at night and less tired in the morning.
