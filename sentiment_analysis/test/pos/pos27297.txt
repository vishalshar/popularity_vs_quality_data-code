There are lots of people commenting on this who haven't bought this thing. They give it a one star because it's "too easy" or  takes the "fun" out of homebrewing. Let me tell you the truth: I have a 30 gallon electric brewing system that I still love, but haven't used since I bought the PicoBrew. This has changed the way I brew and think about brewing.The first thing this system did was open me up to being more adventurous. At 2.5 gallon batches, who cares if I make something crazy. I've made almost 10 batches in two months because I can open up the recipe designer and think about what I'm making and have fun with the crafting. I don't need to make 5 gallons or 30 gallons at a time.Using the Zymatic is simple. You design or scale a recipe to a 2.5 gallon batch. You put the ingredients in the box, put your water in a keg, and have it run your precrafted recipe. Advanced brewers can adjust water chemistry, measure pH and o.g. (at any point in the boil/mash) through the sample port, and easily add items directly to the boil as well. This thing really accelerates at beer < 1.070 gravity. I've made some awesome pales using this thing. The system is designed to make the wort and then let you ferment in the keg. I prefer to ferment in cheap glass carboys, and the picobrew lets me easily circulate the wort from the keg to a carboy at the end. I've made some fantastic beers with this system.The customer service is top notch. I've had Annie, Kevin and others at PicoBrew respond to questions on a Saturday morning and ship me parts that I lost (my fault) at no cost. These guys are on top of their inbox, and for a $2k system, you get a level of support that matches the price. I can't say enough about how responsive they've been to my questions and problems.I give this product five stars because it's fantastic to brew with and way easier to clean, and I can do it in my nice air conditioned kitchen. There are a few problems with water pooling on the top, a less powerful designer than I'd like, and chilling is sort of a pain, but this is a homerun in my book.
