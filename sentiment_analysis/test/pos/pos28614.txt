Finally Petcube Play has night vision what is really important for me. I'm travel a lot and time zones are different so night vision is really great feature.I had a previous version of Petcube and really love it. But this one is absolutely fantastic.It is much smaller, it has night vision. Also I like the laser - it looks brighter to me and works more smoothly.Me and my cat are absolutely happy to have Petcube Play. Pictures attached.
