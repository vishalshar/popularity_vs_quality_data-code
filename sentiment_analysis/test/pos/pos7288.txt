Arrived within a week. Upon first review it looks to be very durable with a flex tube armor shielding and my iPhone does not give any "not compatible/supported errors" when I plug it in. I have yet to have any cable for my iPhone last me more than six months but this one may be up to task. I will post a follow up review in 6 months.
