Sugru is amazing stuff.  I have used it to fix a beloved shoe, make a surf fin key easier to grip, and to make my iPhone headphones more comfortable.  There are hundreds of other uses available to view if you google Sugru.  It's very easy to work with, but has a short-ish shelf-life so don't order too much of it.  It's not cheap!
