My daughter-in-law has one and so of course I had to get one!  I like the appearance of the Urban - I think it is classy with an abstract look and also earthy.  I am still getting accustomed to my Leaf, but so far so good!  I am finding the sleep tracker is pretty accurate and I have not had the time to meditate (unfortunately).  The stress tracker is interesting - sometimes I wonder if it feels more stress than I do!My one concern is with the wrap bracelet - when I take off my bracelet to shower (wish it was waterproof), I have found my Leaf falling off the bracelet due to the gaps in the link. So, I am in the process of looking for another bracelet since that is my preferred choice of wear.  All in all - I don't even know I have it on!!!
