I wanted a ballistic nylon wallet with RFID blocking to replace my old ballistic nylon wallet, which I've had 35 years. This one hopefully will last 35 years (when I'm close to 100 years old!). It could be a bit bigger though. The credit card slots are very tight, making it hard to pull a card out. I'd like to see a tri-fold version come out from Viator Gear.
