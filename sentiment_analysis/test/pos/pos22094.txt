I saw these used on the Food Network and decided to try them.  They really work. I have never been able to keep my cheese fresh.  I have tried wax paper bags and even tried wrapping it in parchment paper.  This time my large block of cheese from pasture raised cows never showed any signs of age.  It took about 6 weeks or more to use it up and it remained just as fresh as when I bought it.  I am really pleased with these storage bags.
