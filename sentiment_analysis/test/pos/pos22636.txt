I love the combination of dried bananas and dark chocolate and found this brand when I was traveling recently.  They are absolutely delicious. They're a bit of an extravagant treat, but I'm willing to pay more for organic and fair trade ingredients.  When I researched this company online, I learned that they a Certified B Corporation, which means they're the real deal, and that's important to me.  The chocolate banana bites arrived in perfect condition, well packed.
