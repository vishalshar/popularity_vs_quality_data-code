Exactly what I was looking for. We recently acquired a wood furnace and I learned the hard way that fire and mascara don't mix. But I missed my long lashes and this works beautifully. It won't give you caterpillar lashes, if that's what you like, but it is buildable and lengthens and separates better than anything I've ever used.
