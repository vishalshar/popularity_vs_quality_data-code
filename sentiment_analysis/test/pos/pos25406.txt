I purchased this a few weeks ago and am really happy with the results. It's concentrated, yet light and rich. Really, one of the best moisturizers I've ever used. My skin is highly sensitive and is now on the more "mature" side; and still prone to the occasional acne. It hasn't caused any reaction; and the smoothness of my skin has improved. A little goes a long way - you won't be disappointed. I will definitely purchase again - love it!
