I was playing one of my mountain dulcimers when the Triller arrived.  I immediately tried it on my dulcimer.  WOW!  I am experimenting with Triller sounds on all of my stringed instruments and hear something new every day.  The Triller has quickly become a five-star, vital friend in my musical world!
