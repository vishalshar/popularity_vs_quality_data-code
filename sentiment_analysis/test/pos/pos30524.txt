This went from the package to a successful test in five minutes. I have one Roost installed in one of my smoke detectors. Tests on all of my smoke and CO2 detectors throughout the house work. I get notifications on two separate phones. The best part is getting notified of problems without paying monthly monitoring fees. Clean, efficient packaging and simple, clear instructions. An all around win.
