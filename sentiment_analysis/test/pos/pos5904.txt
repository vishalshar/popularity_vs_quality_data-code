LOVE THIS COLLAR. WE HAD JUST BROUGHT HOME OUR LITTLE FRANKLIN SINCLAIR CHIHUHUA, AND WE'VE HAD AN UNDERGROUND FENCE FOR OUR PUG AND LAB. IT TOOK LIKE 1 DAY FOR HIM TO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT WALKING NEAR THE FLAGS! KEEPS HIM SAFE AND KEEPS US FROM HAVING TO KEEP HIM ON  A LEAD, SO HE CAN RUN THE YARD AND BE A DOG.. LOVE IT AND TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT.
