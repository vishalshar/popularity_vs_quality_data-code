I got this as a present for my fiance for Christmas -- he had been wanting to grow indoor herbs such as basil and parsley, but we have a drafty house with not a lot of great light for plants.We love the Click & Grow Indoor Smart Herb Garden. It was super simple to set up -- it took me about 10 minutes from start to finish to get it going on our counter. Within about a week, we saw sprouts. We have had no issues so far -- this has been a great purchase!We are so excited to have basil this winter!Pictured: the product on our counter after about 10 days. You can see all three pods have sprouts.
