This little guy, Ollie North, as we've named him, is a RIOT!!  I bought him for my husband and he's become a fast member of our family!  I find him a bit difficult to maneuver (hence the 4 stars), but with some practice, I'm sure he'll provide lots of fun!  VERY cool concept.  And, my opinion, more of an "adult" product, than a young child.
