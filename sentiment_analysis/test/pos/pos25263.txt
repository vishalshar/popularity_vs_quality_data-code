When I first got my dinos, they glowed a little bit for a few nights, and died, most likely of hot shipping temperatures in my area. I gave them a little dino food twice trying to revive the poor things but nothing happened so I contacted the seller and they were extremely kind. They responded pretty much same day to next business day with a real person not a machine. They got me a quick free refill of not only a healthy batch of dinoflagellates, but another dino food pouch and a little sticker! It's been 2 days now and I've been taking very good care of the little dinos. Bringing them to the counter during the day and a very dark part of the house at night. And they glow a whole lot being the first few days. Theres not that many little guys yet, but the few that are there are huge and bright. Agitate the case slightly and they glow floating around in circles like a beautiful starry night. I sure hope they continue living healthily because these little cuties are great and neat low maintenance pets.Must have for that science fan in your life.
