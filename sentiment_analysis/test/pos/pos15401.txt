I've used this on 3 year old gloves that have lost it's grip and also 1 week old gloves.  The product does what it says it does and that's add grip and tack back to the gloves.  I've used this on Cutter and also Nike gloves and it works perfectly.  It works the same in winter, in 20 degree weather, as it does in summer.  No need to purchase new gloves when you can add the tack back with this.  I'll be purchasing this again when I run out.
