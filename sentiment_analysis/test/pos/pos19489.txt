I've had this case for about a month.  I don't normally buy a case for my phone but the iPhone 6 was slippery  and I have small hands.  The case fit the phone very well.  The pocket in the back is perfect for one credit card and maybe some folded cash.  The texture on the side of the case makes it very easy to hold and has allowed me to use this phone one-handed again.
