I got a sample of this in my Ipsy bag a few months ago, and recently just bought the full size version. It is such a gentle exfoliant and I feel like I glow after using it. I also really love the smell. I don't use it everyday because I have sensitive skin, but I really look forward to using it on the days I do. It's delightful!
