I got started using the "Big Sexy Hair" (dumb name) for some hair volumizing...and I really liked it but I DIDN'T like the price...so I decided to try this "dry shampoo" volumizing product...a lot more product for less money.  Now, that's what I like!  But..does it work the same way?  YES!  I like it and will continue to use this product...be sure your hair is dry for proper effect....sprinkle in TINY amount throughout the hair and scrunch it how ever you like.
