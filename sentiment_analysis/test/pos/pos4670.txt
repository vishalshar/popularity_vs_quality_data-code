I'm pretty cynical and skeptical about many "natural health" claims yet I have found that Dream Water has worked for me every time and the new powder formulation works great. Being a small "stick" of powder makes it easy for traveling, I can pack several in my purse without taking up any room. My results are pretty spot-on, they say take 30 minutes before bed and it's true for me, within 30-45 minutes I am ready to zonk out in Dreamland. The taste is also a lot more pleasant than I was expecting, I was expecting a sour, bitter taste (don't ask, I have no clue why) but instead it was nicely sweet, not too sweet, and tastes better than the liquid form of Dream Water.
