I got the Nanoconsole to use my LG V10 to play over-the-top TV phone apps in rooms and places where I dont have a cable connection but I can put a TV or monitor there, such as the bedroom, the study, the backyard, on the road in a hotel room, even the office (dont tell my boss).I use a lot of apps to stream movies and videos, such as Xfinity TV Go, NBC Sports Live Extra, MLB At Bat, HBO Go, Netflix, Sling TV, and Google Play.  These apps always work reliably on my phone and theyre pretty snappy on my phone vs. having to wait for the same apps to load and run on my streaming TV sticks and boxes.  Most of these apps on my streaming TV sticks and boxes dont remember where I left off watching something on the same app on my phone; its a hassle to find the movie or program again, then find the place where I stopped watching the program.  Its a first-world problem, but its still a hassle.  The Nanoconsole solves this problem because when I attach my phone to it, my phone becomes the streaming TV stick or box, and the apps remember exactly where a I paused a program on my phone because Im still using the app on my phone!  Hassle solved.The Nanoconsole lets me show my phones screen on my TV and then I use the Nanoconsoles remote control to control my phone.  The picture quality from my phone to the TV is very good.  When Im streaming video from the Internet, the picture qualitys nicer the faster my Internet speed is.  If I have a slow Internet connection, the streaming video quality will be grainy.  Ive noticed that some apps stream video at a higher video quality than other apps, so your mileage will vary depending on the apps you are using to stream videos (YouTube and the NBC Sports Live Extra apps video streams are excellent).  Also, for the first time I can easily play videos and pictures Ive taken on my phone on my TV, and the video and picture quality are great because theyre not being streamed.  I know that my streaming TV sticks and boxes can also show videos and pictures from my phone, but in how many years I still havent yet figured out how to upload videos and pictures on my phone to the cloud and then stream them back down to my TV.This summer, Im going to put a small TV out in the backyard, connect my old Nexus 5 and Nanoconsole to the TV so we can BBQ and watch sports outside on the TV with the various TV sports apps on phone.  Outdoor man-cave stuff.  I may even try taking the setup to some tailgaters.A work colleague told me hes been looking for a product like this because not all streaming TV apps run on streaming TV sticks and Apple TV.  He wants to watch his cricket tournament streaming app that he watches on his phone on his TV.The Nanoconsoles easy to set up.  You plug the cables that come with it to your phone and TV.  The Nanoconsoles remote control is very cool.  Its a Bluetooth touchpad that moves a cursor on the phone so you dont have to get up to touch the phones touchscreen to run apps.  It takes some getting used to because its a different way to control your phone, but its a clever idea and useful.  The whole setups cool and useful.  Two thumbs up.CAUTION:  make sure you have a phone that supports SlimPort before buying this, because the Nanoconsole only works with phones that support SlimPort.  Ive been using it with a LG V10, Nexus 5, and Amazon Fire HD 6 without any problems.
