Pretty easy to setup once you review the how-to video online. I have a 9 year old and an 11 year old who are active soccer players and working on continuing to develop their skills. There's no better way other than getting touches on the ball.We've set it up twice so far and we are going to attempt it leave it setup over the weekend to see how it fairs against the weather. Every component appears to be durable and the poles seems to be painted well enough to with stand rain. We waterproofed the wooden base to hold the posts, so we shall see.This definitely beats kicking the ball against a wall and gives the flexibility to play with only one person. I will report back if anything changes.
