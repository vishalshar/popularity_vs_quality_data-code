When it comes to buses and boats, I usually start to feel nauseous pretty quickly. This makes for a miserable journey. These bars, however, seemed to help quite a bit on a recent multi-hour shuttle ride. I had half of a bar on the first half and the second half on the way home and I didn't experience any feelings of car sickness whatsoever. That's pretty amazing from someone who has tried every OTC and prescription medicine or patch out there are usually still feels car sick.That being said, I wasn't a huge fan of the texture (the bar is a bit dry). I'd classify the flavor as uncontroversial with natural ginger and oats. I would probably not opt to eat these for fun. HOWEVER, I have 2 more bars left that I'll be testing on future journeys and if they work as well as the first time, then I'm sold.
