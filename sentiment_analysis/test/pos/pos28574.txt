Great Switch! The application (to control the switch) is easy to use and the switch works as intended. Multiple "scenes" can be programmed, the Neon "glow" directly on the switch is a nice feature (proximity sensor) that can be disabled if preferred (works great to find the switch in a dark room). The switch has phenomenal potential to continue developing and expanding the application and software functionality.The switch is fairly easy to install (electrician is helpful for three-way switch installs, single pole setups are straight forward), although I did need to return one switch (software glitch and the switch would not reboot). Customer server was outstanding and they immediately shipped a replacement switch. One thing to keep in mind when converting more than 5-10 switches is the strength and range of wifi in your home. I would highly recommend a high-end router or use multiple access points placed around your home. Some routers may struggle to manage a large number of devices connected and may not provide adequate wifi signal throughout your home. Tip: Ubiquity makes some of the best Wireless Access Points (WAP) on the market and installing a few can resolve issues with wifi coverage.Final bonus, the switch contains timer functionality which can be programmed from the app, great for setting outdoor lights (and indoor lights).
