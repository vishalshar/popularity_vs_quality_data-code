I love this.  I previously had a UP24 and I like this so much better.  You don't have to take it off to shower or swim, and you don't have to tell it when you are going to sleep.  It's much lighter than I expected.  I wear it on my ankle because I discovered that my arms were more active than the rest of my body and didn't really give an accurate reading of my activity.  The walking and running programs are awesome.  I tend to slow down and this reminds you to keep your pace up.  I haven't tried the biking mode yet, but I can't wait to.The swimming mode is surprisingly accurate.  The only thing it misses is when you are just kicking.  It would be nice to be able to add that in.Overall, great purchase!
