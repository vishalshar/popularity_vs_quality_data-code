A must have for any pet owner! This camera has been awesome. My husband and I have long work hours, but still love our dog more than anything, and want to be with him. We set up this camera, can see, take screen shots, talk to, and can play with our puppy when we aren't home. He loves the laser pointer. You can also add others (friends and family) who have a pet cube (app on your phone) and play with each others pets! Its fun and family friendly. You can also look at others who have their pet cubes set to "public" (you can always keep your "private") and play with their pets!
