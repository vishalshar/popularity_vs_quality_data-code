Awesome. Compact and portable. Fully functional router that is capable of replacing your existing router or the wifi function on your computer. Requires a slightly more computer savvy user to be able to utilize all of the functions. Worth every penny (especially when you buy from amazon... because, for some reason, it's about $20 cheaper here than on the Anonabox website).
