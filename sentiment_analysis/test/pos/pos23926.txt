So much fun!  Our little rescue dog is a ball fanatic and I loved the idea of an indoor or outdoor toy she could learn to play with on her own when the family is busy.  Great exercise to keep her content!  While she is still learning the process, she loves playing iFetch with the kids.  And surprisingly, the kids love it just as much!  In fact they have started a game where one child lauches while the other dives through the "line of fire", while all the while the dog is in hard-core fetch mode!  Tons of laughter and a very happy little dog!
