I cannot explain enough... how much I love my Pencil by 53!!! All the reviews are right when they say that as soon as you learn how to hold the pencil, using it is a whole new way of life! I thought I was in love with my iPad before... now... I'm ADDICTED! This is my first stylus pencil. But I got the best one. You can use it on all sketch apps... but obviously, I use it for Paper. Attached to this review is one of the Remixes that I completed with this pencil. I promise you will not regret it. I love the walnut color... it goes well with my Smart Cover and... well.. it goes great with life! So don't hesitate... you will love it :)
