This is a wonderful program that fuses online app technology with hands on learning.The Cosmo unit is very well made and the apps are creative, educational, fun, thoughtful. This type of educational format should be in every classroom. Osmo is truly 21st Century learning. I would love to see this concept expanded in all areas. Multi sensory learning should be the standard in all schools. I  am homeschooling my son  who has high functioning autism and Oslo Numbers, Newton, Tangrams have helped him connect in ways that iPad apps or hands on manipulative  alone have not.The Words app is also wonderful but my son cannot wrap his head around the game. He can read many words but conjuring up letters in no particular order is confusing for him. He is only 6 so in time he might be able to enjoy that app as well. He is not into the Masterpiece app but I am! The whole family.
