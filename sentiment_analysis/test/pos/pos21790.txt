I enjoy using Silicon cookware, baking mats, and linings, and had been hoping someone would start making exactly this item- re-usable bags in silicon. The waste with single use "zipper" bags is terrible, and even though I try to re-use them, they end up looking very ratty and questionable...so, wish granted. This 7" Stasher is a  silicon bag with a clever "zipping" mechanism that works very well in that it is easy to press shut w no fumbling to line up the grooves, and is waterproof once shut (see pic- it feels like a 70s waterbed when filled w water). I wouldn't manipulate this excessively filled with liquid (soup) tho, as it might be squeezed open accidentally, but it's fairly reliable for stews and such. This holds my leftovers well and you can even microwave the pouch straight out of the fridge (leave an opening!). It can also hold a sandwich w it's shape- need to cut in half and put the sides in if you have wider bread. I feel better that my food is touching a non-reactive surface vs. some plastics that leach chemicals. This is a very useful product, and I plan on purchasing more of these.
