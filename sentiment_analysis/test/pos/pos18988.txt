Bluetooth reception is very solid. Line-of-sight isn't required. You can bring your mobile device into the next room if you'd like without any audio dropout.Setup is very quick and easy, and I like the elegant design. The DAC is of nice quality, though just a bit less than that contained within the Arcam rBlink. However, the Relay has no issues with blasts of static as is the case with the rBlink, so at the moment this is the more attractive choice of the two.The press of a button allows you to bypass the Relay's DAC and send the digital signal on to another DAC via a coaxial cable. That's how I have it set up. I have the Relay send my iPad's signal to my OPPO Blu Ray player, and it sounds great. If you don't own another DAC, using the Relay's DAC produces very good sound in its own right.I've deducted a star because I think that $250 is just a little too expensive for this type of item. If it were priced around $200 I'd give it five stars.
