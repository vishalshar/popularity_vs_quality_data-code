iPhone App has a "known bug."I received the Kinsa Smart Ear Thermometer on Feb. 16. I installed the app on my iPhone 6 with iOS 9.2.1 and paired the thermometer without problem. I took several reading and transferred them to the phone. The next day I took more readings and noticed all of my reading were dated Feb. 20. The readings were in the Apple Health app with the Feb. 20 date and did not show on the graph because they were dated in the future.I changed my rating to five stars because Kinsa has updated the iOS app. It is now assigning the correct date to the readings.I emailed Kinsa support. They replied immediately and said I was experiencing a known bug and to watch for an update to the app. They gave no indication when the app will be available. This is disappointing.
