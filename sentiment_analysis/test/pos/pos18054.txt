I love this stuff.  I originally bought the stick version because I thought it would be easier, and after years of wearing traditional deodorant, the thought of applying a deodorant with my fingers was not appealing.  The stick, however, I found very difficult to apply (because it's in stick form, you have to wait for it to warm up against your body and who has time for that when you have a baby that is only happy in the bouncer for the length of a 5 minute shower).  This stuff you just scoop a little bit out with the stick provided, rub it in, and you're done.  No residue, no need to wash your hands or anything.  I usually just swipe my fingers on my underwear and proceed with getting dressed.  I have very sensitive skin, so initially I did have a reaction, but I'm so glad I stuck with it.  People, read the FAQ page on their website!!!  It explains the ins and outs of your armpits pretty thoroughly.  I hadn't read it and was ready to throw in the towel, but I stuck it out for about a week and a half and read up on their website and the initial stink (pit detox, who knew!), and redness/tenderness (using too much product) went away.  I am now very happy with their product, and I'm so glad I'm not using the traditional, aluminum filled stuff anymore....especially since I have a baby that loves to shove his hand in my pit while nursing!
