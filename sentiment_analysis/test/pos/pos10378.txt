I really like this product. It was fairly easy to learn to use and all the ins and outs of all the different functions. Yeah only things keeping me from rating this 5/5 is that:A: the rates are pretty slow, so once you begin to get comfortable you can't really test your limits to much.B: the altitude hold just simply didn't work on mine, and I had to constantly re-adjust the throttle.
