4 1/2 stars! This product is a godsend. We have a small dog with separation anxiety and this gives us a way to make our time away be better. She can hear our voices from time to time and get treats; we can see if she's stressed or not. This little invention has done more to help us leave our dog alone than dog therapy and medication. That is saying a lot!Having said all of that, because I anticipate buying this product again: This is the first iteration of this product and it somewhat shows, therefore four and a half stars instead of five. You can only use small round treats (the tiny bone shaped milk bones it came with got jammed) & the signal to the camera isn't always consistent (but still more consistent and amazing than one would imagine!). It would be great if there was a more industrial strength model. A larger dog who really wants the treats inside could do some damage as the product is mostly made of plastic (probably to keep costs down, but I would think there could be different grades/models in the future). It would also be great if the camera could move or be a fish eye lens so you get an even bigger view of the space. It would also be better if the audio was two way, being able to hear if your dog is happy or stressed (whining, crying) would be helpful.Finally, the customer support for this company is outstanding. They really care about their product and customers, that bodes very well for the future of this product.
