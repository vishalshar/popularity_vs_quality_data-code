I was very pleased with the installation of this product. On the BMW F800GT, this was NOT a 5 minute installation simply because the license plate bracket is several pieces that have to be disassembled; drill one hole for the wiring, then a bit of juggling to get it all back together. Not at all difficult but not 5 minutes either.I've not had a chance yet to have my wife drive behind me and see how it's working but I can tell you that cars behind me are definitely not tailgating and seem to slow down even when I don't have the brakes on, so I'd have to say that it is working the way it's supposed  to, making it worth the investment!I had one minor issue on the first power-up, and a call to Faizal had that resolved quickly.Honestly, the install was so simple with good instructions, I find it hard to believe that anyone that is skilled enough to ride couldn't do it. The end result is a clean installation that looks very OEM.UPDATE! I noticed that neither the packaging nor the unit itself (even on the inside) says "Made in China".  WOW, a new electronic product that's not made in China!  I asked Faizal and he said the components are made in the USA, but final assembly is done in Mexico.  The good news is that they are moving all assembly to the USA very soon.  A Win-Win for everyone.  Well done, Vectolabs!!
