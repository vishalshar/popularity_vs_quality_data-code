Picked these up as an idea for a boot lace replacement for work. While that didn't pan out(they're just a bit too small for my boots in the tight configuration they're too loose in the normal configuration to be reliable) However for my Lugz that I wear when not at work they are perfect. Great as a quick slip-on. have yet to have a single break, though one did insist on continuously popping loose but hey, you get a pack of 14 so no big deal. They really do look good. I've actually had people ask me about them when they realize I'm not actually wearing laces.
