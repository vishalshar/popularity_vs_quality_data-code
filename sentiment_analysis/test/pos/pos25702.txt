Wonderful all natural sleep aid that works when I need it. My mother introduced me to this product in its bottle form. Works like a charm. I like Dream Water in the powdered form because I can use whatever filtered or bottled water I want with it. The water used probably doesn't matter to most but Im always skeptical about the kind of water that companies use in "pre-made" products.This is one of the first sleep aids I've used that has had consistent results.Im pretty price conscious. The price retail stores charge for these little bottles is simply ridiculous, my mother was spending over $4 per bottle at Harris Teeter. This powdered version on Amazon is several times cheaper and I prefer it being powdered as well. At roughly $1 per packet, I still wanted to see if I could find any sleep aides that were either better or similar but cheaper. I went on a bit of a research spree and found a few other sleep aids that have been effective and consistent for me. I shied away from "proprietary blends" whenever possible.My top sleep aid recommendations, unordered: Drift Off, Natures Design, Sleep Formula, and Dream Water (this product)
