I mean it in both senses of the word As in IT (information technology) + OMG this is the IT must-have bag!Where to start? This bag has totally revolutionized the luggage game! I am blown away this bag has it all!First, the bag looks great - clean lines, attention to detail, & minimalistic design. It has a ton of cool features: weight scale, USB port for charging, handy magnetic closure for laptop pocket, GPS, thoughtful organized storage, secure locking, & helpful Bluesmart app. And all these features still keep it light and maneuverable!I got this bag for a wedding I went to last weekend but also as my go-to weekend/business trip bag. It is perfect for a 2-3 day trip.  As a rule I only travel carry-on and couldnt wait to test out my new luggage! It is a perfect bag for a few days, it is a bit smaller then my old bag but it has only made me a more proficient packer! I got everything packed up for the wedding and set-out for the airport. Once I arrived at the airport this is where the luggage really started to shine! It was a breeze getting through security. The front packet has a perfect spot to fit all my necessities, keys, wallet, glasses, plus my Mac Book Pro 15! I cant go anywhere without my laptop, and it has a cozy little front pocket, it slides in and out with ease!When I got to my gate I plopped down, plugged my phone in and when to work (by work I mean Instagramming) I had almost full battery but I could help but try out the new luggage features and show off a little to my fellow gate mates ;)Overall, this is a great bag. I haven't used the app extensively yet (I will update my review after a few more trips) and a few of the other tools + the app just got a new facelift!I feel like I have found the travel smarter not harder bag of the future! Whoo hoo I am kissing my travel woes behind!** Bonus points since it is slinky (cat) approved!
