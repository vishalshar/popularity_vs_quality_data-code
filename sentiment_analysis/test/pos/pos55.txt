I just finished installing this lock about an hour ago and so far I'm pretty pleased with it.It has several advantages over other electronic locks I've installed:First, most electronic locks try to engage a deadbolt using a servo motor. This almost never works because unless the bolt is lined up perfectly with the latch plate the motor will bog down and hang with the bolt partway in. This lock simply engages or disengages a solenoid that connects the door handle to the lock core. When the door is locked, turning the handle does nothing. When the door is unlocked, turning the handle opens the door.Second, this lock is easier to install than the other locks I have installed. The tolerance between the plate and the lock doesn't have to be perfect. The whole unit is very easy to put together in the door as well. After you screw in the plate on the door and the latch hole you just fit the two halves of the lock together through the doorknob hole, put in the screws, snap on the door handles (they can face left or right as you like) and put in the batteries.There are a few things I'd like to improve about this lock:First, as other people mentioned, the "knock to open" functionality flat out doesn't work. It doesn't work with the app open, it doesn't work with the phone screen off as advertised. I felt like an idiot turning my phone screen on and off, launching the app, swiping through menus, all the while banging on my phone with my knuckles trying to find the correct sequence of actions to make the knock-to-unlock feature work. It doesn't work like in Ultraloq's youtube video, nor does it work any other way I've tried.Second, when the quick start guide that says "install the app and you're ready to go," that is a big fat lie. You can use the app to lock and unlock the door, change some basic lock settings and view the user log. You can even set a photo of the user. But you can't program the lock with the app, and that is functionally retarded. That is the main feature of a smartlock you would want to move into an app. No, no... Instead, you'll be punching archaic, confusing sequences of numbers and buttons on the keypad to add, delete and modify users. This is highly disappointing.In the manual it says that the OLED display on the lock "guides you through processes." It does none such. When you're programming the lock it will show one useless word on the display like "menu" or "welcome." I don't understand why they couldn't have it say something useful like "press 1 to add a user" or "enter a new code or touch the sensor to add your fingerprint." Instead it just says NUMBER OR CODE. Uh, what does that mean?It's an OLED screen. You could make it display anything imaginable. You could have it completely walk the user through the whole administration and setup process without even using the manual. You brag about how you use THE BEST PROCESSORS and yet you don't use those processors to make the lock user friendly. That is a usability crime. You never make the user do more work than they need to.Lastly, I was a little confused at first when I unlocked the door because I was able to open the door from the outside once, then it wouldn't open anymore. I thought for a bit that the lock was broken, then I realized on my own (because the app doesn't tell you and it doesn't say in the user manual) you can only open the door from the outside once per authentication. So you have to give a thumbprint, input a pin or unlock the lock with the app every time you open the door from the outside. This is contrary to how one expects a door lock to work: One expects that when a lock is unlocked it stays unlocked, the way nearly every door on the planet works.The only other option is "passage mode" which keeps the door unlocked all the time. To enable "passage mode" you have to get out your phone, open the app, navigate 3 menus deep and toggle a switch. Then when you're done you have to get out your phone, open the app, navigate 3 menus deep and toggle the switch to turn off "passage mode" again. This really, REALLY needs to be a toggle on the front page of the app.This could have been handled WAY better.Here are just a few examples of how it could've been handled way better.The lock could be designed so that if you leave your finger on the sensor for three seconds the door stays unlocked. It could be designed so that there's a "keep unlocked" button on the touch panel. It could have been designed so that if the user touches and holds the enter key after putting in their PIN the door stays unlocked.Like many devices with Bluetooth features, this lock seems to have been designed without any Bluetooth or app functionality, and then had the smart functions just sort of slapped on at the last minute before the whole thing was shipped. This becomes readily apparent when you discover that there's a version of the lock you can buy that doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity nor does it have an app.One last thing to know about this lock: If you have a storm door, before you install this lock you'll need to measure the clearance between the door you're installing the lock on and the storm door because this lock's handle is massive and juts out quite some distance. It barely clears my storm door by about 1 or 1 millimeters.This was another poorly made design decision. Most smart locks that have a bulge box on them either have the handle inset into the bulge box so it doesn't protrude nearly eight inches or the handle is mounted above or below the box. No, not on this one. They just designed the lock to be several inches thick, slapped the handle on top of that and called it a day.It's like the designers of this lock took all the crowdfunding money, had a six week bender, then sat down in fifteen minutes before jetting off to Paris and threw together a lock so they could ship something and not get sued. I mean, it works, yeah. In the hour or so that I've had it it hasn't failed, but the design and usability decisions seem to have been made by a monkey with a crayon.
