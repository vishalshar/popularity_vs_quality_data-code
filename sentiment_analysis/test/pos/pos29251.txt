I have used a variety of gaming mice over the past several years.  The Razer Mamba, Deathadder, and Lachesis, as well as the RAT 9, to name some of the most recent.  Until this mouse the RAT was the only one that was comfortable for me.  I have large hands and I am a Palm style player.  If you are a claw gripper...THIS IS NOT THE MOUSE FOR YOU!  But if like me you have large or even medium sized hands and have been looking for a great feeling and responding mouse to fit your hand, this is the ONE.  I can't say enough good things about this mouse, without even going into to much detail, the 8200 dpi sensor responds perfectly, and the software customization is great.  The only mouse that came near this one for in game feel was the Mamba, but it was too small and the battery kept dying.  The RAT was great and I wouldn't have given it up, but sensor issues kept coming up, with more than just one RAT 9, so I had to find something more reliable, and I am glad I did.  I have been using this mouse for over three months now and I absolutely love it.
