My cats fur is so shiny and soft! I wish I found this earlier! My old cat has been suffering with dandruff for years and this finally did the trick! The best part is its for ALL life stages so now that we have a kitten we don't have to separate the food! I have my dogs on solid gold now as well and they are all soft as velvet and looking super healthy!
