Initially, I was able to set up most of my devices using either IR or the wifi option. All of my devices were already preprogrammed so setting up was easy. I did have one issue so I emailed their customer support. I received a response same day and worked with the same employee for the following few days. My issue wasn't even that big, it was more of a questioning line trying to get the app to work with a DirecTV genie mini via wifi (still in beta). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get the wifi to work with the genie, but they will be looking into it further to see if they can fully develop this option.The reason I was trying to get the wifi to work with the genie is that this unit is in a different room than my tv. As a current workaround, I picked up a Next Generation remote. By swapping out one of the batteries in the AnyMote unit, I was essentially able to broadcast an RF signal to connect to the DirecTV. Everything is now working great, love it.
