Absolutely LOVE the Go! Simple, dependable, versatile and accurate. Like being able to tell time with a push of the dial - the main reason I purchased it. Also appreciate not having to charge it!!!! The watch battery is genius! All of the above AND it's waterproof - great for swimming. I have been telling everyone how pleased I am with this. Buy one - you won't be disappointed!!
