I received a sample of one of these in my monthly snack box subscription - and I was VERY skeptical.  Fruit and seeds that doesn't need to be refrigerated, and comes out of a tube?  Sounded weird.  To my surprise, I LOVED them.  I have tried all the flavors (except for the Peach Chia).  They are low calorie, filling, and delicious.  I love being able to grab one and run out the door in the morning, or pack one to come with me when I go for a hike!
