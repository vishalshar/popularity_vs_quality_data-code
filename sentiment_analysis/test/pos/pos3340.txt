Just a few days in, but so far so good. I had a little trouble initially getting the band and the app to communicate. I reset the band and cancelled, the recreated, my account and everything has been fine since. During that period I emailed the Pivotal Living guys for advice, I got a prompt response and some concise options to try to correct the issue - great customer service.Through the app you can customize your goals - steps, hydration, sleep, calories, activity time and weight loss. Hydration and weight changes have to be entered manually into the app. The band monitors the rest and you sync it up with the app to view it all easily. I don't know if it automatically syncs or not as I don't leave Bluetooth on, I just switch it on to sync.The gentle vibration alarm actually works. My sleep patterns are either deep sleep or awake, there's nothing in between. In spite of the vibration being very slight it woke me from a deep sleep.If you want to monitor your activity level and feel paying through the nose for similar products is ridiculous the. This is the device for you. It works, it's affordable, it's customizable and the company actually provide service when you need it.
