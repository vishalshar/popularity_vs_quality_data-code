Coupled with the right headphones this thing is nothing short of fantastic.  The last few decades have seen a major decline in the way we listen to music. Cheap portable players, even worse headphones / earbuds / speakers. This thing is definitely reversing that trend! There is much debate out there about whether or not we need anything higher than "CD Quality." I for one have always thought that we do, and now the proof is in my hands. I was to the point where I had almost quit listening when I heard about this and decided to give it a try. I also bought some higher end headphones (Grado's Sr325i's and Sennheiser HD700's) to pair up with this thing and all of a sudden I'm back to listening to music all the time.As some of the other reviews have pointed out, this isn't the device for you if you primarily stream music, but if you prefer to own music and are ready, willing, and able to pay the slight premium for high-res there isn't anything on the market that can touch the sound quality of this device until you start spending three to four times as much.The magic is back, the emotional connection is alive again, thank you Pono for making music special again.
