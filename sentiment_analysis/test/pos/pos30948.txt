If you want  review from a non-techie real average joe then this is the review to read!!!UPDATE: 12/31/16. I Moved recently and unplugged my Lumas. When I got to the new house they would not re-connect. I tried several different combos of which one to start with first.  So I called Luma tech support and that is what this update is about...I waited almost no time before the Luma guy answered and he was very nice and seemed to know exactly what he was doing. He basically informed me that I should have "removed them" from the network before disconnecting and moving. I did not know that. He also tried to help me figure out which was the main hub by switching them out but to no use. We had to reset them. There is a little reset button that you have to use a paperclip for to reset the Lumas to factory settings. I did this on each one and it set right up. since Luma is super easy to initially install, this took no time at all. I was on the phone with the guy for about 30 minutes and he was patient the whole time. I did not feel rushed and I felt like he genuinely wanted me to get back up and running. So not only is this a great product but their customer tech service is top notch!!!I have always been extremely disappointed with the internet in my home. I have tried 2 different "wifi extenders" and it got a little better when I ditched the TWC modem and bought a highly recommended one on the internet. That helped a lot, especially with just not losing the internet as a whole spontaneously...but I still had terrible coverage throughout a lot of my house.I AM NOT A TECHIE GUY AND NEEDED SOMETHING SIMPLE. THIS WAS IT!!!I finally got this a week or so ago and right away I was impressed at the difference. I even downloaded an app that people had mentioned, speedtest.net. You just turn on your wifi and take it around your house and hit begin test and it tells you what your upload and download speeds really are.In my house, before Luma I got 35 down and 6 up right next to the wifi router but as I moved around some areas were down into the 20s download speed and one area was 4!!!!! Yikes.When I plugged in the Luma and tested it, It was around  35 throughout my whole house, even the farthest reaches. My house is shaped like a big U with the router/modem right in the middle. I have a very choppy house so there are lots of walls. About a 2000 sq foot home. So call me impressed.Setting up I felt was a breeze. Again I am not a techie and don't want complicated. I know that the biggest complaint on most of the reviews here is the fact that it is not configurable. Well I wouldn't know how if I wanted to.  So I really appreciate how easy it it.It took me 15 minutes or so to hookup. I downloaded the app... I plugged my first unit into the modem and waited for about 3 minutes for it to finish connecting. It goes through different sequences and different colors to tell what it is doing when it is setting up. Everything is done through the app. It tells you when it is connected.Then it tells you where to put the next one based on your house layout. I just found a convenient plug in place near to where they suggested and it set itself up. I should mention each one needs plugged in and comes with the plugin adaptor. Each one also has a ethernet port to plug something directly into it if you want.I moved on to the third one and was good to go. I then went immediately to speedtest.net and tested my internet even in the FARTHEST reaches of my house. Around 35 everywhere.The app is nice even after setup because you can go in and see if your house is all in good standing. It tells you whether each Luma is online or not. You can even restrict content level from unrestricted to G for kids.Now every once in a while I will lose internet connection with my Lumas but I think it is my crappy TWC internet. Then they all need to reconnect. No more often than before.What I don't love about it is that I can not find a way to relaunch a new one without unplugging it and plugging it back in. I wish there was something in the app that allowed me to "reboot" one of the Lumas when it goes down. It does very occasionally seem like one goes offline which messes with your overall house coverage.I definitely like this and am very glad I bought it. Whether or not your are a techie you should be very happy with this. If you are just an average person looking for much stronger wifi throughout your house with no dead zones then this is for you.If my review was helpful to you please click yes below, I would really appreciate it!!!!
