The August lock isn't perfect, but it's pretty amazing for what it is able to do. It's new technology and I think some people are being overly critical in their reviews.Pros:-I can let people in from wherever I am. Usually the app takes less than 10 seconds for me to do this from remote (with the August Connect also set up).-I can tell Siri to lock or unlock my house, and it actually works, every time. With an Apple TV set up, I can do this from anywhere, not just my wifi network.-The auto lock feature has worked every time for me.-The virtual keys are flawless. Any guest needs to download the app and make an account. But this is a one time deal and takes five minutes. Then you can set access unlimited times for them, for free. I continually use this.Cons:-The auto unlock feature, for me, works 3/4 of the time. The other 1/4 I need to dig out my phone and unlock from the app, which takes about the same amount of time as using a physical key.-Every so often the app will be a little buggy and take extra long, but this is rare.-The homekit app IOS 10 isn't enabled at the time of this review, but will be shortly.-The instructions online to use Apple tv generation 4 as a surrogate August Connect are very, very poor. It actually does work, but takes some experimenting.Overall, the August works much better than I would expect for really cool, brand new technology. It's still a little bit of a toy, but it's awesome, and a real showstopper when people see. Plus, letting someone inside my house via Siri from my couch is the ultimate lazy pleasure.
