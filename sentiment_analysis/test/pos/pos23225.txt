Our cat needs to be fed 8 times a day because of stomach acid coming up a few hours after a meal. When I'm home, I don't mind feeding him but going out was complicated, even to run errands!Enters Feed & Go. Our cat didn't hesitate one second to eat from it! Call My Pet Over is useless, the machine is pretty noisy when it rotates, he knows what to do. If I know or think I may not be home on time, I put frozen raw/wet food in the feeder, place an ice pack on the top, schedule the feeding(s) and leave, our Dude waiting by the feeder for the next meal. It's fun to watch him sometimes, the feeder starts rotating and he's on it right away.We love it! The cat eats from it, it takes wet/raw food as well as dry, it's great quality and is beautiful (looks like a giant Apple Magic Mouse), albeit it has a big footprint. It was easy to set up, webcam is fun, website easy to use. It's actually genius. The pet sitter has no problem using it, although it seems complicated for a stranger to rely on an automatic machine and website. No issue so far, everything is set up by me anyway, so it's been easy.It's great but not perfect, especially for the price.- Like I said, it's noisy when rotating, the first time, the husband thought it had a problem.- Webcam does the job but is poor quality, for the price, you'd expect something better.- It's not stainless steel. Alex told me that the plastic is not made of chemicals that cause chin acne. It's good that there's less (or other?) chemicals but my understanding is that plastic scratches easily and will eventually host loads of bacteria, hence the chin acne. I will keep feeding him in his Basis Pet bowls (the best on the market http://www.basispet.com/products/stainless-steel-cat-dish-made-in-the-usa) as much as I can.- The compartments are not well suited for cats who literally have to put their whole face down to lick the food stuck in the corners (there is some waste with wet/raw food). Surprisingly, our cat doesn't get frustrated and will do whatever it takes to get the most of his meal but I would love it if the bottom corners were rounded (slopes) like the Basis Pet bowl.- The unit is not refrigerated, getting the ice pack to stick to the top of the feeder is a challenge.Customer service is excellent. One of the latches broke recently, I contacted Alex who answered very promptly and offered to fix the lid for us. Knowing that I was concerned about our feeding schedule and our cat issues, he sent us a temporary unit, and wanted to make sure we were all set up before I sent mine.
