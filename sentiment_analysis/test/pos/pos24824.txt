I have a family of  seven cats that all seem to have some type of auto-immune ailment involving inflammation, most minor, one fairly major (he used to get another brand joint supplement in capsule form based on shellfish that he enjoyed eating, but no one else would touch). It is easy to incorporate this supplement in their wet-food. It contains turkey tail, but smells more like its main mushroom component. None of the cats complains about it being added to their food, but none of them goes after the supplement when I open its container either. When I started them on the double dose for the first two weeks, they cleaned their plates far more often than before. Since some have gum inflammation, I believe that means it is helping. I intend to keep them on this supplement long term, but will have to wait a few months for their normal veterinary exams to know if the visible ailments have improved. I'm very happy that you can't overdose with this supplement.
