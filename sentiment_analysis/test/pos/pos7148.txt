My dog has been limping due to his age, I saw this on amazon and decided to give it a try. To my surprise my dog no longer has a noticeable limp, he is also jumping back on the sofas after we started using this product. I am so happy that this product works, and would highly recommend it to any dog owner. As for the flavor the treats my dog does not always like them, however with the improvement that I have seen I am completely satisfied.
