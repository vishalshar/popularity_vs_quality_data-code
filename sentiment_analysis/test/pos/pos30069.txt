After cutting an X in the plastic, try breaking up the coffee ground medium with a blunt object (I used a butter knife) then soaking in water for 24 to 36 hours. I decided to do this after initially following the manufacturers directions, which resulted in no growth (the medium is too densely packed for the water to soak through). 10 days after I broke up the medium, I have mushrooms.
