I am pleased with my purchase of the Activit√© having been using a clip on activity tracker for a while I determined that none of the wrist type trackers had an appearance that allowed me to wear them all day. This has the appearance of a wrist watch and can be worn 24/7 tracking sleep as well. It uses low power Bluetooth so haven't had to worry about it running out of power. I do agree with some of the comments regarding the ability to see the time in reduced light there has to be a light source close or you won't be able to see the time. The best part of the deal is I am able to count on it tracking my activity on a consistent basis and know when I am running short of meeting my goal during the day so I can add some laps in.
