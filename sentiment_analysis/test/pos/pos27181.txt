Great socks, I'm over 6" tall and finding medium weight cotton dress socks that don't feel or fit like "ankle" socks is a challenge. These are exactly the length I've been looking for. And they do live up to their name... extra soft.They come in premium grade packaging, a fancy heavy gauge cardboard box.... impressive at first glance, but one can't help wonder just how much that adds to the price of the socks when it's just for show. I gave it to the wife to store her large knitting needles in, she appreciated it.
