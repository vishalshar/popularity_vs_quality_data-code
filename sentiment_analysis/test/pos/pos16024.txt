I got this to repair some old gloves for family football games.  It does an amazing job repairing older gloves and bringing them back to a condition where the gloves are good to wear.  The gloves had better grip when wearing them and a good feel to them.  Using Grip Boost saved a lot of money compared to going out and buying new gloves.
