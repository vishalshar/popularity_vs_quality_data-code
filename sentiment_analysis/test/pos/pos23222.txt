We have 4 cats, 2 Female 2 Male. They are all between 5 & 6 years old. They all have a variety of eating habits. One eats everything in sight and consequently she is overweight. One eats so fast he tends to vomit as quickly as he eats. Another one thinks it's fun to wake us up at 330 am because he wants his breakfast. Then we have one that has no particular habits but will eat when the food is put out.We have been searching for an automatic feeder that would help us control the times and portions. Last year we set on our search. We tried two different RFID feeders. You put an RFID disc on the collar of the cat and the doors open to let that cat eat. The concept on the surface is good but the real world function did not work for us.The reasons varied; the RFID device had to be in the right position for the dish to work, the doors opened in the face of the cats, the RFID device was too big for the cats etc. Our search continued.I happened to find the Feed and Go unit... In reading the description it sounded great but we were hesitant based on previous experiences. i e-mailed Feed and Go to get some feedback on their successes. After all the price was high but if it worked it was well worth it. Alex (the owner) contacted me and we had a great conversation. He explained the way it works in depth and walked me through the devices functions. I was convinced and bought one.After using it for 3+ months including 3 weeks while we were away, we are happy to say that it truly lives up to its description.It is shaped like a large version of an apple mouse. Clean and sleek. It has a carousel inside with six compartments. You program to turn for either individual feedings, a series of feedings or multiple day feedings. The programming is done through your own web portal. It is easy! We started with individual feedings just to get the cats used to it. Set up was easy and the instructions were clear and concise. One of the questions i asked Alex is did it make any noise. He said it did as it turned. In fact it does and I was concerned when we first started using it. The noise it makes lasts 2 or 3 seconds and it has turned out to be call to action for the cats. That is their dinner bell and they run to the feeder once they hear itWe quickly went from trying it out to feeding 5 times a day. We played around with the schedule, remembering that we had several goals in mind. Sleep was key. We set our first feeding at 3:30 AM... I am happy to say we now sleep later in the morning. The cat that eats very fast now has a series of feedings so he is not inclined to vacuum his food down. He is not totally vomit free but is much better. In fact we see him sitting next to the feeder when it getting close to the time it goes off. We don't know how they know what time it is but they do. We are able to control the portions for the overweight one as well.We have a cat sitter come in while we are away. She was amazed at the function. It took 5 minutes to show her how it worked.She has seen other auto feeders and the one comment she had was that the cats could not get the food out by breaking into the unit. I have seen them try but it is impossible because of the design. It made her visits very easy and cut down on what we had to pay her to visit.Another function we liked is the camera. You can program the unit to text you when it goes off if you want. We did. The text arrives with a hyperlink to your individual portal. If you log on you can see who is eating. Admittedly the camera is not the best however it is good enough to see whats going on. It was great to see the cats while we were away.Overall we are very pleased with Feed and Go and will be buying a second one! We have truly seen many different units and we believe this is the most user friendly, cat proof, sturdy and best looking unit that we have found on the market. in addition the people at Feed and Go are great to workwithWell worth the investment!
