I wasn't sure how this would properly hold the camera before I bought it, and was pleased to discover that it works very well. The adapter fits snugly, but not tightly, around the camera, and the insertion of the tripod screw mount presses up on a nub that causes the bottom rubber to tightly contact the camera. While I think the camera should have come with a tripod mount to begin with, I must admit that it works well, and is well constructed.
