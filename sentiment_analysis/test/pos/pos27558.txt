It simply listens for your existing alarms to go off. That also means it's super easy to plug in and set up. If you already a large number of alarms installed in your house, you only need one or maybe two of these.It also make a very nice RGB light, much brighter that most nightlights, and it's all easily controlled from your phone app. You can also set up temperature and humidity alerts.One thing to note is that the Leeo only picks up modern smoke alarms with 2 or 3 beeps. My alarms were from the 80s and had a continuous beep. They were long overdue for replacement (alarms are less effective after 10 years) and once I did, the Leeo worked perfectly.
