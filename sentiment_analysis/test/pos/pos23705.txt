My one year old daughter was recently diagnosed with psosarsis and there isn't much they can do for someone so young so I searched and searched for lotions that would be safe and work on her delicate skin. I came across metaderm and gave it a shot and it worked! Cleared her skin and made her skin feel nice and soft. Their customer service is also very good and helpful with some questions I had. Would def recommend for anyone but especially for someone with a kid who has psosarsis
