I am an aspiring personal trainer/ strength coach and I have to say that this is the only product that has kept my earbuds in my ears for the entire duration of any training session. I have only used them for a few days, but I love the product so far. Very easy to put together, and delivery came as soon as possible. However, they do take some getting use to at first, but your ears will adjust. 5 stars because i can finally use my old earbuds while I run and weight train. Thank you Earhoox!
