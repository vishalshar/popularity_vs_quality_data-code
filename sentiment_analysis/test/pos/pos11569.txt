It's a nice concept and all. Wish there was a dedicated on/off button and that the buttons weren't so cheap. In order to use this after it's the display has gone to sleep, you have to push one of the function buttons - which, because they are under the plastic cover, requires two hands and enough light to see what you are pushing (lack of tactile feedback). And if the function you pushed changes the setting/mode, you have to push it again to get it back to what was there. So bottom line - it works, but could be better and easier to use.
