Works great to clean the aluminum sun roof over my Koi Pond which can only use water since no soap or chemicals can be allowed into the pond below.  The firm brush does an excellent job with the water to clean off insect eggs and other dust and debris that sticks to this underside that gets damp at night from condensation.
