Too much reliance on reading ability at the basic level - game is sold for ages 5-12. Do all 5-year olds know pescatarian?! As a result my 5-year old can't play independently. A major shortcoming which I hope becomes patched. There are a couple of other minor issues too but since it's otherwise excellent it still merits 9/10.
