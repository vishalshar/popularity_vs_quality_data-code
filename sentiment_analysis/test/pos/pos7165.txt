The ilumi works great. The new phone app works a little better than the old one, but I have a couple comments - (1) it should be clearer that the app with the black and white icon is the new one. (2) I find the UI for changing color to be confusing. You should start with a quick tutorial. But aside from that, I love the light - my office is all white, and I love how it changes the entire feeling of the room by adding gorgeous color! Would purchase again.
