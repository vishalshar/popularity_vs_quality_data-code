I'm a Weight Watcher. To find a food with a 0 PPVALUE is a very big deal!  Yeah!  This give you a fruit AND a veggie!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is a personal taste issue. I'm not a fan of "Spice". I guess I didn't read the description close enuf to see "apple spice" on the label!  Will definitely try other flavored!!
