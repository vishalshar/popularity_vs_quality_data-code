Since purchasing my first TrackR, I have already ordered more and recommend them to many of my friends.Pros:1) The design - The bravo is by far the best designed Bluetooth tracker on the market. It metal material makes it small and durable so Im not worried about it getting cracked or broken from normal wear and tear. The size also allows me to stick it onto my TV remote and the inside of my glasses case so I can locate them.2) The replaceable battery - This was a big selling point for me. I didnt want to invest in something that I was ultimately going to have to replace. I love that the app has a battery life indicator, so I know how much battery life the device has and I will have an indicator of when I need to replace it.3) Two-way ringing - This feature is so cool! I am consistently leaving my phone somewhere in the house and its always a pain to try and find when I leave. With the TrackR I can just use the TrackR on my keys to ring my phone.4) Separation Alerts - Again another really neat feature. I dont usually walk away without things, but its great to know that if I do my TrackR will let me know.5) The Crowd GPS - I havent had to use this yet, but I love the concept. Once the network grows some, I think this will be very useful.The only thing I wish I could change about the device is the volume of the ringer on the TrackR.Overall, I absolutely love my TrackRs and will probably continue to buy more for myself and others.
