The watch was nice. It doesn't keep my boyfriend's sleep cycle as accurately as the phone on the bed method did, and the face is a little small. We still love the styling of it. Way more chic than a fit bit, and seemingly as accurate. Overall, we are happy with the purchase because aesthetics makes up for the slight dip in functionality over just using phone based health monitoring apps. It is nice that it is waterproof and it logs our swim time etc.The face is an in between size that makes a discreet piece for a man's wrist and a statement piece on a woman's wrist. I do plan to buy one for myself. So it was good enough to purchase twice. If you are looking for a stylish health monitoring watch then this is your best option.
