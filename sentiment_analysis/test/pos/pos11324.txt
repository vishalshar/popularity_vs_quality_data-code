I got this for my 3 year old and we love it! It fits his iPad mini very well, and the handle is nice for him to carry it around. Silicone seems of good enough quality, and has held up well thus far. It does come with a screen protector, but it's very light and thin. We don't mind it though, it's better than nothing. Some of the bulkier screen protectors make it had to use the screen and this one doesn't at all. Great kids case for the price.
