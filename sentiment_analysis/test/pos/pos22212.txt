The device was pretty straight-forward to install with my two Overhead Door openers.  The openers may be made by Genie as they are compatible with Genie wireless remotes.  Two wires is all it takes to make the door go up and down.  Having a historic garage, I had to adjust the door sensors several times to make them work.  I would have preferred a more durable design as they lose "click-together-ability" after being taken apart a few times.The app is disappointing but it does do what it's supposed to - open and close the doors.  I can open the app at any time to check the door's up or down status.  However, if I leave the app open on my Samsung GS6, the next time I switch to the it, I get the message it's closed unexpectedly.  Then I have to launch it again.  Closing it after each use is a work-around.  The day I installed the Garageio I received warnings the door is open but I was adjusting the sensors so I'm not certain how long the door was open before I received the alert.  I'm sure it's published somewhere. As far as I can tell, this is all the app does.  It was also a challenge getting the black box configured with the wifi using the app.  Turns out our phone screens were too bright and I needed to hold them away from each other.However, don't let these comments hold you back from buying one now.  If you have a modern garage (built after 1968 or so), placing the sensors might not be a big deal to you.  And future releases of the app are bound to add more functionality such as making it easier to program, turning the light on/off or the ability to stop the door mid-travel.  For now I'm happy to have the basic functionality.
