This is the best dressing shaker ever, no mess and perfectly blended each use, and the glass is high quality... I bumped it on my granite counter and it didn't break, it's solid and well made.  The presser lock on lid doesn't leak and it's very easy to press down, I have nerve damage in my hand so I don't have much strength so it's important that it's not too stiff.  Very pleased, highly recommend this product!
