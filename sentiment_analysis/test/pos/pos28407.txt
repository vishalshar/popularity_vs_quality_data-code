Awesome robot for my boys. They are 7 and 9 yrs old, I bought one for each. They love having battles with each other by using their tablets as a remote control.  They also play by themselves using the stacking game.  Surprisingly, Alkaline AA batteries will run this robot for a long time before they run flat.I even like to mess around with it sometimes.  Its amazing that the technology that makes this possible has filtered down to toys like this which are now affordable.The company that makes this does a good job at keeping their smartphone/tablet app fresh and updated.  They seem committed to its development by adding new features. One thing to watch for before buying is that if you are going to use the app with this is to make sure your device has Bluetooth LE aka Bluetooth 4.0. Older devices won't work with regular Bluetooth.  The robot still can be lots of fun without the app, but the app does give it a lot more options.
