Top of the line solid mount for any bicycle application.

Best part is when you take your phone off the mount, its not one of these clunky cases with rough edges which makes it difficult to keep in a pocket, purse or bag.  This is a case that you can use everyday and with its water guard cover, its perfect for running and other exercise applications as well (not swimming).
