Wow!! This is a really cool little tool!!!  I'm an electrical engineer, and have been working in the LED lighting industry for several years now.  One persistent problem with LEDs is getting rid of the waste heat.  Up until now, it's been a matter of attaching thermocouples to likely hot spots, or using the "calibrated finger" to test heat dissipation.Now, comes the personal thermal imager!!  I attach it to my iPhone 6+ and I can make a movie of the heating up of one of my boards, or my heatsinks, and measure the temperature to within a few degrees without touching anything.  I can aim the measurement spot very accurately, looking at the image on my phone.  This also provides a record of my measurements if I'm making a movie at the same time.I think it really should have some form of emissivity adjustment, as I'm rarely looking at an ideal black body.  I don't even know what it's calibrated to, but for my purposes, being within a few degrees is ok, since I'm likely more interested in relative measurements.Considering that I've wanted a FLIR for decades, but have been put off by the price, this is a wonderful little tool and recommend it highly!!!!
