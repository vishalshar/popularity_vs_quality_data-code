I wasn't sure at first about a product from a company I hadn't heard of... Then I found out that they're quite well established and growing, and very popular China, just new to the US... Interesting that they use their own AI for speech, and it almost always works perfectly - I've even let some of my friends with heavy accents give it a try (and yes, it sometimes flubbed, but heck, even I couldn't tell what they were trying to say...) It seems to understand basic "natural" speech pretty well - not just keywords and memorizing awkward phrases.Pairing is super easy, setting up your own background image is easy. I saw some reviews that said there weren't a lot of watch faces available, and I can't really judge that - I think there are plenty, and by adding my own backround it has way more than I need for now.There aren't a ton of apps yet, but integration with and extending my phone (Android) works great! I love that this watch feels solid, allows you to "tickle" the side for scrolling - you don't have to hide text/info when you're reading/changing menus...I am seriously considering buying another one!
