I did not expect myself to like these as much as I do. My initial thought was "this will be mushy and bland and I'll have to force myself to finish it. But the moment I started to eat it I knew I would be hooked. Not only are these delicious but they're actually good for you. There is not a single ingredient this that I would not approve, and being vegan myself this is one of the best on-the-go breakfasts I have found. The texture is quite nice- it's like applesauce but with chewable oats- kind of the consistency of quick oats that you put in your fridge overnight. The flavor of the blueberry acai flax is DELICIOUS. It's tangy and sweet, and not at all dull. I love these and I suggest anyone who loves little squeezy packs like these should most definitely give these munk packs a try.
