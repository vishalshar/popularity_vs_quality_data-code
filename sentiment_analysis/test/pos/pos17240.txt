It's amazing that something so simple could be so good.  The ingredients are really just apples and cinnamon and... that's it!  It seems boring, but give it a try and I think you'll find that your bag will disappear pretty quickly.  I do wish the cost could go down a little to compete with potato chips and other snacks, but I suppose eating reasonably healthy can sometimes be a little more expensive.
