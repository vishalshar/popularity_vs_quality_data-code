This must be great but I'll have to buy another box to find out for myself.  I bought this on an Amazon recommendation.  I opened the box, put it in the pantry and forgot about it for a couple days.  When I remembered it and went to the pantry to try one, I found an empty box.  If you have teenagers in your house, you know about empty food containers being left (milk cartons, orange juice cartons, cereal boxes).  So, for now, this is an inferred endorsement.
