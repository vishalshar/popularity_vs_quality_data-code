I got 2 large of these for my dogs and they LOVE them. They already loved rubber toys but these are now their favorite. I have a 62 lbs golden/lab mix and a 20 lbs terrier mix. They both chew on them and play tug together with them. They love that when they drop them they kinda wobble as they roll away which makes them chase after the toy again.
