You need a iOS app downloadable device, and it's compatible with the following:iPad Mini (or later) iOS 8.12+iPad 3 (or later) iOS 8.12+iPhone (4S or later) iOS 8.12+iPod touch (5th Gen or later) iOS 8.12+It took just a minute to download the app (my iPhone, in this case), and it was very intuitive. There is a nice tutorial at the beginning as well, to get you started. You can download individual songs onto your iOS device, and I downloaded 3 of the 25 songs available: Arena Shredder- rock, The Drawing Room- classical, and Tropic Trance- EDM, for a sampling as shown on the video.  Each song had four separate instrumentals to toggle through by pressing the one white button on the pick, and you could either "strum" the instrument alone, or together with the included background song. Just be aware that all the instruments, including strings, drums, keyboard or winds work only w the strumming motion. But, you can't beat this for true air guitar-like action.  My kids really enjoy this a lot, and it's been a party hit w family and friends.
