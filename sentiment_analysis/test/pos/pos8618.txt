This has a place in my everyday bag.  I backed this project at kickstarter last time and was really not disappointed when I got it. The flashlight is very bright for the size and the charging capabilities has replaced my power bank on my bag saving space and weight. The package I got was complete with drawstring pouch and charger and extra accessories. (Please check what's included in this specific Amazon product listing)I own both the Nitecore EA4 and Nitecor EAX Hammer and find myself using this most of the time due to the weight and portability it provides. I also like the fact that I can either use the USB to charge this or the included chargerThis is a good buy for the flashlight build itself, but when you include the charging feature, this just sets the bar higher for other high quality flashlight makers to follow.
