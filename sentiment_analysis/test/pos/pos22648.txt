I've had this case for more than 6 months. I love it. I don't carry a purse, I don't think I own a purse... And this is perfect for what I need to carry. It doesn't seem too slippery to me, as other people have said. If something is sliding off your nightstand, you may need to level your floor.  It holds 3 cards easily and i can also fold a couple bills in there. It snaps shut and it has never popped open on it's own.  I've dropped phone a couple times and it has protected it just fine. I have the turquoise so any dinginess doesn't really show. Any white case I've ever had did get dingy real quick.PROS: holds 3-4 cards and a folded bill or two.It has not added any more bulk than some of my other cases. Still fits in my front pocket jeans.  You can flip it over and use as a kickstand.  All the buttons are easily accessible. Power plug is not obstructed.  Camera can be used frontwards or backwards without obstruction.CONS: the hole for headphones is not big enough to keep my plug in place. But the bottom of the case slides off so I can plug in my headphones. This is irritating though.  I don't know if it is a con or not, but I don't think a guy would want a mirror in his phone case.  The company could probably double sales by making that removable.  I tried to take it out but couldn't. I'm a girl but still didn't want a mirror in there.  The bottom piece that slides out is starting to show strain on the narrow parts. You can see the white marks in the photo.
