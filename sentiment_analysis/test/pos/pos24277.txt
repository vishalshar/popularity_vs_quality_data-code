I received my chair yesterday.  I love it and I would highly recommend it.  Here are the PLUSES and MINUSES!!PLUSESThe COMFORT:  This is by far the most comfortable office Chair I ever had. I love the sides support (above he waist).  I think I heard my back say Thank you ?The LOOKS:  Man I wish my Mercedes car had a seat that looks this good  with great attention to details!The QUALITY:  Great engineering - 50 lbs of great material  even the base is metal!  Yes it looks and feels expensive.MINUSESThe ASSEMBLY:  All easy, I could have had it completely assembled in just 10 minutes but the stubborn wheels (to get pushed in were tight) took extra 5 minutes alone!I missed installing one wheel (phone call distraction) and I sat on the chair and never realized that it was missing a wheel until I left the desk and saw a wheel on the floor where I assembled the chair!!I am amazed with how balanced and solid this chair is!The WAIT:  It took extra 2 days of wait due to back-order (even though it was well worth it).  Demand must be very high.The FIGHTS:  I have to fight with my kids over using it (well at least I know what they would like for Xmas!)The ADDICTION:  I find myself sitting longer in front of my computer!I definitely recommend oneor two if you have a kid!Get it now and thank me later :)
