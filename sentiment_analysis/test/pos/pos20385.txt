Not too high in sodium which isn't easy to find in a stick like this.  Low carb and higher protein.  My husband really likes these for a snack.  Easy to transport for snacks and keep on hand for emergency use as well. We have purchased almost all of the  flavor and liked them.  My mother really likes the honey mustard because it has a little sweet to it and it isn't too spicy for her.Updated 10/8/2016:  Just recently received via the VINE program the Uncured Bacon  to review.  Same as above review plus it does taste like lean low sodium bacon, nice.Per Box we reviewed for the Uncured Bacon:  Made in Vermont with Pork purchased from the US and Canada.
