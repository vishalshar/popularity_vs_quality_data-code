Bought it before Thanksgiving so we could take it to family gatherings.  Also ordered extra mouth guards from another seller on Amazon. We like this version best because it is "cleaner" around little ears.  We have 3 young children and lots of nephews & one awesome niece! So we want to have fun but also keep it clean. This game is GREAT!!! We all laughed so hard our sides were sore the next day! Buy it...be silly/crazy...have fun with it...and take videos because you will want to be able to relive some of those moments!!! ?
