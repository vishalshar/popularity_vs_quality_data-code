I bought one for my phone in August, and I'm honestly perplexed that more people don't love it. I still use its functionality everyday. The tech is not designed for it to stick to textured or curved surfaces, which includes most plastics. However, it sticks to glass perfectly.I routinely use it as follows:1) Sticking it to my bathroom mirror2) I manage to stick it to my car dash with a little support from the sound system dial3) I love that even laying it on a surface creates enough tension that I can operation the buttons on the side of my phone without it sliding and my cats can't knock it off surfaces4) You can affix your license or credit card to it, keeping that important/most used card with your phone5) It's stuck to my laptop screen as I'm typing right now6) I play "magic" tricks on my friendsI do all this without ever having cleaned it and most commonly keep my phone in my pocket.I'm getting more for my iPad and I don't know what else, but I know I will find a good use for them.I do remember that it is ridiculously sticky at first. It's almost scary. As this wears off, it still sticks to all the things its Designed to stick to.
