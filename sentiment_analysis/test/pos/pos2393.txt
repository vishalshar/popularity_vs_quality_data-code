This product was great!  I ended up also purchasing the "long" version directly through the vendors website.  My father uses this PICC line cover while admitted in the hospital - the nurses are all very impressed with it!Just as an FYI - We use the long version while he is at home, because the caps for each are lumen are larger than what is used in the hospital.  That is the only reason we needed to purchase another sleeve!
