Absolutely amazing product! Keeps the mattress dry and clean! My husband has incontinence issues and this is working amazingly well to keep the mattress dry. Very comfortable with no thick plastic layer...no crinkling at all.  I plan to order 2 twin sets for protecting my boys beds from spills and dirt.  Washes very nice and even the side fabric and seems hold up great!
