My 8 year old son absolutely loves this toy.  He had great fun putting it together and now really enjoys exploring the game and all of the functions.  This gift is spot on if you have a child that loves putting things together and computers!  I have trouble getting my son away from his Piper at times.  We had an issue with having to wait for the stock to become available and then one part needed replacement, but the customer service was fantastic.
