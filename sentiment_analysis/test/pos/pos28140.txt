My mother is elderly and cannot replenish her fresh fruit and vegetables frequently, so I purchased these Freshpaper sheets for her.  When placing the order, I honestly thought that it would turn out to be gimmicky and ineffective, but to my surprise, my mother loves them!  Her fresh produce is staying fresh at least twice as long now.  I will definitely be purchasing more!
