My dog was able to get his collar off and chewed it up (excessively smart Weimaraner). I was able to order this to use as a replacement! Saved a lot of money over having to buy a whole new set. It linked to my remote easily (with help of instructions). It works just as well as the one that came with the original set. Also, it came with a charger. I was pleasantly surprised about that.
