I love, love, love this!  I have tried so many different kinds of popcorn oil (you have no idea how many), trying to find that movie theater flavor, and this one fits the bill.  You can use it to pop the corn (I usually mix in a little popcorn salt prior to popping as well), then use it as a topping.  It has a flip open cap, so it comes out of the top nicely and you don't over butter.  If you love that great nummy theater butter flavor, you will love this too! It is naturally butter flavored, so if you are vegan, this is not for you.
