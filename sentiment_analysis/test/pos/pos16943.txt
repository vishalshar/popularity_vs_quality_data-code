This is my send iBaby product. I also have the baby monitors. This is a very nice combination and I am very happy that both of them work on the same app. I like that I can see the history of changes in air or temperature on the app. Wish I could export it. I just take a snapshot of it until hopefully that feature gets added. Like my baby monitor, this also plays music but has same music I have on the baby monitor. Wish they added more to it. Now it is boring but it is ok. I bought two of them so I put one in my babys room and the other one in the living room. The purifier is not strong enough for our big living room but for babys room it is perfect. The company says for 10 x 20 space it takes an hour. I feel it is pretty accurate. It is also a great product to be used as audio monitoring.
