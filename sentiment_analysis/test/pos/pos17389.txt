This product works if you use it at least twice a day. Several users said it didn't work for them but noted that they only used it once a day--if yoiu don't use as directed, don't be surprised if it doesn't work.It stimulates growth, so you have to give it time to see the new lashes as they grow, and to see the improved length as lashes grow longer. If you don't use it for a day or so your lashes won't "thin out" (unless a lot of your lashes suddenly fell out, which you'd notice), but the growth won't be increased or as noticeable.You really need to use it at least twice a day, which can be difficult. I'm never seen in public without eye  make-up. I don't leave the house without eye make-up; heck, I don't even want to leave the bathroom without make-up! So here's what I do: Apply it at night right after removing make-up (it's a bit irritating so I put in Refresh eye drops at night), then again first thing in the morning. Leave it on for a few minutes, then massage in. Then I do my morning routine: lift weights, breakfast, get dressed, do hair, organize what I need for the day; very last thing is to massage it in again, add an eye make-up primer (which is important, because this is oily) and make-up, and head out the door.
