This product works exactly as advertised.  I will go into more detail below regarding my setup, but first I want to debunk any criticisms in other reviews.  I have had no problems with the magnet or the clip being insufficient or too strong - both hold very well and are also easy to remove or adjust as necessary.  Additionally, I have not experienced any loss of signal or any similar issue as a result of using this setup.  The phone, data, and Bluetooth signals have gone uninterrupted thus far (I've used the device for about two months).For my phone, I have the larger of the two metal plates adhered to the center of the inside of my Apple Leather iPhone 6+ case.  This puts the metal plate between the case and the phone itself, leaving only the leather case as a barrier between the plate and the magnet.  While the edges of the metal plate do leave small marks on the back of my iPhone 6+, they rub off with little effort (and some spit) and leave no permanent marks or damage.The magnet/clip is simply clipped to one of the vents above my car's media screen.  I rotated this particular vent so the slats would be horizontal to prevent the whole setup from jogging back and forth when I make turns.
