I use this with their bike mount. The case is solid on its own but really shines when you pair it with their mounts. I've been using the 4/4s case for about a year with the magnet and bike mount. Purchased this when I upgraded to a iPhone 5s. I had been so impressed with my old version, I also got one for my father. This version is even better with the addition of the rubber bumper layer.
