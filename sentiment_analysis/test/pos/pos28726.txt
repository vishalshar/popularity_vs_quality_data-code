Works great! Loud enough for garage work, very durable  (has survived numerous drops off the tailgate....oops) and easy one touch volume. Battery lasts more than a full workday playing near full volume. Sound is good with a surprising amount of bass.  It's very high quality, even the box is comes in is nice.  I'll buy another.
