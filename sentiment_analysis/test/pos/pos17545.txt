I just need a device that I can wear everywhere, give me some sort of encouragement to push me do exercises everyday, give notifications when I get call and sms. Thus, the Misfit Ray is perfect for my need. It's very light, elegant, beautiful design and finish. I consider the Fitbit Alta in the time I buy the Misfit Ray ( to get caller ID). But the Misfit Ray is fully water-resistant and the battery last for 6 months. That make the deal for me.However, the Misfit Ray needs some improvements:- The notifications are great. It shows a blue led and vibration when I get call, green led when I receive messages. However, It only works with default Call and Messaging App on your phone. It doesn't work with 3rd app like Textra...- I really love the Misfit Link app. I use 3 taps to ring my phone because I forget where I placed my phone 2, 3 times/ week. But the Misfit Ray only work with 1 app at the same time. If you pair the Ray with Misfit Link, it cannot sync with Misfit app. You need to unpair the Ray before you can sync it with Misfit app.  (that what I experienced with my LG V10, I don't know how the Ray works with iOS)- The Misfit Ray doesn't have Tag Activity function like the Flash. You can edit activity but it doesn't make any change to your points/steps. This problem make the Ray sometime inaccurate compare to the Flash I had before.
