Have used for a couple weeks. Love the angled plug on this cord. Works great with my laptop. Note, however, the 90 degree angle can create some challenges. For example, if I move it from the USB on one side of my laptop to the other, I have to flip the plug over, which means I have to route the cord a different way. Hard to explain, but if I plug it in on the USB on the right side of my laptop, the cord points towards the front of my laptop. If I plug it in on the left side, I have to flip the plug over, so the cord then points towards the back of my laptop. (You don't notice this with a straight plug, since it's still pointing outward, no matter which way you flip the plug.) Still, seems very durable and the 90-deg plug works very well for me!
