This lotion smells amazing! Winters and summers are hard here. It is cold and dry or hot and dry so my hands can get red and cracked. This lotion stopped that. It keeps my hands so soft and did I mention the smell... The lemon sent is wonderful. It lasts a long time and smells like fresh cut lemons.
