I am a cheese lover and I hate to admit that I have been storing my cheese in plastic wrap and bags for years. I bought a wheel of Bellwether Carmondy earlier this year and decided to wrap it in plastic wrap after the first slice. Poor choice, as it was covered in mold in a little over a week. It still pains me that one of favorite cheeses ended up in the trash so quickly. I decided to look for a cheese storage alternative and I now store my cheese in these bags. I am happy to report that no cheese has been tossed prematurely due to mold and that all cheese tastes excellent after being stored in these bags.
