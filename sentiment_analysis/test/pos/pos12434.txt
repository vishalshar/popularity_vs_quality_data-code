I am one of the pickiest people when it comes to cases. I got this case to use on a trip we had for my daughters 3 on 3 tournament. Hands are always full moving from court to court then to hotel then out to eat and so on. I hate taking my purse and wanted a case for my phone that would allow me to carry my cards and money. This case hands down fit my needs perfectly. I love it and will buy other colors. I bought a Spigen slim armor CS case and it is good but only 3 cards max will fit and this case holds more then that plus bills. Don't think twice try this case now!!
