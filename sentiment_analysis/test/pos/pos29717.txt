This is not my first reCAP and won't be my last and here is why. I ordered reCAP to use on jars of milk that I send to my child's daycare. I wanted them to have the ease of a pour cap and not have to deal with a standard mason jar lid. Plastic containers had become fairly unreliable with leaking, as well as having to be replaced due to the wear and tear. I also have been trying to use more glass then plastic these days for environmental reasons, chemical reasons, and because they just last longer. I was a tad nervous tossing the jar of milk into my child's lunchbox and then tossing that lunchbox into the backpack. But there was NEVER an issue! I did always makes sure the Gasket was dry as well as tight. The Gasket grips quickly so I usually give it an extra twist and can feel the gasket get tighter. I also take good care of my Gaskets and hand wash them. It fit every single regular mouth jar I had, regardless of the brand.This experience has honestly changed the way I do everything now. After seeing how cold the jar kept the milk (as well as kept the taste of the milk in tact) I started using mason jars for a lot more. And honestly the reCAP is what makes it possible, becuase the standard lid is not convienent. When I had that convienient and RELIABLE lid in my hands all of a sudden I found endless opportunities for mason jars with reCAPs on them!! I drink my Chi Team out of them, my summer porch beverages, my water when I am working or playing in the yard. I also use them for ALL of my dry goods! Quinoa, Raisins, Flour, Organic Sugar, you name it! I honestly find a new use for the reCAP every day!This product is 100% awesome and I can't say enough good stuff about it. It will change how you do EVERYTHING in your home!
