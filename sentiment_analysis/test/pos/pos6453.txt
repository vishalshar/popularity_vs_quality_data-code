As most of the other reviews have mentioned, this review is based only on our initial experience with set up and testing, fortunately my daughter has not needed to trigger an alarm yet!Set up was extremely easy. We tested all 3 levels of alerts, and are now thinking through some plans for who she will add, and how she will want us to react.I will point out a few things that we really liked:- one click for "check in". She has a car with her at school, and when she is driving at night or travelling around with her club sports team, this will make that "got here safely" message much more likely to happen.- She can actually use the smartphone app to trigger alerts also. She feels that this is a good option to have for flexibility, and that she and her friends can probably take advantage of that in some situations at school such as crowded parties.- seems like there are lots of different ways to carry/attach the device
