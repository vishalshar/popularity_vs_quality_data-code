I purchased this for my 7 year old daughter for christmas, and it was a big hit! Its has been almost a year since we purchased this, and she still plays with it. It comes with four different games that stimulates your little ones brain. My brother (who is an adult) was even fascinated by this, and we eventually  made it a christmas family game night. I totally recommend this to anybody who owns an iPad and has kids. It is a great stimulator for kids, and not just any cheap toy.
