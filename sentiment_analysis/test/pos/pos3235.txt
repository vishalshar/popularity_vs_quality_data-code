My ten year old son and I brought this along on our family vacation.  It's a cooperative word building game, the challenge being you cannot talk to other players.  The object is for everyone to use all of their cards (or as many as possible) by taking turns to form words together.  You cannot communicate what letters you have, and only two passes total (for all players, not each) are allowed in the game.  Once all players have used all of their cards, or both passes have been used and someone cannot play another letter, the game ends and you score your points. It goes without saying the game is highly portable due to it's size.  It's also easy to learn and the games are fast.  One drawback (at least with a two player game) is there is a fairly good chance one player will end up with a lion's share of difficult consonants - JKVXZ, etc.  At least that happened often in our games.  Also, having only one card of each letter made word building more challenging.  Unfortunately, the inability to communicate in a coop game means you can't really use much strategy, either.  I understand there is only one of each card because they are keeping the game the size of a pack of gum.  Still, I think the game play itself might be more fun with more copies of more common letters.Having said that, my son and I did enjoy the game as a light, filler game that is extremely portable.  It will not replace a 'regular' game, but I don't think it was intended to.  It's certainly much more fun than I expected for such a small sized game and I'm impressed they were able to pack this much entertainment into something so small.  It's definitely worth the price if you like word games.
