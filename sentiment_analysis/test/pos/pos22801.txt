Both of my cats enjoy the Quail variety. We'd tried a few other "flavors" of the Solid Gold, but Quail was what did it for both of them.Inara just turned one & will generally eat as much as she can of just about anything. The first few weeks after her adoption I did have to regulate her food a bit (or she'd eat the entire bowl in one sitting), but with the Quail she regulates herself & isn't gaining or losing any weight.Cass, who's 12, was really skinny when I adopted him a few months ago. He had a hard time getting used to everything and for a while he did seem to be eatting very much, so I switched to the Quail. Now he chows down like a champ & has gained about 1-1.5 lbs over the last three months, so his ribs & spine don't show :)Happy Cats!
