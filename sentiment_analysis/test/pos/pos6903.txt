First one finally died after four years.  Underground fence still works like a champ.  My dog hasn't been corrected in a long time, but he hears the beeping when he gets to close and will stop.  without the collar he will venture outside the fence.  His sister doesn't need the collar anymore and stays in the yard even when other dogs go by.  batteries are expensive but if you check Youtube it will show you a way to use replacement batteries and you just sand off the top portion of the case to extract the old battery and put in the new battery.  Much cheaper.  Batteries last a couple months with continuous use.
