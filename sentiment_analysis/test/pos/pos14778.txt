As a music educator and brass player, I wanted something I could with my 2 1/2 year old to start introducing the concept of a wind instrument. I liked this because you actually have to buzz your lips. I think overall its a cool idea. I would probably give it 3.5 stars just for cost. I bought 2 so I could model for him, $60+ tied up in plastic funnels is a lot. The kid seems to like it, and I think will get use for several more years. I just think it's expensive.
