I wasn't sure if I should buy a tracking device or not but I find XY3 to be very handy.  I tend to leave my phone around the house all the time, the feature to ring my phone definitely a plus for me. Also, I love the various colors and the capability of replacing the battery.  I have a tag on my dog's collar as well, just in case.  Very easy to setup and use!
