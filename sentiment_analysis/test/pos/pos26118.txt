I purchased this camera when it first came out.  I've been very please with the camera so far.  Netatmo has been very quick to release firmware updates and the technical support has been great.  I have seen were people have complained about the heat issues, but it's more like warm to the touch.  I do wish that you can somehow move data to a NAS like Synology so you can archive the videos.  I like the alerts as well.  Will be purchasing another one soon
