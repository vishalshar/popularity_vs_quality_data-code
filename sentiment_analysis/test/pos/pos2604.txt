After reading reviews on mushrooms and products like AHCC, I bought this some time ago for my then-senior Australian Shepherd/Cattle Dog mix, who suffered from a number of ailments. She had several skin issues,  including warts, seizures, and hip dysplasia. While Pet Naturals Hip & Joint helped with her hips, and switching to a better,  grain-free dog food got rid if her seizures,  this powder really did put her back into puppy form--though she wasn't too crazy about the taste and didn't always eat it. Sadly, she passed in the summer due to old age, but I do feel this helped her live a longer life--even 3 years longer than her biological sister, who suffered from the same issues.In December of 2014, we got a Corgi puppy,  who seemed in good health but was on Everpet with his breeder and didn't look the better for it. We transitioned him to Wellness, which certainly did wonders, but this product definitely gave him a boost thereafter. I've been staggering days to boost his immunity, but making sure his body's natural defenses don't grow dependent or lax because of the powder. After his vaccines, I do a 7-day dosage while his body learns to recognize the viruses, then go back to a few days a week with his breakfast. So far, his coat had become much softer, he's itching and rubbing his eyes less, and he barely bats an eyelash after his vaccines are given. Digby also wasn't too keen on the taste but seemed fine when I started adding a little wet food to his dry in order to mask/blend the taste.I've also seen a marked improvement in our senior cats, whose diet never changed, as well as in a neighborhood (rabies-free) raccoon that occasionally comes lurking and had a hot spot going on. That went away within a few weeks. While it may be a milder product compared to AHCC (more concentrated and complex form of shitake), I feel that it's  a good and less expensive place to start, especially for chronic conditions that may not yet be in their extreme phases (i.e. CPV, cancer, etc.).
