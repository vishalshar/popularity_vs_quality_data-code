So, I've been using this in action for many things, including a documentary I'm shooting. This is a great camera and great concept but I was a bit mislead by the website and some of the instruction. And I just recommend getting used to it and I now ALWAYS shoot with a second camera for cutting options.I would love to always be able to use the app to edit myself, but I'm doing a documentary where I am doing interviews that I am in and so it does make weird decisions about camera angles sometimes. I'm figuring it out. It needs clean space and clear definition of those that will be speaking. Sometimes you'll get a random angle of a wall.It also only produces a 720p image in the end. I guess I thought we'd get 1080p.I wish we could pre define the angles. It does a great job of picking them and you can see them in the angle viewers and i wish we could "lock" those in and say 'don't add anymore'. But you can't, unless I'm missing something.
