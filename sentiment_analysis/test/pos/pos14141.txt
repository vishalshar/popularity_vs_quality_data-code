Watching the Tour de France and saw this bottle and said fiinally. Didn't see any in local bike shops, so amazon to the recur, love the look, the seals work so the bottom cap dosen't leak, and the BPA-free makes using it over and over worry free. Would recommend this bottle to any one who uses water bottles for activities.
