I've started running and I had issues with my laces being too tight. So, I re-laced my shoes and would twist the bow and tuck it under the first laces. This worked, but sometimes the laces would come out during the run and I would have to stop and re-twist and tuck the laces. I had to do this enough times that I decided to look for an alternative.I read the reviews, even though I was afraid that they were going to make my shoes too tight, I bought them. They come with pictures showing how to make them regular, loose, and tight. I tried the regular and it was too tight, for my liking. I tried the loose and it was still a little tight. So I modified the loose (see pictures) which fits perfectly! It's so nice to be able to slide my shoes on and have the perfect lace tension!I have only used them on one run, thus far, and will update this review in a few months.
