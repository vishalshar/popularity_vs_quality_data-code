The quality of these socks is absolutely amazing. They are very comfortable. My family loves this brand of socks and while the super soft line tends to be a bit too thick and warm for the Florida heat the thin dress sock style is just right. You do get what you pay for when it comes to socks and underwear and when you put these on you can feel the difference and understand why they cost more than the socks you get in bags at the local big box store. They are much softer and they hold up a lot better in the wash. If you're looking for quality socks that are very soft and comfortable these are definitely a good buy.
