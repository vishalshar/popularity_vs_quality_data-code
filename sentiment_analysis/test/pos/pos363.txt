Delivery comes in a compact box that easily opens.  Once the plastic wrap on the mattress is opened, the mattress begins to expand.  The mattress has great support with a perfect amount of softness.  Movement transfer is minimal to non-existent.  Mattress features a high quality, gray/white cover that has a zipper for removal when necessary.  I would highly recommend this mattress.  It is NOT a memory foam and is more similar to a latex mattress.  No springs, no sagging, no sinking, no pressure points - makes for a great night sleep!
