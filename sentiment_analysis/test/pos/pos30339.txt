Well, I had recently got the new Nexus 6 phone and I was looking for a magnet mount for my car. I had previously had one ( of a different type ) for my old phone and loved the ease of use. I knew that the Nexus was a large phone and while I didn't find in ANY reviews of ANY mount that said it would hold a Nexus 6. When I got this unit I was pleased with the materials and workmanship and was hoping it work work for me. However, since the Nexus 6 is a very large phone and when you add a case to it the metal strip that it came with that's designed to go between the phone and the case didn't work. I assume the magnetic strength wasn't enough to hold the phone in place. So I ended up gluing the round metal disk that also came with the unit to the back of my phone and while the magnet is strong enough to hold the phone to base unit the grip of the sponge/rubber clasp isn't enough to hold the phone in an upright position that I need it in. This is a great unit for SMALLER phones, not for large ones.
