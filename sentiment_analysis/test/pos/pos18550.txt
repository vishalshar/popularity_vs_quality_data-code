These little things are incredibly useful and work as advertised. Fit on my nose perfectly, easily, quickly, and stay on pretty darn good!Very happy with the magnification (I chose as close to my prescription reading glasses as possible) and the size of these. Truly stick anywhere and no excuses for not having them with you! I can finally get over my fear of bringing my expensive reading glasses out with me and losing them.I can't wait to go out to eat and read a menu quickly and easily! I would definitely buy this product over and over again!
