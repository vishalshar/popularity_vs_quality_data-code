Operation couldn't be simpler, if you've owned such a device before. The sound is very good, certainly not studio quality, but you're not going to get that out of a portable Bluetooth speaker -- not at this price range anyway. It could use a little more bass response for my taste, but it stands head and shoulders over the internal speaker on my iPhone, and that's exactly what I wanted.I haven't tested the battery life, so I can't speak to its longevity, but it sure seems to have some legs.Pretty durable, too! I'm not going to go stress testing it, but it's built very solidly, and it's not going to fall apart if it gets dinged a bit.
