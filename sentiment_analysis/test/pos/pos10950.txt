I purchased my Spire on a whim as a Mother's Day gift to myself. I fell in love with the idea of monitoring when I'm tense, sedentary, or haven't taken a deep breath in a while, as well as the step counter. I have absolutely been loving my Spire! I love the spire "buzz" that instantly notifies me if I'm tense, haven't taken a deep breath, or have been sedentary. The app allows you to set the length of time you are in each activity before it gives you a buzz. I use that buzz to take a minute and relax, take a deep breath, and remind myself to be present. Now my being present may only last 30 seconds but that's not the Spire's fault :)The app you say? Love it. There are multiple "boosts" to choose from such as meditation timers, breathe with Deepak, and my favorite - what is mindfulness (a one-week introduction from the monks and nuns of Thich Nhat Hanh's Plum Village monastery). I use the app several times a day to check my step count. I'm recovering from bursitis in both hips and based on my pain level and the number of steps I've taken that day, I can judge my recovery progress.I'm also in love with the actual unit and charger. The unit itself has the appearance of a rock with the added benefit that it's washable! If I've had it on and been sweating at all I simply take it off and clean it in the sink. And I love, love, love the charger which is a sleek grey with a cork surround. I plug it in to my iphone plug adaptor charger thingy, and then I can plug my iphone in to the Spire charger so both units charge at the same time.The one aspect that could use improvement the next go around is how the unit is worn. You're given the option of wearing it on your bra or waist band.  When I wore it on my waist band It was a little loose and sometimes fell off. I switched to wearing it on my bra and that stays much better, however I wouldn't suggest wearing it to yoga because as soon as I'm upside down it slips out and hits the floor.Overall I love my Spire and I've been telling everyone about it. Would totally recommend.**Update: Sorry, forgot to add that my experience with their customer service has been outstanding! I think Neema (one of the co-founders) might be adding me to his Christmas card list :)
