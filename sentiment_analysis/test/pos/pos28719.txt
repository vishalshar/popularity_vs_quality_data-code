I am so pleased with my Libratone TOO speaker! It arrived at my house two days ago, and I haven't stopped playing my music through it since I opened it up. I previously had a very small, very poor quality speaker that I used to stream things through, and I cannot believe that I settled for it! As soon as I heard the crisp, clear sound coming through this little guy, I was so excited! I love the color and shape of it, as well; it really does pack a punch, and the 360 degree wrap-around speaker allows for sound to travel throughout the room, even at lower volume. I cannot wait to take it to college and play music with my friends in our dorm and outside on the grass. Can't wait to see what Libratone comes out with next! I will definitely be purchasing more of this company's products in the future.
