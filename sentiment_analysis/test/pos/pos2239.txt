The most low maintenance fitness tracker ever made and it's gorgeous.CLIP & GO: It's so easy to clip on and go about your day. I've always had a hard time remembering to put on my Fitbit. Half the time, it's at home on the charger. What good does that do me? Also, this doesn't get in the way of anything, because it's not bulky. When I'm at home, I typically just clip it to my shirt and forget about it, and then I sync it from time to time.THE PERFECT ACCESSORY: I am not a jewelry person. At all. I wear earrings 25 percent of the time, and that's it. So, this was more of a fitness purchase for me than it was an accessory, but it turns out, I wear it more as an accessory than anything. It's my go to. I was a little hesitant about some of the reviews saying the LEAF was too big etc. but it's literally the perfect size, and it's gorgeous. I decided to spend a little extra on the rose gold because I typically wear gold tones, and I just fell in love with this one. I've already gotten so many compliments on it!NO CHARGING!: This is what really sold it for me. NO CHARGING! It doesn't die after 5 hours!! I have SO MANY things I already have to charge constantly, I wasn't ready to invest in something else that has a charger. AND, when your battery does finally die after a bajillion year, they give you the cutest little screwdriver to use that comes with the package.EASY SET-UP: I literally had to pull a tab to activate the battery, install the app, and sign up using Facebook. This maybe took 45 seconds.THREE APPS IN ONE: So I used to have a stress reliever app, a "red club" monthly tracker app, and a fitness app, that took up space on my storage for my phone, and like every other girl out there, storage is hard to come by. So LEAF made it easy to downsize my app library, which was a lifesaver.I wear this all the time and love it. Such a great buy.
