Disclaimer: I don't drink a lot of pre-made iced coffee so my review is based on little to no comparisons to other companies. But based on THIS product alone, I like it. I had to be sure to use only the best add-ins like: If I used those small Nestle coffee-mate creamer pods (singles) you can get at hotel continental breakfasts or at conventions/meetings etc, I didn't like it. But, If I used real refrigerated whole milk and added refrigerated creamers, mixed in this coffee, add ice and shake, they were really good. If I used lowfat, or "mock" creamer, it wasn't as good.I bought a 2pk at first and a 4pk later.I gave it 4 vs 5 stars because it doesn't have a dark, robust flavor. It's more of an average coffee flavor but that's not bad but it's not great. Overall it's a 4 star iced coffee.
