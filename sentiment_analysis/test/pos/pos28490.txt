We have had it for about a month now and are very happy with it. The  installation was quick and easy (well, my son-in-law did it but he says it was quick).  It fits inside the door over the existing deadbolt.  To open from inside you just turn it. It rel;ocks after two minutes.Hardest part (and not very hard) is downloading the software onto yourms full of groceries so much easierr phone.  We are Android phone users and experienced no problems.It makes arriving at the door with arms full of groceries so easy if you set it to open when you are near it.
