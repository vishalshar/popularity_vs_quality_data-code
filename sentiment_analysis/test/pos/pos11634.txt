This doesn't work as well as I thought it would for my creamer.  The first try I had way too much come out so have to remember to shake it out gently but looks so much better than the container on my counter.  May use it to store rice instead once I open a new box and try it because of the ease in pouring it to measure.  May try a syrup dispenser for the creamer instead.  Lid fits on securely and snaps tightly so is  really a great idea for the jar I got at a dollar store.
