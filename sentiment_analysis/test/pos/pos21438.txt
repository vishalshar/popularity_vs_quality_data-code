I bought this case as an alternative to a Lifeproof case for my husband. He's hard on phones - hence the lifeproof. But it became a hassle for people to hear him clearly or for him to hear the person on the other end of the phone. No, this is not a full body case, but I feel like it has great protection anyways. Husband LOVES the magnet feature, he can attach it to his toolbox or whatever piece of equipment he's working on so its easily accessible.Have only had it a week, so time will tell how durable it is, but so far so good!
