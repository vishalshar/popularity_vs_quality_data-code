A winner in home security ease. I walk you through the setup, app and all the features **see the video**.  One of the immediate things you nice about the Remocam is the sleek look. With the pan and tilt, night vision, audio listen/talk and alerts I hoped it would be easy to use and set up. I was not disappointed.The setup is so simple as I show in the video.  Unlike others )where you connect to the camera with bluetooth or wifi, enter wifi info, let it connect to the wife then you reconnect and use the app) the Remocam simply reads a QR code, grabs all the wifi and other data and the app sees it.  Within a minute in our test.The camera has great HD quality. The audio worked well both ways and the ability to trigger an alarm sound from the camera is fantastic.  The night vision worked great and turns on automatically.The pan and tilt was easy to work with as long as the wifi signal to the camera was strong. I also like the motion trigger but you need to play with sensitivity.  It gave off a lot of alerts until I tuned it down.You can store video on a local micro SD card or the cloud.  Including motion triggered videos and photos you take with the app. That is an awesome benefit. There is also line in and line out ability included as we show.  The 256 bit encryption takes care of securing the traffic for you so no one can spy on the video feed.The app also has the ability to control other devices in the home.  A great extra bonus. We had one app update while testing and it stabilized a connection issue we had encountered.  We had no issues otherwise.Overall thanks to Remocam for seining this over for discount.free review.  it does not affect our ratings ever (see our profile for proof).  This camera just performs exactly as they say.
