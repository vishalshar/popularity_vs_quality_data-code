I've been diagnosed with celiac disease and am really careful to eat gluten free. But I do like my sweets, miss butter cookies until I found Ginnybakes. Light, crunchy and really tasty without any after taste, I am glad I took a chance with these. Although wonderful when first opening the package, I find that they turn soggy in a couple of days. Not certain if it's the cookie or Hawaii's humidity. Might be both. Regardless will buy again.
