I've been looking for that initial feeling of when I first got my iPhone back in 2007. Although it's  not as impressive as that,  this phone offers a special personality that I can't really explain.It is very stock Android,  but with enough backend tweaking that this phone runs beautifully.I've had several phones most all top tier and this phone meets every expectation.  The camera is not as good as my wife's S7,  but for hard core daily business use this phone is excellent.They also spent a lot of time designing the audio quality plus unique sounds that remind me of the iPhone where I could understand all of the notifications.I did call support for one question and they were terrific.  After that call I realized that they are building a community around their customers so I expect great things to come.If you are a power Google Apps user for business I highly recommend this phone.  Mainly because it's quick,  perfect cut and pasted funtions,  plus dialer,  calendar and email modules just fly.I find the screen really nice too.
