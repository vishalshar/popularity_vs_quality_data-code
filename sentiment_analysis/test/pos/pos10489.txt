I am a person who has a hard time getting comfortable when sleeping on a plane and raditional U-shaped pillows did not give me the support or comfort I needed.  Because I was going on a 13-hour flight to Europe (with one stop) I went to a travel website to research pillows as I wanted to ward off jet-lag.  Once I double wrapped the infinity design over my neck I was in comfort heaven!  When sleeping on planes my head tends to tilt to the side or forward, putting a strain on my neck.  No matter the angle my head was supported with the right amount of firmness. I took it off to support my back while eating and propped it against the window so I could lay on it. It helped to cancel out white noise and kept me cozy during a chilly flight,  I love this pillow so much that when I realized that the pillow in my hotel room was inadequate I augmented it with the Infinity.  It is a bit bulky but, it was worth it and you can compress to get to a manageable size using the strap.
