This is a very clever, useful product. It does take some practice! I find it extremely effective for the calves, and placed on a bench, works great on the front lower leg. The video tutorials are excellent. Take the time to watch them because there is so much more that this item can help with. I'm still getting used to it but it is helping me greatly already.
