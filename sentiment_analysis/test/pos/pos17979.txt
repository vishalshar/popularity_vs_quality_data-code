Blows Stickum out of the water. I play anywhere between 5-10 flag football games a week which takes quite the toll on my gloves. I throw a drop of Grip Boost on before every game and they are good and sticky as new. A little goes a long way with this stuff and there is no need to use a large amount.I would recommend this to anyone wanting to restore the original tacky feel to gloves. It's far exceeded my expectations and I will purchase again.
