Great little mic for the price.  Wanted to go with the better sounding Rode Videomic Me but so far 2 that I ordered have an intermittent buzzing sound when filming. With the Dead Kitten you can order separately you can definitely filter out a lot of wind noise that would normally ruin my videos.  Would like to see it a little bigger so it has better sound and some kind of way to secure it in place on my phones because sometimes it can sag down when recording.  Other
