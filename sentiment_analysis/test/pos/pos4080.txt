I've had this for a few months and so far, I've lent it to two clients - I run a dog sitting service - and used it on the bolters and the runners that I take care of. I came across this on the collar of a husky that I sat and asked what it was. For me, the ability to track the dog (and one cat) that are left with me to take care of, is straight up worth it. It buys me peace of mind and for my clients as well. It's a lot easier to find an animal if you can use GPS to track it, then waiting for the animal to show up at a shelter and if it's microchipped, be scanned. In a manner of minutes to maybe an hour, instead of who knows how long. At least one client turned around and got one themselves.So, it's a probably just shy of a pack of cards, sized module that you snap into a set of clips that clip into place - securely I might add - on your animals collar. The clip is not easy to get off, but the module itself is. I haven't had it fall off at all, it's remained securely in place. You take it off to let it charge on the supplied base, then slide it back onto the collar. Takes me about an hour to charge it. When I'm not actively using it, it sits in it's charge cradle.Where the cradle is, there's a radius, if the collar go outside the radius you get notified (Depending on your preferred method) and the option to start tracking. I've found that the notification can happen anywhere from 15 second after the dog left the radius to about 5 minutes at one time. There's been no real consistent time frame, but it's been short. As for the actual tracking, I enabled it on all three, the app, texts and email. The app is by far the more reliable one to me, because it shows on a map and actually fairly accurately. I forgot to turn it off on my dogs collar, we pulled out, three minutes down the road, my phone lit up like Christmas and showed the block we were on and letting us know that the dog had left the radius of the base and could be located around this area. We decided to just roll with it and track the dog (In the car with us) and it worked. I would give it 20 seconds and refresh it and the indicator would show (within the block) where the dog/car was. There is a button on the module that if you now you are leaving the base, will silence it for a set amount of time.The app itself is useful. I split my time when dealing with the Whistle between the app and the website. I don't like - and this is why I dropped a star - that I have to contact Whistle, to get a profile removed off my account. I accidentally made a duplicate of my own dog, and I can't seem to change the name or remove it without contacting the company. Which is a little ridiculous. I can easily remove the whistle from that dogs profile, I do a great deal of things, but not that which seems a little redundant. There are half a dozen other features relating to activity and the like that I personally could really care less about with it. I know the activity my dog is getting, so I pretty much ignore that aspect of the Whistle.The base cost of the tracker is what you see here - if you know someone who has it already, hit them up for a referral and you can actually get it for twenty bucks cheaper through Whistle directly and they'll get a free month of the tracking for the trouble - and then there is a few different packages of tracking that you can purchase with the cheapest being ninety-nine a year. You can have multiple device on an account, but I don't know if the ninety-nine is per device or per account. That you might have to ask. If you have a runner, someone who likes to just leave the property and take a wander or like myself, run a small pet sitting service, this provides the peace of mind and I can get back a runner as if it never happened. As my business grows I'll likely be grabbing a few more but for now, this one is just right.
