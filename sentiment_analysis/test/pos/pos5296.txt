AMAZING!!I don't often write Amazon reviews, but feel impelled to as Feed and Go is epic! There are lots of automatic feeders out there but none quite like this. I chose this one because it allowed me to feed my dog wet food, which due to his sensitive stomach is the only food he can eat. Plus, it has an awesome webcam... who doesn't want that right!? Here are my thoughts specifically.***Setup:***Simple. Plugged it in, hit the wps buttons and it connected to my wifi.***How I've found using it:******Webcam***I've been using Feed and Go for a few weeks now and I don't know how I lived without it. I'm out at work for around 8 hours most days and I've started using the feeder to check in on Mackenzie. On my phone I just head to my account and turn on the webcam. I have it pointed towards the door (where he always waits for me) and I can check he's ok. That feature alone is worth the money.***Schedule***I've been feeding Mackenzie a strict diet for his sensitive stomach. Feed and Go allows me to be just as strict with his feeding time, which as you know is essential to a good routine and to help him with his IBS.***Reliable***Urgh, finally, a feeder that's reliable. We had an automatic feeder (I won't name names but it only allowed dry food so we used it sparingly) but I couldn't trust it. I would come home and the tray didn't look like he'd been fed, but as all the food was in one big box above the feeder, I couldn't even check if he had or not. I know that many times I've either fed his twice or not at all because of this! Feed and Go is super reliable, has never let me down, I can check the tray (simple) to see if he's been fed when I get back back, and the feeder also stores the schedule in its own internal memory incase my wifi goes down (not something I've had to test fortunately).***Massive unexpected benefits:******Separation Anxiety***Mackenzie love us, and we didn't realize that he missed us as much as he did while we are out the house. Feed and Go allowed us to see what we believe was the start of 'separation anxiety'. So what we started doing is adding treats to the feeder. I log into the feeder during the day and give him a treat. He hears my recorded voice from the feeders speaker and gets to enjoy his favourite treat. He's started to get used to the feeder and now, a couple hours after I've left, he'll wait for a treat! It's massively calmed him down and he's less stressed while we're out.***Medication*** Mackenzie had to take some antibiotics 12 hours apart and Feed and Go allowed me to be exact with the feeding times. Winning.***Text Message** Quite often I have to stay late at work. When I don't, I love to feed Mackenzie myself (for dominance / alpha and simple love) and can do so by hitting the unlock button and then the feed button on top of the feeder). But when I'm running late, at work, or time runs away from me, the feeder feeds him, and I get A TEXT to let me know he's been fed!! So awesome.So, get one, you won't regret it!!
