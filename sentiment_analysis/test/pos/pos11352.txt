I thought it would get destroyed in a month, based on other's reviews, but it hasn't. Not that I do that much walking, but it saved my old shoes, whose soles were already destroyed. It took some time for them to settle in, like maybe a week, but afterwards it was like wearing new shoes. Very comfortable on your bear feet and eliminates most if any of the smell.
