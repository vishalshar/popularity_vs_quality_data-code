Finally  after years of buying various listening devices, this Libratone One Click is the best Bluetooth speaker Ive owned. The design of the speaker is like a self-contained carry case. You can connect accessories (which are included) to create handles and hanging hooks to listen anywhere. Fits right in on a bookshelf, kitchen counter, towel hook in the bathroom.The touch volume controls are in a cool design. The makers of this product really kept the simplicity in mind. Port cover in the back keeps everything hidden. I have the graphite grey model, but the red and caribbean green ones look pretty nice too.The sound is really full with a good amount of bass. With previous speakers, Ive never been satisfied with the range of sound. But now with this Libratone, Im getting good sound in any room where I put the speaker down. Ive always thought it would be cool to have a fancy outdoor sound system for my backyard patio area, and now I feel like I instantly have one. I can place the speaker wherever I want it out back, even hang it up out of sight, and now I have big sound outdoors for parties or gatherings. Love this speaker! So glad I got it.
