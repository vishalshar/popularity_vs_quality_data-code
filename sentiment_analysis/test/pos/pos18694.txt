5 star product, hands down.  Most accurate tuning I have to ever used.  I have a ton of fancy tuners and most are ok.  Roadie is way past ok.  It's fantastic and I am guessing I have only scratched the surface.  One word of caution though: this works best with a good tuner.  I have older guitars like Harmony's and Silvertone's that have rough tuners.  Roadie doesn't have enough torque to move them.  It isn't a problem as Roadie works flawlessly on any guitar with a decent set of tuners.  This is definitely a new way of tuning and one I really like.  Absolutely worth every penny!
