It arrived two days ago. solid; I liked it. Here the problems:- fan noise ( it works for a second and stop in a second. You hear them all. Like a torture.)- Touchpad is not good enough. It is hard to move your finger on it.- 15 inc. Too big for school. Think again before buying.- Not the best for gaming. you can buy something better for the same price.Overall, It is a good laptop, but could be better.
