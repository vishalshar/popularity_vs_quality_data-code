I prefer the tea tree oil wipes from the body shop.  These work and do leave you clean but are a bit TOO wet for casual post workout freshening.  I need 5-10 minutes to stand around naked or a dry towel before I can get dressed.  I think I'll save them for camping when I can't shower but need a thorough cleaning.
