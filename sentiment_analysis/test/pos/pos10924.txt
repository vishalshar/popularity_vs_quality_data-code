THIS IS A LIFE CHANGER.  My cat is 13 years old, and I love him dearly.  He used to cry for a long time before breakfast and dinner.  Ever since I bought the Feed and Go, our lives have changed!  He doesn't cry for food anymore, and I can sleep in for the first time in 13 years!  (It's the first feeder I've ever kept because my cat was able to open previous ones.)  I did have a hard time setting it up b/c of the wifi situation, but if you email the company for support and provide your phone number, they'll call you back quickly.  The woman I spoke with was very friendly.
