I have a pure Bengal cat that likes to go behind the shed, jump on the garbage cans and then over the fence. I install this containment fence and he stays in the yard. Worth every penny.  I still stay outside with him but if I have to run in the house for a minute ,it feels good to know he will be outside in the yard waiting for me.
