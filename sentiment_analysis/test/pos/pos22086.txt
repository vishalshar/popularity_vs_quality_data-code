-Charged completely in about an hour; full charge lasts a little over a week.-Easily synced with my Android device and have had no syncing issues.-Step tracking seems accurate.-Sleep tracking is a little off - I know I wake up in the middle of the night but it is recorded as light sleep. But it doesn't record me sleeping when I'm not in bed as others have noted.-I like the vibrating alarm function.-Easily fits my teeny tiny wrist.
