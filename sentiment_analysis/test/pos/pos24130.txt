I have the P3 advanced, I ordered these PolarPro DJI phantom 4 filters. THEY DO FIT. I haven't shot with them yet,  I just got them about am hour ago, but have the other "snap on" PolarPro ND filters and they make a tremendous difference. These filters do screw on flawlessly(without operator error ? of course) however, they do have a "lip" on them you can see in the pictures. This makes (at least mine) the gimbal lock not fit around the lens, like it does the stock lens. So, instead of moding my current one, I suggest and did order the PolarPro gimbal lock for phantom 3. I will add photos when I have more time. Hope this helps.Thanks - luxury drone
