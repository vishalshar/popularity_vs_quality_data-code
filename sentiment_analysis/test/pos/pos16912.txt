I have lots of trouble finding ear buds that stay in place while running.  I have wasted a fair amount of money trying various over the ear and in the ear products.  This product fits and stays in place better than anything else I've tried to date.  You get two pairs for $10 and the apple earphones that come with the iphone have far superior sound to anything else you're gonna get for $5-10.
