I kill every plant I look at, and yet these are growing STRONG! It doesn't take up a lot of space, it grows fast, and it creates a plush, green, beautiful look in your house! We have a pretty dark apartment so this little bit of green really seems to make it look cheery and nice. I think what I like about this best is that it is so incredibly easy to use.
