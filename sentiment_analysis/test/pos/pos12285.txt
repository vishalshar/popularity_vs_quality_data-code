Ever since gold toe went down the drain, I've been seeking a new source of excellent socks. These are the best I've found by far - they're a good fit and keep your feet the right temperature.They have one odd downside - I've had some sets of these for around 5 months now, but they still shed after I wear them. I always find sock lint in my feet when taking them off. I'd hoped that would become less of a problem with use, but so far no luck.So, they're excellent socks, if you can live with the sock lint.
