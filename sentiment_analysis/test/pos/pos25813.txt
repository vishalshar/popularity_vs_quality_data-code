I live abroad and purchased these for my niece and nephew so we could stay in touch more easily (as well as their grandparents who live across the continent. So far, they seem to be a bit. A bit challenging for the kids to sort out how to use them at first, but they're on the younger end of the age spectrum for these toys. The voice messages are super cute, so that's a huge plus.
