The August Smart lock is an easy to install door lock that replaces the inside half of your existing door lock. Requires simple tools and setup takes about 10 minutes.I was completely blown away by how dead simple the set up was. I choose this device because I didn't want to replace my original keys but still have a smart lock. You can tell from the setup August really thought long and hard about the install experience. The smart lock requires 2 AA batteries and even after a few months the batteries are still going strong.There are two versions available and I have the one that includes Apple's HomeKit connectivity. Which to be honest is a bit wonky and fails more often then it works.The August Door lock also includes a companion app, that allows you to control the door lock, and add virtual keys for guests. Adding virtual keys is a bit of a weird setup with most of my guests requiring help to complete the process which takes away a lot of the cool factor.The app only works when in Bluetooth range of the lock but a separate hub or Apple HomeKit will allow you to control the lock when away from home.The Apple HomeKit integration is the only failure here in my mind. The lock rarely works with HomeKit or Siri and it can be frustrating to setup. This limitation may have more to do with Apple than August and should improve with firmware updates and HomeKit updates.Setting aside the HomeKit issues the lock is near perfect and works great with August's own app.Pro: Easy setup and works great using August's app.Cons: Setting up Virtual keys isn't as smooth as I hoped for guests. HomeKit integration is a long way from perfect.
