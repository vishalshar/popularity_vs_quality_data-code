Installation was fairly straightforward (well, as straightforward as with any switch). It is deeper than your typical switch so you will have to tuck the wires further into the switch box. Also, be sure to confirm you have a neutral wire at your switch box because this will not work without it. My neutral wire managed to come loose and the switch just kept restarting every time I tried turning it on. At first I thought I received a faulty unit until I opened it back up and noticed the wire hanging outside the wire nut. So, needless to say, the neutral wire is essential to it working properly!I love that it looks like a typical switch compared to my old programmable switch. It fit in the standard 2-gang wallplate without any modifications or adjustments (see attached picture). The notification lights are not bright enough to distract you (at least in my experience, they are not any brighter than my previous switch's lights)I did have some difficulty getting the Wemo app to discover the switch during initial setup (which is why I'm docking off one star). Turns out that the Wemo Switch is picky regarding which channel your wireless router uses. I had mine auto-select the best channel (and it chose 6). However, once I manually changed it to 11, it picked it up right away and I was able finish the setup process. If you have a WIFI extender, I would recommend disconnecting it during the initial setup. This way the switch (and app) doesn't get confused with multiple similarly-named SSIDs. Hope this helps anyone having similar setup issues that I experienced.
