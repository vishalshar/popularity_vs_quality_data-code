I am a Apple user and have been for a long time and I have many Apple products.  For the price of this phone, I thought I would give it a try.  Very good product.  Nice screen size for this 66 year old man.  The sounds have a nice loud volume and can be adjusted even louder.  Very fast response time when looking things up on Google.  Pretty good battery life.  It comes with a case to cover the back for proction and a screen protector.  The ear bugs look and work as well as what you would get with Apple phones.  I had to contact POSH support on a matter (operator error) and they got back to me the same day.  This is my second day of using the phone and I am very happy with it.  It won't replace my Apple iPhone but it has some features that work well on the job site that beats the Apple downloads.  Buy any of the POSH products and I am sure you will be happy.
