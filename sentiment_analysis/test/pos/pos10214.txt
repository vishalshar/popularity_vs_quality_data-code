It's not bad. In fact, it's pretty nice. I'm giving it 5 stars because even though I'm not pleased with how my 7" Garmin is working with it, it's no fault of this product. The only reason I'm disappointed is because of where the micro USB charging port on my Garmin is.. on the bottom.. Which means  keeping it plugged in raises the right side of the GPS slightly higher and the left side is hanging. I'm eventually going to be buying a piece of Styrofoam or something to shape it and raise the left side to even it out.No fault of Garmin's either because it wouldn't have made sense to put the charge port at the top if you weren't going to put it in something like this.. Just be forewarned if you were trying to do what I was! Oh, regardless of the unevenness, it holds well without shifting at all and has been for a couple months already. Doesn't seem like it's going to break at all; very sturdy.
