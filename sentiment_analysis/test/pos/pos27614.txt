Finally, a digital thermometer that works! According to my last 5 digital thermometers (oral and ear type), I'm in a constant state of hypothermia and should be dead with a temperature of 94 to 95 F. I've had constant problems with digital thermometers- the biggest issue is that I get readings that are artificially low and undependable, plus the batteries are always dead when I need a thermometer the most. One time, a brand new digital thermometer said our son had a temperature of 102 F. That's high, but not so high as to freak out. I took him right away to the doctor anyway because he seemed so ill and was stunned to learn his fever was actually 104.5 F.  A traditional oral thermometer works, but it takes too long to get a reading when you have a sick kid, plus it's hard for me to see the temperature (especially at night) as I'm getting more far sighted.The Kinsa Smart thermometer is priced reasonably, so I decided to buy it and give it a try. I downloaded the app and easily set up Kinsa on my iPhone 6s (that runs on iOS 9.3.2).  Kinsa is fully compatible and gives a fast, accurate reading that's easy to see on my iPhone display.  The morning after I set it up, I took my temperature and got a reading in about 10 seconds of 98.2 F.  I went to my doctor the same morning, and the doctor's office got a nearly identical reading of 98.0 F.  Kinsa seems spot on and is easy to use, and it requires no batteries. Plus, the price seems fair at under $20. I suggest getting it set up for each household member (it can keep track of multiple people) before someone gets sick as setup takes a few minutes. I'm more than satisfied with this purchase as Kinsa gives a fast, accurate and easy to see reading and is also priced reasonably. I definitely recommend the Kinsa Smart thermometer.PS: I bought MABIS disposable probe covers to keep the germs off the Kinsa. They're a good fit and so much easier than having to sanitize the thermometer after each use.10/02/2016: Kinsa still works great after updating my iPhone 6s to iOS 10.0.2. I've had no issues and am still 100% pleased with Kinsa.11/16/2016: After upgrading my iPhone 6s to iOS 10.1.1, Kinsa is still working perfectly.
