The bottle is really well designed and is cool to bring around. I have only had the bottle for a few days and I love it. You do feel a lot cleaner letting it sit with both sides open and washing both sides with soap and water.My only gripe is that both the top and bottom are pretty narrow so it is a little hard to get your hand in with a sponge to clean.
