These are amazing! And my kiddos love them! Plus, plus!! I have to admit, I like the peanut butter ones better than the chocolate covered ones! They were packaged great and no messy melted product! The ice packs were a plus also, way to go! (And I'll reuse them in my kids' lunches!) 5 stars! Also, I mean get add... You are selling them for a better price than I got one bag for at the grocery store!
