I was looking for a mascara that does not come off easily, and I came across this mascara.  I read all the reviews, so I knew it was not going to be a dramatic mascara.  I am happy with it.  I have very light eyelashes, so the subtle tint to this mascara is nice.  If I want dark lashes, I will use a different mascara.  And the mascara does not come off on my skin as much as other brands do, so I'm happy with that, too.  I don't know that my lashes are any nicer or more nourished or whatever, but that's not the reason I bought it.So it is a very subtle mascara, and doesn't readily come off on your skin.
