We purchased these for a family reunion to ensure that all of the younger swimmers had an extra source of protection. With over thirty children at the reunion, all with various levels of swimming experience, this device was VERY helpful to ensure that all children were safe when at or near the water.  The devices have various settings from non swimmer to beginner and even goes off if the child gets too far from the base (an added safety feature when at the coast or lake to ensure they do not get too far from shore).  We had lots of adults watching the children at all times but having so many little bodies in the water at once it was comforting to know that if any child was under the water for even a second too long we would know.  It brought great peace of mind because even in the very best and most attentive circumstances, nothing can happen faster than an accident! A child in distress doesn't always look like a problem at first.  Knowing we would be able to respond immediately if there was an issue made the reunion much less stressful. This was worth every penny spent and got five star reviews from all 20 adults in attendance!
