I flipping love this immersion cooker. (I DO love my husband more, so marriage is out of the question.) It was my one super cool purchase from the "glorious" collection of Prime Day specials, and I feel like I truly did get the best deal. For the price, this tool has tremendous value, because it really performs. Salmon is beautiful sous vide style. Chicken is tender and lovely, pork carnitas are the BIZNAZZ, and I have made the best tri tips of ever, all time, with this little gem. I simply put it in a vacuum seal bag with a little seasoning and butter, vacuum seal it, (You can use Ziploc bags too!) and put it into my large stock pot with the precision cooker. I let it cook for SIX HOURS as I went about my day, then took it out, and gave the outside a  quick sear in a screaming hot cast iron skillet for a nice crust, and... [wipes tear] the result was a stunning, tender, juicy, perfectly medium rare steak. It was emotionally stirring. I still have a bit of a challenge with getting eggs just how I like them using the precision cooker. It's probably because the outermost part of the egg white has more water, and fewer proteins, so it cooks slower, and always comes out runnier than I care for, but holy crap, the yolks are so gorgeous. I am very much looking forward to having my world rocked with other dishes by my little sous vide friend. It has swiftly become a favorite cooking tool in my house.
