I love my leaf! It's definitely more accurate in counting my steps than anything else I've used. Some devices you can shake and it counts that as steps this one doesn't its very accurate in its step count. I also love how it tracks my sleep and I don't even have to remember to press a button to say I'm sleeping(I would always forget to press it before sleeping with other devices). It knows when I sleep and has helped mon it or it so much. The breathing exercises are also really great to use when you are stressed. And one of the best things I love is no charging!! Great product.
