Doesn't include an SD card, but an SD card is required to operate. While a minor detail, a real pain in the neck for something that would cost them nothing in bulk. Also, My particular unit would not home in Y axis due to the internal endstop cable being ever so slightly unplugged. Even though the factory put a red locking compound on the connector, it was pulled hard enough to slide the entire thing (shell and all) off the pins. No big deal to me but probably a huge problem to anyone not familiar with 3D printing, endstops, and basic error troubleshooting- and none of that would be covered in any support manual. I saved them money by not shipping back for such a simple error but it did require unscrewing the cover on the base unit, examining the wiring, and pushing the connector back on. Hopefully a one in a million fluke.Again, you cannot print anything without an SD card, but it's not included. Any typical 1-32GB SD card will work, formatted FAT32.
