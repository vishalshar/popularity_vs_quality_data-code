I've always hated the 2700k color temperature of incandescent lights and the 3000k of halogen was only a slight step up. On the other side of home lighting was the blue and cold temperature of florescent lighting. I've always wanted something in between but it simply didn't exist. Not only that, I've always wanted a light bulb that would allow me to change the color temperature. During the day when daylight is coming into the home is when the 2700k color temperature of incandescent lighting seems most offensive to me and that's when I prefer a higher color temperature of 5500k but at night I prefer something closer to 3500-4000k. For something warmer, like a candlelight dinner, a 2700k color temperature is appropriate. When I'm reading, I prefer 4500k.A light bulb that gave me this type of control was all a distant dream before LED bulbs like the Philips Hue bulbs broke into the scene. The Hue bulbs though, seem too expensive to me and too dim as well. The Hue bulbs have the added benefit of not only being able to change their color temperature but also their colors. That's a neat feature but more of a neat trick than something that's actually useful. Lifx also makes a color changing bulb that doesn't require you to buyer a starter pack with a hub and 3 bulbs like the Philips Hue's but those are still too expensive for simply being light bulbs.What I really wanted was a light bulb that was cheaper and brighter than the Philips Hue or the original Lifx bulb and that's exactly what we have here with the Lifx White 800.In a way, it's the light bulb of my dreams but its not perfect. There is an added complexity to them because of the smart features and if you are using iOS (iPhones and iPads) then you should be fine. The iOS application is mostly solid. Occasionally I have to manually turn the light bulbs on and off to get them to respond to the app but mostly they update and work flawlessly.If you are on Android though, you may find these bulbs frustrating to use. The app for it is half baked and although I have updated the bulbs through my iPhone 6, my Nexus 7 tablet continues to ask me to update the bulbs but fails each time I try. Then the bulbs become unresponsive to the app and I have to turn the bulbs on and off again to have them respond. This happens on iOS too but its very infrequent, on Android I feel like more often they don't work.It seems to me that Android has a large user base so I would hope that Lifx would work harder to take care of this demographic, they are only hurting themselves by getting Android users a half baked app but that seems to be the case for a lot of Android apps when compared to their iOS varients, but I digress.I love these bulbs but I do have a couple of wishes.1. I'd like a physical remote. Using my phone to control the lights works well but I'd like a physical remote to control them. Call me a Luddite but in a day and age where we can't get away from looking at LCD screens, I'd like to have something tangible to control the lights. Yes you can still turn the lights on and off from your wall switches and these lights do retain the brightness and color temperature you had set them too, but I'd like to do all of this through a physical remote control.2. Please list the CRI of these light bulbs. CRI is a basic lighting statistic but it's mysteriously missing from the specification sheet. I'm guessing the CRI of these light bulbs is low and that's why Lifx has left it out. I've looked at a number of objects and comic books under the lighting of these bulbs and I have no complaints about the quality of light. That may just be me though. I am sensitive to the color temperature of lighting but I may not be as sensitive to color accuracy.Overall these light bulbs are excellent but Android users may want to stay away unless you'll be happy with setting the light bulbs brightness and color temperature and sticking to a wall switch to control them with only the occasional change up. I should also note that while I have not had any issues with the size of the bulbs, they are much larger than regular A19 bulbs so fixtures with tighter spacing will not accommodate these bulbs.
