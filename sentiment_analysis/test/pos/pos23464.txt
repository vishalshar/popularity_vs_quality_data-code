So, I am not pregnant, and neither are my two school aged daughters, but I buy this multivitamin.  I give my kids a half dose of these. Here are the reasons I like this multi:1.)  K2 is the type of K that is needed to properly use D3 and calcium, hard to find a multi with this best form of K2.)  Methylfolate is the bioavailable form of folate, upwards of half of the population has a genetic anomaly that keeps them from turning the manmade form called folic acid into the usable form of methylfolate.  Inability to properly use folate can lead to a huge list of health issues.3.)  MethylB12 is the is the bioavailable form of B12, upwards of half of the population has a genetic anomaly that keeps them from turning the manmade form called cyanocobalamin into the usable form of methylcobalamin.  Inability to properly use B12 can lead to a huge list of health issues.(if you are reading this and have never heard of MTHFR please google it now and read up on it)4.)  NO chromium.  Chromium is a toxin, studies on chromium were done in rats which do not always translate into humans.  It is theorized now that the way that chromium works in balancing blood sugar is most likely a reaction of the body to the toxin, the body uses energy (glucose) to deal with detoxing the chromium and the use of energy is what brings blood sugars into balance.5.)  NO manganese.  Manganese is a toxin and there is no real proof that manganese is a necessary micronutrient for the human body.6.)  All natural colors and flavors etc.7.)  NO iron.  Iron is necessary and it is estimated that iron deficiency is actually quite high among the population.  However, iron blocks the absorption of so many micronutrients that it needs to be taken separately of many micronutrients.8.)  NO calcium.  Yes, calcium is necessary, but like iron, calcium blocks the absorption of so many micronutrients that it needs to be taken separately of many micronutrients.9.)  Omega 3.  Just handy to have it all in one place.10.)  Stearate free.Here is my only problem with my using this as a multi for my kids, I feel the B12 is too low.Here is my problem with this as a multi and why I cannot take ANY of the SmartyPants products.  I have Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis and though it may sound counterintuitive I have found out the hard way after three attempts at taking different multi's with iodine in them that iodine causes my TSH and TPOab numbers to go up and it gives me a goiter.  Humans really need only a small mount of iodine and it is easy to get enough iodine from food.  The USDA recommends an iodine intake of 150mcg daily, 3oz of shrimp has 35mcg, a cup of milk has 56mcg, 3oz of cod has a whopping 99mcg!  Even one egg has 12mcg of iodine.  To take 150mcg of idone in a multi is just excessive for anyone.Here are my wishes (I hope SmartyPants reads this!):1.)  I wish that Smartypants would reformulate all of their products so that ALL of them have methylfolate.  Right now ONLY the prenatal has methylfolate, all of SmartyPants' other products have folic acid.  People with the MTHFR genetic mutation should not take folic acid.2.)  I wish that SmartyPants would reformulate to be iodine free or at least offer one iodine free version.
