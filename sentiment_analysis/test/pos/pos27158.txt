My husband hates when his coffee cools off, so these lightweight lids are perfect. The heat suctions the lid to the cup providing a vacuum to keep contents hotter longer. I pop one in a baggie and keep it in my handbag for when we eat out and have had so many people ask "Where did you get that!" Buy 2 sets and make a friend!
