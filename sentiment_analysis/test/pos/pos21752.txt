I was a little wary of buying from a company in China; and doubly so when the bike arrived with a manufacturing defect (an imperfection in the seat post meant we could not lower the seat).I reported the manufacturing defect to their customer service team, which sent a brand new bike without hesitation, problem fixed.  That's the nature of my 5* review because I expected hesitation or even some condescension that we were installing the seat wrong.---Update: my 3 year old kid loves riding his bike, he does it all the time.  He's become fast enough that I had to buy myself a bike to keep up with him.My only real complaint - I think the redundant "back-pedal" brake is not necessary.  He sometimes accidentally activates it when he is coasting down a hill.  So, now he coasts down hills with his feet off the pedals.
