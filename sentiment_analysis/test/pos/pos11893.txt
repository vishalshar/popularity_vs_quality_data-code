Prior to order I stumbled upon a review for this on youtube and I knew I wanted to try it. I purchased this for my sons 16th birthday. I currently own a note 5 phone and the same brand vr - My son has a fire phone and wanted a device that would work with his phone. After receiving the merge, I feel good about this purchase. His phone fits good, it works with google cardboard. He says its more comfortable than my SamVR. It does not have the same touch controls but the trigger button works well. I wish the price was less - its actually $10 bucks more than the current price for SamsungVR but only because there is a price drop due to a new model (you know, the new model for the recalled phone)  So far I really recommend the Merge VR
