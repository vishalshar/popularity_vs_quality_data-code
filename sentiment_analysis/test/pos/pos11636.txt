Allowed me to turn a 20 cent mason jar into a portable drinking device.  I can't wait to use it for smoothies!  The condensation will be an issue but I can live with it.  The cap itself is well made and expands the life and options of mason jars.  A super idea!  I'll have to pick up some more for my pantry.
