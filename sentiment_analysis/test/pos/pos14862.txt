These are a great snack for those who are trying to eat healthy.  There is no added sugar which is a plus and these are very crunchy.  The fuji apples are sweet enough without needing added sugars and/or sweeteners.  I would give it 5 stars but there is a slight aftertaste that kind of remind me of a can of SpaghettiO's for some reason.  However, I would definitely order these again.
