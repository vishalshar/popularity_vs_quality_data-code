I bought this for my mother, as she wanted to start growing more herbs in the kitchen. It's a nice little system, easy to setup, and works almost entirely on its own. All you do is click in the pods, add water to the reservoir and plug it in. The light goes on and off by itself, giving the seeds and plants all of the light and heat it needs. When the plants get growing you move the light up another stage, of three total. Since the system works as described, I couldn't consciously rate it much lower than 4-Stars.The real issue I have with this system is the price of continual use, specifically, the replacement pods. They are needlessly expensive. For example, the price for lemon balm is $19.95 for a three pack! I can get the seeds themselves from any garden store for a dollar or two. My plan, when mother is done growing out her basil, is to empty the pods and refill them with Rockwool or some other seed starter, and drop a few seeds of lemon balm, thyme, or chives and see how well the system works then.
