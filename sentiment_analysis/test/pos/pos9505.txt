Works just as advertised.  I actually plugged it in the extra cigarette lighter outlet in the back of my SUV so it doesn't clutter the outlet under the front dash.  It notifies me each and every time I park and leave my car.  And with the LED light, it gives ambient light in the rear of my SUV; bonus!
