This review is for the 3 color temperature probe.Included with the steak thermometer are the instructions and the power on cradle.This cooking thermometer is one of the most unique and clever little devices I have ever seen.  This brand makes other types of probes for a specific cooking temperature but unless you cook everything the same way, I am not sure that I see the practicality of a probe that only detects one wellness level.  I have used a variety of cooking thermometers from the probe stick in and check once in a while type to the corded leave the probe in both wired and wireless types and both those kinds of cooking thermometers have their pros and cons in terms of their use.  One of the biggest cons of the probe type is that you cannot leave in the meat while cooking and although the cable type can be left in, the probes tend to easily fail due to the fragility of the cord.  This device is neither of those and sort of both at the same time.  This is a stainless steel probe that can be stuck into the meat and left in the whole time cooking as it can handle very high temperatures.  I was actually quite surprised at how small this cooking probe is at less than 3.5 inches in length. The device is small and lightweight but feels very well made.  On the surface this device looks simple with a metal probe with one LED light at the top of it but really there is some clever technology in this.  For one, there is no power switch on this.  This is powered on by placing the probe into the bottom section of its stand and it magnetically activates the battery that is inside the probe.  The LED light flashes indicating it is ready to be put into the meat.  This automatically shuts off after a period of time if it is not being used, so make sure the meat is ready to be put on the grill before you activate the probe.  Depending on the wellness level you want, this changes from green to yellow to red with flashing indicators to let you know it is getting close to that wellness level and double flashes when it reaches that wellness level.I have found that this works best on thicker cuts of meat and because it is a probe that must be stuck most of its 3 plus inches into the meat, some meats that are thinner or odd shaped, such as chicken legs are pretty difficult to use this with.  In reality, this is best suited for use with steaks more than other types of meats.  The indicators seem pretty accurate in comparison to my cooking thermometers that display a temperature.  For me, I have found that this works best as a supplement to my regular probe thermometers to alert me to check all my cuts that I am cooking as I do think this is a bit pricy for one probe as you can only use on one steak at a time unlike regular probes both cable and stick type that can be pulled out of the meat and different items can be checked.  This indicates that this can be used 1000 to 2000 times before the battery is depleted.  Granted that is quite a long time but there is also no way to replace the battery on the inside once the batterys lifespan is done.  One of the things that concern me the most is that this well-made, well-engineered device has no warranty information indicated in the instructions, the makers website or on the Amazon page for this thermometer.  Is this an oversight, I dont know but with no indicator of a warranty usually means a 90 day or less warranty, which I think is disappointing considering the cost of the SteakChamp.ProsSmall, lightweightWell madeClever engineered deviceWorks well with determining wellness level of meats, specifically steaksCan be left in the meat while cookingLED light indicates wellness level accuratelyLong 1000 to 2000 use lifespanConsPricey for one probeOnly works for one piece of meat at a timeNo warranty information  (UPDATE:  I have been contacted by the manufacturer and told that this has a 2 year warranty.  I am glad to see that this was just an oversight in the instruction manual.  Hopefully they will update their warranty information in future printings of the manual.)Mostly limited for use with thick cuts of meat, works best for steaksCannot change batteryEven with some limitations, I think this is a pretty neat device.4 starsI was provided a sample in exchange for an honest review.  I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.
