I heard about this from my friend and thought it was cool to try with my dog. I have a Yorkshire Terrier who can be quite mischievous when nobody is looking (i.e. paw his way to the trash/get to food on table), so this allows me to spy on him while I am out. The camera works surprisingly well but works best in natural lighting so I would put it in room with windows or skylight. There is some lag in the feed but improved when I moved it closer to my router. FYI you have to download a separate app to access the feed and you can talk/listen to your pet. The speaker is pretty good, I tested it out in the other room and my voice rang out clearly. There is a laser function as well but my dog hardly notices it, probably better for cats. Through the app you can add others to access your feed as well so is was pretty cool. The best part is that I can watch my dog while I am at work and it is very simple to set up. I do wish that the cable was a little bit longer so I have more options on where to position the cube. I got this in rose gold which looks really nice.
