My dog loves these treats, and she is very picky when it comes to her treats. Originally I was looking for something kind of chewey, these appear to be crunchy, which is fine with her, she loves them. They were three times as much at a neighborhood pet store in my town, so I was excited to find them here for a reasonable price. I will continue to order them from amazon.
