I have to preface and say I do not like mushrooms so this was a leap of faith purchase. I have read about the medicinal properties of Lions Mane for Nerve growth and wanted to try it. So the 4 star vs 5 rating is for the not yet seeing any benefits of using lions mane after 3 weeks. The product itself is conveniently packaged in individual pouches and is easy to make a drink.
