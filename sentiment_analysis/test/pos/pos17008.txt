I just replaced a dead Harmony 900 with the Elite. I loved the Harmony 900 but was annoyed with a few things that are fixed with the Elite. The 900 would send two clicks instead one for some apps on the Roku. You couldn't customize Activity images with the 900 and the 900 was fairly large. The 900 was also cumbersome to update on the desktop. Glad to see all that fixed/added with the Elite. I never used the keypad so I don't miss it. I rarely watch live TV but when I do, I use the guide to find channels. Also don't miss the dedicated Skip buttons. I don't have a need for the hard smart home buttons on the bottom so I wish they were somehow more generic to allow customization that would remotely make sense. Battery doesn't seem to last as long but I put it back in its cradle nearly every night.Love being able to use my iPhone and iPad for updates and customization. The UI is pretty intuitive and with a few exceptions, pretty efficient. I tend to use the remote 99% of the time though during viewing and would prefer an on-screen qwerty keyboard on the remote rather than having to get out my phone if I want to type.Very happy with this purchase.
