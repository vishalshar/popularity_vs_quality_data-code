This has been a miracle cream for me.  This is the ONLY non-steroid cream that has actually worked on my severe eczema!  I have eczema on my hands and before using this cream I had to use steroid creams a few times a week to control the crazy itchiness and the terrible rashes on my hands.  And I'm talking about potent steroids, a weaker Desonide didn't even work for me.  My hands were horrible and it was an embarrassment to have to shake someone's hand, knowing how rough and scaly my hands were (I'm a woman so I'm supposed to have soft hands, right?).  I have tried other natural eczema creams and though they have worked on my kids, they never did a thing for me.  Until I discovered MeraDerm!  I have been using this cream for about 7 months now and it keeps my eczema and the uncontrollable itch under control.  I very occasionally use steroid cream to bring my skin back when the eczema starts to get really itchy but I've only had to use steroids a few time since starting this cream.  So once every 2 or 3 months!  A huge difference from 2 or 3 times a week!!  I use this quite often throughout the day, probably at least 5 times a day.  I notice a difference when I don't use this as often.  My hands will start to get more itchy.  My skin on my hands is still not perfect but it is better than it's been in years!  My eczema really flared up when I had my first child 4 years ago.  This has been such a lifesaver.  Those with severe eczema know how terrible it can be, the uncontrollable itching, the unsightly rashes, the pain from cracked and bleeding skin.  I also use this on my kids for any random rash that I see and it clears pretty much everything up in a day or two for them.  This started to heal my hands in a few weeks of using it at least a few times a day.  I am hooked and I hope this cream will never stop being produced!!  I also use the hyper-moisturizing cream from MetaDerm and it is more moisturizing but it sometimes flakes a little on my skin if I rub it in too much.  I bought the large bottle of hyper-moisturizing but will buy this regular one again when I go through the large bottle.
