Item arrived prior to estimated date.  Good quality product.  This strap has the quick release tabs that connect to camera and then you clip the strap to those tabs.  I however, don't trust any of the quick release tabs, therefore, I made a modification of adding key rings to the camera and then clipping the strap to those rings.  I am pleased with the purchase and would shop with this seller again.
