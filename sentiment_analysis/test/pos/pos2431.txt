This system is a life-saver, literally!  After, a close call on the ladder painting window sills while juggling my bucket and brush I decided to a Google search for paint bucket holder. I was hesitant it try it but am very glad I did.It keeps the bucket very stable on my hip and the magnet allows me to keep my brush from going in all the way to the handle.The lip around the top stops spills and I would definitely recommend it, makes painting less messy in general and safer on a ladder.
