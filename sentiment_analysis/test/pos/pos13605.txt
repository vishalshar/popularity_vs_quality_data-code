I am completely blown away by the rachio. The only comparable experience I have had is installing my first Nest thermostat.I had no idea that there was a controller like this for a sprinkler system. Even though I *probably* could have installed the weatherproof enclosure myself, I got cold feet and hired a sprinkler contractor to do it. Once the rachio was wired up, I added it to my WiFi network, and was up and running. The contractor and I walked around to the zones, and did the software setup. After defining the zones, the task of setting up the schedule was almost anti-climactic. It suggested a 3 day schedule, which is exactly what I was going to do anyway. The entire process took 1 hour and 10 minutes: 50 minutes for the contractor to remove the old Hunter Pro-C controller and install the weatherproof enclosure, and 20 minutes for the rachio software setup.The price of a rachio is less than half the price of a conventional sprinkler controller like Hunter and RainBird. The biggest benefit of all is that I could never really figure out how to program my old Hunter Controller completely. My wife is the gardner in the family, and she didnÂ’t even try to learn it. She would just call the landscapers if she wanted a change in the watering cycles, and they would come out and do it. To run a manual cycle on a single zone, she went out to the valve box and manually opened a valve. Now she has complete control of every aspect of the sprinkler system right in her iPhone: Magic.
