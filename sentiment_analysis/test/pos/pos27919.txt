I wanted a microwave that had 4+ stars, was spacious enough for my large dinner plates, and was around $100. I went to Sears, and the Kenmore microwaves that they had that were big enough were priced way more than I wanted to spend and felt cheap -  the doors jiggled and the control panels looked like worn-out children's toys.I got this microwave from Amazon, and it hit all of the criteria I wanted, and more. Under $100, spacious, all the normal control features, and it looks and feels expensive, with high-quality construction. Best of all, it runs incredibly quietly! I told my roommate that I was using the microwave for the first time, and she was like, wait, right now?? She was standing just outside the kitchen and had to come in to see it for herself, because she couldn't hear it. The only thing I would want to change is that it continues beeping even after I open the door, but so did my last microwave. I'm very happy with this purchase!
