I'm using this to control amplifiers in a whole house audio setup, and it works great!  The app is simple enough, and I was able to get IFTTT set up very easily.  The programming is a little wonky (I had to do it a couple of times), but it works and you only need to get it set up once.  It's also very cost effective, giving you 2 individually controllable outlets for about 40% less than a single Belkin outlet!
