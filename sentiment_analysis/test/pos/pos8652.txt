Really like it... it works WAY better than Tile and TrackR. A little on the sensitive side... but I'd have over sensitive than none at all!Shake to find phone, phone has option to find keys or other Chipolo items.Chipolo Plus is out now so that the unit has a button to find phone. May try for that one to avoid movement of keys setting off phone.Regardless, GREAT and effective unit
