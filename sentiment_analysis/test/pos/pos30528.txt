We own 13 of these now, and I LOVE them.  The ONLY issues we had were with the original release of the firmware, which had a few issues connecting to SOME access points.  Once the firmware was upgraded, no issues.  And one other issue where the battery went dead within a few months.  However, on that occasion, Roost customer support actually contacted ME and informed me of the issue before I had a chance to contact them.  They PROMPTLY sent out a replacement battery, and now everything is working great!  Of the 13 batteries we own, 9 are installed at one location (two of those are in CO2 monitors), and the other four are installed at my mother's house.  They are all registered to me though, so when my mother burns her toast, it lets me know and I can call her to make sure everything is truly OK.  We love these things!
