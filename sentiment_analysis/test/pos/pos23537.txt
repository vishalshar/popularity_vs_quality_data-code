I bought this phone mount/holder as a gold box deal, and I don't regret it. Fortunately the CD slot is located at the very top of the audio system panel on my 2012 Subaru Outback, and the panel is at the top of the center dashboard configuration. When this holder is installed and my phone is in it, none of the controls for the audio system are blocked, and very little of the display is obscured. This configuration also means that the phone is held slightly above the level of the dashboard. My phone is connected to the car's bluetooth. When the phone's in the holder I can just glance quickly at the phone to see the caller ID when a call is received, which helps me decide whether to answer or let it go to voice mail. The mount itself stays put in the CD slot after I've turned the knob to get it set in there. However, my phone seemed to flop a bit when in the holder, until I realized I could tighten the tension adjustment (turning the slotted round disc located behind the phone). Now it sits tight.EDITED on May 14, 2013 to add: The other day I finally posted a photo in the "customer image" collection, that shows this gadget holding my phone, mounted in the dash of my Outback. I'm still using it, and liking it.I've also figured out that if I flip the holder around to a horizontal orientation, it will hold my Garmin Nuvi 1350. However, I have a beanbag nonskid type dashtop holder for the Nuvi and will probably continue to use that, and keep this Mountek gadget for my phone. I rarely use the Garmin except for road trips and the beanbag holder is easy to stash out of sight when I get out of the car, without removing the Garmin first.
