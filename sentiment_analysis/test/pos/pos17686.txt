These vitamins are awesome. I used to assume that a vitamin was a vitamin, and all of them were made equally. But that is definitely not true, and these vitamins are way above the others I've come across.These are probably the cleanest vitamins out there... They taste great WITHOUT the added sugar or other junk that some vitamins use. And as a guy who doesn't worry too much about being "healthy", it's great to have an all-in-one, chewable gummy to get a lot of the vitamins I might miss in a day. They're not big, gross herbal pills that are hard to swallow. It's like you're eating a few fruit snacks, but there's no catch--they're just good for you!They're for sure worth the price, and are a simple and easy way to keep your body healthy. Buy them, take 6 a day, and don't look back.
