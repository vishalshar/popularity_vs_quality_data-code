I bought this for my boyfriend since his macbook air was constantly running out of storage. This was easy to install and worked perfectly to give him more storage. He did have to move some files off his laptop to make room for the installation, minor inconvenience for someone who already had no space left, but it was worth it to increase the storage space but quite a bit. The card fits into the slot on the right hand side of the laptop, we never use that anyway so it will not be missed, it is the same silver color and fits in perfectly, not even noticeable. I will probably purchase a second one for my own laptop soon.
