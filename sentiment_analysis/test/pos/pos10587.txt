I received the Cube a few days ago and started playing with it right away. I was actually surprised at how small the unit is. I first tried it with a micro SD chip and it worked great. Pretty good light output for such a small unit. The image was very good up to about 60-70 inches. It was still acceptable up to 120 inches but was a little less sharp. My android cell phone did not have MHL capability so I ordered an adapter for Apple so I could use my Ipad and Ipod. When I hooked up the adapter to my Ipad and the Cube, it worked right away. I just selected External Devices from the main menu and the image was projected.  I am an aerospace engineer and am not easily impressed, but the RIF6 is a remarkable piece of technology for its size. I do have one suggestion though, since many customers have Apple devices it would be very convenient to have an Apple adapter as part of the package. . It is so convenient to just bring this small projector to a presentation rather than lug a large traditional lamp projector.
