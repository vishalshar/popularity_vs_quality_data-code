I've been using it a couple of days and it's so useful. I can watch Netflix in the kitchen while cooking, I also used it to view a recipe while baking (photo shown). I created a blog post video easily by slapping it to a window. And of course, I've used it several times to take selfies. I even stuck it on the ceiling while freezing cherries yesterday just for fun for an areal shot. It sticks really well to glossy paint. Not so good on flat paint though so watch that. So far I've stuck it to windows, cupboards, glossy paint, stainless steal, my microwave, and the ceiling (which is also glossy). I press it firmly into the surface, give it a little test pull to make sure it's safe and restick it to use as needed. Pretty easy and fun. I already dropped my phone a few times and the case seems really durable which is good. I think it's a great case for the money and really genius.
