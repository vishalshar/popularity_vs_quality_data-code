Style 4.5/5: Compact, not overly huge with a matte / pearl finish doesn't leave finger prints. The color changes slightly with the viewing angel for an oil / pearl look which is very nice. Reminds me of my Sennheiser Momentum Over Ear headphones.Comfort 3/5: Initial clamping force is quite strong on this and I don't consider myself to have a large head. Clamping force is arguably more than my Klipsch Mode M40 which were notorious for its clamping force. After breaking them in, it does become comfortable clamping pressure. Also ear cups are rather small for a "over ear" style headphone. Prolonged usage can be uncomfortable and they do get hot since the cups are made of a pleather type of material. Headphone length is adjustable and sit on a ball joint to allow for different ear angles.Functionality 4/5: Easy to drive w/out an amp and it does what it's supposed to do. Bluetooth pairing is easy. I've tried multiple times on several devices (Samsung Note 5, Note 10.1, and iPad Mini) with no problems. Reason for a 4 instead of a 5 is the lack of the ability to connect to multiple devices at once. Devices need to connect one at a time so you can't have a device dedicated towards music and the phone for phone calls. It's just one device which may not inconvenience some people but my entire FLAC library is in my tablet (which as a better DAC) to save space on my phone and save battery life. Simple and straight forward design with Power On/Of, Volume Up / Down, Play/Pause/Skip, and an app launcher which works quite well from what I've experienced so far. App also indicates battery life which is nice since the headphone shows no status of battery life and also comes with a burn in track. Does not have Active Noise Canceling (ANC) which is fine since it passively seals very well.Sound 5/5: The sound quality is crisp, clear, and very enjoyable. Sound band seems to lean more towards neutral in these headphones and sound similar to my PolkAudio Ultrafocus 8000 but not as neutral and clear as my AudioTechnica ATH-A700X. Highs aren't shrill and lows are adjustable via the bass switch which is an excellent feature to have when playing different genres of music. Songs that emphasize vocals I would keep on low bass. Classic Rock, 70's/80's Funk and Jazz I keep on medium bass and Dubstep / Progressive / EDM of course are high bass. Bass itself isn't very punchy and doesn't have a hard impact to them. Bass is defined and not overpowering or muddy but still instills the feeling of immersion. There are some cases where I wish the bass was a bit more punchy in high energy music, like with my Mix Master DJ headphones. These headphones seal very well and do not suffer from excessive sound leakage. Reason for 5/5, the bass mode selector. Instead of using multiple types of headphones for a different genre or loading a different EQ setting, a switch is all it takes.Build Quality (4)5/5: Steel design, strong and flexible but curved points that join the headband body to the driver section seems to be a stress point. Will have to wait and see if that area becomes a problem.*May or may not be important information for others*MK802 Sound and functions compared to owned / tested wired and Bluetooth headphones:*Each headphone have been burnt in and spent a minimum of 100 listening hours over different genres.
