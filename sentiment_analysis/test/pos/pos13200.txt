The Pet Loo has been a great purchase, easy to assemble and fairly easy to train our pup to use it. Note, we use this outside on our balcony, not inside as designed for. One design issue is that the turf slides around. We fixed this easily by applying velcro around the edges of the box and the turf. All-in-all it's a great product.
