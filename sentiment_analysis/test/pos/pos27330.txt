I have an 8 year old black lab. He has been eating a brand recommend by his vet all his life.  My masseuse recommended I try this food for him.  When I opened the bag it has a wonderful aroma, I thought about trying some...his former food smell like grain, straw sort f smell.  The thing I noticed right away were his stools.  They were no longer hard, dried up and hard to pass,this food made them look healthier and easier for him to pass.  He just gobbles up this food.
