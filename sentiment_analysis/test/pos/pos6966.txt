A very affordable complete system as long as you have a smart phone which is required for the app that will display your tire pressures.  You can actually check your tire pressure from inside the house with the range these have.  And if you need to replace batteries (which happens with all tire pressure sensors!) these are the simple nickel sized wafer types that you can buy anywhere.  No need to replace the entire sensor!
