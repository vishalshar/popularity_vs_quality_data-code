I am a dedicated, loyal and committed Blackberry user, perhaps in 'denial' that the BB era is almost passed away, slowly. I therefore wanted a secondary phone that could keep me in touch with various apps (no longer available or working on BB) needed for daily business use, a world phone I can use while traveling outside the country, and at the same time still keeping my BB. My next objective was to get the best of price and functionality. The POSH Ultra max 4G LTE L550 meets my need. The screen size 5.5' and surprisingly a battery life that can last me the whole day with normal use was well worth the purchase. I am very satisfied that it did not come with many bloated apps or installation from other branded phone. The phone is fast enough for me, though I notice a few/couple seconds delay in some of its operations (opening of apps, email, etc).The front facing camera is very minimally adequate with some lag, but auto-focuses. The rear camera is fairly decent, but not great. Bluetooth works as expected, though the android to android transfer at phone set up did not work as expected, it gave error. SIM card works seamlessly, and calls are fine. It detects the 4G LTE easily on T-Mobile network. Call quality is fine, sound is acceptable. Dual SIM card is a great value, though it is not clear if the second SIM takes the place of SD card. The instruction is not very clear in the accompanying manual. I am using a T-Mobile sim and a 200GB SD card, and the phone recognizes the SD card's capacity. Phone came with screen protector and transparent case. Great value for money. The operating system is Android Marshmallow 6.0. I am not sure if one is able to upgrade to 6.0.1 because it does not detect any update.Overall this is a great budget phone. My only concern was the microUSB cable for charging uses a long pin (the charging slot is deep within the phone), no other microusb cable I have can work. I got in touch with POSH tech support, and they shipped out to me a spare charger. That was great customer support. Their response was within a few hours, and they are ready to make sure one has a great customer experience. I would have given a 3 stars, but for great customer service, I give a 4 star.For the price, and the quality, this is far better than many other phone of its price range. I recommend this phone if you are looking for a budget phone that works, and give you good 'estate' for your buck.
