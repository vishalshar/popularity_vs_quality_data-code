I'm one of those people that HATES top sheets. I also hate changing my duvet because it's annoying to get it off, wash it and put it back on again. Enter Simplified Bedding: This makes it so easy to have a layer between us and our duvet cover that's also easy to wash! I don't get tangled up in the sheet either! It's great!
