I would give this 5 stars, but after wrestling with WeMo & tech support trying to link this to my Amazon Dot, it was brought to my attention it would never link with Alexa because it isn't "officially" a WeMo product.  In spite of the fact that the WeMo app controls it perfectly.  This knowledge would've been helpful going in to this purchase...
