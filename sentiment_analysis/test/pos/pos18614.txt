Quad Lock is a company that came up with the most fantastic idea. One mounting system across all your platforms. It's just incredible.I've used Quad Lock's armband for several months now (twice a day, 5-6 days a week) for any of my general physical activities. I wear it to the gym and on runs. I have the QL bike mount, so that's not a necessity for me... needless to say, I love this company and the products that they offer... so why only 4 out of 5 stars?It's the velcro. The band is wonderful and fits even larger sized arms, but the velcro wears out over time. You can make certain adjustments so the velcro fits on different parts of the band, but it just wears out over time. I hate having to spend thirty dollars every time I need to replace the armband, but simply by the elegant nature of this product, it's still worth it.If QL fixes the velcro issues in a future version of this product, it would easily catapult it to 5/5. I currently own and use three different Quad Lock mounts (armband, bike mount, and car mount) and I think they're wonderful. The best part is you're not limited to using their cases if you don't like--you can get a universal adapter (which is the route I have taken. I put it on my Lifeproof case). This lets you change phones with ease of mind, knowing you don't have to get a new mount every single time you change a phone! All you need is a new universal adapter, which is way cheaper than replacing many different components.
