Feels very soft, not crinkly at all. I finally got a good night sleep as I did not need to wake up and check if my toddler rolled over his smaller mat. We have not had an accident yet,so  cannot  say anything about waterproof part. Will update the rating if it ever leaks. Will definitely but  the same cover in twin once my son upgrades to  a twin bed.
