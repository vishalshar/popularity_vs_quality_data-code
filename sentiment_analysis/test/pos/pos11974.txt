So far it's my favorite sugar substitute. It can cause some digestive issues if you consume to much. I would start out slow and build your tolerance to it. Has zero after taste, and a cooling effect in the mouth (nothing like a peppermint though). NOTE: I've ordered this 3x from Amazon and the bag had burst at the bottom seam. Amazon quickly refunded my item, and the company contacted me and sent me a 2lb bag which arrived unaltered. I think that maybe the bag has to much room in Amazon's box and banged around too much. The company said they were in the process of repackaging the item.
