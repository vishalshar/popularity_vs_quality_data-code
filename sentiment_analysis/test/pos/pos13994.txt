I have heard nothing but great things about Mionix, and wanted to see what all the hype was about, so I purchased the Mionix Propus 380 mouse pad. Having a good mouse is definitely important to PC gamers, but having a good surface is also important.  The Propus 380 mouse pad has a hard, yet flexible tracking area, with a smooth silver-metallic plastic coated surface to ensure optimal tracking.  The bottom of the pad has a rubber base which allows maximum grip on table.  The 15in x 10.25in or (380mm x 260mm)extra wide tracking area makes it the ideal surface size.Needless to say this mouse pad is exactly what I was looking for, and cheaper then what I expected to pay.  Brilliant design and cheap, that's why I gave it 5 stars.
