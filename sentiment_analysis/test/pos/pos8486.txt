The scale works really well and looks slick. First couple of readings were inaccurate but after resetting it worked well ever since. The scale needs the additional feet that come included in the box to stop rocking from side to side, mine didn't come with the extra feet but Qardio offered to send them for free, but I have been waiting for a month.
