It's been about a week since I've gotten this chair and it's exceeded myexpectations to be honest.  I've used many regular office chairs so thisis my first gaming chair.  I have definitely loved it so far.  Setup waspretty easy - instructions were clear and I didn't need to use instructionvideo. There's plenty of posture support for all angles when I sit on thischair.  It's comfortable when sitting upright and in mi-recline when I useit for gaming and Netflix-ing.  The head cushion was a nice touch andprovides good support.  I actually didn't/don't use the back cushion muchbut it's very nice feel when I listen to music in a reclining position.Overall, very pleased with the product and I will update if anythingchanges.
