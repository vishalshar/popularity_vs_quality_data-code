We bought this leash for taking our dog canoeing since we don't trust his recall and wanted to make sure he stayed with us.  It's long enough that he can swim and/or walk far away and explore while we still have a good grip on him.  I especially liked that the rope floats so it's easy to see and won't get tangled in his (or our) legs.
