I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He's been so involved in computer games lately that I wanted him to actually have an incentive to play outside. Since he first started playing Futchi, it's hard now to actually get him to come inside...even in the rain! I like that its making him more social as well, he's starting to be more confident and also inviting over a lot of friends. If only Futchi came with a lifetime supply of BBQ because we're going to need it for all these kids...
