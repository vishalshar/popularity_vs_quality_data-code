I have a high arch and 9 out of 10 shoes I put on hurt. I go to a speciality running store and get fitted and pay $160 for shoes and they still hurt. They laced the shoe laces different ways and just wasn't helping much at all. I found Hickies when I bought another pair of shoes after searching online. I absolutely love them! I can workout every other day for 90mins and I'm not getting blisters or pain in my feet anymore. I'm actually on to buy another set to see if my last pair of shoes just needed these in the first place. I use the website and watch the videos to make it a loose fit and thats what I needed.I have bought another pair of lacing set before that the running company sells and they hurt too much. They work for my husband, but not me. I recommend these to a lot of family and friends who have high arches or just pain with their tennis shoes.
