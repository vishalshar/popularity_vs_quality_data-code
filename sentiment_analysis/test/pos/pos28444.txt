For the last four years I've really liked the Brainwavz Delta IEM Earphones, which I bought after CNET rated them "best buds under $30" or something similar.  I really like them -- great sound (I thought) plus incredibly comfortable.  But I decided to try these out of curiosity, based on the rave reviews (at that time all 5 stars) re outstanding sound quality,  As much as I like the Brainwavz, after carefully listening to and comparing several songs, from classical to country, I must say the sound quality on these is definitely better.  From bases up through the high notes, the notes just come through terrifically clearly and distinctly.  Based on first impressions I still like the Brainwavz better ergonomically -- they are easier to grip from the back and also may stay in my ears better for exercise - just an impression and I'll update this review after I've tried them a couple of times.  But any other time, for great sound quality these will be my go-to buds.
