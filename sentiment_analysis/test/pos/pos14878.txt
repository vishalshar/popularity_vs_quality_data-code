I bought this for my 10 year old Grandson who lives across the country.  I get regular videos of him with his latest creation!  I love that he has so many options for invention, even with this base kit.  But I can see that I'll need to support his inventing habit with more kits, which is fine by me!  So much better for him than video games, etc.  And he enjoys it so much more!
