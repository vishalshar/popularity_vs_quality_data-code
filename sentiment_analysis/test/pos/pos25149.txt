Somehwat small on my large wrist. Better suited for a small man or average size woman. But since I wear long sleeve shirts, I am not complaining because sleeve doesn't bind anymore like with my previous analog watch. My other issue is the ghosts steps. Definetly not for the super jocks, but perfect for the person looking to be reminded you how USELESS you have been all day. Between the Apple Watch and the Withings Steel, I prefer the Withings better. I don't need all those bells and whistles.
