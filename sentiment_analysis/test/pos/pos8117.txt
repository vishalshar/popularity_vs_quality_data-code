I have been looking for a new office chair for quite a while.  I came across these chairs in my search.  After reading about the product and the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I have had the product for a few weeks now and I must say I am really happy with it.  I work from home so I sit in this chair all day long, and my back feels so much better.  The height of the chair makes me sit up straighter so I do not slouch as much- which is what will cause my back pain.  It also has the back cushion which really helps my lower back.In addition, to the comfort, it's really a stylish chair and the color goes perfectly with my newly remodeled office.  I would recommend this chair to anyone looking for style and comfort.
