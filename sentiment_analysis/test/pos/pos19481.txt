Customer service is top notch. I emailed the seller and he responded within five minutes. Shipping was immediate. It is so refreshing to be able to purchase a well made product from the United States with superb customer support.This case is one-of-a-kind. I used to have the CM4 card case for my iPhone 5s. Love being able to ditch my wallet. It did well holding three cards but the cardholder would stretch out and I would always have to keep three cards in at all times. The design of this case is stunning. The real wood backing is a showpiece. The sewn on cardholder is elastic and will conform to any number of cards that you put in there. I keep 4 in there at all times. I think you can probably put six cards in there without difficulty. While this does make the case a bit thicker in overall dimension, I have found this to be of benefit. The side of the elastic cardholder actually gives me something to hold onto and I can now text on my iPhone 6s with one hand! This is probably one of my most favorite benefits of this case. Prior to having this case, I had a difficult time texting with one hand and when I did, I would get hand cramps in trying to do so.I have varying sizes of the lightning charger for this phone. My larger diameter ones do not fit. The Apple branded cables as well as ones that are only slightly bigger made by Anker fit just fine. This is the only downside I see to the case.Overall, in terms of phone protection, the case is a bit slim. However, there is a knobby texture on both sides of the phone which is me much more grip than the naked iPhone did. Not sure how much protection case would afford if you were to drop it on the floor. But from other reviewer's, it does seem to hold up pretty well.In summary, this is a high-quality case that you want to show off at all times from a company with excellent customer service and it is actually made in the USA.
