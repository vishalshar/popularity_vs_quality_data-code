Had a fitbit which had constant sync issues and popped off and disappeared while on a crowded train.  Bought this as a replacement and I really like much better than my old fitbit.  Here are the PROs: Never charge it (expected 6 month battery life), fully water proof - I shower, swim, kayak with it on and never take it off, reliable - it syncs first time every time which is breath of fresh air from my fitbit.  It's easy, unobtrusive and good looking.  CONS: A VERY VERY minor issue, cylinder has a sharpish edge that can scrape a little while showering if I move my hand the wrong way.
