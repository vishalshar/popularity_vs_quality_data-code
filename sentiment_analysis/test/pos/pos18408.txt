I bought one of these for my wife's tool bag because the picture shows they are pink.  I don't know if they come in different colors or someone is being deceptive, but the one we received was a bit on the orange side of red.  Anyway, she really likes it because it keeps her from guessing about all those different size hash marks and what they mean.  It's accurate so I like it too.
