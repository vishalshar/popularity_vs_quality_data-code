Fixed my USB cord and my MacBook Pro adapter cord so easily. Better than ANY kind of tape! Sugru dries to a strong, yet slightly soft plastic-like consistency. I don't know why cord manufacturers don't use something like it to strengthen joints - oh wait a minute, yes I do - because the cords wouldn't break as easily and we wouldn't have to buy new ones so often. You don't get a lot of product in each packet but definitely enough Â– I used a whole packet to fix my computer adapter and another pack to fix two USB cords (see photo). Will save me lots of money in the long run.
