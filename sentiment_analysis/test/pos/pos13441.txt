I was very excited to come across these snacks.  The fact that they are nut free and say so on the front of the box makes our son feel safe and happy.  I spend hours in grocery stores reading the back labels, I wish more snacks did this.  The mini chocolate chip cookies are delicious, we gobbled up the first box in one day.  I can't wait to try the other Skeeter Snack offerings and hope they make it to stores in California someday.  Thank you Skeeter Snacks!
