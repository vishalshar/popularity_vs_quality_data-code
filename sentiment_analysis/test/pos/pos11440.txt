This was my third drone purchase in about 8 weeks, having purchased and returned 2 DJI Phantoms because of defects right out of the box (see my review). Well, the third time was the charm, since there were no defects and I had my X-Star Premium flying on the same day that it was delivered! The aircraft was easy to set up, the documentation was comprehensive and clear and everything worked perfectly, right out of the box (which is actually a very nice quality carrying case). The X-Star Premium is easy and fun to fly and appears to be reliable and sturdily built. To be honest, I was tempted to buy the Yuneec Typhoon H Hexacopter, but I was leery about spending another $1400 after my experience with DJI.  After having flown the X-Star, I am convinced that I made the right choice, since it does everything I need it to do (as a first time drone owner) at a price that is $500.00 less than the Typhoon.  I would highly recommend the X-Star based upon its ease of set up, ease of operation and its build quality.  I would also recommend that it be purchased with a set of propeller guards and at least one spare battery.  Incidentally, unlike the DJI Phantom, you can charge the controller at the same time that you charge the drone battery.Lastly, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Autel Robotics' Customer Service.  The primary reason I bought the X-Star Premium (apart from its high ratings here on Amazon) was the fact that its customer service is based here in the United States and is available 24/7.  I called customer service twice, to ask a question,  since purchasing this drone.  Both times my call was was picked up almost immediately and both times my question was answered cheerfully by a friendly and competent representative.  A far cry from what I experienced with DJI.
