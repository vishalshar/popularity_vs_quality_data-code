My 9 year old has resisted anything robotic for years, but having something he could control from his iPad made this "The Coolest Christmas Present."  We have used at home and taken it to the park (using a Hexnut cover.)  He really enjoys all the pre-programmed routines the Sphero goes through, and likes to show people when they come to the house.It has gotten a lot more play when we used stuff around the house to make a course for it.  (small boards for rails to focus it on the ramp each run, a length of 4" PVC pipe to jump into, etc.)At the park, we were mainly limited to pathways and other smooth and only slightly hilly surfaces.  We have not tired water yet, but that is high on our list for next adventures.
