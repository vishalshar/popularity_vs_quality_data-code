I purchased my Cubii through their direct site several weeks ago and I could not be happier. Everyone at work is talking about it and trying it out. Such a great investment in personal fitness equipment!It definitely has some weight to it, but I was able to carry it into work easily. I put it together in minutes and it is so discreet, most people don't even know I'm using it. I can get 3 miles in a day while still working at my desk. My job restricts me to a desk for up to 8 hours a day, Cubii allows me to keep my legs moving and burn calories without sacrificing work time.I also started using my Cubii while sitting on my exercise ball chair; taking my "workouts" to another level. The 8 resistance levels are also a great feature, if I will only be able to use it for an hour or so I will bump up the resistance. If I will be at my desk all day, I leave it at 6 and coast all day long.This product is slight more expensive than some of the other portable exercise equipment, but it is well worth the money. Their app shows you calories, stride, distance and time for those who like to track their activity. It also links with the Fitbit app making it even more useful. If you are serious about your health and looking for a way to continue to be active while sitting down, Cubii is the perfect tool.
