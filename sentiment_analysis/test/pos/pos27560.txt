Disclaimer: I'm an IT Engineer so I can get 'techie' in my reviews..I purchased this because I really want a pane of glass window into my home, it's safety and security. However I am very very concerned with the security of IoT devices and the ability to utilize them for BOTNET or spying activity. So my deployment has been slow, measured and very very researched. One of the things I was not looking forward to was replacing all of my existing 'alarms' in the home with IoT alarms, it's expensive and time consuming. So this solved the issue relating to water/smoke/fire/carbon alarms in a brilliant way.Setup was a breeze. Plug it in, install the app on your phone, enable bluetooth and stand in bluetooth range of the device. The app will pick up the device and launch the configuration. Put in your Name, Email Address and a STRONG password. Then pair the device with your WiFi network. Once paired it will download firmware automatically in the background and re-boot the device. After that you can run some additional configurations, setup additional emergency contacts for the device, change the light/color/brightness, etc. You're finished and now you can test it.If an alarm sounds the first thing it does is pop an alert on your phone. If you don't respond/acknowledge the alert it then CALLS your phone. If you do not respond it will then call additional emergency contacts and notify them. There is a short 'clip' of the alarm sent to each person in the chain so they can verify it really is an alarm going off. At that point you determine if the fire department needs to be notified or you can dismiss the alarm and declare it as a test. The device WILL NOT automatically call the fire department, and it is illegal to have devices automatically calling them so don't even think about setting it up to do this! That's it, you can forget about the device now!Technical stuff...1) It uses ARM processors running on Debian. Debian itself is quite secure and very difficult to hack and/or install malware on. So it's unlikely this little ARM based debian computer will be compromised.2) It uses AES security for WiFi.. Use a nice complex WiFi password and SSID, remember your AES on WiFi is generated by the name of your WiFi and all common WiFi names already have keys generated to break them. However there is ONE FLAW with this device. It only recognizes letters and numbers in the WiFi name and WILL NOT connect to a WiFi SSID that uses ASCII or SYMBOLS. For example if your WiFi SSID is JH129932GHG!!! it won't even see it because it doesn't see SSID's with 'characters' in them.. It took me a bit to figure out why it wouldn't see my SSID in the home and this was the reason. So I created a secondary SSID on my access points just for this guy to connect.. Also, I recommend putting this on a AP-Isolated SSID (guest) then it cannot community with anything else on your network, it doesn't need to anyway and this increases security.3) Outbound connections on this are 443(SSL) encrypted and safe. It connects to pubnub as the API for SMS/Mobile Device notifications. It uses Amazon Cloud for Updates. Other API's are LEEO custom and it connects 443 to api.leeo.com. Security looks good and my sniffer doesn't show any problems at this point.That's about it. I actually highly recommend this device. It's sound technically, low cost and could be your first true IoT device in the home. For $50 it actually could save your life or the life of your pets. You'd know what was going on in your home while you are on vacation if there is a fire or water leak. Also, if you are asleep and your carbon monoxide alarm doesn't wake you it this would ring your phone and most likely wake you up! Also it's possible to set it up to notify a neighbor or friend, saving your life - potentially. Think about this for senior citizens! Drop this in your mother or grandparents home and have peace of mind they'll get help FAST if there is a fire or carbon monoxide leak!Negatives:The only negative so far I can find is that the humidity sensor is very inaccurate and flaky. Since I have a Sensei Thermostat I could care less about this feature. But you should know buying it that you cannot rely on the humidity sensor for any degree of accuracy.Note: As for the nightlight, it's a good feature and can be turned off or tweak how you want.
