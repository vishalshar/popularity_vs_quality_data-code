I've really like this moisturizer.  It is thick and creamy, but doesnt' feel heavy.  I wear it under my make-up after letting it absorb and it goes on smoothly. I'm more concerned with dryness and getting wrinkles, and so far it's doing what it says. Will continue to purchase as long as the price doesn't go up.
