I only have one tracker at the moment, but the app seems well designed and easy to differentiate between trackers/objects. It's smaller than my car key fob and is pretty thin so it fits easily in my pocket and doesn't feel like adding something clunky. The tracker was extremely easy to set up and the combination of audible tones and a flashing LED made finding my keys quick and easy when I used the app. My only complaint is that the tone can't be turned off manually once you have found your item, but hopefully this issue will be addressed in the near future. When that happens I'll likely bump this up to a 5
