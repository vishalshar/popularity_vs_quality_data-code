Let me tell you about this computer:1. It's fast. Quick startup, quick download, quick loading, everything is fast.2. 476GB SSD rather than 512GB, but I'm not complaining because it's a massive drive and comparable computer specs results in ~250GB SSD.3. It does everything I need it to do, from gaming to writing an essay for my college classes. It's very versatile.4. The price just cannot be beat, like at all. You will sacrifice something good and pay almost $200 more if you were to shop online.5. It's lightweight and you can carry it around, but I prefer to leave mine stationary.6. The graphics are legit. I can play League of Legends and World of Warcraft on the highest settings with no tearing or any other sacrifice. This is a great laptop, no joke.7. When doing in person shopping as soon as I told the sales associates (in Fry's and BestBuy) the specs of the laptop they shrugged and straight up said "we can't beat that; the price or the specs. You're better off buying it from Amazon." I already knew that, that's why I've been hung up on it.8. The screen actually isn't one of its cons. It does what it needs but it's no UHD.Cons:1. Please, please, PLEASE get a fan for it. I've noticed it having high amounts of heat. I'm using a cheap Belkin fan and it's working pretty well.2. 100% buy a mouse. The mouse pad is not the best but everything else about it is. Get a mouse.3. Speakers are garbage. If you want to hear anything buy some cheapie or hook it up to Bluetooth speakers. Quiet speakers. Ugh.Overall this is a very great laptop with minor annoyances. Your biggest issue will be that you absolutely need a mouse for this computer. As many other reviewers have stated, the track pad is absolute garbage. Since I'm using it to game, I needed an actual mouse anyways so not that big of a deal for me.
