So far I love this. We have Anatolian Shepherds that live with our flocks/herds, and since they're often out of sight, It's WONDERFUL to be able to confirm that they're still on our property. The only major down side is the battery life (it appears to need charging EVERY day, which is a pain, and the 'whistle zone can only be configured as a round spot - which either doesn't cover all of our property, or, if it does, also covers a goodly portion of the neighbor's pastures as well, so I don't get notified when the dogs go over there, That is a fairly minor concern though since I can still see where they are. I did buy the cover for additional security and protection of the device since the dogs are out in the pasture/woods/creek beds.
