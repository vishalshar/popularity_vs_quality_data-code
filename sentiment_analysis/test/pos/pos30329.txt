As someone with serious sleep issues, this crazy little device has given me and my doctor a whole new insight into my nightly sleep patterns.  One of the features that were an immediate plus, was the Smart Alarm feature.  I no longer wake up in a bad mood after being woken by some horrible siren, and then stay in that bad mood all morning.  The Smart Alarm wakes me when I'm in a light state of sleep with a soothing musical alarm, and I wake up actually in a good mood.The only drawback right now is travel.  I've taken two weekend trips since purchasing it, and I was unable to get it connected to the hotel internet, so I have no sleep info recorded for 6 days last month.Update ---------------------------------------------------------------------Now that I've had the Sense for a few months, I can honestly say that I still love it.  As far as I can tell, based on what I can remember from night to night, the record keeping of movement and sound while I am asleep is pretty accurate.  I have only had to adjust my wake time in the timeline once.  My doctor is pleased with the recordkeeping of the device as well, as he can now see what is basically going on from night to night without having to keep me in a sleep pod every night.
