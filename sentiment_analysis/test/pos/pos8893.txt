I've been using the August smart lock for a few days now I can give it a very solid thumbs up. I can't really speak to installation as I had a locksmith install a new deadbolt so he installed the August for me but it all looked very easy.Setup was relatively easy though it took a few tries to connect to the lock. Then it had to do two firmware updates, which took about 15 minutes. But it was all painless. Setup with HomeKit also took a few tries. Generally, it all worked pretty easily and I was up and running within a half hour. Also, it connects to my Apple TV (4th gen) so I don't have to buy the August Connect to use access the lock using the August app or Siri.As for usage, well, it just works (with one small exception, which I'll get to). The app has a big round button that you press to lock and unlock and responsiveness is instantaneous. Using Siri, it's also very quick. You tell Siri (Watch or iPhone) to "unlock the front door," it does a little searching (maybe 5 seconds). and the door unlocks. Obviously, the same with locking.As for some of the advanced features, auto lock is very nice. I just set it to always lock after one minute and it always does. As for auto-unlock, here's the exception. It just didn't work. I live in a condo and set a small radius and I could not get it to work. I looked at the August Support FAQs and looks like I may need to set a larger radius but the other problem was that with auto-unlock on, remote access through the Apple TV stopped working -- I just got an "Out of Range" error. I could play with this more but, honestly, auto-unlock just isn't that important when all you have to do is tell Siri or use the app to use the lock.As for the design, I think it looks great, especially in my condo, which is of a more modern style. I agree with some posters that it's fairly large but not in an obtrusive way and the design is striking and minimal. My only small issue relates to the finishes. I bought the silver model and I don't love the aluminum look. I think a different lighter gray (chrome) would be more universal but it's OK. Wonder if the dark gray might look better.The app itself may be a little complicated. Well, given that you open to perform a simple binary task, they should find a way to have the locking button always available no matter what tab you're in.Finally, there's the question of usefulness. I get some of the criticism about "what's wrong with keys." Personally, I find this very convenient and I no longer leave my condo, walk three blocks and suddenly ask myself "did I lock the door?" I can just check the app and of course, with auto-lock, I never have to worry. It will also be nice giving people (including house cleaners) access without having to give them a key.Overall, a terrific product.
