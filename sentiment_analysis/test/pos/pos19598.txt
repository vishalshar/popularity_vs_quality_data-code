After staring at an iPhone for eight years I decided it was time to try something new.  I followed Nextbit for months on Kick-starter and Twitter and finally decided to pounce on the $299 price tag on Amazon. It took some getting used to Android OS but I totally forgot and don't miss my iPhone and the 20% battery earnjngs I would get! I still find myself staring at the phones design and color... a refreshing take on an ocean of lookalike smartphones.
