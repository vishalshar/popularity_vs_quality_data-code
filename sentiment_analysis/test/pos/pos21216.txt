This is a very decent wedge pillow.  Very comfortable and super conforming to your body.  My only beef with it was how it came to me.  I opened it up and the zipper was not attached and there was about a ten inch portion of the seem that was ripped to shreds.  This clearly wasn't the result of issues encountered during travel so it had to have been packed up like that despite the substantial shortcomings on what I assumed to be reasonable standards of quality.  I almost sent it back but I was so amped to use it that I spent two hours sewing up the damage.  Good pillow though, for sure.
