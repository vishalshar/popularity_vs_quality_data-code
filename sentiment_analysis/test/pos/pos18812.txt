I LOVE this system amaziling for the size, watts per channel and size of speakers this system ROCKS. Im critical about my music and even though you can never duplicate as a live performance of your band, this little system is the BOMB! Puts out quality bass,  treble, radio station receiption, the remote for this system is the best you don't ever have to leave your spot of relaxing you can do anything sitting down except change the cd(you need a maid for that lol).
