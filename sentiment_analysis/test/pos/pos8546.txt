I gave this product four (4) stars (yeah yeah, I know, there's only 3 kinds of people in this world, those who can count and those who can't but allow me to explain) because it's marketed as "measuring is made more simple, reliable and accurate." But as mentioned in many of the reviews, the digital reading is definitely inaccurate by 1/16 of an inch. Not good for tackling projects that call for precision measurements such as finish carpentry where a 32nd of an inch really matters. Excellent for tasks that do not require precision measurements such as rough carpentry, drywall, plumbing, electrical or simply hanging a picture. Three major features I so love about this little device are the memory, the center line, and using the back of the tape to obtain a measurement up to the corner of a wall. Simply put, AWESOME! And so, I am compelled to give this product an extra star because it impressed me that it still works after dropping it in a bucket of water not once but twice in different occasions. I highly recommend this product and will definitely purchase a few of 'em to give as birthday and X-mas gifts to my family and friends who work in the constructions industry.
