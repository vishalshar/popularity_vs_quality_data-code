My daughter received her one light keyboard yesterday and she absolutely loves it!! she took lessons for 3 years and never practiced when i asked her too and all of a sudden she wont stop practicing to go to bed! its a miracle and i love this company for making it. I am thinking about getting one for my husband because he wants to learn too. one thing i wish could be better is if the red lights were brighter under sunshine in the living room. its not a big problem because you just have to move it out of the sunlight but still maybe they can do this for their next version.
