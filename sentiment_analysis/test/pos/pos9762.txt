The are used by my 15 son.  His complaint with these and others he has used is that they are not loud enough, in particular In his downhill ear that is catching the wind.  I think that that is a good thing, he spends too much time with headphones in his ears so at least I know he can't crank these too much.  He also said the clip often comes unclipped.  They did fit his helmet no problem, he prefers wired over wireless so he doesn't have to worry about charging them,plus the mic to use them for phone calls is a bonus.not to mention his $200 Bose wireless headphones were lost...fell out of pocket of who knows.  These are less likely to just fall out, or be left behind, and if they do get lost they are cheaper to replace.
