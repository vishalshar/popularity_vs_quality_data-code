While technically optional for an outdoor installation, you would be making a mistake not to get this. I replaced an existing Toro controller with the 2nd Generation Rachio controller. The conduits that routed power and valve control wires to my Toro are evidently standardized, because they were exactly the same size and spacing that this enclosure was expecting. The only customization necessary was the drilling of three holes in my home's siding to screw the enclosure to the house. Everything else was just removing and installing screws, and disconnecting and reconnecting wires and conduits. I am so happy Rachio has this enclosure available. I was expecting this project to be an all afternoon event involving an extra trip to the hardware store. Instead it was a straight forward half hour (15 minutes if I did it again) project with no issues at all.
