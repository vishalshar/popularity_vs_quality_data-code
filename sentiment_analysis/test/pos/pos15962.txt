As an avid coffee drinker her and somebody who moves around a lot at work I can tell you that this product really is something awesome. The Minipresso by Wacaco  does everything that it tells you that it will do witches make a great shot of espresso. With all that being said obviously there are some pros and there are some cons about using something like this. Let us start with the pros: The Minipresso  is very compact and you were able to transfer port it pretty much anywhere you want.  You can stick this thing in a lunch box in your backpack in your glove box you can take it with you anywhere you want to and that is a huge plus.  Another thing that I really like about it is how it all just kind a folds together - it's all one unit and you're not going to be losing items or anything like that. I really like how solid this thing feels.  I feel like that if I were to drop it it would still be able to function and not give me any problems. For the quality of the espresso I think it makes a very good above-average shot of espresso given for the fact that this is a manual system.  Obviously you're going to get stronger and better shots miss Bresso with an automatic machine but for what this is it makes a superb above-average shot of espresso.  As long as you follow the directions that it provides you you're going to make a great couple of espresso without breaking the machine. Do not tamp.Here are some cons: (not many) For this section I think it really just comes down to a couple things and first of which is The really obnoxious squeaking noise that happens when you start building up the pressure inside the canister.  The really obnoxious squeaking noise that happens when you start building up the pressure inside the canister.  It is an auditory distraction that takes away from the whole experience of making this really great shot of espresso.Another con that I have is that the cup that comes with the unit doesn't really keep your espresso warm for very long chill when you're on the go when you want to enjoy a nice cup of espresso it's going to become cold very quick. (that's a personal preference). My last con is going to be the price.  Now when I bought this I bought at $87.  That's a little bit steep considering that you can buy this directly from the website for cheaper At around $56.  And that's my mistake for not doing a little bit more homework on that.
