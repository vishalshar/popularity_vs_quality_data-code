I've been struggling with eczema on my face(forehead,under eyes,& near chin) for months now-as soon as I thought it was clearing up I would wake up with big red splotches. Hydrocortisone creams weren't doing anything for me and stung when I put them on. I've been using the Metaderm cream for less than a week and honestly can't believe that my eczema is almost completely cleared up. The cream leaves your skin feeling soft and doesn't sting or irritate when you put it on. I shop on Amazon all the time and usually never leave a review but I wanted people to know that this cream really helped me.
