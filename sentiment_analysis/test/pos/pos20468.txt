Can't believe how great this case is. I'm guessing I've spent a couple thousand on various cell accessories over the years and this is one of the best purchases I've made. Holds cards well (3 in my case) as well as some folded cash. Fits an iPhone 6 like a glove. Had some trouble with charging cables (Apple, OEM) falling out with the case on, but that seems to have stopped. Not a cheap case, but worth the cash..
