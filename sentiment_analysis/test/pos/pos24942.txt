Wasn't sure what to make of this towel, but the price is right and I know Grip Boost is a local business (MD), so I gave it a go.I love it! For some reason the big guys seem to make their football towels so wide - not practical for football players. I don't need to trim this down to size because it's already the right size.Plus it feels really high quality (one month of use so far). Highly recommend.
