Although a bit pricey (certainly compared to Flinstone type multivitamins), these gummies are worth it.  When my daughter was 1 I started researching multivitamins for infants/toddlers and to my horror read that Flinstone's and many other common brands you see in stores have aspertame in them!! Seriously?!  my research led me to the SmartyPants brand and I haven't turned back!  These with the added fiber really are the complete package with omega 3s DHA/EPAs from sustainably sourced fish oil, a complete multivitamin, fiber, vitamin d, and no added sugar.  My 3 year old takes 2 gummies before nap and 2 more after dinner as a "dessert/treat" and she LOVES them.  She used to take the "SmartyPants Vitamins Gummy Vitamins with Omega 3 Fish Oil and Vitamin D" until I realized there were ones with fiber and no added sugar!  She did not notice the switch at all i.e. did not miss the sugary coating and Dad thinks they taste better than candy!  The only other vitamin/supplement I give her is a Calcium gummy because she does not care for milk and these do not contain calcium.  I've contemplated giving her another vitamin, immune support, etc. but they would push her close to or over the recommended dosage of vitamin A.  Great product- very grateful to have these for her.  One tip- give them one at a time and show/instruct them how to chew it up very thoroughly.  As with any other gummy, this is essential to the processing and absorption of the vitamins and since they are so yummy it's easy just to swallow them after a few bites.
