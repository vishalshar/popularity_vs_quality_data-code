I've tried a lot of phone mounts, and this is the best so far.  The plastic doesn't feel very sturdy, but the design is awesome.  It stays really close to the stereo and at first look you won't even notice it's an aftermarket solution for the car's lack of built-in maps.  Another great thing is you can leave it in place while unused and it won't look terrible, it's very discrete.I'm using it on a 2015 Mustang and my phone completely blocks the car's screen, which is a shame only when I reverse and can't see the camera.  I still prefer it to any other mount.
