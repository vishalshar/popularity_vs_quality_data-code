I am using this device to find where I need more insulation in my house.  I can actually see where the studs are behind the dry wall, which is colder than where the insulation is between the studs.  Found leaks around window and door moldings and spots where the insulation is lacking.  I am sure this thermal camera will more than pay for itself in fuel savings.
