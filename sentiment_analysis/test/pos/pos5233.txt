I bought this for my friend after hearing how many pairs of gloves her son was going through in a season. She said it is amazing stuff and restored the grip on his gloves to almost new. You don't need to use much, so the bottle will go a long way. This should drastically cut down the frequency of buying new gloves for him. Neither my friend nor her son has had anything bad to say about the product, so I'm giving it 5 stars.
