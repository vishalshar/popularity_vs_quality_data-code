Yes, it is just a piece of rope with a snap on the end.  However, we have used many others, including the metal wire ones, and this one just works better.  It doesn't tend to get tangled, and it doesn't get hard bends in it like the metal wires.  The first one we purchased has been in use for many years, and although it faded from orange to white, it is still going strong.  I would recommend.
