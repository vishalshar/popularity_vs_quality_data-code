I don't know what it is about the texture of these bones, but my dogs are obsessed! They usually like the flavored soft plastic bones and they tear them apart (and ingest) in a matter of hours. These have put up with a large heeler mix and sheltie for a couple weeks now..which is a win for me. They are very bouncy, which the dogs like a lot. Will definitely buy again!
