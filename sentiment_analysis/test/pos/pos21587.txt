Ok this is the first review I've ever written this router is amazing. I've had the att modem/router and it's been horrible. Good speeds on Wired but the wifi was pitiful we would switch to a 2 bar cell signal and get faster internet. Take a look at the before and after shots went from at best 19mb downloads to 175mb! It feels like we went from the 1990's 2400 baud modem to the modern age. Great product and setup was a breeze. Can't recommend enough.
