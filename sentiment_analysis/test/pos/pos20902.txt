I definitely like this very much, but there are definitely still some shortcomings they need to overcome.one of my biggest issues is if I hit a shot offline into say a different fairway the device will register the next shot against that hole instead of the hole I'm playing. This can be corrected when you review the round online but it can get confusing at times. Say you hit your approach shot offline near a different tee box, then hit a wedge back to the green. That wedge may be registered against a different hole and I've ended up with a 504 yard wedge shot on a par 5 or a wedge shot to the next tee box, then the driver etc adding an extra shot to that hole and missing the shot on the hole you were hitting on.Also there are no really good statistics on your short game and putting yet, but it seems there is an active user community with lots of suggestions for improvement  which hopefully they will address.I've already confirmed club distances with this as well as used it to help identify better drive averages using different balls.
