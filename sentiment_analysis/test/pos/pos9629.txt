Bluesmarts suitcase is not for the casual traveler, but of course I knew that when purchasing luggage at this price. Ive taken a trip or two (hundred), and this bag is a great fit for short-term business travel. I got it for the features, since running between meetings at a client often leaves me with a dead phone by the time I get to the airport, and the built-in charging capabilities solve that problem without being tethered to an outlet. However, it also helped me streamline my packing since it is definitely smaller than other carry-on bags. When I packed it the first time, I thought Id have to sacrifice for my 3 night trip and leave some essentials at home (looking at you, workout gear). But it was no problem to work in 2 sets of dress shoes, a couple of dress shirts and slacks, cold weather apparel, gym clothes and running shoes (see photos). If youre backpacking through Europe or doing 2 weeks on a beach this is probably not what youre looking for, but if youre traveling a lot in short stints this is a great suitcase to have.The bag has a good layout with compartments where I expected them to be, and an easy to access outer pocket. I didnt use that much on my first trip but I can definitely see a good fit for documents and small electronics in the future in place of my briefcase or backpack. I also liked that the size made it easy to wheel around the airport and down the aisle of the plane so I could easily get to my seat and pop it into the overhead. My previous carry-on bag had more room but was bulky and I often had to carry it down the aisle, so this is a big improvement.I expect there will be improvements as Bluesmart refines the bag and supporting functions, such as the registration confirmation experience when registering for the mobile app (pretty basic text, no HTML) and the sensitivity of the automatic lock when your phone loses contact with the bag, but overall pretty minor. And the accompanying features, like the polished mobile app itself and the ability to provide another level of protection by even having an automatic lock are nice. Overall, a great addition for any business traveler.
