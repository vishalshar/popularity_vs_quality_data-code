So, I thought these were going to be really dorky, but my hubby NEVER untied his shoes, so I took a chance.  Put them in his tennis shoes today, and he LOVES them.  Perfect for the person who hates tying shoes.  They aren't the cutest "shoestrings", but they do what they are intended to do.  I hope they don't stretch out with wear!***UPDATE***Well, after a few weeks, my husband has asked if we can order some more of "those fake shoestrings" for his other tennis shoes.  He would never ask for something that is just okay, so they must be awesome.  My oldest son, a teen, doesn't think they look very "cool", but we are past the age of caring about any of that.  If my six-year-old didn't NEED to learn to tie his shoes, I'd order him some too.
