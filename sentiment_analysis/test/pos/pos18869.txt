So I've had these for a little over a week now and I can confidently say these meet and exceed all of my expectations. I held off purchasing these when they first came out due to the negative reviews about the Bluetooth connectivity and dropped calls. I've had no issues at all with any of that thus far. They are very comfortable (once you get used to them and if you get the right sleeve), and they stay securely in your ears. I'm very active and they've never felt as if they were going to fall out. The charging case is great, albeit a bit heavy but that's to be expected. I love the fact that once you place the earbuds in the case, they automatically disconnect from your device, and subsequently auto connects immediately once you place them back in your ears. In regards to the battery life, I've yet to have them die on me, but to be fair, I haven't had the chance to stress test them continuously for the full 3.5 hours. I'll usually have them on throughout the day during work, and take them off periodically while I attend to other matters and place them back in their case to charge.  The volume is a bit on the low side though - I'm hoping Bragi will be able to make some adjustments with their next software update to increase that. The audio transparency is a neat feature as well. If you have the volume set to medium, you'll be able to hear some background sounds. If you've got the volume set to max, you really won't be able to hear anything else. They also look awesome. I'm constantly getting asked about them and praise the design.  Bottom line, these are a godsend, if not a bit pricey. But if you've been at all looking for a truly wireless experience, you will not regret these.
