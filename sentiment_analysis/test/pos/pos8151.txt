This stuff is amazing!  I have an 11 yr old beagle with horrible seasonal allergies.  She can easily start needing prednisone from early spring all the way through October and we usually even need to get her a few steroid shots too.  This stuff really makes a big difference.  If I actually remember to start her early enough- like February then we can safely sale through spring, summer and fall without needing any kind of meds except for an occasional benadryl.  Sadly since I had 2 babies within the last 2 yrs. we got a bit sloppy and forgot all about this product so the poor dog was back on prednisone.  I just got her back on it now for a couple weeks (no prednisone) and she is already over the itching and scratching.  Love this stuff!!!
