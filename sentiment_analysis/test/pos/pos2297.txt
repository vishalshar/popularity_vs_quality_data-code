I have been using MetaDerm for almost a year now.  Prior to using it, I was applying the steroid creams twice daily for 2 weeks and then going off of them for two weeks.  During the two weeks on the cream, my excema was tolerable.  Almost immediately after ceasing use of the steroid, the excema symptoms would again flare up.  Also, I am diabetic and the steroid creams caused my blood glucose to spike.Then my wife found MetaDerm.  I had nearly immediate relief during the two weeks off the steroids.  And then I started not needing the steroids as often or as long.  Now I only use the steroid cream when I have a flare up, and then only for a few days.  I am using a tiny fraction of the amount of steroids that I used a year ago.  In their place I use MetaDerm twice a day.  My blood glucose levels are much improved.I am very thankful and grateful for the improvement in my excema symptoms that this product has provided for me.  I would wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone.
