It's a great device that does just about everything you could need but there are a couple of small drawbacks that annoy me.1. There is no power button on the remote.2. It cuts of the first few seconds on songs while using blue tooth.3. There are no controls for tapes; rewind, fast forward, etc.And just a suggestion, the round dial for the tuning the radio should have a light.Otherwise this thing is great. None of the above problems woud make me return it.  The sound is good, not bose quality but it doesn't come with a bose price tag.  Plus, my can't seem to handle vinyl.
