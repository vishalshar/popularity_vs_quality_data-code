I love these, I have a pair of them.  They are very bright, can display the full spectrum of color at full brightness, and I love the way you can program them with scenes and animated effects.  I like having them turn on slowly in the morning as a wake-up alarm.On the negative side, the app could be better (but a new version is apparently in the works).  It does feel a bit silly to wait 10s for an app to launch on your phone in order to turn on and off your lights.  Occasionally, a bulb will lose connection and I have to go over to the lightswitch to reset it. Both bulbs also produce an audible high-pitched hum, but you have to be in a near-dead silent room and be within a few feet to hear it.But those are minor nits.  With a better app and some firmware tweaks, these will be the LED bulbs all others will be judged by.
