I have a pair of minimalist sneakers that just wreaked during this past summer.  They were starting to make my entire hallway smell.  So i gave these a try.  I continued wearing the sneakers daily and put these in them each night.  it took few days before the odor started to go away, but after about a week the sneakers were much fresher.  I'm still using them and they are still working just fine.  Just leave them in the sun for a day if they start to smell.
