I have had this hearing amplifier (right ear) for about two weeks and have worn it almost every day as I was at a conference all of last week. This gave me a really good opportunity to test it out in a large banquet hall where I was standing at an expo booth all day for four days. The Solo was absolutely awesome and so helpful in letting me hear what people who came to visit the booth were saying (last year, in comparison, I spent most of the conference saying What? to booth attendees and my booth-mate).I dont have an official hearing loss, according to my ENT doc, so I am not in the market for hearing aids, but I have toyed with devices like this for the past couple of years as I sometimes struggle at large group dinners or in expo halls (my job requires me to attend several trade shows per year). The sound that the Solo relayed was crystal clear and not at all fuzzy or over-processed like some other, cheaper devices I have tried out over the years (granted, the other devices I tried were under $100-- you get what you pay for, and I am confident that this is worth every penny, to be frank).It also helps that this hearing device is super small and sits mostly behind my ear (only a small part is IN my ear), so most people cannot see it if looking at me head-on (not that I really care- I am excited to be able to function normally in social settings!). Overall, would highly recommend if you have trouble hearing people speak in noisy or crowded places. It has done wonders for me in just two weeks!
