This thing is LEGIT. So, we have a toddler. And packing for the child is....difficult. He requires more luggage than I do because of all of his accoutrement. One of which is a white noise machine. It's not essential, but I don't take chances with his sleep and hotels/other people's houses/vacation rentals can be pretty noisy. So, I find it important. Anyway, this thing literally fits in the palm of my hand. And, it's louder than his big white noise machine. We've run in 10 hours on a charge before. Definitely good for nap time. And, it uses the same charger as our kindles so we don't even need an extra. This is such a supreme winner. It's not too shabby as a bluetooth speaker, either. I can definitely see bringing this thing down to the beach to play some jamz (I write it that way because I am cool). Don't hesitate, excellent product if you like white noise, compact efficient things, and no-muss no-fuss winning products.
