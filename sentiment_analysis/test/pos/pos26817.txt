Super easy to apply. The kids love it. My son is night time potty training and was scared to go into the potty by himself. Now that he has a special light up toilet that he can change the colors on he feels more empowered and less scared to go to the potty by himself. That is PRICELESS.  So far it's been working well for 3 months. Only complaint is the suction cups (4 small ones) are on a square surface where the toilet tank is rounded so they come off all the time. It doesn't really affect the function that much but it looks dumb and bugs me.
