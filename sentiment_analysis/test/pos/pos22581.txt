After reading the reviews here I almost didn't buy the Fugoo. There were enough reviews complaining about the loudness (or lack thereof) that I actually placed an order for the Logitech UE Boom. About an hour later I came to my senses after comparing the two speakers more closely. For the same price as the UE Boom, the Fugoo offers 4x battery and 3x the number of speaker elements. Plus the Fugoo appears to be more durable with it's IP 67 rating.  Fortunately I was able to cancel my UE Boom order before it shipped.Now that I've had a couple days to listen to this speaker I can't fathom what the other reviewers were complaining about. The Fugoo is plenty loud and the sound quality is exceptional.  I should mention that I downloaded and installed the latest firmware which claims to address loudness issues.  If you have problems with your Fugoo volume you should do the same.One small issue that I almost hesitate to mention, but I will because of the way it turned out.  After charging the speaker overnight I paired with my phone the next morning.  I was about half way through the first song when I noticed a small tear in the jacket (cloth material that covers the speaker).  That obviously didn't affect the sound at all, but it's a bummer considering I paid $199 for the speaker. I contacted Fugoo support regarding the defect and they were quick apologize for the inconvenience offered a replacement jacket at no cost. So, I would have to add great customer service to the already long list of Fugoo attributes.
