This is such a beautiful sleep sack! I purchased this for my little guy because I love the design and the other reviews were so great. This product definilty  exceeded my expectations .  The material is incredibly soft and very cozy. The little guy sleeps like a dream in it. He's only five weeks old right now and it's definitely big on him but I'm looking forward to when he gets a little bit bigger and it fits better.
