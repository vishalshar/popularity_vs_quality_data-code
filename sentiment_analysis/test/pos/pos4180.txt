This device is revolutionary. I can now use my Surface Pro literally anywhere without having to worry about finding an outlet. It kept my SP3 topped off at 100% over the course of a day of a heavy and non-stop usage that began at 10 am and ended at 4:30 pm, with no bathroom or meal breaks. I also use it to simultaneously charge my Galaxy Note 5. Given the amount of power it packs, I can definitely tolerate its somewhat largish size.
