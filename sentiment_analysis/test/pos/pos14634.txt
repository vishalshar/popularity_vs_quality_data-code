I really like this product. I bought the Tile Item Finder first and found that it was inadequate for my needs and I returned it. PebbleBee has many more features including the ability to find my phone in addition to finding my keys. Another feature PebbleBee has that Tile does not is the ability to change out the battery when it gets low. With Tile you have to send it back for a new unit.
