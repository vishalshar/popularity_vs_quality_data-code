I own both Mophie & Otterbox iPhone 6s rechargable cases, and ThinCharge has them both beat, in my opinion.  The big selling factor for me is the acceptance of a lightning cable.  To my knowledge, no other rechargable case has this feature.  One caveat is that I've had this case less than a month, so I can't speak to durability.  I will say that the Otterbox seems more protective, albeit thicker.  ThinCase has well-rounded corner edges, however, and should provide adequate protection for my purposes.
