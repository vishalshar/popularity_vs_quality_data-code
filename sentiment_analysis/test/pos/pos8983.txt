My husband and I were really excited at first, but it took our seven year old a bit of time to warm up to this little guy.  It's pretty fun once you get the hang of it, but there's quite the learning curve - first just to figure out what it is you can do with it (my son can read instructions, but none really come with it, and we aren't really in the habit of letting him go look through youTube which is where ultimately we had to go get our intel).  Once we got some initial info, then he was able to get into it a bit more and figure out more by himself.  This isn't the first toy I have this problem with - I get that we are in a techy age, but I feel like toys should still come with useful intro info.  Even the Wowee website is completely useless in terms of actual info, every time I did my search all I got was the page selling the product - 'here are all the features'.... that you will have to look all over the internet in order to figure out how to activate and use.... :)  So for that reason, I give it four stars.  And also because in the end, I didn't think it was amazingly terrific, to be honest (now I'm thinking about the programming app).  I feel like there could be more flexibility with the app.  So anyway, cute and entertaining - but not something I would absolutely recommend to all my friends.
