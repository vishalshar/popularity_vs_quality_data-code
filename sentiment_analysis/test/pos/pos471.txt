Easy to setupI got Amazon Prime and I received it the next day after I ordered! Then I just setup BEDDI and got it running in a couple minutes. Setup flow was intuitive, and app is easy to use. It looks as nice as the photo online, and has cool light effect. The only thing I wish is a stronger bass for speaker.
