I bought these for my grandson and they turned out to be a good solution for the parents and for me. as an old-fashioned grandma, i was used to placing a diaper or flannel pad under the baby in the crib - then when baby spits up or if there is a diaper leak one just changes the diaper or flannel pad, not the entire bed.In these days of not placing anything in the crib for baby to get tangled up in, no one wants the diaper or flannel pad. These sheets solve that problem.  The sheet set envelops the entire mattress, and has a top sheet that zips into place. it is easy to just zip off the soiled sheet and zip in a new one. The zipper is a large plastic one covered by a fabric placket.In addition to quick change due to wet or soiled sheet, i think this system will also work well to prevent baby from pulling the sheet off the mattress altogether, which is something babies tend to do as they begin to roll and crawl around in the crib.I was very happy with the quality of the sheet fabric, very soft, washes well (fits mattress better after washing). Zipper is sturdy, covered by fabric placket. Seems ingenious to me.
