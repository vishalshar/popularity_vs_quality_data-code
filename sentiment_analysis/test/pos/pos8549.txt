The difference between these Immune Support jerky treats and Bixbis regular jerky treats is that these have blueberries and cranberries to act as antioxidants.  Both types of treats are made and sourced in the US, without GMO, byproducts and fillers.Our dog likes these chicken jerky treats, though they come in as her second favorite chicken jerky treats, next to the Vera brand, which is moister and chewier.  I do like to mix things up with her, so its nice to have both and to have two versions that I can feel safe giving her.
