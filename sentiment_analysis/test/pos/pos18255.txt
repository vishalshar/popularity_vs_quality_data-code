To start off, this mouse feels great. The texture and all of the buttons feel fantastic. The issues I had with it were it is a bit small for my hand. My hand measures 18 cm from the top of my middle finger to the base of my palm and the width is about 9 cm. I play claw so this wasn't too big of an issue. Another thing is the scroll wheel is not tactile at all. You can't tell if you are even scrolling from my experience. Not sure if that was just a hardware issue or if that's how they are manufactured. The software is another thing that is fine but could be improved. I had a steel series rival that I had macros set up on. The Mionix software allows you to make macros but there is no features such as toggling the macros or pressing and holding the key for the macro to work unlike every other brand (Steel Series, Razor, and Logitech). The tracking was fantastic. There was absolutely no acceleration at all! So if you don't mind the scroll wheel then this is a great mouse. The price is a little steep, but you are paying for better build quality.
