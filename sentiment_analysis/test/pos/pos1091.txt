I admit it. This is a gadget. I have no "use case for it". But I *love* it! This is way cool. It cannot see through walls, windows, or cloth held a distance from the body (I've tried these to check limitations). That being said, I look forward to Seek Thermal coming out with a software development kit so I can do even more with it (ok, promote it to "geek gadget"). As is, if your dog is loose at night, or you want to see what that "strange sound in the night" is (campers take note), this will let you see exposed body heat at a good distance. And did I mention mine came with a nice compact hard-shell case with foam padding (fit in a pocket, protect the camera - GREAT attention to detail Seek Thermal).The good: cheaper than any other thermal camera I've found (by A LOT), compact, coolThe bad: can't see through cover (bushes, obstacles, etc.), though this is not major for me. Not military resolution/range, but I'm a civilian, and it will see animals at range.btw, I have no association with Seek Thermal (though this reads like a shill review) - I just am still in love with the camera.
