Very impressed with these. After being disappointed in steelseries siberia P800's, I ordered these. It was a very good decision. The sound is great, mic is clear and the only time you need a wire is to charge them. Which so far they lasted me 10 hrs continual play time on the ps4. Some reviewers say they feel a bit heavy. To me, it was unnoticeable. Feel very good and comfy on the melon. It feels like a top of the line headset for the price. I would reccommend these to any ps4 player.
