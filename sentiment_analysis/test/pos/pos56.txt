Beautiful, well polished and well built. I had backed this project on Indiegogo while I was in search of lock that would provide the security and at the same time for something that would look good on my front door. I am proud to be a backer and reviewer of this product. I came across the Ultraloq and was very much interested in the specs. I received mine earlier this month and eagerly installed it on my front door. The package came with clear installation instructions and templates for new installations. Since my door already had a lock on it, the installation was a breeze. It too me 20 mins from removal of the old lock to installation of the Ultraloq. The only problem I ran into was that I had previously installed a deadbolt on my front door and had to remove it to get the Ultraloq on the door. I had to by a deadbolt hole cover from Lowe's which cost me a measly $5.00. I got the same polished brass finish as the lock. Together they look wonderful.Setup was easy after installing the three batteries that came with the lock. I downloaded the Ultraloq App on my iPhone and paired it via Bluetooth instantly. I setup the admin account and three others for my family within 15 mins. We tested it for almost an hour and it did just what it was suppose to do. The thumbprint entry is flawless. Setup can be done via the app and from the lock itself. The only feature it does not have that I wish he had is wifi connectivity. Nonetheless, this is by far the best smart lock I've come across and I highly recommend it.
