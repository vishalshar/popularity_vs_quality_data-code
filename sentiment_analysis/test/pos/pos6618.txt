I bought this for my daughter's 10th birthday.  I wasn't sure how it would be since most of the reviews are from "Vine" users who got the product for free.  But honestly, this was the hit present of her whole birthday!  Yay mom!!  It's different than other scooters...it sits higher off the ground, has a nice rear hand brake and has the fun option of being used with the rocking motion.  I wasn't sure if she would be scared but she wasn't, and she picked up how to use it right away!  She goes outside and scoots around by herself for 30+ minutes at a time and all the other kids in the neighborhood want one :)  I just have to tell them where I got it :)
