Daughter absolutely loves this bike and won't get off of it! I loved it because it looked different then the standard bikes do. It was a little bit more in price than other bikes but well worth the extra money. She is a little small for it, but has learned some tricks to get on it now (since she rides without training wheels). She likes the hand brake too which I switched to the other side because my daughter isn't a lefty. Came with all the tools to put together, even though I used my own, and just put those in my tool box. I would order this bike again, and will look at this company for future purchases.
