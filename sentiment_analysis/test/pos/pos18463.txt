Affordable laptop for gaming. I am able to play any games with high video setting. I can tell a difference when playing black op 3, league of legends. Start-up very quick, about 5 seconds, light weight, thin. It does not have dvd nor cd slot but I am aware of that. I have no need for dvd player any way.
