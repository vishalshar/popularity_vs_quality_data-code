We bought this after losing several cats and then having one come back with a pellet in his lung. People said "keep them inside" but it was always so clear that cats love being outdoors too. With the fence, our cats now happily roam the back yard. If this had been invented earlier, I'm sure some of our wonderful cats would still be with us. It was easy to install, both along the existing fenceline (VERY easy) and along the ground and driveway (an afternoon's work of tiny trench-digging).  The kitten caught on to it after about one small shock. The yearling male, used to roaming the neighborhood, was terrified for a day after his first shock, but adapted within perhaps 2-3 more days, with no trauma. He waits for his collar in the morning and happily trots out into the new "territory." Without a fence it's harder--not so much as a barrier but just a visual aid for them--I'd definitely suggest using the flags liberally! Although the cats have learned where the e-fence is in the front yard, too (with no "real" fence to mark it), we've had two incidents of the male cat running the wrong way ("through" the e-fence) when he heard the beeping. Both times we just turned off the fence and called him back, again with no trauma. He really doesn't seem to see the e-fence as imprisonment, so he's not trying to escape. We leave the collars on in the daytime and let them go in & out a cat door, then close that at night or when we're not here, and remove the collars. This gives their necks a respite and thus, though their fur is a little less thick where the collars sit, there is no skin trouble(and I have to say, even the 6-month old kitten doesn't mind the collar, and they sleep and wrestle with them on all the time).In short, we think this is a life-saving invention, and a very good purchase at a reasonable cost. We wish the collars were a little smaller, but mostly we're just happy that they exist at all.
