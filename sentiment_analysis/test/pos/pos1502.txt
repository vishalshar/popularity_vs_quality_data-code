This  is one of my favorite games to play. It takes 4 - 12 players and scales nicely. One or more players are a witch, one player is a constable (who gets to save another player each night), as turns go on, the witch cards can move to the player or players to the right, corrupting others and increasing the size of your coven. The witches win if every live player is in the coven. The villagers win if they expose all witch cards.
