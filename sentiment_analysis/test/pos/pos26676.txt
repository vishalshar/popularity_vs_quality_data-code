Fantastic item - powerful and well built. The online docs from ACROBOTIC were EXCELLENT. I got it working in 10 mins,scanned for wifi & picked up networks down the street! Micro USB is great for powering/uploading -getting started was painless.Cisco at ACROBOTIC promptly and carefully answered my emailed question. I definitely recommend this unit, and I will definitely buy again from ACROBOTIC
