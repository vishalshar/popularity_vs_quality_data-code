I purchased this for my husband after reading many reviews for it and I'll be the first to say it lives up to all the hype. What impressed me most was recently my husband knocked the case up against a sharp edge creating what I thought was going to be a large permeant gash on the back but less that 15 minutes later that portion of the case began "self healing" and now you can't even tell that anything happened. He's had it for months and it still suctions to multiple different surfaces same as the first day used it.
