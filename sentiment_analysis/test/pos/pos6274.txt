Just received it and tested for fit (S7 with case fits snugly into phone pouch, older 13" Mac Book Pro fits into main compartment). Seems to be well made. It is lighter than expected but that is part of the advertised design. Time will tell how well it endures regular use. I do wish the contents of the neoprene-lined, hidden pocket could be a bit more easily secured, as they have a tendency to flop around in my limited use. Overall, pleased thus far.
