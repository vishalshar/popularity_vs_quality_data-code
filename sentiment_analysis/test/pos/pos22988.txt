A lot of fun to use. Pretty simple and does everything it says its going to. The Ability to manipulate the plastic as you go is pretty good - that meaning calligraphy or a bit of stylized handwriting will come out looking well made. Larger structures do look amateurish but that may have a lot to do with my limited art and design skills - but this pen is a lot of fun.One great feature is bonding or fixing plastic items around the house. A broken remote control backing - or the bond on a shower hook - annoying things to replace - but very easy to fix with this pen - so something to consider if you are a new age handy man.
