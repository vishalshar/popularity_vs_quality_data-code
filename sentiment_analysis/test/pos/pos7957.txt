Happy, healthy 9 yr. old dog.  We alternate between the Chicken, Salmon and Buffalo. Our 65 lb. collie mix gets the Great Life kibble every morning. I like that it has no peas or potatoes as well as being grain free.  This is what separates it from the other Grain and Potatoes Free kibbles. Peas and potatoes can be high glycemic.
