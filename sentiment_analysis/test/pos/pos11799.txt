this new product is just that- so simply thought out, yet the important details are there, that it makes you wonder why no one thought of it before! And it can actually fit IN your purse! It might not look like much, but it is JUST as safe as traditional boosters! What a concept!You can see the mifold at its tallest, next to a traditional older children's booster seat in the pictures, pretty SLIM isn't it??? But NO worries, it exceeds safety regulations.  A trooper friend who deals with safety seat checks was pretty impressed with the mi-fold, but DID suggest you might want to carry your manual with the seat, just in case you get stopped and have to prove that ii is US/state compliant, and meets any of your state's regulations! As with anything new and different not everyone knows about it yet!  The compliance officers should, but general patrol might not! That's something I had not thought about!Thanks to it's handy belt guide/latch, you can literally set the mifold up in literally 2 minutes or less!  The seat DOES need a traditional lap AND shoulder belt,but even the 9 year old was able to set it up all by herself, and use it! you can use it for ANY of your older kids, thanks to its three width settings (the side belt guides pull out for the settings) of small, medium, and large" . I DO wish they would lock in place, as the first time we set up the mifold, one side slid back in, but it was easily remedies by having the kid hold them 'out' while sitting down, then their body keeps them in place. Plus the fully variable shoulder guide, means it can be adjusted for kids ages 4 to 12 years old, with just a simple pull and release of the strap!The mi-fold does stay cool, even on the hottest days, which we can attest to, as the day I took these pictures, it was 98 degrees  outside, hotter in the car (as it had been sitting in the sun), and the kid NEVER complained about it being hot! advised that for shorter rides she would be happy to use the mifold, but on the 90 minute ride to Irish Dance class, she would definitely want to ride in her traditional booster, as it is a bit more comfortable. however, she also informed me that she definitely liked sitting 'like a teenager'. Another issue was not being able to see out the windows as well, but that is really not that big of a deal for most of the times when you would really be NEEDING to use the mifold on the fly! So we will use ours for when she has to ride with someone else, or when we have another child riding with us, or for when we are traveling and not in our own vehicle!mifold goes anywhere your child does, and that portability really makes it a must to have for back to school season, as you'll never know when you need to have an extra kid in the car, or when your child will have to ride with someone else. Knowing they have a SAFE and portable booster with them, really can give you peace of mind!The mifold would be a great shower present, or a great 'bon voyage' travel gift, as it's one thing that all parents can USE but wouldn't really think of buying! But once you have it, you'll wonder why you didn't get one sooner!
