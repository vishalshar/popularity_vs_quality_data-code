This product is great. I was attracted to it because it is made from birch rather than corn AND the price per pound is lower than most brands. How can one beat that?  I've noticed that different brands have different sized granules. These are somewhat coarse. This doesn't bother me because in hot liquids, it dissolves easily and if for some reason I need a finer texture, I can put it in the blender or spice grinder....if even necessary. It usually isn't. It's not unusually coarse. It's just that some brands are finer. With the quality and price, I'm sticking with Morning Pep brand.
