Love the ease of use. Lenses clamp onto my bridge gently but securely. I have not secured the case w/ the adhesive to my smartphone because I use phone cases that have kickstand props on the back so can't comment on how secure they might be. I did however have to place a strip of cellophane tape over the adhesive strip on the case. No prob. My ideal readers are 1.75 strength. I flipped a coin on ordering the available 1.5 or 2.0. I went with the 1.5 and they seem fine. Perfect clarity occurs perhaps only 2-3 inches farther from my eyes than my ideal, but who's picky?Now, why not 5 stars? I had to subtract 1 star because the lenses are very soft. The first time I wanted to clean the lenses I used a standard foil wrapped paper lens wipe. Having not cleaned them yet, therefore not knowing how soft the lenses might be, I applied very light pressure just to minimize any possibility of any kind of abrasion or scuff. In spite of that, on the first lens I wiped, I checked immediately and lo and behold there was an ever so faint scratch. You can't see it unless you look very very hard in that perfect angle in the light we all use to be sure our lens is  perfectly clear. So only my brain will really know it's there because I was so careful. Warning, do NOT use any paper product to clean these things. If I had used the same pressure with the thin paper lens wipe as I do on my other 7 pairs of readers, 4 glasses, and tablets, the scratches would have been visible. Get out your micro-fiber cleaning cloths and clean away. Knowing how soft they are it remains to be seen how long they will last in their perfectly clear state before uncontrollable dullness might set in. Some other reviews of this product have also made mention of this lens characteristic.10/10/15 addendum. As previously mentioned my ideal reading glasses are 1.75. That strength is not available so there is the coin flip of 1.5 vs 2.0. I chose 1.5. I thought at first they were doing the job.  Well, they were, but at a holding distance about 5-6 inches further away than usual for complete clarity. I lived with it at first but since all of my other half dozen reading glasses are 1.75 and one pair of  2.0's, the difference when using these was starting to be annoyingly apparent. I've returned these 1.5's and ordered the 2.0's. The lesson for me at least, if you're in between strengths go stronger.
