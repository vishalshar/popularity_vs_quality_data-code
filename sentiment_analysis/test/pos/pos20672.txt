I own two of these (Rachio Gen 2 16 zone). House 1 got Rachio in April 2016 in a Rachio outdoor enclosure (see photo 1), House 2 got Rachio in June 2016 in a porch closet. Both are controlled from a single app that we use on an iPad and an Android phone, and soon on an iPhone (once we update the iPhone's iOS software).I mention all this because the genius of the Rachio controller becomes more evident the more use you make of it's advanced technology, and the more zones you use. Here are some examples:  * House 1 has three zones of drought-tolerant plants (~20 minutes of low pressure, 1 gal/hour drip irrigation, 3x weekly), two zones of shrubs (lower much lower frequency watering, higher volume drip), and more recently, a high-pressure zone running three gear-drive sprinklers in the back yard (twice a month)  * House 2 has 8 zones, a mix of pop-ups and drip irrigation that we will be monkeying with for the rest of the summer. It's a bit tricky to water containers...  * House 1 is on the valley floor, where it's warmer. House 2 is in the mountains, where it's cooler.All of these sprinklers were formerly controlled by a motley collection of digital timers, which allowed a limited range of programs. At house 1, the twice-a-month zone was impossible, so we settled for once a week on a separate, recycled timer. This never worked right, so we gave up and did it manually. Of course, we always left that zone running too long by mistake.Enter Rachio. I bought the first one because the older timers couldn't handle a rain sensor (required to get a rebate from the county). The Rachio app leads you through a simple setup for each zone, where you answer questions (type of plants, type of sprinklers, slope or flat, type of soil). It then figures out how much water you need automatically. We've had three hot months, and the plants are all doing great, so Rachio must have figured out the right answer.Then you tell it where your nearest weather station is (easy to find on the web) and Rachio decides when to skip watering. It will also skip based on sensing rain in the rain sensor, but frankly I think this is unnecessary if you have the internet connection to the weather station.You can add names and photos to each zone. Rachio sends you messages (optional) each time it runs the irrigation or changes the schedule. Finally, you can override the programming, or change it, anytime from your phone/tablet app, anywhere in the world.I was a bit apprehensive about setting all this up, because we've all experienced high-tech goodies that don't get used because we can't remember how they work. The Rachio is very intuitive, and has great online support (company execs respond to many of the reviews & questions here on Amazon.)How's this for super convenient: I'm going to drive past house 1 last week, and can check the sprinklers, but my time is limited. No problem: Fire up the app, tell it to run the zones I want to check, then by the time I arrive they have all run. I can do a visual check on the plants and a finger check on the soil. Then I can turn on the zones one at a time, from the curb, to make sure the short list of funky emitters are working correctly (see photo 2). Total time on site: under five minutes.Bottom line: Advanced, internet-connected technology that works. The more different things you want to do, the more you will like it. You will figure out new ways to use it as you go.
