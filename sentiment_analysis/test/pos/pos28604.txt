This product is a great replacement for shoelaces it makes it really easy to slip your shoe on and off. I read some of the reviews and was quite worried about the hickies snapping under presure but I found that the hickies do amazing under pressure and meet the requirements to keep your shoes on. I would definitely recommend this product!
