My wife and I both have one and have played 8 rounds. The statistics are very helpful in seeing where you are good and where you need work. Actual yardages for clubs over a period of time will bring most people to a more realistic view of their game. We had a couple of issues initially and the factory response was immediate and excellent. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to analyze their strengths and weaknesses thru statistics.
