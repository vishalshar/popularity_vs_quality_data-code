I'm glad I waited for the 2nd generation lock!!  I installed the lock on our front door and also bought the keypad and august connect.  I've found that trying to share the iOS app with non-technical folks (house keeper, maintenance person) hasn't worked very well (they weren't able to figure out how to install/sign-up on their own).  In these cases, I was glad I was able to give them a code to use on the keypad.  Only problem with the keypad codes is you cannot set day/time limits.Installation was quick and easy, no issues.Connecting to my Apple TV HomeKit was also easy, once I installed the apple tv on a tv relatively close to the front door.  Since then, I have had fun showing others that my front door was locked when I am away from home.
