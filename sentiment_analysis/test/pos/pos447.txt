I have purchased different brands of filament to try to find out if all filaments are alike or you really get what you pay for.  Honestly, turns out neither is exactly correct.Since this review is specifically for the AIO Robotics PLA filamant (I have three different color spools in this brand), I'll focus on that and summarize my overall thoughts at the end.I purchased AIO's bright blue PLA as I was looking for a good contrast/accent color for a project I was preparing to print.The color is vibrant on the printer bed as it is on the spool, which is great as some of the PLA I've used prints a little muted.The polymer seems very consistent and reliable in my DreamMaker Overlord Pro.  I've printed large bases (ample time for previous layer to cool) and small details (minimal cooling time) and the layering is very good.  No separation yet.  I've also printed fairly tall, thin walls which have turned out great.  I've yet to experience any issues with extrusion.AIO's plastic spoils aren't my favorite. it's a minor thing, but I prefer a little lip on the outside edge of the spool (vs completely flat) to attach a clip to hold the filament end during storage.  I also prefer clear spools over black.The Amazon offering is kinda slim.  With few exceptions, AIO seems to primarily offer PLA.  I would be interested to try other polymers to see if their quality extends beyond PLA.Lastly, I prefer to keep 1kg spoils on-hand. I only had 0.5kg spools to to choose from on Amazon.  As is typically the case, smaller quantity means a little higher unit cost.  Overall, the cost is only slightly higher than my average (per kg) and lower than some lesser performing filaments I've tried.PROS1. Vibrant color2. Consistency3. Overall print qualityCONS1. Packaging2. VarietyNEUTRAL1. ValueSUMMARYNot all filaments are created equal. And even if they were, a number of factors (age, shipping conditions, warehouse storage time) would still separate out good from bad.  I feel that the quality of the filaments that I've received from AIO are all well above average and since the cons I've listed don't impact print quality, I've given this product 5 stars.  I would purchase again.SIDE NOTEDon't be the weak link in print quality.  Invest a few dollars in a good storage system to keep your filament cool and dry.  Check out YouTube for a variety of storage ideas and options.  Get air-tight containers (storage bins or 5gal buckets), desiccants to remove moisture and don't leave filament in an idle printer.  You can turn the best filament into the worst in weeks (or even days) if your not careful.
