These underwear are awesome!  The pouch for your junk is way comfortable - no more mashing or squeezing it all together when you sit down, and no more grabbing to rearrange it.  I do have some other kinds, but really I only wear these now.  They are great at the gym, and also for everyday.  The only caveat I have is that I wish the waist were a bit lower, but that's a minor quibble.  Get a pair - you'll be glad you did.
