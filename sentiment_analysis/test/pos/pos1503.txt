For people who like the idea of a social deduction game but are looking for something beyond Werewolf or One Night games Salem may very well be the game for you.  While the hidden role mechanic is still in play with this game the added card game mechanic adds a new layer to this type of game.  Facade Games has done a great job intertwining the game's theme with the actual history of the Salem Witch trials, using the real names of the people involved as game characters.  It's definitely become one of my favorite games since purchasing it and is now my "go to" social deduction/hidden role game.
