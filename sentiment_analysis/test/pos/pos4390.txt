I'm so happy that from now on I can check on my cat anytime and from anywhere. Recently we had and awful experience with her running away from home at the same time as we were leaving for a Christmas vacation. We found out about it three days since we left when our friends were visiting the "kitty". It was awful. We rushed home (our vacation ruined), thank God we found her as soon as we got back. She had an abscess from racoon scratches, went through the additional visit to the vet, got a round of antibiotics treatment. Now she's finally fine, but all this would never happen if we had Petcube at that time. So beware, kitty! Big brother is watching you now.As a bonus, a can not only check on my cat when I'm not at home but also spy on her when I am (and she's in another room and I can hear a suspicious sound of something being chewed). And of course, play with the laser. Kitty loves it. Now my friends and family exercise her when I don't have time
