Our 1 year old chocolate lab had a huge wart cluster right on his lower gum and the vet said that we need to just wait it out for it to run its course, which could take anywhere from 1-5 months. And although its mostly an eye sore, with our energetic pup, i certainly didn't want to keep him away from other dogs for that long. I researched everywhere and found this immunity support powder and decided to give it a try. We are currently on week 2 of mixing this in his food and his wart is almost gone! My husband and I were kind of shocked how after one week, we could then noticeably see a huge difference each day of it going away so quickly. I suspect in the next day or two it will be completely gone.I wish that I got this earlier but now I am a fan of this product and recommend this to anyone!!
