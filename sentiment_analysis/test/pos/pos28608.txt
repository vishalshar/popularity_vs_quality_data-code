I purchased the Petcube Play because I wanted a second monitoring device in our house for when we go on short vacation. My wife and I were quite pleased with the previous Petcube product, and we were excited to try the new features of the Petcube Play - predominately the night vision. With previous camera set ups, we could only view our pets and our home during the day, or if we had left a light on.Improvements with this version are definitely worth the upgrade. The set-up on this version of the Petcube is easier than ever. The app gives a short walk through, and then with 2 clicks, you're connected to your home Wi-Fi network.The HD video is quite apparent. The quality of the image and video is much improved! There is no fuzziness to the images anymore, and everything is clean and crisp. After the first day of set up, while I was at work, I was able to catch our new kitty on the table drinking out of water cups that were left on the table (this is her new habit). I quickly turned the sound on through the app and told her sternly to get off the table. She quickly jumped off the table, and attempted to find out where my voice was coming from :)The night vision is a huge plus. The night-vision immediately kicks in when the lights get too low in the room. It works even when all the lights in the house are out. The night vision image is in grey-scale and looks just as clean and sharp as the color video.The only downside so far is that you can only have one Petcube attached to your account. So in order to get this working, I deactivated my old Petcube from my account, activated the new Petcube on my account, and then assigned the old Petcube to my wife's account. We have set each other as friends and have shared our camera's with each other so we have full control of each camera. It's a decent work around, but it would be more convenient to be able to assign multiple cameras to one account.
