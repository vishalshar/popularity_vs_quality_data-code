Update 7: they just activate insight and gives you an idea how you drove for a month. Other than that it feels like started to lose connection more often with their server. Still all three of the adapters are working but losing connection more often so you cant track the cars as good as before!Update 6: still problems with notifications on iphone but other then that working as advertised. And i am sure it will only get better in time.Update5: so far so good... Sometimes shiws offline but other then that only problem i am having is notifications missing on ios!  Will keep updating...Update 4: company claims pro picks the strongest cell signal between tmobile and att. This is not true so far. I have great tmobile coverage and no att coverage around my neighborhood and adapters all three seitches to offline and lose connection when i come close to my house and stays offline untill i drive to a good coverage att area. Other then that so far working good except couple times it skipped the iOS notifications. Will keep updating.Update 3: this thing is really handy to track your cars plus getting info about your trips. Data is sometimes slow and sometimes it becames offline but this is just the first week or two of the product so i am bumping my rating to 5 stars. Highly recommend it. Amd dont forget to drive for half an hour after you install the product or it wont update amd upload your trip details and dont register the adapter!!!!Update 2: i read one of the other reviews and it states this does not have it is own gps. WRONG! even if you dont connect your phone it atill tracks amd uploads the info to app almost perfeclty. Sometimes there is a delay because of cell coverage of the device but most of the time very accurate. And you do not need a phone to track a car! It has it is own gps. I have three amd i can see my wifes and my sons car without any problem.Update: Finally figured out how to make it work. I think it is using att network amd i have very bad att coverage in my area amd that was the reason I switched to tmobile. So if you have bad att coverage where you install the product then take a drive to an area with a better coverage and it uodates itself amd stop showing gps  information amd other information  Unavaliable. So after registering the adapter just take a 20 minute drive and it will start working... Plus dont forget to turn on your Bluetooth and location on your phone. You dont need it but it helps. So decided to keep all three for a month.-----------I recieved the product today and installed as advertised but after registering no information available. Gos unknown.... It is a known firmware issue i guess and they will fix it in the next firmware update..No contact information anywhere about the company... No phone support... Just community forum and you can email them. Disappointed. Bought three for all our cars and Returning all three...
