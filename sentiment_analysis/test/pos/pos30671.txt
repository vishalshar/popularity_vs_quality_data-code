I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand I _love_ it because of its antibacterial and astringent properties. I no longer have to use antibacterial lotions on my skin to prevent razor burn! That's incredible! On the other hand it burns on certain areas of my skin like my upper lip and anus. It seems like my skin is adjusting to this, though. With each use it burns less and for a shorter amount of time.
