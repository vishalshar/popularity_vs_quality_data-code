So far after a week of wearing this at work and at home I have not noticed anything wrong with it. This is my first smart watch and I am loving it. I was worried about it breaking it at work do to slamming my hand constantly against metal, but the screen does not even have a scratch. The only thing I wish they had was a bit more features. So far I know it is a new device and the company is looking to update with many new apps, but why not launch a product with everything already on it? All in all love the watch, very durable and would recommended to some one I know.
