This is a great item, at a great price!!! I've been looking for something like this for my long road trips so I can have my HTC One M8 on my Honda VTX, and it works great. For the first 150 miles or so, I had 2 rubber bands around it just in case, but it wasn't going anywhere. I took the rubber bands off and for the next 600 miles of the trip, it didn't budge.What I will say is that the One M8 is not the largest phone on the market, but it is big. Based on fit, I don't imagine this would fit a phone that is too much bigger than an HTC One M8.It would be great if they offered this in a few more colors, but otherwise, I'd recommend this to anybody looking for a phone mount for their motorcycle.
