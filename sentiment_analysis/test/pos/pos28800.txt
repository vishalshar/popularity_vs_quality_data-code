It's not for everyone, just because it takes a while to work, but if you like cold brew coffee already, then this will seriously up your game. It is really easy to use, easy to clean, and does a fantastic job.It comes in really fun packaging that looks like a milk carton. Other reviewers have noted it before, but the packaging really is top notch. Product presentation matters, and the Dripo totally nails it. It's really fun.The Dripo unit itself is pretty tall, but not unweildy. You could easily take it to work with you and leave it on a desk or in a work fridge, etc. It has multiple parts, but they all lock together securely. As long as all the parts are screwed tightly together, you could probably even throw it in a bag and not worry about it spilling. I didn't try this, but it seems like it seals well enough for it to work.The instructions are really clear and easy to follow. It does take 2-3 hours or more to finish a batch of coffee, but it's worth it. I've taken it to work with me and if I start a batch going as soon as I get there, by the time it's done, I'm halfway through my workday and ready for more coffee. If I make it at home, I'll just put the whole Dripo unit into the fridge overnight. By morning, it's finished dripping and is ready to go. Plus, it's nice and chilled.The coffee this thing makes is very good. It's strong and bold, without any bitterness. It's ridiculously smooth and makes a fantastic cup of iced coffee. The amount of coffee you get from one batch is easily enough for two glasses of iced coffee once you add ice and milk. I usually split the finished black coffee into two glasses, then my wife and I each add ice and milk to taste and we both end up with a full glass of iced coffee. If you like really strong coffee, you could drink this black, but it is really strong and bold, so be warned.The parts are all super easy to clean, too, and the paper filters can even be re-used if you rinse them off.Here are a few tips I want to share after using the Dripo:- Pour some water into the grounds directly first and use a spoon to stir it up. Make sure all the grounds are wet, then assemble the Dripo according to the directions. I found that a large amount of grounds stayed dry and didn't brew when I didn't get them wet first.- Use medium ground or course ground coffee. I used espresso grounds once and they're so fine that some of the grounds made it through the metal filter.- The paper filter goes on TOP of the grounds. The instructions make this clear, but some other reviewers seem to be placing it on the bottom. It's there to evenly distribute the water dripping from above, not to act as a filter.- Don't rush it. Let it continue dripping until all the water in the top container is gone and the grounds have stopped dripping.- Don't tighten the seals between chambers too tightly. Again, the instructions mention this, but I found first hand that if they're too tight, then it creates a seal inside and the water won't drip. Loosen it just a bit, and water starts flowing again.Overall, I'm psyched about this product. It makes a seriously good iced coffee and is super easy to use. It's a bit expensive, but if you were previously spending $2-4 each day on coffee shop iced coffee, this thing will pay for itself really quickly. Plus, since it's actually cold brewed, the iced coffee you get out of this tastes better than most store-bought iced coffee, and you can customize it however you want.If you like iced coffee and want to try your hand at cold brewing, it couldn't be easier than the Dripo. I highly recommend it.
