This brand has been increasingly difficult to find in stores but my cats go CRAZY over it! I love the shiny packaging and the artistic designs they put on the bags, it's holistic but not INCREDIBLY out of the park expensive.  They also come in some of the funkiest flavors I've ever heard of, that being said my cats still prefer the plain old chicken.
