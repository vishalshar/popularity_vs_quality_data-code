Super easy...and for me that's a big big plus.  Out of the box (which is a gorgeous thing in and of itself), all I had to do was enable Bluetooth and hit play on my phone's Pandaora and voila!  MUSIC!  The sound is great.  I use it for my classroom, which is fairly large, and it fills the room.  Rivals the SONOS speakers we have at home, but ZIPP is way easier to set up and is portable!  Battery life is great, control interface is clean and sleek and intuitive!  Looks great too.
