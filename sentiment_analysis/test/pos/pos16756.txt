"When I received my yoga towel, I got exactly what I expected with respect to size, color, and most of all quality! Unlike others, my yoga towel didn't smell at all! In fact, I used it directly out of the package for a hot power yoga class. This towel and its price is an incredible value. No need to spray your mat to help it adhere to your yoga mat, as doing so will make it slippery be used if the rubbery non-slip flowers. The rubbery no-slip flowers are good, but could stand to be a bit better as when my feet are moist/damp, I still slip a little. Other than that, grab yours now!!! Great stocking stuffers or gifts for your yogi friends."
