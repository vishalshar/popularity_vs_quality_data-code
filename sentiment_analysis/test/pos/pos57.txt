This lock is ALMOST the complete package,  It's easy to use, has great features.  The fingerprint identification is fast, key entry works great, and flawless bluetooth.  I love the little perk where you can knock on the phone in your pocket 4 times and the lock will open.  I love that it keeps a log of entries as well, and that the keys and fingerprint reader are backlit.Seems really high quality build.  Easy handle change for direction of door.The only feature that this lock is missing, is the ability to send a 'key' to another smart phone, so that you can remotely provide access to a third party.  Since the lock already works with my phone's bluetooth, it would seem to be reasonable to expect a software upgrade in the future where the company provides this ability.  I should be able to send a 'key' to someone else's phone that would enable their phone's bluetooth to open the lock, similar to what August and others do.  I hope to see that feature in the future, which would be the final element to make this lock perfect.
