I used these as a 'backup' to keep my cheeses fresh, specifically, a wedge of parmeggiano reggiano bc it is costly. I prefer to store my expensive cheeses and perishables in a vacuum seal with my Foodsaver, but sometimes I can't be bothered to pull out the whole machine and go through that process.  It's faster to open a drawer and pull this out.  They work well in keeping the cheese fresh a long time.
