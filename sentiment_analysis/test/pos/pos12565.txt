It took me a few tries to get used to applying it and using it.  I have to be careful not to get it on my face or ears when applying.  Other than that its great.  It works to cover up the areas where my hair is so thin that my scalp shows through.  I am very happy that i found this product.  I am very self conscious about my thin hair and this really helps.  I dont use the finishing.  I dont seem to need it.  I apply, pat, comb, done. sometimes i use hairspray on top but the fibers stay put either way.  I was worried they would rub off but they dont at all!  The color i ordered is a little darker than my hair color, so next time i will order lighter.  But even the darker color blended well and wasnt noticeable. If you look closely it might look like my roots are a little darker than my ends.  It even seems to help cover my grey hair a little.
