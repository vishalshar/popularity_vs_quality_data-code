If there ever is a Rise of the Machines, this little guy is gonna be trouble. He looks sweet and fun, but just ask my dogs...This little guy is the Devil. He runs, hides, changes directions and can break into a light show driven dance on a whim. My Shero is named Ajax, and he runs circles around anything he wants. His green hue is perfect for hiding when he plays in the grass. Gone is the era of being the lonely cat lady (or grouchy old man)...enter the new era where Sphero runs wild!
