We've had a few glitches with our Smart Keypad. I don't know if this is because we bought refurbished or not, but everytime, we just troubleshooted and it was good to go. This product is amazing for when you have friends or family coming to visit. Even better if you have rental property. You can have multiple codes to unlock the door.Keep in mind you do need the August smart lock to use this product. The design is great and lightweight to fit on or around your door. Really as long as it's close you can put it wherever you want it.
