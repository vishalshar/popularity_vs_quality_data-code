When I use this product, my brushes not only dry straight, but they also dry quicker. Thanks to the way that the guard dries the brushes, it keeps the bristles tight and my makeup applies much more smoothly. I used to only use the guard when drying my brushes, but since it keeps them in such a nice shape, I just store them with the guard on at all times now. I love this product so much that I have purchased enough guards for ALL of my brushes. Trust me, it'll save you money in the long run! Quick Tip: When I dry my brushes using the brush guards, I also use small hair elastics to hang them upside down from a hanger. They're dry in about 3 hours!
