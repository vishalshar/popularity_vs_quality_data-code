I play light to meadium-heavy Euro games mostly, with some word and party games in between. SHH is a great word game that will appeal to gamers and non-gamers alike, because it has interesting mechanics, it is smart, and it is challenging, but it has simple rules and takes a short amount of time to play. The main challenge of SHH comes from the fact that players cannot communicate about the word that they are trying to build. In a two-player game, this is not such a big problem, as you know exactly the consonants that the other person has in their hand (vowels are shared, but consonants are divided up to go in each player's hand), but it is very difficult to know who has what in a game with more than two players. It is difficult to imagine building a word NOT with the letters in your own hand, but just including, say, A SINGLE letter from your hand and NONE other... SHH is also a great game to play with children. Our 11-year-old cousin loved this game, even though it proved to be challenging and we did horribly in one game and did pretty well in another run. The images on the cards, the round corners, the tiny "lip stick size" container are all great design features that make this game a good gift, good "filler game" in gamer talk, good stocking stuffer, etc.Highly recommended for those who like cooperative games and word games and games that fit in your pocket or purse.
