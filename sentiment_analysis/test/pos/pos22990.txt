Admittedly, I am late to the world of 3D printing. But being a creative person, I gave in to the lure. What's more, I was looking for something to take me away from the screens on my various digital devices. All I can say is, what took me so long? The Doodler is fun, easy and, best of all, DIFFERENT. I am not the most technically minded person, but after about 15 or 20 minutes, I got the hang of it. Here is what I would suggest if you are thinking about getting one (or gifting to friend or family). Go to their website and watch a brief video so you'll know what you're getting. And when yours arrives, read the instructions carefully before you attempt to do it. You'll save yourself a little time and a lot of frustration. Included are photos of my first two efforts--a ring and a duck (why not?). As we are expecting out of town visitors and their tween daughter, I suspect our next creation will be a family project: a tiara. Again, it takes a lot to drag us away from our computers these days, but this is a great hands-on art project. It's not a toy, but it's totally entertaining.
