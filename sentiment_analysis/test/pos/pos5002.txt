Summary:This is an expensive feeder, one of the more expensive ones on Amazon. This feeder does a lot of things right and is likely the best option. In the end you're happy you got it since it does the job and does it well, but you're left wanting more for your money (I will repeat this many times below).I did my research and it's unlikely any product currently exists (this could change) that gives you a better value without sacrificing features, so this is your best bet by a mile. It's worth it, but it needs improvements to remain the best on the market.--The Good--Customer service: My unit arrived with a dead power brick and some other weird issues, I email'ed support at ~7pm on a Monday night and I revived a response within an hour. I was directly called by Marissa (CEO) an hour or so later. I was sent a return label and was shipped a whole new unit promptly. Awesome support.Has a Camera: Web viewing that works on mobile / desktop. Keep in mind there is no "app" you would use Safari, Chrome, etc on your mobile device. More on the camera later.Air tight seal: This is awesome for kitten or pups who are too smart for their own good. It is next to impossible for anything without human thumbs to open the feeder. I previously invested in a cheaper feeder and my kitten would be able to reach up a conveyor belt and knock more food out whenever he wanted.Ease of setup: Super easy, especially if your router supports WPS. It takes maybe 10 minutes to set this thing up.Ease of use: Fill the food dishes with portions for your pet, set the schedule, and you're done. Just remember to re-fill the dishes every day or so.Web UI: Easy to use and works well on mobile--The MEH--No mobile app: Although mobile web is nice, for $200 you really should be getting a fully featured mobile app that allows more functionalityOne recorded greeting: As far as I know there is only one stored greeting. For the $200 you will be spending you should really be able to record multiple clips and play them from the mobile appOne speaker: When you look at the back of the unit it appears that there are two speaker grills but only the left one emits sound. It appears the one on the right is for input (maybe?), which just seems odd. The speaker is also not very loud. For $200 I'd expect better speakersVery low res camera: With how cheap camera sensors and components are these days, I was really expecting a better camera. I don't expect a 4K camera or 1080p but something better than this. I've attached a picture of my kitten during mid-day. It is quite blurry and really should be better quality than a 2009 webcam. Again, for the $200 investment you are making in the feeder, you expect a little more.No night vision: This was a little annoying. I don't expect much on this but being able to see nothing in the dark is just a little annoying. A little light near the camera to turn on would help capture an image in the dark.No notification when food dishes are empty: This would be an awesome feature. The dish has 6 slots to put food, every 5th or 6th feeding, the feeder should remind you to refill the dishes with food for your furbaby.
