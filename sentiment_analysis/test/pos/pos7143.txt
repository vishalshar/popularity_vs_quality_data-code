I got this for my parents and it's been a hit.  The Dr's found the long term data it provides very helpful and made some treatment changes based on it.  Without this product an intermittent blood pressure problem would not have been accurately diagnosed.Customer service was great as well.  They had an initial shipment snafu but the company fixed it quickly and without any fuss.
