Works as expected.  No leaking from the top or bottom, though somehow I occasionally dribble water on myself from the top nozzle.  (I have the blue and black one and it happens with both, so maybe it's just me...)  I don't notice an overwhelming plastic taste/smell.  Good deal for the price.Update after using it for a while... if there's a lot of condensation on the outside - or if you drip water down the bottle while filling it, water will pool in the bottom.  Then, when you drink it, the water will drip on you.  Also, it doesn't keep water as cold as some other bottles I've had.  Still a decent product for the price and I like that it's clean!Update:  I've owned this (two of them) for 3 1/2 years and I use it weekly.  I wash it in the dishwasher (top rack) and have had no issues.  No leaks. Satisfied customer.
