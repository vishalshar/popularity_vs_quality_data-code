I'm surprised and happy to be providing a five star review! This worked so well for me I placed a second order. I like that this is in powder form. Easy to store in night stand drawer. No need to mix with water. I have chronic issues with insomnia and difficulty falling asleep and this is by far the best non-prescription option I've tried.
