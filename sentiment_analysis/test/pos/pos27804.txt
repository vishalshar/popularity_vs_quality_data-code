I bought this for my daughter who cycles around Brooklyn and wanted her to be visible at all times, the review in Uk is good and with rechargeable batteries and 360 visibility I'm hoping this does mean she is lit up well when cycling at night. Excellent idea not sure why other makers hadn't thought of this before. She is very pleased with it
