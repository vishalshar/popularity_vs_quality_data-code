It takes a year of use for a good review so here ya go:Replaced quicklace system on several pairs of Salomon shoes, women's size 9. Two outdoor, trail, wet grass pairs and one clean, city pair.Salomon eyelets are made for thin cable-like laces so Hickies were very difficult to get through the channels. I had to use tools to poke them through. I put undue stress on the Hickies while poking, pulling, and stretching through a tight opening made for a thin, hard string. One broke in the process and Hickies was more than happy to replace with an entire set. Now, a year later, ONE Hickie has broken. It was the highest on the shoe, the one that gets stretched the most. That is a good track record.With me, regular laces need double knots and the Salomon quicklace would need tightening as the shoe got older. The Hickies have never needed adjusting.My friend saw these and bought them for her husband with Parkinson's disease.Perhaps a dry review but quick and to the point. They are worth every star to me.
