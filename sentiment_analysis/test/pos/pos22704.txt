Really, this thing is smart.  Gave it to my son for tracking all his activities.  He plays water polo  and swim competitively this thing knows when he turns in the pool or when he changes strokes.  How?  He can track his activities when playing competitive tennis as well and once used to it, he doesn't even know it is there.  It is an awesome way to track all your training etc.
