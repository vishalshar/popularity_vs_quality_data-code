There are a lot of people giving it one star, because they are backers who have not gotten theirs yet, and feel cheated because they are selling on Amazon.  I don't blame them for feeling cheated, but there are only shooting themselves in the foot.  No one wants to spend $400 on a cooler with a ton of negative reviews.  If they don't sell retail, they cannot get the extra money they need to make the backers coolers.  They spent a lot of money on design and ran into a lot of delays that cost more money.  This was a huge project.  The creator did not have experience managing a project of this scale, nor did they have a lot of experience getting an idea from paper to product.  He spent more then he realized he would have to spend and ran out of money.  It happens.  It's very unfortunate, and I don't blame people for being mad.  I would be too, but they are only delaying things more by scaring retail customers away.  So when deciding if you want to buy, ignore the people who give it one star because they didn't get theirs.  Read the ones from people who actually know the product.  A lot are good.  Some are bad.  Make your choice based on those reviews.  Right now, this cooler is at a great price and Amazon only has so many left.  I suggest you buy.  With that said, here is my review...I've had my cooler for 10 months now.  I've taken it camping, family outings, boat rides, etc.  It's powered through every time.  It makes perfect drinks.  It really keeps things cold as well.  We went to a wedding about 7 hours away and decided to make it a road trip.  We put some food and drink in there and put ice on top.  It kept it cold the whole way up there.  Not only that, but the next morning, drinks were still ice cold even though the cooler had been in the car on a summer day.  This is more then just a cooler with a built in blender.  Lets list the pros:1. Keeps things ice cold for a long time.  It even kept up with a Yeti cooler for awhile, and that Yeti was more expensive.  More expensive and it didn't even have all the other features.  It just kept things cold.  The Coolest cooler does that very well.  Unless you need something that will keep things cold for 3 days in 100 degree heat because you cannot get more ice, this one is still the better buy.2.  The blender works like a champ.  It was specifically designed to make frozen drinks.  You cannot say that about most blenders on the market.  This blender could be used at party to make drinks, and it will do it better then your average blender.  Also, a normal blender that can make perfect frozen drinks, doesn't work off battery.  This one does.3. The battery lasts a long time.  I believe I did about 10 pitchers of drinks before, I had to swap out the battery with the extra I had charged.  I bought the extra thinking I would need it, but I don't make 10 pitchers of drinks in one sitting.  I can get away with one.  I will say it is nice to have the second one, so I can do a quick swap in the event I forget to charge the one that's in there and it runs down unexpectedly.4. Charging port.  You can charge your phone, the included Bluetooth speaker, iPad, or other devices that can charge off USB.  Obviously this will use some of that battery power I mentioned before, so if you are going to do a lot of charging and blending a lot of drinks at the same time, it might not be a bad idea to get the second battery.5. The Bluetooth speaker sounds great.  It does vibrate a lot if you are playing something with a lot of bass.  It vibrates itself right off the end of the table.  The simple fix is to turn down the volume or adjust the bass levels on your audio device.6.  Big wheels.  Its nice to have the big wheels because it's easier to go over rugged terrain or up steps.7. Included bottle opener and cork screw.  Not everyone at a party wants a frozen drink.  So having a bottle opener and cork screw is convenient so you don't have to remember to bring one.8. Tie down strap.  I've used this and it has come in handy as well.  I have packed on camping equipment, folding chairs, luggage, etc.9. Convenient storage of plates and knife.  I only wish there was a way to store more then four.10. Quality.  This thing does not look like its going to fall apart in the next century.  I think this is where the creator probably spend most of the money on materials.  I think he might have been able to go cheaper with some of the materials and gotten away with it, but he didn't.  Because he didn't go cheaper, I have an solid product.Cons:1. Heavy.  Even without anything in it, it's heavy.  When you add drinks and ice in there, it's even heavier.  This is where those big wheels come in handy.  I am not sure how they could shave off weight without compromising the power of the blender motor or how well it keeps things cold, so I'm OK with the weight.2. The left lid (which houses the blender motor) has something rolling around in there.  This could be a rock or something that got in through the battery compartment (which has holes in it, probably for air circulation) or it could be an internal screw that came loose.  I don't know because I cannot take it apart.  The screws are covered with these white plastic tabs that are darn near impossible to get out.  Since I cannot get them out, I cannot get to the screws to unscrew them and take the lid apart..  I'm trying to work towards a solution to this with Coolest support, but they've been a bit slow to respond to my emails.  In their defense, it does take me some time to get back to them as well.  Despite whatever is in there, the blender works just fine.That's all I can think of for now.  A lot of people might look at it and say, I'll never use it, but trust me, you will.  It can be used at any outdoor gathering such as tailgating, family reunions, picnics, boat rides, camping trips, BBQ, parties, etc.
