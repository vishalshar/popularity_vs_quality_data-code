I have to say, I did like this product, but for what it is I find it to be a lot more expensive than it needs to be. I DO like that they put a small amount of folic acid in this product, but note that it is not the full amount of folic acid recommended for women trying to conceive. It does mix very well into any liquid, hot or cold. It has absolutely no taste, when mixed with water you absolutely cannot tell there is a supplement in your water and I really do enjoy that, however pure myoinositol powder is MUCH less expensive than this product. In this case, you are paying for the Premama name, not really the product. After I finished this product I was able to find 1lb of myoinositol powder from Now foods, priced just about ten dollars more than this, with months more servings in it. I will link it here Now Foods Inositol Pure Powder, 1 LB As a matter of fact I still have about 75% of that powder left, because I am 6 weeks pregnant as of this writing. Whether or not this inositol product helped, I couldn't tell you but it certainly couldn't hurt to try.
