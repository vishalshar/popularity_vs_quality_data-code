A bit pricey but beautiful and different. Great warm light and energy saving. Stays cool to the touch (maybe slightly above body temperature).  No latency before the light comes on - feels like incandescent light; but prettier! We have it installed currently on a mid-century-modern arco light and it just looks the part.
