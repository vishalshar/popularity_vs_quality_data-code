This is a great sounding unit for its size. Water, dust, sand, snow, no matter what your outdoor activities are, this unit works well. It actually has some weight to it as well! It has a lot of available things that you can get for it to make it stay on a backpack or wherever you would like. The battery life is amazing! At first, I didnt think it was loud enough so I went to Fugoo's web site and they have new firmware /  software update that makes it much louder while keeping the good sound.  Number 1.00.36. It was a big time improvement!Is there some better sounding units out there? Sure but, they are bigger in size, not as portable, battery life is nowhere near what this is, as well as not water, dust, sand, snow resistant. If you need a unit that can stand up to the outside elements, this is it.
