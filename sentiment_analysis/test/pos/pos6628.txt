I cooked eggs with this and made stir fry marinated chicken and Eggpplants. Let me say, this is absolutely wonderful. It gives my body the healthy fats it needs while keeping me satietated. I haven't felt so satisfied and full at the same time while not feeling fatigue. Usually when I feel full, I want to take a nap but this truly changed how I feel. As if it gives me additional energy. Whenever I use oils like vegetables, corn, or canola (Most likely GMO esp. corn and too much Omega 6 over omega 3s), my mind and body feels busted after consuming food cook in them. Absolutely busted and out of it. Anyone in need of healthy fats and don't want to munch on nuts all day, use this to cook or drizzle on your salad. In addition this avocado oil is wholesome and not diluted like other oils on the market. Hopefully it isn't. Maybe 5 years down the road when this oil becomes more main stream, there will be companies that produce a cheaper version of an inferior avocado oil.
