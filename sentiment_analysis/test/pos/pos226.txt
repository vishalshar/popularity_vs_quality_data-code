I switched from conventional antiperspirants/deodorants to "natural" products many years ago. However, I recently realized that the brand I'd been using wasn't really doing anything. I don't really smell, so it wasn't a huge issue. I did decide I wanted to change to something better. I read a ton of reviews all over the internet and decided to try Primal Pit Paste. I'm glad I did. The application is simple - I make sure I hold the pea sized amount against my skin before rubbing in. It works really well. I use unscented and by the end of the day I still smell like...nothing. I believe it might also provide some moisture relief. I haven't had any skin irritation, and I have very sensitive skin. That is actually why I switched from the conventional stuff.One thing I do want to address is the concept of a "detox." Yeah, your underarms do go through a change when you switch from antiperspirant to natural stuff. However, it isn't like what I keep seeing described by a lot of natural companies - including PPP. The "detox" is really just a few days of really gross sweat. I knew it was going to happen, so I made the change when I could drink a lot of water and sweat out whatever was plugged up. I think the biggest misconception I've seen is that the redness/irritation/rash from the baking soda is somehow a detox. It isn't. Your body is just acclimating to the chemicals in the natural product.
