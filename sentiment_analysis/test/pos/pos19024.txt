This pack is fantastic! I love it. I bought it, along with the new Polar Pro Cinema series filters, for a trip I took out to Colorado last week and man am I glad I did.  For anyone that loves to hike and loves to drone this bag is perfect.  And when I say hike I mean legitimate intense hikes. I basically replaced my REI pack with this. First the compact size of this is fantastic and much less bulky than my previous P3 bag.  It looks like a regular size back pack, maybe a little larger.  I was able to carry it on as a personal item (not even carry on bag for overhead storage) that fits under the seat on my flight, which was crucial if you've ever flown Frontier who,only includes a personal item.  The departments are unbelievable and well designed.  The main pocket fit my Phantom 4, props, extra battery, small zip pocket perfect for three filter lenses, the pack rain cover that comes with it, pouch for my iPad and other small things, and room to spare.  Then you have another big zip department.  I guess a lot of people out their computers in here, but it can be used for just about anything.  I actually put a camel back water reservoir, snacks, etc in it and it worked perfect. Then there are the side pouches, zip pocket, and straps where you can put stuff. Then it is so ergonomic, especially for hiking which is very important.  The waist band is very durable, and wide and comfortable and actually serves its purpose to distribute weight to hips which was crucial, as I took this thing on several "strenuous hikes" with steep grades where you're elevating several thousand feet.  The chest strap may go unnoticed but that is also very crucial and was very important for comfort on the hikes.  The best part is is I had the comfort knowing how stable the equipment was being held on the inside. All in all the pack is great and can wait to use it again.  It's great for carrying around your drone etc even if not hiking. The Cinema series lenses were great and I will review them later. I do regret forgetting to buy the gimbal lock from Polar Pro that fits all the lenses, as the DJI stock one did not and I had to switch the original lense back every time I went to transport/hike.  But all and all I am so happy I bought it for my trip.
