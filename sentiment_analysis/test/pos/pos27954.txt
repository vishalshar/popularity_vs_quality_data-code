Purchased these headphones when my old ones (Beats by Dre) broke. Below are some of my general feedback:- The sound/clarity is good- Not advertised as noise cancelling, but it does a great job of noise isolation/blocking out external noise (Great for walking around cities like NYC)- They are, of course, over the ear headphones which itself is bulky. But the traveling case make it simple to get around.- Super comfortable (compared to Beats by Dre and Sony). Also work well to keep my ears warm in cold weather!- Taking phone calls works perfectly- Design is great, very minimalistic, but catchy.- Price point compared to others is excellent.The headphones are great for what they are, over the ear headphones for every day activities. I hope to see more come from this company for different uses (working out for instance).Plugged - Crown, Over the Ear Headphones with Mic - Black/Gold
