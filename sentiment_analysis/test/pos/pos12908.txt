Omygoddddddddddd.. I couldn believe this. Its totally awesome with respect to size, portability, clarity and quality. I ordered almost 3 projectors from amazon and had to return them coz of bad quality... was totally tired of choosing the best and finally thought of giving a try for RIF6 CUBE.. When i received them I was 1st impressed by its design as it was cute small and strong. Then with the multiple cables they have provided that was perfect for my MAC to plugin. Finally i played my movies and was unbelievable that the clarity was perfect... I totally love this and started promoting this to my friends :P :P The inbuilt speakers where equally good though i used my bose external speakers for more volume.
