As a mom of two little kids, I rarely get the opportunity to spend time on myself. I also hesitate to spend too much money on myself, unfortunately - a good childrens sale doesn't get a second thought ...  That's not something to be proud of but it sets the stage for my hesitation to spend almost sixty dollars to do something I've been doing since I was 6 months old - sitting up. Unfortunately, the amount of sitting I do is minimal but when I'm at my computer (ordering things off of Amazon, of course!) or after bedtime watching TV I just want to MELT into the chair and I feel the tension in my neck, shoulders and most recently sometimes in my lower back. That doesn't make for a comfortable sleep later on, which makes me tired the next day wanting to slouch even MORE.  Well, I splurged for this thinking I'd rather spend sixty dollars now than sixty thousand later for risky back surgery and put it on ten minutes ago. Plus, with Amazons return policy it was no risk.  This thing is the most comfortable chair I've ever sat in. I automatically felt my neck go into position and my back fully supported.It looked a little intimidating with the pads and the straps when I opened it up but after 30 seconds reading the actual instructions to put it on, it was amazing. She's thought of everything from the kneepads to the case to the clip in between your legs to be even more comfortable. When I first saw her on Shark Tank explaining it I was wowed but wouldn't spend more than double what her cost is to make it HOWEVER know I truly think this thing is worth every penny - and more.  It's quality, comfort and convenience and feels GREAT.  You won't be disappointed, buy it now.
