This wipes work great for an occasion where you might need to shower but you don't have access to a shower.  One body wipe was able to clean my body sufficiently.  I would recommend doing your privates till the very end.  The smell is great and does not leave you smelling like a baby wipe or medicine cabinet.  4 stars because I think they are a bit pricey.
