My dog is slowly reaching his senior years, though still considered an adult, and I dont want to lose him. Ive been noticing that hes been very lazy, lethargic, and gaining weight  as many middle-aged beings tend to be :) So I thought  okay, Ill give this a whirl.I seriously felt silly buying this. What am I doing, buying this gimmick? I thought; but the reviews talked me into giving this a try, anyway.So now weve been using it. Its been a number of weeks now, and we are THRILLED. The app could definitely use some work, it definitely takes a bit too long to fetch and load and all of that, but thats peanuts, and the device itself is awesome. Were thrilled. And tired. :DIn the picture: Boo, my dog, with his fashionable FitBark, after a grueling workout :)
