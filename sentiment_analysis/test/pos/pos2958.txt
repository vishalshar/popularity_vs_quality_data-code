I'm drinking number one. I ordered these for breakfast and the regular soylent for lunches. So far so good. A lot of people said it takes a little to adjust to the taste. Not so much. I thinks its fine right out of the gate. Pleasant coffee taste like one of those canned espresso drinks. The surprise is the texture. I thought it would be much thicker. Very watery.
