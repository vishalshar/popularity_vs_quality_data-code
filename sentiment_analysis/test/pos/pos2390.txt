I am a long-term picc paitent so over the years I have tried several picc covers. Suprisingly there's more to it then you might think. This one ranks as probably my second favorite, and the best for active use. The mesh cutout on this one is the key to keeping my dressing dry while being more active and sweating. As I am (like I'm sure many other patients) on several medications which increase perspiration, this is especially important. Otherwise, this sleeve works well and keeps my line and extension tucked away. My only complaint is that when I'm infusing, it doesn't do as well since the IV line doesn't stay put.
