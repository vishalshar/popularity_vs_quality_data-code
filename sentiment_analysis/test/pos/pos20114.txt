I bought this soap for my teenager, suffering from acne. I have tried so many things OTC and RX, but nothing worked. Also tried Black African soap with no success. I have first purchased charcoal soap from Herbivore, but I like SAPO soap a lot better. I compared the ingredients of the two, and the activated charcoal is number one ingredient in SAPO. This soap has greatly improved my son's acne at just a fraction of what I had spent on all the acne treatments.  Great product and great company standing behind their product.
