Love it! The fire tv remote is great but such a hassle to deal with two remotes for something as simple as volume. Learning function works with any button from any device and great for tv, stereo etc. Size is good once you get used to it. 4 stars because it's so pricey for such a basic remote; almost costs as much as the Fire stick itself!
