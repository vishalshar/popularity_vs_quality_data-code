There are so many uses for these.  I've bought 15 so far.  However, I have had 2 mishaps with them.  Dropped one reCAP and the tab on the cap broke off.  On another the hing for the cap broke off.  So, I bought 1 more reCAP to replace the broken pieces on the 2 damaged caps. They can be really hard to get the caps threaded, but with persistence and patience they will seal tightly.
