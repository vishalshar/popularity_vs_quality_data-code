I love the light taste and high smoke point of Thrive Oil. We will use it on a regular basis. We don't do any baking but sprinkled on salads, alone or mixed in a dressing and used in pan frying for cutlets, stir fry, with fish etc.  the oil is terrific. I always felt olive oil was too heavy and especially for cooking eggs. Thrive is excellent. And of course, it's health profile can't be beat.
