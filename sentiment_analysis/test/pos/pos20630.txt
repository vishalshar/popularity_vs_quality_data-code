So, I've had the new generation, Atlas Wristband 2, for a few weeks now. Unlike my Gen 1 Atlas which began collecting dust in my drawer shortly after I posted my original review, the new Atlas is an integral part of my workout -- okay, maybe "integral" is a little on the heavy side, but workouts without it are just not the same. I always make sure it's in my gym bag.Anyway, so here's what's changed that boosted my 1-star review to 4-stars:- First, and perhaps the biggest and most important change in my eyes: LEARNING MODE! This time around, Atlas really will learn new exercises, and you can teach it how YOU perform an exercise. This was, by far, the biggest draw back of the Gen 1, in my opinion. You were limited to 50 exercises -- though they were actively adding more -- but now you can teach your Atlas any exercise you want regardless of whether you use a barbell, dumbbells, TRX, a machine, or your body weight. What else could you possibly ask from a fitness tracker? It knows a solid number of basic exercises if you're new to weightlifting, and if happen to be Arnold himself and sometimes literally invent new exercises, that's fine -- you can teach it all your nifty little tricks. If you scroll down to my old review, you'll notice this change solves most of the issues I had with Atlas (namely, that you couldn't teach it your form, or new exercises; thus, it was a very constraining accessory).- In my old review I said Heart Rate Mode doesn't always display your heart rate, and that often times it was easier and faster to just hold the sensors on the treadmill. That's no longer the case. Heart Rate Mode consistently shows your heat rate, as well as time, and calories burnt.Why I didn't give it 5-stars:- I have yet to be able to fully track a leg day with Atlas. Obviously, Atlas can track anything that involves your wrist moving in some kind of way, leg presses, hamstring curls, and calf raises, often require your wrist be still. I attempted to stuff Atlas in my shoe's high top and teaching Atlas exercises that way, but ended up getting an error when teaching the exercise. Today, I fixed Atlas to the axis of the machines I was using when the exercises called for no wrist movement (leg press, and hamstring curl) and had a lot more success with it. It took a few tries, but Atlas eventually did manage to learn both of those exercises. Personally, I don't quite mind that Atlas won't be tracking my heart rate when I fix it to the axis of a machine since I can track it with my Apple Watch just on leg day, but it might be an issue for others that don't have that option.- Battery life is OK. It'll never die on you in the middle of a workout as long as it's fully charged. I've even gotten through a full workout with 45% charge, but I definitely recommend charging it after every workout. To me, this isn't a huge deal. Just beware: don't expect to charge Atlas once a week or something, keep a charger in your car or gym bag.- Spotting a partner often results in faulty readings. You gotta cut Atlas some slack here, though. Spotting a partner on bench press is basically the exact motion of doing a deadlift, so certain things are just too nit-picky. I just wish there was a "Delete Set" or "Clear Set" button on the Wristband itself so you could quickly adjust those mistakes as you go. Atlas did say they will likely include this in coming updates, which I look forward to; and thus, I'm not too bothered by that issue knowing that there's a likely fix coming soon. In the meantime, you can fix that in your Dashboard, or, what I often do, is simply drop the number of reps of whatever exercise it thought I was doing to 0 pounds for 0 reps.- Apple Health syncing is not yet integrated, but it's coming, so -- again -- not too big a deal.Overall, The Atlas Wristband 2 is what I expected when I originally ordered my Atlas -- and it's awesome. It is exactly what I wanted. A tracker that will just that -- track. Track without me having too think too much about it. After a set, I simply input the weight. When, for whatever reason, I forget to do this, I can just go back and do it on my phone. I love the analytics that are immediately available to you as soon as you sync your Atlas, and the summary you get via email at the end of the week with all kinds of useful information (highest weight used, best form performed in which exercises, and worst form performed in which exercises, whether you focused on toning or bulking, etc.) The 2nd generation's memory can also handle a slightly larger load of exercises, which is nice for those of us who don't plan out workouts. Typically, I sync my exercises on my way to the gym or once I get there since it only takes a few minutes. Just select those which pertain to the muscle group you are doing and let Atlas do the rest. Getting Atlas to a point where it knows most of your exercises and you get to personalize your form on the ones it does know that you do differently will take a few weeks. An annoying part of that process is that teaching exercises will end your current session, resulting in several "workouts" being record during one actual workout. Once Atlas is up to speed, though, it's great. I would definitely recommend this product to a anyone looking for a weightlifting fitness tracker.PREVIOS REVIEW (For Atlas' Gen 1 band):I bought this product directly from their website. The attached picture is proof that I own it.I pre-ordered this product and had very high hopes for it. After 2 weeks of use, I feel confident in reviewing the device.The device has stellar potential. The idea is that it will count your reps, and it will know the exercise you're doing, without you actually having to do anything but the exercise itself. Naturally, you have to input the weight you're using manually, since there's no way for the device to know. However, my reason for a one-star review is as follows:- The company marketed the device saying that Atlas would learn your form and you would be able to teach it exercises. This function is not yet available -- but you wouldn't know that from looking at their website (see attached picture.) Therefore, you're left with only 50 trackable exercises. Of those 50, you can chose 15 per workout to load into your Atlas before you start your workout -- if you don't do this, it can't track your exercises. In other words, if you don't plan your workouts before you go to the gym, this is not for you. Atlas' very limited list of exercises lacks very essential ones, such as: Lat pull down, incline bench press, tricep pull/push down, diamond push ups, preacher curls, 21's of any variety, and every single machine is not trackable except for the cable row.- You have to perform the exercises exactly how Atlas thinks they should be performed. The device will not learn/recognize your form. Everybody performs exercise differently, some of us have developed enhancements over the years and Atlas will not be able to recognize those. As a matter of fact, if your hands are not exactly where Atlas wants them to be to perform a crunch or a sit-up, it won't track it. So forget about reaching for the sky on decline sit-ups to maximizing that burn (Don't worry, Atlas can't track decline sit-ups, anyway). It will A) Not count the rep or B) Count as a totally different exercise.- It does not track all the exercises it does know perfectly. It's supposed to know when you're doing dumbbell curls, and even when you switch to alternating dumbbell curls. It often messes this up. It also has a lot of trouble differentiating between barbells and dumbbells. I will say, though, when it does track correctly, it's pretty awesome.- You cannot track the exercises it doesn't know -- not even manually. All you can do is log them as, "Other." You cannot go back even in your phone app to edit the actual name.- Heart rate mode does not always display your heart rate. I would say about 2/3 of the time it's calculating your heart rate. Most of the time I get tried of waiting for it and just hang on to the sensors on the treadmill. It does not count steps, either, just heart rate, time, and calories burnt.Now the biggest reason I gave it 1-star:- 2 weeks into owning my Atlas, it stopped syncing with my phone. Over a few days before it totally stopped syncing, I noticed that it was missing certain days I worked out; finally, it just stopped syncing with my phone. I reached out to Atlas about this and they walked me through a short troubleshooting process. We could not get it synced with my iPhone so they said they would need to replace the device. The device has not been replaced yet because apparently they have a "High number of tickets."Basically, at $250, I expected to receive a finished product. If you look at Atlas' social media it is flooded with question being answered with, "We're working on that for the next update..." So my recommendation is wait it out on this one. The tracker is not a finished product. The company back-tracked the release of the band multiple times and ultimately ended up rushing to get the orders out to their backers and you can definitely see the repercussions of that. Once you've used the band it is yours; returns are only for bands that have not been used yet.
