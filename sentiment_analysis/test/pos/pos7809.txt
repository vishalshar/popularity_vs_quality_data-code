Xylitol is great. I use it as a direct replacement for sugar. I have heated it to make toffee (it needs to be a little hotter than conventional sugar). I have made ice cream with it and it works great. It tastes just like sugar, but is actually healthy. I keep it on a top shelf so my dogs can't get it. (Xylitol is deadly to dogs!)
