My girlfriend loves it! I got this for her for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. It looks awesome, she gets a ton of compliments and she really enjoys the period tracking and "stress resistance" estimation it gives you based on your steps, activity level, amount of sleep, amount of sex, and where she is in her cycle.The one thing we aren't to sure about is how accurate the pedometer is. She is a server so when she's on her feet for 6-8 hours a day running around, she is often surprised that she only seems to log 6-8,000 steps those days. Fitbits seem to be way more sensitive, so we're not sure which to believe. That and she has an Android phone and the initial set-up/sync process was very difficult (the manufacture concedes this much in the set up guide), and we weren't able to get it synced to her phone until the next day after trying all the troubleshooting steps they recommended numerous times. Kinda killed the initial excitement but she loves using it now.TL;DR girlfriend loves it, very stylish and useful. Unsure how accurate the pedometer is and had trouble syncing with her Android phone.
