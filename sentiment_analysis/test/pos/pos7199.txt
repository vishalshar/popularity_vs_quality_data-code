As other have stated, this works.  It's rock solid and very secure.  I have done two 35+ mile mountain bike rides on some of the roughest trails in the area and have no issues with this.  I have even gone over jumps with this on and my phone doesnt even move.  I had my reservations at first but after an OTB crash with my bars doing a 180, the phone was fine.  It didn't even move.  The only issue I had with this was with my edge to edge ballistic glass screen protector. The case pushed on the sides of the screen protector causing it to raise a little.  The screen protector was on its way out anyways as it was over a year old and had some dirt under it causing it to lose its adhesiveness.  The rain guard is kind of annoying to get on and off and useless if you want to take a photo.  I dont ride with it on.  I mainly bought this to use with strava live segments.  For live segments this works really well.  You get a very large display to see where you are.  Other than strava this is handy to just have quick easy access to your phone.
