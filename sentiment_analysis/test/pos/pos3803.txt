Overall this is a very nice wireless fence system. In the past you had to dig trenches and make sure that you weren't going to cut through any of your existing wires or pipes before you could install a wireless fence. It was either time-consuming or very expensive. Now you can set up a wireless fence for your dog in a matter of minutes without any extra expense or trouble.This unit uses a radio broadcast system.  You are effectively running your own radio station that broadcasts in a circle in the area of your yard. Anytime your dog moves out of range the collar begins to beep at him and if the dog moves far enough out of range it will shock him.This is a very simple and elegant design but it does have its problems. The main one being that if you ever forget to take your dog's collar off and leave your house, the dog is shocked constantly after you leave the broadcast area and until you realize it and take the collar off or 15 seconds.The old design would have only shocked the dog briefly as you crossed over the fence line. But this design will shock the dog a great bit more. Until you can get the collar off. Of course this shouldn't happen at all or at least not very often.There are huge trade offs though, the largest one being that this unit is now portable.  You can set up this unit in a matter of minutes at a campsite, a vacation spot, or a friends house. It is great when we go on vacation we leave our dog with our in-laws and we set this up at their house. It greatly relieved us knowing that even if they are careless, or just not used to having a dog to watch, that this dance will help keep our dog from running off. I will list a few pros and cons below.Also, if the radio quits broadcasting during a power outage, your dog's collar still has a battery on it and since it is not receiving a radio broadcast would probably be again shocking him. You may want to put a and uninterrupted power supply on your wireless fence base station. This would also make sure your dog could not run off during a power outage. But probably more importantly it would keep from shocking your dog during a power outage.Pros:Easy to set up;Fast to set up;Well made;Portable!Cons...Proprietary battery design;Large collar for some dogs, our dog is a 10# Pom and the collar is very large for him;Expensive;You must remember to remove collar.***Dog could be shocked if power outage occurs.***  Update: System is apparently designed to recognize outage and not shock dog, except for possible correction if he/she is near the boundary at this time.Overall,  I feel like that the advantages that you get with this design far outweigh the negative's. I would recommend this and we use it for our dog regularly. One great thing is that eventually once you have your dog trained, it doesn't even have to have his collar on to know his boundaries and usually will stay with in the yard even if the fence is not activated. Your mileage may vary depending on your dog.
