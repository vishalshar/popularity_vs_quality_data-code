This just sounded so good-- I am a Nutella fan, but I also am a peanut butter fan.  The idea of having something that was both was intriguing.  Do not expect this to taste like chocolate--the predominate taste and texture is definitely peanut butter, with a back taste of chocolate and even slighter coconut. It is delicious!
