Done dropped it in any way you could imagine still in good condition. I liked that u really gotta put ur fingers to it to get the ipad in so that means if it falls it aint gonna pop right out the case like experiences that i had in the past. I also like the way the buttons are set up in the back its easy for my 3year old to turn off and put volume down before he couldnt even put the valume down with previous cases. Keep up the good work vakoo
