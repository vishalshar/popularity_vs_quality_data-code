Ok, here's the deal. This is the cheapest way to dip a toe into home automation with theÂ Amazon Echo. I love my Echo, but I always want more features. With this WiFi connected power strip, I can control a living room lamp as well as turn on a radio (or other device) with a simple voice command to Alexa.  I followed the setup instructions (a little bit tricky!) according to the Wink app downloaded onto my Nexus 7 (2013). The strip is connected to your WiFi and to the Wink app in a very strange way; the app literally flashes the screen of your phone/tablet and that flashing code is used to program the power strip! This flash programming took a few tries, but eventually worked fine. To work with the Echo, you must link the Wink app to the Echo in the Alexa app on the phone/tablet. After linking, you must then instruct Alexa to discover your devices. Alexa will discover two outlets. Using the "create a group" setting in the Alexa app, you can rename each outlet to a specific device. I used the ultra-creative name "the lamp", so when I say "Alexa, turn on the lamp," that is exactly what happens! No work-arounds, no IFTTT recipes, just simple commands to Alexa.A few notes: 1) The Pivot Power Genius only has two "smart" outlets. The other two are plain old dumb outlets.2) It is a little bit on the bulky side for a power strip. No big deal to me.3) Despite what other reviews report, I used an Android device to connect and program the strip, not an iOS device.4) For $21 shipped I think Pivot Power Genius is the bargain of simple home automation!Buy one and try it out for yourself!
