Perfect fit for the controller. Note that it seems that you cannot have the cover of the controller installed with this enclosure. Not a big deal at all (in fact the cover covers up the ability to manually operate a zone and must be removed) and is actually easier to open than removing the cover to run a zone manually.The outlet inside was easy to connect and quite useful. I was able to clean up my previous controller electrical installation with this setup.
