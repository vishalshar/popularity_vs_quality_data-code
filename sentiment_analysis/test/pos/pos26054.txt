Just received this scooter today in the mail. My feedback is broken into several areas:Packaging: The box that this was shipped in was, well, cheap. The outside had some beautiful artwork showing the scooter and the logo however the packaging budget must have been spent on the outside as the inside really had very little in the way of protection for the product in side. When the box was delivered there was a huge hole in the side of the box where the engine was located. Fortunately there was not any damage to the plastic cover or the engine itself. It looks like it was caused from the movement of the scooter whilst in the box during shipping or storage. I took several pictures of the outside of the box thinking that once I opened it I would find many broken plastic parts. I was however very pleased to find that the scooter was in tact. To the manufacturers, consider using expandable foam to protect the product. I am sure a cost effective solution is available.Assembly/ Instruction Manual: The set up and instructions were very straight forward. I took about 10 minutes to check things over and ensure that it was ready to roll.The manual was fairly well written with adequate pictures and write ups. I am aware that there is an instruction video online. If I were the manufacturer, I would recommend watching it prior to attempting the setup. Not because it's difficult, but because some folks might not follow directions that are written down but would watch a video. If the customer doesn't know about it, they can't use it. A flyer printed out in the box pointing them to the set up video would be nice but not required.First ride/ break in: Took about 7 pulls to get it started but once it was going, it ran great. Allowed the bike to warm up and varied engine speed for break in. I was happy with the overall performance on flat ground and stability seemed to be just fine. I was a little underwhelmed by the lack of power at the start or to climb even small hills. I am exactly 200lbs and on anything but a perfectly flat run acceleration is barely noticeable and the bike takes considerable time to get up to speed. If you live in an area where there is a lot of hills, this may not be the best bet. That being said, this bike is more fun than a barrel of monkeys. Easy to ride. Very intuitive. The power is not something that will get you in trouble.The bike is very buzzy and has quite a bit of vibration. I would wager that you will be spending a lot of time pulling over to tighten up the handlebars and the chain. In the 20 minutes of riding, I had to tighten the handle bars 3x and the chain once.Pros: Lots of fun, great price, good design, not that loud, CARB approvedCons: Poor packaging, buzzy nature, seems like a lot of maintenance before, during, and after ride.
