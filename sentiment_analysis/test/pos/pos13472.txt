Short review:  Truly impressive headphones and an amazing bang for the buck!Long review:  Here is my take on reviewing this product. This is probably my first review of a product on Amazon ever, but I liked these headphones and their value proposition so much, that I just had to write something and share my thoughts about them.  I purchased them about two months ago and have been using them regularly ever since. As many other reviewers before me mentioned, the packaging is just exquisite. Great presentation, attention to detail, and selection of materials for a $100 product (I'd say they are very well suited for a $500 one too). When I initially got them I did a listening session using my PC (through a Fiio E17 DAC/AMP running some high res music files) comparing them to my Phillips Fidelio X2 cans (a very well regarded $300 set of open headphones) as a first comparison. That was my best point of reference at time and my thoughts were that the 1MORE's compared very well to the X2's in detail, had better mids, similar heights and slightly less prominent bass (if you are familiar with the sound signature of the Fidelio's that is not a surprise. They have a slightly v shaped frequency curve and nice, tight base). The 1MORE's sounded very neutral and detailed to me. If you are a fan of darker sound (more bass heavy) these are probably not for you. But with that being said, and the fact that I do like some bass to my music, I can safely say that these have very adequate amount of tight, crisp bass response.One thing I did from the very beginning is to make custom molded earplugs for my ears (there are online tutorials on how to do that very cheaply, $10-$15) which basically turned them into custom IEM's on a budget for me. If you don't like to bother, you have a wide selection of tips you can use at your disposal included in the package. I mostly use these when I work out so having the custom ear molds keeps them in place without any issues and isolates outside noise very well. The cord is long enough for my uses but as others mentioned it is not a 3 meter one. The cable itself seems of good quality and seems to coil a lot less compared to the pair of Senheisers I used to work out with prior to getting the 1MORE's.Now the real revelation of how good these headphones really are came to me a few weeks after I got them. In April I was able to visit the AXPONA show in Chicago, where there was a very wide selection of headphone manufacturers present. I took my 1MORE's with me to use as a point of reference and hit pretty much all the headphone stands I could. I will not go through all the details as this is already shaping up to be a very long review, so I will only mention how I think they compared to the Shure models they had on display there. I tried my headphones back to back,with same source, same amplification (same everything overall) against the SE425 ($300, dual driver), the SE535 ($500, triple driver), and the SE846 ($1000, quad driver).( I did sample their top of the line $3000 IEM's and they sounded amazing. These however were headphones that are in a completely different league, and were driven by a custom amp specifically made for them). To my ears ( disclaimer: I think I have good hearing for a beginner audiophile but am definitely not a Golden Ear, so these impressions are very personal and subjective) the 1MORE's sounded much better (in terms of detail, imaging, frequency response, and sound signature) than the SE425's, slightly better than the SE535's and pretty much on par with the SE846's. (If we assume that I was biased by the product I own, and that my hearing is not trained/developed enough to distinguish any slight difference in sound quality, I think it would be fair to say that the SE846's were a bit better. I wasn't able to pick a sound quality winner between these two models though, so they were equal to me.) Now, if you add pricing to the equation above it can be seen why I am so blown away by the 1MORE Triple Driver's.  As far as drawbacks, I do find a few. The gold colored pieces are a bit tacky for my taste, but personal taste is very subjective. The biggest issue to me is that the cables are not replaceable and the rubber section, after they split towards the ears, seems less durable. I am not sure how they will fare with longer use/abuse, but so far so good. As I said, I mainly use them for working out and have had no issues with them despite the numerous pulls and tugs, and sweat they have been through.  To sum it all up. I think these are great headphones that punch way above their weight-class considering the price. I am not affiliated with 1MORE in any way, but I do hope that this company stays profitable and is able to come up with products that offer similar value proposition in the future.
