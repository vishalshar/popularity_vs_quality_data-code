I take audio pseudo-seriously. I own Philips Fidelio X1's, Shure SE215's, and a full Polk Audio system. I appreciate a full yet clear sound.I recently transitioned into a position where I have my own office. Headphones are a no go because I need to be able to hear knocking on my door. It seemed as though, much to my dismay, the bluetooth speaker market would work best. I say that in jest because bluetooth speakers tend to be junk. I also wanted a quality unit to bring on vacations and trips.I was going to buy a Bose Soundlink 3 until I stumbled upon the RIVA Turbo X. Seeing it was on sale for $167 from $350, I thought I would try it. LOOKS/FEEL/SPECS: Combo of plastics and metal at around 3 lbs. Feels very sturdy and premium in the white coloring. Not much else to say, it gets lost in its surrounding and I want that. I like a quiet and subdued look.-45 Watts of power in a 3 driver system in this package is insanely impressive. 4 passive radiators help to fill out the sound of the unit. Loud isn't even the word I can begin to describe this speaker of this size. Extremely impressive.SOUND: Best Bluetooth speaker on the market IF you position it correctly. In my opinion, it needs to be in the corner of a room, around 3 inches from each wall, to radiate bass into the natural acoustics of the room. If you just plop this on the table and expect booming bass, you will be disappointed. You need a wall to radiate bass off of in order to get a nice full sound. The unit is definitely catered to a neutral, audiophile-esque sound signature. Bass is present but does not overpower the rest. I have never seen mids so present in a speaker such as this because voices shine here. Highs roll off a tiny bit but it is not noticeable. Clarity and separation are top notch. In all, a wonderful sound that will easily fill a room.-Volume: This thing is very loud and does not compress/clip at high volumes. Puts other units to shame. I can only keep it at 2-3 at the office-Trillium Audio does not seem to do a thing for me. I find it to be a gimmick that does not matter if you have it on or off. Turbo definitely makes the unit sound more engaging.-Bluetooth has yet to cut out sub 75 feet for meOTHER THOUGHTS:-This should have come with the $30 case like the RIVA S does. However, with the current discount, I can overlook it.-I wish it came with a remote-2 Year warranty is fantastic feature-I have not tried the splash proof claim-Battery life is too good. I have never seen anything like it for any electronic device.CONCLUSION: At $350, this unit was competitive. At $167, you will not find a better portable audio unit. I promise you that. The sound and volume is unparalleled IF IF IF you position it correctly.
