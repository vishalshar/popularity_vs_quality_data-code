This is such a great idea! The whole concept is remarkable. My son and I built it one day and then on his own he has been able to follow commands to complete the system. I wanted to buy him raspberry pi, but was afraid at 12 he wouldn't be able to figure it out on his own. By using Minecraft and the secret mission concept puts raspberry pi at his level. Thank you!!
