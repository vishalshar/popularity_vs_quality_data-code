Bought this for my 6 YO son.  Over all this is a fun toy for any child... and a good alternative to having a real pet (As long as the raptor does not leave dead batteries on the floor). Roam mode is functional, but limited. Play mode is best... my son likes to put his finger in the raptors mouth and play Tug-Of-War for a long time.The only big issue I have is that the program for the Bluetooth has connection issues and disconnects a lot. This could be solved through program updates on the software for my android, but not sure if the manufacturer is willing to fix the issue.
