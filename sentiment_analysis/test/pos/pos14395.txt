Beautiful, functional luggage for 2-3 night stays!I travel every couple of weeks for work and needed a good quality carry-on that can hold my laptop. I struggle to keep all of my various devices charged since I'm always working on the go, so a bag with a charger seemed like a great fix.  I'm also a designer, so the look of it was important to me. The Bluesmart bag meets all of those requirements.  It's definitely smaller than my previous carry-on (see the photo), but I was using that one for weeklong trips and a few airlines made me check it when it was fully loaded.  So, I was looking for something that I knew would meet all of the restrictions.  The Bluesmart does and it seems to work really well for a shorter 2-3 night stint. I think it's better to keep things light and efficient so I can get in and out of the airport as fast as possible.  I was also super excited about the built-in scale feature.  It seems to be a little inconsistent with its readings so far, but it's not too big of a problem since the suitcase is smaller and hard to overpack, soI haven't gone over any weight limits. I'm hoping they get that dialed in and release a checked bag version as well!  Overall, I'm super happy with it.  Definitely a step up in terms of form and function from what I was using before.
