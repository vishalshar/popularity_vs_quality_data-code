I love my URB-E! I take it with me everywhere specifically to save time. I'm about 225 lbs and in shape and use the URB-E instead of my car these days, saving it for longer trips out of town. I went for the sport tuned model with the extra kick after looking into boosted boards, segways, and only found Chinese made junk or contraptions that looked like toys that I would break in two seconds. I first tried this out in Austin during SXSW at the Driskil Hotel (i put my pic from the trip) and was able to get around EVERYWHERE, around downtown, south Congress, Barton Springs and stillll plenty of charge left. The team was AWESOME, they know their stuff and know they're not selling a toy like everything else out there. If you don't have a car, don't want to put extra daily miles on it with short commutes or need to zip onto the train this is perfect.  If I leave the URB-E in my car I don't stress out where I park.  If you are on the fence GET IT! If you think it could save at least 15 minutes on your commute GET IT! I got to meet the found Grant who is a transportation teacher at ArtCenter, he has built THE solution for getting around cities. Ahh Love it!!
