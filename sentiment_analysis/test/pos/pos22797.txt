We have two cats..one a Main Coon who could not keep his food down, he would throwup undigested food etc.  Since being on Solid Gold, he has only had a couple bouts of that and it is always a 'hairball'....even tho on Laxatone.  But he is so much better.  It is expensive I know and I have a hard time paying the price, but my Mr. Grayson is so much more content so it is well worth it.  Problem is...our other cat wants to eat  it also, but she will eat the 'other' brand which is a bit less expensive too, so I try to keep her from eating Mr. Graysons 'solid gold".  I  really am amazed how well he is doing with digestive issues, this has been a great improvement for him.
