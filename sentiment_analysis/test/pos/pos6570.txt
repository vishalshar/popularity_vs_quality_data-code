This is pretty great. Every year, after unplugging for season, my old controller was a pain in the ass to setup the schedule for. I don't think I ever got it quite right. Also a hassle to stop for a few days after a big rain. The Blossom was set up in mere minutes. Now, I can just whip out my phone and change the schedule to suit my needs. Or fire up a few zones if the kids want to run in the sprinklers. I bet Nest/Google buys these guys in due time. Very well crafted and designed. Highly recommend.
