I bought my device in March, and took it with me all over Italy this April 2016, and I was very happy with its performance. I turned it on, paired with my phone and tablet without any hassles. I then put it in my rental car and used Google maps to drive all over Rome, Florence, Pisa, etc. I never lost reception even while driving in the countryside throughout Tuscany. I was also very impressed with the cool design and long battery life. Definitely recommend it - its cool.  BTW - It fits perfectly inside a portable HDD carrying case I bought on Amazon, so it was well protected while I was traveling.The only reason I am not giving them 5 stars is because I opted to buy 1GB data blocks of time on the go, and their device software did not register all the prepaid blocks of time as you bought them. The digital counter on the devices LCD screen only showed the remaining balance on the current 1GB block that was still being used, so you had to search in the purchase history on the device to make sure that the other data was actually waiting to be used and was ready to go once the current block of data was used up. The counter would reset to show each 1GB block of data available and start counting down the use as it went. I actually suggested to the Glocal team via email that they update their software so that the counter on the device shows all of your purchased GB's as soon as you pay for them, so that it makes it easier for the user to know that they are all set to go.  I hope they make that update, it's a small thing but I think it would make the device even better.
