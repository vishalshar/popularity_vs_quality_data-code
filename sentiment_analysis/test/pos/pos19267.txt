I like these, although they're harder to turn inside-out to hand wash than Lunchskins. And they're kind of plasticy, so instead of packing sandwiches in them (worried that the bread will pick up a plasticy smell), I've been using them for veggie stix or other chips. They work well and seal extremely well.
