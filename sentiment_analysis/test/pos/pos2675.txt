I'm an adult and I eat these.  They give me a quick release of carbs and curb my hunger when I am really out of control. I like them better than the cheaper all fruit snacks, or fruit and corn syrup snacks commonly available. I notice the texture changes from time to time, and after they had a bunch that were really leathery they became unavailable for a while. None of the texture changes really bothered me, but I could see how the more leathery ones would be tough for little tykes who seem to be the primary target with these.I keep them with me when I am working, walking or biking for a quick shot of energy. Not a substitute for a meal, more of a place holder.If they ever came out with one that was way more veggie/ less fruit  I would jump on those very quickly.I could probably find a way to make my own.  Something to go on the ever growing list of things to do that will probably never get done.
