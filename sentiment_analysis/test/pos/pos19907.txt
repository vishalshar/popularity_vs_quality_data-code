I love this stuff, it tastes just like sugar and it's one of the few brands not made from corn. It's reasonably priced and ships pretty quick too. It does cause some mild stomach upset if you consume too much of it before your body adjust, but start out slow and gradually increase it if you want to consume a lot.
