IT WORKS !!!!!??Always test before trusting it for the first time on a new surface...our kitchen counter is slightly bumply so it will hold but I can knock it over with a HARD smack...our coffee table surprised me.... didn't think it would hold on wood top but a HARD smack did nothingbut break my fingers.If you use the the top, use the straw, leaks a little if you try drinking by putting it to your mouth.Keeps cold stuff cold and hot stuff hot.Actually surprised me how well it works.
