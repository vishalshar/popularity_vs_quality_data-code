These are really good for the money. I tried the Focal Spheres before these and returned them after listening to the Pistons. There's no way they are 5 - 6x more than the Pistons. No way.If you want earphones that have a nice build (threaded/braided cable, metal fixtures), good bass and mids, then get these. Some of you may like really crisp music and strong highs, these are probably not for you then. Then again, do you really expect to get the kind of range your looking for in earphones? You might as well drop 300 - 600 bucks on some nice cans. In general though, these are _fantastic_ all-around earphones and are totally worth the money.A little background info: I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I am particular about what I like and research things before I buy them. I had the Focal Spheres before this and did not think they were worth the money. I currently have the B&W P5 headphones (the original/first version), the Bose QuietComfort 25 noise-canceling headphones, the 1MORE Pistons earphones, and I'm looking into buying the 1MORE triple driver earphones.
