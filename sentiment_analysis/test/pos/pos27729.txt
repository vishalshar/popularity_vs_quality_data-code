Well, Gromit, I think a little cheese is in order! And because I've kept it in Formaticum Cheese Storage Bags, it's fresh and ready to eat. Get these and unwrap your cheese from those awful plastic wraps that the grocery store provides so you can see the cheese you're buying. That's fine for the store display cases, but not for your long-term cheese needs. These bags allow the cheese to breath and stay alive and good tasting. They may seem a little pricey, but it's cheaper than throwing out cheese left too long in plastic that suffocates the living organism that is cheese!
