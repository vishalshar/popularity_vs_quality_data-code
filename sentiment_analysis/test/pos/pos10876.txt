great little robot, plenty of amusement. I went into interactions with expectation of being like a traditional toy or gimmick. Not the case! I actually started to smile and talk to this little guy as he was interacting with me. It is like having a personal little droid play pal, Cant wait for more improvements and abilities down the road with this and anticipate more complex robots with Anki, inc. Great jobs with this guys,...The only con I can even find for this is that (though this my bad or fault with lighting) even with okay lighting in the house, he still has trouble sometimes picking up things. I literally moved a lamp next to the area I played with him so he could see. maybe work on a better light detection system for this little guys visibility. seeing through his eyes with the adventure mode, a lot was black, even though i had a lamp right above him and around him. surprising though, through all this blackness he was still able to play with me, this tells me a lot about how advanced he is.
