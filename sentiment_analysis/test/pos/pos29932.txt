I've been taking the pre mama fertility for one whole box. Nothing has happened but I do get pregnancy like symptoms but every single test I've taken says negative. I also get the worst migraines from this product, so it was a bust for me. I've been TTC for five months and figured this would help. But unfortunately nothing.
