This product has completely changed the way I feel about coming home to my dogs. That may sound silly, but it's true. For years, my dogs were throwing up while we were at work. My husband and I would secretly try to make sure the other got home first, just so we didn't have to clean it up. Over the years, we have tried everything you can think of. I've discussed it with more than one vet. Nothing ever worked.I figured there was nothing that could be done. I had settled on a dog food that seemed to be a little more agreeable to them (they threw up slightly less). About 6 months ago, my pet store stopped selling that food. Figuring it couldn't be much worse, I gave this brand a try. It was like night and day. They literally have not thrown up since.Now i come home and I'm as happy to see my dogs as they are to see me!!
