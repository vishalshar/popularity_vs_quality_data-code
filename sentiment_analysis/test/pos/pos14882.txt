I'm 70 years old and it's tough to tie shoes...so bought these little gadgets that were very easy to put on.  I put all four on, but they made my shoes too tight so I took off the top one....three also made my shoes too tight, so took that one off.  Two are absolutely perfect and make it very easy to take shoes off and on and look fine.  I will now be able to purchase shoes that tie.  Thank you Hickies.....
