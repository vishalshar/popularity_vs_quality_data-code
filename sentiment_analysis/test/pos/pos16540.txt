This box of Go Cubes contains 20 individually wrapped packages of 4 chews. Each chew has 50 mg of caffeine in it, essentially the same as a half of a cup of coffee so an entire package is the equivalent of 2 cups of coffee. It's not exact because the caffeine in this is concentrated, and some people, like me, react much more to concentrated caffeine. The long and short of it is, if you are looking for a quick boost this will certainly do it. To try it out, I devoured a pack like a starving wolf devours a sheep. About 15 minutes later I was bug eyed and ready to do back flips off of my living room wall. So as far as a quick and convenient caffeine burst, it does the job.The taste initially wasn't that bad. There are three flavors: slow drip, latte, and mocha. Each packet contains all 3 so if you don't like one, you're SOL. The part that got me was the aftertaste on all three flavors would probably wake someone up from a coma. Seriously. They should try this on a coma patient. The person will come back instantly.If you are a student pulling an all-nighter, a professional pulling an all nighter, or anyone pulling an all nighter, this will help as long as you have some kind of chaser. If you're in a rush or going somewhere that taking coffee or getting access to coffee is difficult, these are certainly convenient. Again, beware of the knock-you-on-your-@$$ aftertaste.
