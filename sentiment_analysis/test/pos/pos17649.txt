These bags are great especially if you're trying to be eco-friendly! They are air-tight when closed properly and are very durable. The only thing that's really a pain is cleaning and drying them, since they can't go through the dishwasher. They must be hand washed and then turned upside down on top of a slim glass (or similarly shaped item) to dry out because simply laying them in a drying rack will not allow the inside to air out completely. If you're willing to put in the extra time to help our environment, though, these reusable bags are awesome!
