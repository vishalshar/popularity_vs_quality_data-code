I've been using the Canary Flex for a few days now and love it! I have a regular canary that I use as a baby monitor and got the flex because I wanted to carry it from room to room for various reasons such as monitoring my pets in one room, my toddler in another, keeping an eye on people coming in and out during some remodeling on our home, etc. The design is beautiful and quite small, however the camera covers so much more space than you'd imagine. I was also able to set this up seemlessly with my other Canary on the same account. Set up from taking out of the box to connecting was under 10 minutes. Very pleased and love the customer service.
