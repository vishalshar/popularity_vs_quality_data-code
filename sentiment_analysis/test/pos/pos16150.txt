Bought as a replacement after I washed the old one in the washer. This is a great product. We reply on it. I also like the FitBit feature that tracks exercise. I find it motivating. The day after I ordered it I was with my wife and we both got messages that Abby's tracked was not in the charger. No, IT WAS IN A BAG OF RICE! Wow! It came back to life after a cycle int he washer. Now I have a spare.
