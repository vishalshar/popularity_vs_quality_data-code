When I first opened the box I was surprised at how sturdy the brush guards were.  I was a little bit unsure if any of the  brushes would fit.  But as soon as I tried slipping it onto the brush, it immediately flexed and contoured to the shape of the brush.  You can definitely re-use this, I'm using it as a protector for my brushes for when I travel and for drying out my brushes.  It's lightweight, not bulky and very convenient to have.  And it's more affordable than other products out there.
