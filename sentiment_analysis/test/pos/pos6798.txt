Well. I needed something that could make me (33 female) my cousins (18/19 year old males) and my great aunts and uncles (80's) all crack up and have fun. I mean, you've got to have a family with a big sense of humor in the face of profanity (as profane as 2 cartoon stick figure men can get, which turns out- pretty profane! Think minimalist South Park) but if you do or if you host an adult game night this is an absolute crowd-pleaser. We had 2 family members die this year, mothers/daughters, and I didn't know if anything could make my family smile on Christmas. This brought laughter and release to us when the old traditions were too sad to face. Very clever!There's amazing replay value because the cards change meaning depending on if you place them 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, so I can't really fathom seeing the same strip happen twice. That said, bring on some hilarious expansions please.
