I've tried just about EVERYTHING under the sun to try hiding my facial piercing hole.  This product does the trick!  Easy to use instructions. I know it says no foundation, but BB Cream seems to be fine since it's not as thick.  Helps with blending your skin tone, just don't go crazy with it and you should be fine.  Less is MORE with this product, as stated.  I mix it myself to get the right amount as I'm not filling in a larger area,Great product--will definitely purchase again! :)
