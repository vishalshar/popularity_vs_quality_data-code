To be honest I was expecting something hard to carry in my workbag. It actually is the size of an ipad, bundled in a nice cover/case. I was amazed by its capacity as I personally bought this because of solar energy and its environment appeal. It charges iphone and ipad together for 3 times and still with residual time. Amazing capacity. Also as it is really thin, it goes side by side with my laptop and requires less space compared to my last 12000 mAh battery that was 1/3 of a brick size. Solar panel works great and it can also be refulled in regular outlet. Great work by solartab. A little expensive, but better to spend on this that respect nature than in regular it gadgets that become electronic trash and we even dont know where it goes.
