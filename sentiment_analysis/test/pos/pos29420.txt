Oh man get your racing gloves ready.  What a great concept for a racing game,  the track is big and the cars are fast.So I unrolled the starter kit track and charged up the cars, which only took about 20 minutes to full charge.  After downloading the app on my Iphone I was ready to give it a try.  I was not disappointed.  The app is real easy to navigate and walks you through everything.  Uploading the car into the app is as simple as putting it close to your phone, after that you can upgrade your cars weapons, engine, chassis, and power tanks if you have the points.  You earn the points by racing and winning.  Playing solo against the AI car is very fun,  had me making sound effects right along with the game.  I will say this, I have not been able to play with a friend because my friend had an android phone and it won't work if you are using an Iphone.  I will update this when I get a chance to play with another human.  My buddy was having some trouble with the android version of the app, it crashed a few times before he was able to get it working.  When it did work and we tried to race his phone couldn't find my Iphone for the multiplayer option.Now for the Iphone there was no issue with it working and working well.  The car responds quickly to lane changes and turning.  Firing the weapons is accompanied by flashing lights on the front of the cars,  and lights up the back when hit.  I have already upgraded the weapons and there is a lot more upgrades to go.  I just got RHO so now there will be 3 cars on the track, myself and 2 AI.  I can't wait to see how it works with another car to fight with.Cleaning the tires is a must after at least 2 races.  You will know when to clean them because the car will slip on the turns.  I had the track rolled out on my floor, which I had just cleaned and mopped and the tires still got dirty.  The track seems to attract dirt and dust so it will get all over the tires real quick.  Cleaning is a breeze and doesn't take much time at all, it's as simple as running them across the sticky pad they provide for cleaning the tires.All in all this is an awesome gift idea for young and old alike.  Very reminiscent of slot car racing back in the day just way cooler.  Worth every penny.
