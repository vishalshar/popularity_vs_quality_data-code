I typically only make major purchases if I've been able to do a lot of research and weigh all the options, so I had some trepidation about buying a bed online.  I was not disappointed.  The bed is supportive yet comfortable, and not hot as some people say foam mattresses can be.  Some of the old minor aches and pains we had with the old bed are now history.  Glad we made the purchase!
