The ditto is one of those devices that seems like such a no-brainer in hindsight.  Why aren't phone manufacturers making detachable, clipable vibration motors already for their devices?  Who wants to have their phone on them at all times?  I work in a noisy environment and getting alerts is a big challenge - I can't hear my phone at any volume when the machines are running - so I am a perfect customer for the ditto.The good news is that it works just as it says.  The device is small and light enough to even forget it is there, and the vibration is intense enough to get your attention without being overpowering and making you wish you wore your brown pants.  If you really like the idea of this device, you will probably be at least satisfied with the operation.The not so good is that it simply isn't as flexible as one might prefer from customizing the vibration options on a phone.  The alerts do not repeat - this is especially critical for the alarm function!  The preprogrammed alert patterns are clunky and there isn't an option to set your own. These are glaring limitations that could be solved with a more developed app.  I have also found my bluetooth connection seems flaky since I added the ditto.  My bluetooth headphones are normally very solid, but since I've added the ditto they drop out of connection randomly, perhaps once an hour.  In my unprofessional opinion it is like the ditto makes the bluetooth restart now and then, which doesn't bother passive devices but makes active ones skip. Aside from the headphones randomly disconnecting I have not experienced any problems, and I can't for sure say that is ditto's fault.  The ditto's connection seems good.The tethering feature works, but it may not be as responsive as some people would want, based on how it is shown in their promo video.  You have to set a delay (30 seconds to a few minutes) for it to kick in. In some cases it may be less "tethering" alert and more "sucks to be you, because it's too late to go back now" alert.  I could easily get in my car and drive away before it goes off.The bad: the wristband is worthless, except perhaps as a pattern to make a nicer one for yourself.  It's as bad as the other reviews say.  I don't know why they wasted money including it.I really really like the simplicity of this device.  I like that it is just vibration. I like that there is no off switch or recharging.  I like that i can replace the battery myself as needed. I like the price.  What's missing is more functionality in the app and more ways to wear it,  like a heavy duty sport clip, or a silicon molded wrist strap, or a molded bezel with a loop so you can wear it on a necklace.  Personally, I may modify a leather bracelet so I can hide the ditto in there.  It includes a non-clip back piece that gives it a sleeker profile, so it can be tucked into a small compartment. There are some lux jewelry wearables coming out (like the Cuff wearable) with a similar idea, but so far the ditto sounds like a superior product with a nicer pricepoint, and you can buy it now.  Just be creative and you can make a nice wearable accessory out of it.I also own the Notti light, which is a similar idea (external notifications, but light instead of vibration) and I really like them both.  They have different strengths.  The ditto is perfect for on-the-go, and the notti is a fantastic home alert when you can't be bothered to clip a piece of tech to your jammies.  They have the same big weak point (app functionality), because they are new devices, but they both have loads of potential and work well enough to be worth buying now.  If you need external non-audio alerts, I would look at both.UPDATE:  So, I lost my Ditto yesterday.  I wore it to work, but on the way home realized it was not clipped on (in a location I thought would be the most secure).  Thought about it, realized I'd knocked that spot with a piece of equipment a couple times during the day.  The ditto app tries to connect with the ditto when opened and you can see if it makes contact.  Checked around the house just in case I had left it home, but it was not connecting to anything.  Went to work today and the app connected!  It was somewhere in the building!  Unfortunately I had been busy in several different areas.  Commenced looking on my hands and knees peering under equipment, checking in boxes, periodically hitting the test button hoping to hear it rattling somewhere.  Tried connecting from different corners of the building hoping to narrow down the direction.  Ditto connected everytime - impressive but not helpful.  Coworkers ask me what the hell I'm doing and I explain I am looking for a little pill shaped piece of plastic that vibrates.  Lucky for me one coworker had found it and set it aside!  This was the farthest location from my normal work area, at least 30 feet away through 3-4 walls.  While I was looking for it I was grumbling about how I was going to dock a star from this review for the s***ty clip, but now I am sort of impressed by the connection strength and the connect/test function of the app that gave me some chance of finding it again, so I am leaving the 4 stars.  I will be finding a more secure way to wear the ditto and not rely on the clip. While it was lost, I contemplated if I would buy a second - if the ditto is worth replacing.  I think it is.
