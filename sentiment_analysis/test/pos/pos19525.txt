Pros-Lots of room to play-Suction cups are pretty good (occasionally falls, but pretty rarely)-Works well-Holds quite a bit of weight-Sturdy-Good priceCons-Occasionally falls off tub, causing all the cups my daughter has on it to spill-Not a very high edge so my 2 year old tends to dump water over the edge onto the floorMy daughter loves this product. She stacks bowls and cups on it to float her rubber duckies in. It works very well and we have less water on our floor for the most part since we have purchased this product. Before this she was stacking cups on the side of the tub. :) Definitely recommend this product to others who have kids.
