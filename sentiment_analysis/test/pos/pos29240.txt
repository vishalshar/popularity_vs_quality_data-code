Seriously digging this speaker. For me, good sound is at the top of my list in terms of features, and this ZIPP speaker indeed sounds great in my house and outside when Im hanging out in the backyard. A couple of years ago I was considering hard-wiring all kinds of outdoor speakers and Im glad I didnt. This ZIPP does the job at such a lower cost. I feel like I have all the listening options I need now with my various streaming music services. Ive got tons of Spotify playlists and mixes and Ive found myself enjoying my tunes a lot more since I got this speaker. Any room I want to move to, the speaker comes with me. I like the 360 sound, and the bass is surprisingly strong. This is a great solution for a lot of my music needs without having to get a crazy expensive sound system. And as a bonus  it looks cool!
