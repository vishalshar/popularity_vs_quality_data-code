I have never ever written a review for anything I've purchased online.  This is one review I will write.  I owe it to people like me who are searching for something to cover up or camouflage the 11 between my eyes.  I don't have terrible skin but the wrinkles between my eyes are ruining my self esteem.  I watched a lot of tutorials before and after purchasing Dermaflage and felt very prepared for my first attempt...and I nailed it.  I am so happy to look in the mirror and not see the lines!  This really works!  I took a mirror outside and in the sunlight I still cannot see the product.  It looks like my real skin!  I feel so much relief that I can stop thinking about these two wrinkles 24/7.  Okay, so next steps are to test the longevity of the product.  This Worry Less started kit didn't include the primer so I'll be ordering that next along with extra applicators because I liked how finite the product was dispensed.  I think I might email Dermaflage next to thank them!
