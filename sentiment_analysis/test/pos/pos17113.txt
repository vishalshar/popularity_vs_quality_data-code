great little stereo system, decent sound and nice retro look for my home office setting. bluetooth integration allows to connect it with pretty much anything, I am playing music from my computer on it. excited to get the turn table back into fashion in this nice retro look. sound is amazing!my only little reservation is for design of the backlit blue displays. have to stand really close to it to see what function is switched with a remote, blue color is a bit annoying too. the wires to the speakers are super short, only can set speakers next to the unit as shown on the picture, or buy additional extended wires if you want to stretch speakers farther apart. for all that, not giving all five stars.other than that, this is a great value for money!
