This case is awesome and certainly worth the money!!I'm one to always carry a bunch of stuff in my pockets so the less space my phone takes up the better. It really does fit like your typical iPhone phone case, but much more durable.The battery life is great, my phone hasn't ever died and I've only had to use this battery's full power once because I didn't charge my phone the night before.The only reason that I didn't give this product 5 stars is because of one small design flaw. Maybe it's not even a flaw, but when I drop the phone the small piece (top cover) of the case falls off. It doesn't break or anything, and my phone doesn't fall out, it's just the way the case is put together. I just don't want to drop it somewhere and lose the top piece to my phone case. Maybe future designs will have someway to attach it to the rest of the body.Besides that, all good things all good things! ??P.S. I would also suggest getting a tempered glass screen protector. This case design does have a nice lip so your screen doesn't touch the ground face down, but who's phone really drops flat face down on a flat surface??? LolP.S.S. I HAD TO PLUG THE CASE IN BEFORE IT STARTED CHARGING MY PHONE. Must have been the way to kickstart the circuitry or something.
