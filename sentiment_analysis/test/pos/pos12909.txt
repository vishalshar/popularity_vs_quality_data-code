Insanely easy to use, great picture quality, super portable. I love this product so much and I highly recommend it! Two warnings: if you're trying to project off of devices that don't have HDMI ports, make sure you buy the proper adapters. And the speaker works but is small so it's best to have a stronger audio output source
