What an amazing product. Meets and exceeds all my expectation I had on iOttie products.  I currently own the iOttie car phone holder which is one of the best design ever.  In fact based on my recommendation bunch of my friends have bought the same product and they are very happy about my suggestions and of course the product itself.Now coming to iOttie MiGo I have no words to describe my joy.  I am more happy with this product than my new iPhone 7 plus.  I got this product yesterday and almost done with all my hands on with this product and here are my review:Pros:1. Construction is very solid.2. Excellent design.3. Very good grip on hand.4. Hassle free Bluetooth connectivity.5. Sturdily holds the phone.6. Haven't tried GoPro as I don't own one right now :)7. Ordered a mini tripod stand and will update more on how this fits on it.Cons:1. Only one that I can think of is that I couldn't think a way to fit my phone in portrait orientation.  Please let me know if there is anyway.2. If at all engineering-ly possible then I wish if the size could be extended to few more inches.Overall once again a very nice product and I would recommend this to anyone who asks me for a selfie stick. I will upload some photos soon.
