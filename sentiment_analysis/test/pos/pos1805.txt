Its a lovely speaker. I found it on Kickstarter and backed it. Their software is buggy when the product is shipped, but the wood box is really good, my whole family love to touch its authentic wooden surface. The sound is awesome to me. I use AirPlay a lot. Some of the radios are out of services.Pros:1. The design and the craftsmanship, Im very satisfied with the build quality2. it can be very loud, more than I expected, yet still sounds OK (another Bluetooth speaker $199 of mine cannot be so loud)3. It is perfect for background music, I can use my phone to call, voice, video, while Cube keeps playing music4. Alarm, yes, alarm, I can turn off my phone. Cube works by itself. (I hope Sugr can support music alarm)Cons:1. It must be charged with its original charger, other USB charger does not work (anyway they offer a Qualcomm Quick Charger)2. Sometimes I got distorted AirPlay music, Im not sure if its Cube problem of my Wi-Fi problem.3. Sugr said there will be Spotify Connect, still under development?As a Kickstarter backer, what impressed me is the team has been continuously improving this product. With their software update, the Cube is getting more stable and more features.
