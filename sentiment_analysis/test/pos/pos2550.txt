I have been drinking the Chaga Mushroom Elixir from Four Sigma Foods now for over 3 months and absolutely love it. I first heard about the amazing antioxidant and immune building benefits on a podcast and decided to do my own research before buying. I read several articles that supported the claims that were being made. I have a very active lifestyle and travel frequently which tends to be hard on the immune system. I enjoy the Chaga blended in with my coffee every morning.
