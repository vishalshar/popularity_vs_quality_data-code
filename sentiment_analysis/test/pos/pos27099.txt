I got a big block of sharp cheese and put it in the bag. The cheese kept much of its taste during the ten days it took us to finish it. The bag was reusable for a second block. It seems ready for a third. I compare this to my previous experience of keeping the cheese in a plastic freezer bag. In the latter the cheese would dry out, get hard, and taste flat
