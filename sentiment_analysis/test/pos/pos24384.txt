Fine taste - and certainly convenient.  I have made my own cold coffee for years, but enjoy the convenience that Bizzy offers. The flavor is as mild or strong as you like - I was happy with the 2/1 ratio in the dilution directions on the bottle. I may try to keep some in stock but relatively high cost prohibits using it as an everyday product. Too easy to make your own cold coffee for an average day.
