I bought these headphones a few weeks ago and so far they have lived up to great expectations.  They fit very well over the ears and although they aren't real noise cancellation headphones they still block out ambient noise.  The music quality is great and sounds better than my Beats headphones. The package is also really nice and providing two sets of cables for Android and iPhone is a great touch.  Overall its a great buy and you really cannot beat it at this price point.
