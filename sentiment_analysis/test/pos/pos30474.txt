I can see where this product will more than likely solve my shaving woes, it's taking longer for me because I've been shaving for over 12 years now.  Love the safety razor it's very smooth, and the aftershave is nice as well. I consulted several "old-school barbers", as well as a dermatologist and they all said that anything you put on your skin after shaving should never burn.  So o love this product very much so.  Will keep using and keep updating my progress
