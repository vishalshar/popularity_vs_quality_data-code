Netatmo's Welcome is, so far in the time since I've had it, one of my favorite cameras.  Since the camera just came out I'm hoping that the software, app, and integration with other products (including the weather station) will come along soon.  I'm also looking forward to seeing what there might be coming in the form of additional filters for distinguishing faces, more on this later.There are a few good things and bad things that I've found with this camera, so I'll start with the good things.Good--My face and my fiancé's face were easily recognized, and after uploading a photo from my camera roll, Welcome was able to distinguish us much faster than before, even in low light conditions.-Other people entering my home have been "recognized" easily, and quickly which prompts me to either identify them or to delete them from the memory.-The camera can recognize when I'm home, can notify me of movement based on rules I set up, etc.-MAJOR PLUS- the camera records to my phone and to a micro SD card, so no fees!The bad (because there has to be right?)--(1/2 Star)Welcome "recognizes" faces on TV when I'm watching the news, so I have to go in and manually tell it that all of those recognitions were false positives.  I would move the camera to a different place, but the only location that faces the door, also faces the TV, so-(1/2 Star)The app asks for my location, and unlike Netatmo Weather, it is always on. This is strange, because I can't see why my location is needed at all times if it also needs to recognize me? Even my other cameras that use my location, don't use it this much.In Summary, Netatmo's Welcome is awesome to a degree.  I didn't mention that the video is pretty good, until you download it, then it is great. The app could use some work, and I bought the camera for both it and the app functionality. The recording ability, specifically the ability to pay no fees, is how customers should be treated.
