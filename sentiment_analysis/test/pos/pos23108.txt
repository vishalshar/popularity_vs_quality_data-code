I have been using the iOttie One Touch 2 for some time now.  I use one on my nightstand to hold my phone while it charges and one in my work vehicle (I have an iPhone 6S Plus in an OtterBox Symmetry case).After watching the video about the development of the iOttie 3, I decided I would give it a shot.  Needless to say, they took an already excellent device, and managed to make it even better!The first improvement is the larger close "button" that makes locking your phone into the cradle much easier thank the iOttie 2.  They also added a additional depth to the side holder jaws that actually clamp on to the device, and it holds even more solidly than than it's predecessor.The sticky type suction cup grips to just about any surface you can find, and they redesigned the tightening knobs which makes it easier to really tighten the adjustable points on the holder.I absolutely recommend this holder to anyone that needs a rock solid device holder that fits even the largest phones on the market.
