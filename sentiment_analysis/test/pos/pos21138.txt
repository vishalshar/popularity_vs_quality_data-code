These are a game changer. I have always hated over-using ziplock bags as it's just day after day of plastic in the garbage. Enter this resealable bags, and I'm madly in love. The big ones hold a decent sized sandwich on a roll, which is fairly tall, and the small ones are great for snacks. I've never been happier and will purchase more as needed.
