Great bath sponge, really nice to have a soft side within the sponge. BUT, even though it says "machine wash" it came out hard, which is very disappointing. Other than that, thank goodness you get 2 in a package.UPDATE PLEASE READ!! The lovely owners of the company The Lux Puff contacted me by email as they saw my review here on Amazon. They wanted to rectify the problem of the Lux Puffs. I was VERY SURPRISED!!.  Who does that now of days? They asked if I washed it correctly & gave instructions, but right after that they offered to SEND ME A REPLACEMENT!! The second email, THEY ASKED WHAT COLOR I WANTED!!If you have any problems whatsoever, let them know. I wish them much success because of my experience with this company that has INTERGRITY. :)  :)
