(Update: March 13, 2015  These just increased in price by $7 from last month.  I used to buy large bags of cinnamon and plain each month and the cinnamon smaller bags, but will not order again until they go down in price.)These are really good with one caveat. I find that there are pieces that taste moldy/dirty sometimes. I am not sure if that is quality control or if I have weird taste buds. I buy these every couple of weeks, but prefer the cinnamon flavor. It is not cloyingly overfowerful, just a touch of cinnamon. Nice. Crunchy like chips, no oils or added sugar.
