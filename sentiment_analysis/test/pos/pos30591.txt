down a star for two bugs in the design? the flashing between the two halves of the molded case is so sharp it hurt my hand. It took a few minutes with a razor sharp knife to shave down the entire perimeter and that was solved but for a premium case that is not acceptable. To be fair I think they spent premium $ for extremely precise molds to avoid having to clean up the flash but it backfired because what it created was a very very very small RAZOR SHARP flashing.? same problem with ALL quad lock products: they teeter totter and wobble because the lock hole acts like a pedestal. I fixed my last quad lock case by dripping a drop of clear epoxy in all four corners and intend to do the same with this case as well.A HUGE improvement saving a star in the rating is now the back is sealed and sift inside. The old models acted like a dirt collector sucking all sorts of gunk into the back of the caseCase is by far the best case for iPhone and I've used more than a dozen over the years.The material is perfect the design save the couple of flaws above is fantastic and the utility because of the half a dozen ways you can mount the case make it the most useful case bar none.I took the wall mount and replaced the sloppy adapted book holder from the levo and made a perfect iPhone / iPad holder. I recommend anybody with quad lock case follow suit.Cut off the platform and use a 6mm bolt to attach the quad lock wall mount: use a locking nut on the bottom and get the tension just right so you can modify the angle but still get the case on and off. Unbeatable. I'll try to upload a photo later.
