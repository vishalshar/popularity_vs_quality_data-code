Much, much better design than the previous (we have been using this system for seven years).  These collars are not inexpensive, but they keep our four rodent-chasing Rat Terriers safe and out of the road when we can't have our full attention on them, while allowing them to run and be dogs, and that is priceless to us.  This purchase was to replace a seven year old collar, got our money's worth out of that one.
