I homeschool my 12 year old and bought this as a project for him to work on over the summer.  I was a little disappointed when he put it together so quickly but then realized that putting the components together is really only the beginning.  I then discovered the lesson plans that PIPER has on it's website and using those we have begun to explore together circuit boards and basic engineering.  Using minecraft to teach real world skills is a genius idea.  MineCraft on its own is a great game that teaches creativity, problem solving, and group dynamics and expanding that out from the computer into the real world makes for an easy transition and fun learning.  I don't know who is learning more me or my son, or which of us is having more fun.
