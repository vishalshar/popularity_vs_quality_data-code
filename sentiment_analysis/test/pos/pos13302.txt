I was traveling recently without access to a proper shower and sometimes only cold water or boiling hot water. These body wipes definitely came in handy. The first time I used them I felt a little wet and sticky, but after I realized how effective they were (no body odor at the end of a long day working outside), I quickly got over that and was grateful I had them with my while traveling.
