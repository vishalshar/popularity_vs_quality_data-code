I bought this as a gift for my wife and it performs as advertised.  We have taken it to the beach and it performed well and worry free. It's not loud enough to have at an outdoor party but for close range playback it works well. This turtle shell speaker is best suited in an enclosed environment like a bathroom or hotel room. I'm hoping they can make one that's bigger, louder, in stereo and with a longer wireless range.
