I have had way too many chargers over the years. I am impressed with this one especially because it is lightweight, slim, charges quickly, and it got more charges than I expected for my Iphone (3). We plan to purchase several more for our kids for Christmas!Since I wrote the above review - we have purchased 6 more for kids and spouses.....we are that impressed with these little chargers. We also just took it overseas for a month - and it charged quickly, often and I cannot say enough about the shape and how lightweight it is!
