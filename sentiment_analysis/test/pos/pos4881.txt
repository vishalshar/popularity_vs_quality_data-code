Our cat needed a urinalysis so I thought this was worth a try since she doesn't like being corralled in to her carrier.  This was a perfect solution to taking her on a stressful vet visit!  I purchased 2 bags and a small litter tray (1 bag barely covered the bottom of the tray), and as soon as I placed the box in her regular litter area, she went right in and used it without any issues.  The liquid stayed right on top of the sand and was easy to collect with the provided pipette, tilting the box also helps in pooling it all together.  I used a specimen cup instead of the provide vial - the cap didn't seem too sturdy.  She's pretty smart and knows when something is up, but this didn't phase her one bit.  We tried the plastic beads in the past and those were worthless (I think she actually rolled her eyes when she saw those).  While it is a little $$, it was totally worth it, and I would definitely use this again.
