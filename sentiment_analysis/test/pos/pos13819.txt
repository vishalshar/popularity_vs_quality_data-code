Really good, in fact, I love all of boom chick a pop, products! A nice treat and easy to get carried away. I love them all depending on the mood I'm in. They do all seem to have sugar, so they do have a sweet side to them. Nice to get for company. Serve the different flavors in a different unique bowl, purchase popcorn bags for the guests and that will provide some fun conversation. ( that is if your Boom Chicka Pop, lasts till company) :)
