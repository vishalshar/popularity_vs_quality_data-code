So far, so great!I was looking for a spoon & fork set to eat in any of the following situations, in order of frequency with which I find myself in each:- When I bring snacks or pack a lunch, and invariably grab a fork when I have yogurt or soup, if I remember to get a utensil at all- So I can avoid disposable utensils when I order something to go, but will not be returning home to eat it- Either of the above when I'm traveling.- Outdoorsy fun, hiking, camping, living out of a truck for 2 months, that kind of thing.I've only used them for about 2 months, so use has been pretty mild up til now, but they seem to be holding up very well, and with humangear's very attractive lifetime warranty, I am not at all worried about their longevity. Though I might refrain from, like, purposely trying to snap them in half or something. Just in case.I like that they slide and snap together, that is real handy. I even nailed down a one-handed maneuver to separate them; it's a strangely fulfilling experience. Day-to-day I keep them in a specific pocket inside my bag along with a cloth napkin, and they live there forever, always at the ready for impromptu picnics. I wash them by hand (I just don't have a dishwasher; I don't think it's necessary, but double check with humangear) whenever I remember, which is never, cuz I'm a enchanting combination of forgetful and disgusting.This darkish blueish grayish is my favorite color, so that was cool. Mine are considerably grayer than the almost-navy blue ones that appear here on Amazon...I suspect there's been some color saturation abuse inflicted on these images, so I would expect a duller version of the ones you see here. I like their shape, pretty nifty design that doesn't remind you too much of lunchbox utensils for kids, which was a concern of mine. They're comfortable to hold and just long enough for the jars that I use instead of tupperware. I appreciate that you can slide them apart, flip the spoon up, and snap it back into place, creating an unstoppable super-utensil powerful enough to reach the cavernous abysses of even the longest of jars, muahaha!! (Like 7.5", 9.5" max if the opening is wide enough. Another reviewer has done the lord's work and provided detailed measurements of the utensils' dimensions.)Anyway, highly recommend. I was shooting for metal, because I try to avoid plastic if I can and because they look nicer (Any recommendations?). But they're probably also heavier? And more expensive as well, I didn't find any as convenient as these. Very satisfied with my purchase.
