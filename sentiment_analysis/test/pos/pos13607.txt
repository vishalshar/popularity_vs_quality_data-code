I decided to try swapping out my existing Rain bird sprinkler timer with one that I can control over internet.One of the features that i really like about this is that you can enter your soil type, grass type, exposure to sun, types of sprinkler heads and slope to help set the best possible watering schedule for your lawn. It will also check your local weather to help determine your watering schedule.Installation was fast and easy. It mounts with 2 screws connect your zone wires and common wire and youÂ’re done. The rest of the programming is done through the app.My only 2 complaints about this product is that it does not come with any mounting hardware. And there are no sprinkler controls on the box itself. It is all done through the app, which is why I only gave it 4 stars.I would highly recommend this product but with the caveat that there is no controls on the box or hardware for mounting.
