I really had my doubts when I bought this. I tried one of the cheaper couplers, the kind with the ring in the center and I can tell you they don't work. If one dog pulls the other gets pulled too.I have two 13lb. Italian Greyhounds. Today I just walked down a very very crowded urban street and I had no trouble maneuvering them around all the people. I also take them running for an hour through a busy park and it works pretty darn great.I'm not a dog trainer or anything, so I wouldn't say I have the best behaved dogs either.SPORN is a great product. Really-I couldn't be happier (or more surprised.)One more thing: I'm still using my retractable leash, but only for the feel of the handle. I tried to extend it, but we all got tangled up and, because of the weight, it wouldn't retract. This isn't a criticism, but just a heads up that you won't be able to extend your leash. But really, the length of the SPORN, for me and my dogs, is perfect.(I'm not giving five stars-I'm saving that for invisible leashes that attach to my cerebral cortex)
