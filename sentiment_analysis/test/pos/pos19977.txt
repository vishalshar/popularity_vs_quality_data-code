This is a favorite in our house. Our little poodle mix with hip problems as a pup has been eating this as a treat regularly is now 2. He hasn't had any issues in over a year. I don't know if it has anything to do with this or not but it makes me feel like I'm doing something. He also really likes it. I break it up and put small pieces in a  Kong toy for him to play with a release.
