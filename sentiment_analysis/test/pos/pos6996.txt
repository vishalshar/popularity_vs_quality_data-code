My dog is 12 years old and was very lethargic and now after using this for 3 weeks in conjuction with Muscle Bully Protein he is now walking 3 times the amount he used to and is happier, more alert and energetic. I recommend this product, plus it tastes great and he's loving it. My dog is 90 lbs and gets 3 1/4 teaspoon measures a day.
