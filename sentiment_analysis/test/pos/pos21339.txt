This is a great product for anyone, and especially for those who are sensitive to odors or chemicals. My car doesn't have a cabin air filter (as most don't) so this was the only way to go for me. I won't use those plug-in ion generators because they all produce ozone as a by product of generating ions... and ozone, even in small amounts, is toxic to inhale.I got it because I often haul livestock supplies which leave a somewhat unpleasant strong odor in my SUV. This seems to really help reduce that odor, once I've unloaded the supplies. It also worked really well when I was doing some touch-up painting on the door jambs. The car paint and clear coat finish left an obnoxious smell in the car, even after the paint had dried and even though I had just painted a few very small spots. This product arrived two days after painting, I put it in the car and the next day the odor was gone. I hang it on the fold down clothes hook in the middle seat area.
