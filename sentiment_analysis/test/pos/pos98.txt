I am in love!!! This is the best thing ever!When I opened it my jaw dropped. This thing is tiny. I thought there's no way...I can't sleep without a fan- period. I have tinnitus and the slightest noise wakes me.Plugged this little thing in and couldn't believe it! Its better than any fan I've ever owned. Its loud enough and has several settings. It doesn't look nor feel cheap either.Highly recommend this adorable little fan.
