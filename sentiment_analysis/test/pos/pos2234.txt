Absolutely incredible flying machine.  I am a novice to Drones, but I've piloted several  RC Helicopters.  This drone flies like a dream.  The software, controller, case, and functionality of my premium edition is a 10 out of 10.  This is definitely one of those best bang for the buck devices.  I have flown it several times using my Motorola Android phone.  I could not get my google Pixel-C Tablet to run the software...but that will probably be fixed in later releases.  As a Gen-1 product, I am shocked at how well thought out everything is.  Videography is excellent, though I only run my camera at 1080P and not 4K because editing the content at that high of a resolution is cumbersome.  Caution!  The Landing Legs are very low, so that the camera is very close to the ground when parked.  Maybe an inch or two of clearance.  Landing on a small rock between the legs might break it.  But that said, I HIGHLY recommend this drone and cant really think of anything 'significantly negative' that should be improved or fixed. That is so rare in today's world that I wanted to specifically mention it.  Their Engineers did a great job with design.
