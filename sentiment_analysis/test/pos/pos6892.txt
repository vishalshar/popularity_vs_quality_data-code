Our family has really enjoyed Battle Goats! The card art is beautiful, colorful and the game is simple enough for kids and non-gamers alike. Each player has 9 cards and set them face down in a 3 x 3 grid. Most cards have abilities that are activated in specific scenarios. Placement of your hero, goats, weapons and creatures really matter.Battle Goats can be taught in about 2 to 5 minutes and an average game takes under 25 minutes. The cards are well made, the plastic box the game comes in is super portable and that means that this games goes with us when we travel. My only issue with the game is that game play seems very broken with 3 players. The game plays great with 2, 4, 5 and 6 players! Every time I played with 3 players, it seemed like one player always got beat up on.My son who is 11 is a huge fan of this game and asks to play it every week it seems. This is a definitely a game I'd suggest for a family that's looking for a fun card battling game with a low barrier to entry.
