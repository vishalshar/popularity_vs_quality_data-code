I caught this on sale for $799 and free prime shipping.  At that price in July 2016, this is a hard deal to beat.  Sleek lines, looks nice, no bright colors or sharp edges and it is lightweight.  No real bloatware.  I turned it on, did the initial setup, patched Windows, updated the video card drivers, added Malwarebytes, tweaked the power settings, and installed Chrome using the official preloaded Chrome installer (itÂ’s called Edge).  Works great.  So why four stars?  The memory is built onto the main board but more can be added with one expansion slot.  The lid is brushed aluminum but the case is plastic.  I would pay more for all aluminum and maybe an extra vent in the bottom.  The video card is 2 GB of memory, I would prefer 4 but for the price it is not a bad compromise.  I am not a fan of the spring loaded Ethernet connector.  If you plan on using the wired Ethernet connection and moving the laptop around, I am not sure how well this will hold up.  My overall verdict; great for occasional gaming or as a travel laptop.  Day to day use, heavy gaming, I would move up to the ASUS ROG line.  Add your favorite Anti-virus/Anti-malware software, 8GB or RAM, a 512GB SSD, Bluetooth keyboard/mouse, and pickup an HDMI to VGA adapter to connect to older monitors and projectors and you have a pretty nice laptop setup with some decent gaming horsepower.
