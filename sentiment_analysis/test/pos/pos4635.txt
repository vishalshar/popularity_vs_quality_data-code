This device is small and light and stays connected to my phone flawlessly. The yardages change as you walk, even when your phone is asleep. My iPhone 6s Plus battery seems to hold up better using tLink then when I used my phone alone. You also have fast access to your exact yardage without having to wake up your phone and let the reading settle, which is what I was doing before I got the tLink. The tLink system seems quite accurate, although I would point out that neither the device nor anything the tLink app does has anything to do with the accuracy since the tLink uses your phones GPS and the app uses course maps from the same major provider that supplies other golf GPS vendors.I used the trial of the Stat Tracking feature during a 9-hole round, and it worked almost flawlessly. There were two holes where it didnt know I finished the hole, and I needed to push the advance button. The on-screen instructions advised of this possibility. As soon as I did this though, the device requested my hole score, putts, etc. All this data was neatly displayed for me at the end of my round, along with my total score. Pretty cool. I will likely use the 99 cent per round stat tracking feature from time to time. The subscription pricing options are not cost effective unless you play golf more than twice a month, which I dont.I took quite a while to decide between getting the tLink or a self-contained GPS wearable. After reading of trouble updating the self-contained devices over USB, as well as (with watches anyway) the proprietary bands breaking and needing repair, I decided tLink had some advantages. Easy updating over the app, and the course database in the app is also updated more reliably to name a couple. (Smartphone apps generally update with no trouble.) Also, if the band breaks a new one can be had cheaply, although I have pretty much settled on using the belt clip (more on that below). The tLink is very light, and smaller than most of the other golf GPS wearables, though the others are shrinking in both size and price. (Garmin refurbished S1 golf watches are the same price.) Of course, if you dont want to golf with your phone, one of the self-contained devices is what you want, the tLink wont work.Now to some other minor negatives. Firstly, while the tLink is smaller and lighter than other golf GPS devices, it is still bigger than any watch I wear. After wearing it for the pedometer function on my wrist for a while, I decided it was too big. I was also a little concerned about the stories of the device popping out of the wristband when golfing. I switched to the belt clip. However, the belt clip holds the device tight against your belt so to look at yardages, you need to grab it and twist your belt up so you can see it. In my view, the tLink ideally needs more of a belt lanyard. I have shorts I golf in at times with little loops that am now using some of the time, and I also made a lanyard of sorts out of a key clip. (See photos.) Hopefully, tLink will come out with other mounting options.Secondly, in my view, the app needs some work. If you have your location services in your phone turned off either to save the battery, or for privacy, the app wont even start up properly so you can look at your stats. Even if thats not an issue, if you are out of range of your tLink (for example you want to show somebody at work your stats) a series of cumbersome menus come up and the only way to access the stats is to hit the help button with just the right timing. Even then as far as I can tell you can only access golf stats, not pedometer data. Finally there is no way to print anything (other than with screenshots).All-in-all though, I am delighted with this purchase. And because the device is a simple remote display unit, the other functionality, mounting options, app features, can theoretically be easily and cheaply updated, which could prove to be tLinks biggest advantage over a dedicated device. Time will tell whether the folks at tLink make good use of this ability.
