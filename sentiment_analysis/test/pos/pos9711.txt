Extremely versatile bike mount capable of mounting both portrait and horizontally out front or over the stem. I am using this product with the GoPro mounting attachment and the GoPro Session.Pros:- compact- GoPro attachments- iPhone support- quad lock mounting line ups are better than anything I've previously seenCons:- not cheap (case + out front mount + GoPro attachment)- android support mediocre as expected
