Read about this in Time Magazine at my nutritionist's office and decided to try it.  I've been on an anti-inflammatory diet and have not been able to eat regular pasta.  Although this product is rather expensive I decided to give it a try and I'm happy I did.  Really does taste good and satisfies my craving for pasta.  Haven't found a good sauce yet but am working on it.  I'm glad I tried it!
