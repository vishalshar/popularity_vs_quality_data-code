The main reason I bought this lock was for the push notifications.  And the first day I installed it I was ready to send back the notifications were not  showing up except when I was at home.  Not very useful, Lo and Behold 24 hours later Apple TV had an update and my August lock also had an update.  So that morning I open the front door, and sure enough I get a Apple Home notification The door is Unlocked.  Well I turn off WIFI (did not wanted to make sure it was gonna notify  me when I was away from home.  sure enough I lock the door, I get a push notification the door is locked.I am sure the Engineers at August are working on the next step to add these notifications to the Activity log.Some of the great things about this lock, You can set the lock to unlock when you get in the vicinity of the door.
