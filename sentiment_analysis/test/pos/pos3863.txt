Overview of my travel experience with the suitcaseI travelled with the bluesmart carry-on suitcase during a 3-week business trip involving international flights to the USA/Canada. I travel for work or leisure at least once a month for extended periods as well as weekend trips and was in the market for a new carry-on and was intrigued by the technological features it advertised. See pictures for the bluesmart in action.Features I enjoyed:1) Auto lock and auto unlock: The app allows you to enable the auto lock when separated, which gives you some comfort that if someone else does get their hands on it, you have some time to track it down before anything happens. It also notifies you if it ventures too far. The auto unlock feature was useful when I was near my suitcase and wanted to open it without having to take out my phone and unlock it through the app.2) Location: My biggest fear is someone picking up my suitcase and fleeing, so it was assuring to be able to track its whereabouts. However, you have to be within Bluetooth distance for it to kick-in.3) Weight scale: Im usually a reasonable packer so Im rarely overweight but the built-in scale is a good feature for those who are moving heavier goods.4) Charging: There were 2 USB ports and an accompanying fast-charging cord which was useful as there werent many accessible charging stations at the airport.5) Durability: I originally intended to carry-on my suitcase on my return flight, but the airline checked my suitcase at the gate, so I was initially concerned of how it would fare against the rough treatment that checked bags usually undergo. The bag didnt have noticeable signs of wear and tear and looked almost as good as new and exceeded my expectations on material quality and durability. See picture with tag included in review.6) Compartments: There are two main mesh flaps that act as good organizers for belongings as well as an outside compartment accessible from a zipper that is a good shield for laptops. Most carry-on suitcases have an outside zipper compartment that is poorly protected (i.e. by fabric), or require you to unzip the whole bag to retrieve your laptop.Development points:1) Shared access among users: Currently, the suitcase is only controllable by one user at a time, however you are able to transfer ownership of the suitcase by sending an email to bluesmart to allow someone else to use the suitcase. Through reading the FAQs on the website, it seems as though a shared access feature will be implemented soon where this extra step will be bypassed so I am looking forward to that.2) Variety of product line: I think this product would do well with a checked bag counterpart as it would solve many travellers worries of losing checked baggage with the location feature.To buy or not to buy?While I was in line to pass security, another traveller noticed me controlling the bluesmarts lock with my app and commented on how it was a unique feature. I think the market for travellers who demand more from the products that accompany them, who are open to using technology to enhance their experience, and who dont mind spending a bit of money in doing so will find a good investment in their purchase.
