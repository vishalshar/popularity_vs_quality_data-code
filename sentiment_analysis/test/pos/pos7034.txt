I love this so much I had to leave a review right away. This is by far the best car phone mount I've ever had. It is super sturdy and the suction base is also sticky to mount on most any surface. I have a 2009 Subaru Forester and the dashboard is porous. A regular suction cup wouldn't work on it. This one sticks on very solid and the stickiness fills the porous holes in the dash to allow for an ever stronger hold with the suction. I didn't know it was sticky. I was going to get a strong adhesive to permanently attach it. That was a nice surprise. It came with an extra sticky suction pad too! It is very easy to adjust and holds very solid once tightened. It does not rattle at all and does not feel cheap in any way. The operation is incredible. This truly only requires one hand operation for both holding and removing the phone from it. It holds the phone very strongly too. I'm not at all worried of my phone coming loose or even the whole mount coming loose. The one improvement that would be nice is to allow you to adjust the pivot of the base. Once this is mounted you can't turn it without removing it. Thankfully in my case I love it right where it is. I 100% recommend this product. I've spent this same price on crappy phone mounts. For this price and quality you can't say no.
