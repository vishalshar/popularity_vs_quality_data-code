Used these for a backpacking trip and they were pretty impressive. The towel material is really thick. Definitely more like a wash cloth than a baby wipe, and the towels are larger than a regular wash cloth. We were pretty dirty after hiking all day up and down a mountain, so it took 2 to get as clean as I'd like to be, but one got rid of the appearance of dirt. For after a workout where I was just sweaty and not filthy, these would be perfect.
