I've never had a smart watch before, and I've always been interested in getting one. Since I love my iPhone, I was pretty much stuck with the Apple Watch (which I didn't like for many reasons), but thank God I was wrong!I am not looking for anything incredibly complicated or a mini phone on my wrist. Just something that would help make my life easier and more convenient -- and the Pebble Time Round was just the ticket!The Pebble Time Round has the aesthetics that I like. Great design. Not flashy, but still pleasing to the eye. Oh, and it has to look like a watch, not a gadget. I don't know why people are complaining so much about the bezel, but it's not bad at all. The strap is okay -- but you can change it so it's a not big deal at all.Now that I have this watch I can tell time, get directions, track my steps & sleep, have a checklist, check the weather, get notifications (text messages and calls), get a quick glance of my calendar (agenda for the day), and get subway info without having to take out my phone. An added bonus is I can call Uber with it, too.There are a lot of other apps (health, developer, etc) and functionalities (alarms, calculators, etc), but all I need from my smart watch are the tasks/features that I listed above. The quick charging and long battery life doesn't hurt either. It's also very customizable with different watchfaces and I can rearrange the order the apps appear on my watch.Overall it looks great, solid construction, even more solid functionality. It works for me and my needs. I'm a happy pebbler!
