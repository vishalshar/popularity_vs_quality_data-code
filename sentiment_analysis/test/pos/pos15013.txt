Lives up to its claims very nicely.  While I will probably get more use out of it when we're traveling and trying to stay charged in a hotel room somewhere, I use it nightly to recharge my phone, my Nook Color, and my ear piece.  I also use it occasionally to recharge a battery for use at campsites or while on the road.  My wife will probably use it to keep her tablet and keyboard charged, as well.
