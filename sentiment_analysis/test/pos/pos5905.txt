Very Durable! This is a great product! I bought two of these a year ago to use on our goats. Even with 15 acres of lush grass they preferred everything my neighbor's property had to offer. I was worried that the "Little" dog collar wouldn't withstand a goat's abuse, as they rub up against anything they can find to scratch themselves; but these collars are still going strong. I have just had to replace the screw-in contacts because I didn't think to tighten them periodically, but they were cheap and I doubt I'll have to do it again. I use the Fido's Fences replacement batteries which run about $5.50 a piece and last approximately 8 months of continuous use. Until you have owned a goat, you might not appreciate how impressed I am that these collars still work!
