The product is excellent, and at a great price, but both bags had split open at the bottom seam before they arrived, so it was a mess. If the bags are too weak for the weight (which they obviously are) then put them into other heavy-duty plastic bags before shipping so the Xylitol is at least contained, and not loose in the box.
