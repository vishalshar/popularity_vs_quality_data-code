I liked the sleeker, more stylized look to this product compared to all the other phone mounts I've seen offered. It's just as appealing in person and doesn't look cheap or clunky at all. At first I was a little put out at having to drop twenty bucks for what is essentially a piece of plastic, but I got over that pretty quickly when this got here.Adhesion is great, and I'm not having the problems with the expandable arm that I see other people mentioning. My phone (a Samsung Galaxy Blaze) in its protective case fits snugly when cradled and comes out easily with little pressure. You don't have to pull on the arm to dismount your device; I just grasp my phone at the top or bottom and pull it toward me.I could see tossing this in my bag and travelling with it if I have to rent a car at my destination.I'll be ordering another one, because my husband prefers his phone's GPS over his TomTom, and this has been a good purchase from a functionality, usability, and appearance standpoint.
