The scanner comes with USB cable, installation CD, quick guide, and warranty card.PROS:-Comes very nicely packaged (for those of you who might plan on giving this as a gift.)-Small, lightweight and easy to travel with. Easily fits in a pocket or purse-Fits comfortably in your hand.-Bluetooth wireless connection.-Scans and digitizes documents and pictures on-the-go. The scanned data can be translated or edited for further applications.-Corrects lighting on poor images.-Recognizes and translates more than 70 languages.-Translate and Edit Instantly with Excel, Word or PDF.CONS:-Slightly difficult set up.-Takes a bit of practice to get the scanning process down.The set up process could have been easier (especially for my PC) but it works very well with my Android phone and has been a very convenient and helpful tool for both myself and my daughter. I am a mechanic and I use it at work to scan my work orders for future reference and my daughter uses it to scan and save key notes to use for studying for upcoming tests.Like most technology, this device does have a few quirks here and there but for the most part I am happy with it.
