When I came across this while looking for volumizing products, I was a little skeptical. A powder that adds volume? After reading reviews I knew I had to try it for myself. All I can say is WOW. This stuff is like fairy dust! I put a VERY small amount in 2 day unwashed hair just to see how it would do and WOW. It made my hair look like I just washed and dried it plus way more volume! The bottle is small but it takes a very, very small amount for results. I highly recommend this to anyone who hates washing their hair daily but doesn't want dirty looking hair, people who struggle with getting volume in their hair, or people who are just looking for extra volume! You won't be disappointed :)
