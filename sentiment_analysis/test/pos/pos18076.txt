Looking to transfer large data efficiently? The MyDigitalSSD 128GB OTG is your best bet. This portable external solid state drive lives up to its definition as a superspeed, lightweight, pocket sized storage companion.What's INSIDE the BOX- OTG USB 3.0 mSSD- 6 inch USB 3.0 cableI was looking to transfer practically a whole user profile from an outdated laptop to a newly purchased one. That included documents, images, videos, setup/installer files - you name it. In addition, I wanted a storage device that was portable and useful for my works laptop as I would need to backup important project files from time to time and work on them from home.Out of the four (4) choices (e.g. 64, 128, 256, 512GB), I went ahead and purchased the 128GB. When I first held the portable SSD in my hand, it felt lighter compared to any USB storage device I own. Skeptical at a glance, but once I used it to transfer a 10 GB directory filled with documents, images, and videos, into this SSD, I was fairly impressed. In about 3 minutes, the directory was completely copied into the portable SSD. Even opening a few files took merely seconds.Its sleek and lightweight, just as advertised. With the assumptions of it being an SSD storage device, it has satisfied my relatively obvious needs - which is to store lots and lots of data. Ive had this device for little over a month now and it has been doing its job. However, I did observe that it wasn't able to transfer a mere 4GB ISO file. My workaround was to compress the ISO file and then it was able to transfer successfully. I literally carry this around everywhere I go that sometimes I dont even know I have it on me.Pros- Lightweight- Pocket Size- 3.0 SSD- Shock ResistantCons- Not scratch resistant- Case sold separatelyBottom LineThe portable MyDigitalSSD is a great investment. Use it for the simplest of reasons - to store data.
