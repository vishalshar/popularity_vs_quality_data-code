I am a very large, very sweaty male with a long commute.  I used to bring a spare undershirt to work everyday, and keep a spare dress shirt in my car just in case it gets really bad.  These wipes have changed that.  Using these in the bathroom every day at lunch is basically like having a shower in the middle of my day.  I feel ten times fresher and much more confident through the afternoon.They remove oil and sweat immediately, and leave your skin moisturized and clean.  They deodorize while leaving a very light, pleasant, gender-neutral fragrance.  They're not great for hair, but combined with a dry spray shampoo you can basically skip the shower totally.  Not that I do...Anyhow, while it seems that these wipes are primarily marketed toward women, I highly recommend them for men as well, especially if you are of the especially moist persuasion such as myself.  Just give them a try - they might just change the way you live.
