Quality control is poor, but customer support is pretty good.  Make sure you order this well before you need it, because it will need to be pressure tested for several days, and perhaps sent back for leak repairs.But once it's good, it's great.I highly recommend the wrench.  Using pipe pliers on the brass fittings is...suboptimal...and get a cup of food-grade silicone grease (keg lube) for helping to seat the several o-rings.The tap is twitchy.  It doesn't have good detent positions for off or on.  If you pull it all the way forward it also slows to a dribble, so there is a "magic spot" where it pours nicely, but no detent there means it will fall forward to the "dribble" position if you don't hold it.
