The first batch of mushroom came out nicely and tasted amazing. The instruction said you can get a few crops from one package, but my second side of the mushroom never came out even though I did the same treatment. (*After several days of this review written, the second side started to grow some mushroom. Not as fertile as the first time. I wonder what affected the condition to sprout with more days. Water? Temperature?)  I'd say $22 for the amount of the mushroom I harvested was steep, but I guess the joy of growing your own needs to be counted, too.
