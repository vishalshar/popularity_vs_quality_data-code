A quality gummy vitamin (with one caveat) that contains no artificial flavoring or sweeteners.  Because of this, the taste is pretty awful.  Unfortunately that's just something you'll have to deal with if you want a natural gummy vitamin without artificial flavoring.  It's not unbearable, but I definitely don't look forward to eating them.
