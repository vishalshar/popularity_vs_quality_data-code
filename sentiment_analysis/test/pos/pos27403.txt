I like this one better than the xr because of the wider angle. It is a really novel product. The app works well, but not much instruction on how to use it. I'm pretty intuitive with apps, but this one does have some quirky things going on.  But it mostly works great. Amazing to see different temps of everything around you.  The pics and videos are really cool too. I can get creative with those. I have found weakness in my Hvac duct work, and seen rats in my shed I didn't  know were there.
