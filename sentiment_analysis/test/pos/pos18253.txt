I'd like to start off to say, yes, there is that pink tint on the led when the colour is yellow, but goes away if it's any other colour.Was it worth my $50? Yes and no, considering how my headphones cost $10 more and it seems like i would have enjoyed its competitor more. I bought it because someone I knew was using but the rest of my friends are using a g502, which it seems I would have liked more but I'm intending to keeping to mouse.Pros:-Rgb-Matte plastic body-not-too-stiff cord.-THE ERGONOMICS OH MY GOD, now I may be exaggerating a bit, but damn does this fit in my hand like a small glove. I have small hands but a lot of users have much larger ones, this fits all sizes basically.-made for all type of mouse users, I have a hybrid grip and this works very wellCons:-pink tint mionix doesn't seem to want to fix any time soon-not sure what it's called, but where the mouse and cord meets has an extrusion... it does not look very appealing and may seem bothersome if you're working in a small space.-only 1 dpi button-bottom plastic is cheap compared to the rest of the body-led lights peak out of the scroll wheel like the space bars of a ducky, i'm sensitive to light so it bothers be that a small area is extremely bright
