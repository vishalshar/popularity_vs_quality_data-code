I really enjoy these tweezers. Found them years ago under the "Uncle Bill's" brand, made in Connecticut.These are so great we actually bought a bunch of these one year for handouts at trade shows, sticking our contact label on the plastic tube they came in. We got LOTS of great thanks and comments on them.I am a woodworker and home "handyman" (just at home) and use these for lots more things than slivers. They are so "accurate" in maintaining their points in line, they never miss!Now, the reason I gave this latest purchase these only 4 stars was the new(?) packaging. They came as pictured on a stainless "tab" to put on a key ring, and the slot keeps the tweezers closed. The PROBLEM that I had was getting the tweezers out of the tab ... took a LOT to "work" them out, patience, pliers, and more patience. I threw away the tab.I longed for the old packaging where they came in a small plastic "test tube" with a screw top. Easy to get out, and the tube kept them easy to find in a toolbox, drawer, etc.Will still be ordering these great tweezers, sometimes just as a small gift, but will look further to see if anyone still packages them in the tube.
