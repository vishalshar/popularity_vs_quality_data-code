Well, it does work. First of all, the thing feels very much like a dime store toy. Now, please, don't let that be overly derogatory in forming your opinion. It is actually very well designed. someone put a great deal of thought into it. But, the plastic housing, and the light weight put me off.  It folds up like a little 'Barbie Doll" carrying case that folds out into a dolls dressing room or something. But, in the folded state, it takes  up very little room and is very well protected. Performance....It was very difficult to get the driver to load and be recognized. The hunt for the driver was about an hours worth of frustration that really should not be an issue at all. I am working on a Windows 7 and had to up grade to a Windows 8 Lap top just for this machine...it worked fine, so, it may have been a Windows issues...which has not been uncommon. Expect the scans to take quite a while. The M&F instructions and tutorials are full of this advice.  Scans take up huge amounts of computer memory. So, the best advice I can give is use a dedicated computer strictly for scanner use. Set your target on the turntable and let it do it's thing...You will need to take several scans of the same object to get a really good scan that can be reliably printed...but, I understand, this is true for most scanners of this caliber. The scanner should come with a little stemmed stage (like a wine glass, only a half inch tall. If you do not have one, print one. It is very hard to separate the bottom of your object from the stage that scans with it...so, a little table or single post stage is what I use to solve that problem.Lighting is critical. You really need some sort of flat but fairly bright lighting scheme to help illuminate your targets. I fount that battery powered "stick-up" lights work great. Build a little light "Tree" that can light up your targets from right and left and above.  I think I paid 12 bucks for three of these lights and they made a huge difference in my scans. They do not flicker, and have great flat light spread. You have to (must!) calibrate the scanner before every scan. I don't know why, but, this give better, perfectly scaled scans. Calibration is super easy, but takes a little time.Overall, once you get the darned thing set up and actually working, it is ok. The software you down load to go with it is made for people I call "Cadillac drivers" who want to just push the pedal and go. But, it is rather odd...very few options you can tinker with..so, in a way that's good. But, it is confusing at first and seems again, more like a "Play School" video game than a real craftsmanship tool.Clearly, the M&F people were trying to make a scanner for everyone. It is fine for some people less experienced working with 3-D and computer digital modeling. If they ever get their driver to be more workable with Windows it should be fine (in research, I found that the Mac folks do not seem to have any issue with the driver and also, I understand, Macs works very well with this little scanner! A point to ponder) .Final lines: It's an okay scanner. It's probably a bit over priced (In my opinion), but it is well thought out and does scan objects well if you work with it and give it lots of time to get the job done. I would love to have a better software to use with it and yet, for the price, the software does work.  And, it is well protected, so you are not likely to "tweak" it to a point of making it totally screwed up. Put your objects on that little table,and you will be in the 3D scanning world.
