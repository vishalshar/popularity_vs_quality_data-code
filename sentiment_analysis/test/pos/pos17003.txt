I am using this remote to replace a Harmony One.The remote (part that you hold in your hand) 5/5:I love the overall profile of the remote.  It has a great feel in your hand and the buttons are where they should be, unlike some of the other previous Logitech remotes.  The buttons are intuitively located which allows for a quick ramp up time especially for the people in the house which may be a little less enthusiastic about new technology.  I find the home automation buttons helpful as well, and the fact that you can assign them to other things is a huge bonus as they all have dual states and trigger multiple items so you probably will not need to use them all if you even have compatible items to control.I find the fact that the remote does not transmit IR to be a huge benefit to the overall experience.  No longer do you have to wait while conscientiously pointing the remote at devices as the Harmony remote beams the proper IR signals to all your devices.  I found this to be a frustrating aspect of the Harmony One as activity transitions would take far too much of my time waiting for the remote to finish what it is doing.  It is also a huge bonus that you can angle the remote towards you while you are interacting with it rather than having to angle it to transmit IR.The hub:  4/5The fact that the hub is in an enclosure is a huge win.  It is networked which allows for a great interaction with the hub itself and I find that the ability to sync through Logitech's servers and update firmware on the fly a huge win.  I especially appreciate the fact that the hub integrates with my smartphone which allows me a lot of freedom!I have two smaller complaints surrounding the hub.  First is that the IR blaster ports on them are 2.5mm rather than standard 3.5mm.  This makes it difficult to expand the remote with additional blasters.  Such upgrades require adapters or modifications to the blaster wires themselves in order to connect multiple blasters to one port (which you can do).  If you have everything in one cabinet this probably won't affect you but for me this was  a little bit of a headache.  The second complaint is that you cannot pair additional Logitech devices to the hub.  I was looking at possibly picking up  the Logitech keyboard but it looks like I'll need an additional hub.Usability 4/5:My only real complaint is that the software is designed to be too easy to use for the standard scenarios and advanced options are more difficult to find.  This has been a problem for the Harmony line of software in my mind.  For example the option to ensure that your DVR is never powered off is buried deep in the device settings.  You cannot control this option in the activity and you cannot remove the DVR from on/off sequences.  While the DVR option makes more sense in device options finding the option makes using the software difficult and requires a bit of searching which might be a problem for some users.The other problem that I find with the software is the division of the home automation and device/activity options.  There are no ways to mix the home automation and device options in ways that make automation more fluid.  They are separated in the software which is not only a problem when you want to make sequences that contain both but it also leads to confusion.Overall a very nice remote, I'll give it 5 stars and it is safe to say shut up and take my money.  I can hope that Logitech will come up for solutions to the small software issues which is this remote's only blemish that may frustrate some users.
