So for, the unit performs as advertised.  The only minor negative I can make is the radio tuner is anolog, not digital.  I did not pick that up anywhere in my research.  It is not a big issue, just takes a little longer to select a different station.  On the plus side, there is an indicator to tell you you've locked in the frequency.
