In all honesty this score should be a 4.5 or 4.6, but lacking such options I chose 5, as 4 stars would be far too low.Cons:No waist strapNo reflective coating on the backTough to load main compartment when fully unzippedAll side pockets expand into main pocket giving lots of organization but not as much extra spaceCould use a top pocketPros:Very comfortableVentilated shoe pocketGood amount of organizationHolds way more than you would expect it toBuild quality seems to be good (only used for 3 weeks at time of writing)Good looking (personal preference)\Anti-microbial coating (smells fine even after hauling gym shoes for a while)Very VersatileOverall:I use this backpack for biking to and from work. It isn't perfect but for the price and how much I can hold in it, its honestly great. It has some flaws and I cannot speak to how long it will hold up over time. But considering how much it can hold and the price I don't think this is a bad purchase. Seems to be a versatile and efficiently designed backpack. Will be keeping an eye on Apera and hopefully they make even better bags down the line.Updates and Edits:Having used this backpack for a few months now I'd say that my previous thoughts are still all valid. The bag doesn't seem to be damaged or worn in any way despite heavy loads and biking with it 5 days a week.However, some new complaints have come up. The shoe pocket extending into the back rather than being an extension is pretty poor design. It means that if you want to put nice shoes in the bag and use it for other stuff they can easily get squished or take up too much room.Also, the shoulder strap adjustment is fine, but the excess hangs off annoyingly rather than being secured back with an elastic as it should be. I purchased some velcro tape and tied it back myself.This is minor but the bag could seriously use a water bottle pouch.Finally, there is absolutely no waterproofing. A laptop I had was ruined in this bag, and I count this as a fault of the bag manufacturer as this being a "sports" bag it should have some kind of waterproofing. My fault for not thinking but shame on Apera for not including it. I purchased a rain cover and have been fine since though.In conclusion, I am reducing my score from a 5 to a 4. This bag has some faults and requires extra purchases to fix them. For 120+ dollars I expect a bit more but they aren't total deal breakers.
