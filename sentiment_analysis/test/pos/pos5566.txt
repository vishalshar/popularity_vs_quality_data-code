The GreatCall Splash emergency device is a Godsend for me.  Living alone with some health issues, it gives me a sense of confidence and of feeling secure and safe wherever I am.  One touch of the call button and a friendly and competent operator immediately answers to find out what my emergency might be.  With GPS capability, the operator can locate me immediately and if I am unable to answer, area emergency services are immediately notified to render aid.  The basic service runs only $15.00 a month.  An upgrade will give a subscriber the added advantage of a medical support team of both doctors and nurses which is useful if the user has a medical question before emergency services arrive or are notified.  The upgrade only costs $20.00 per month.  This device and its services are with you at home and away.  And, it is even safe to use in the shower.  GreatCall Splash uses the service network of Verizon, so wherever there is Verizon service, the user can reach a responder.  And, Verizon is almost everywhere.  I would highly recommend this device to anyone with a medical or safety need.  Great product and a great service.
