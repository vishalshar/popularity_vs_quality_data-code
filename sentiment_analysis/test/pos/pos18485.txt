My harmony remote died and I needed a simple universal remote, easily programed.  I found it with blumoo.  When programing my ipad as a second remote it did lock up on me and I wrote an email for support on blumoo.com.  The response was minutes NOT hours or days!  Quick fix and on my way again.  They even checked in with me later to be sure everything worked and I didn't have more questions!  This is not an isolated incidence.  A friend also bought a blumoo and wrote to support with the same response and success.  Great product and easy to program.  Macros are wonderful.
