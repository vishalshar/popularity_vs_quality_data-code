Our first child had trouble getting enough milk in his first week of life and ended up in the hospital with jaundice. We hired a lactation consultant to come to our home to help with the feeding and one of the first things she did was set up a scale to weigh our baby before and after a nursing session to measure how much he was ingesting. That was the first concrete confirmation we had that he was not getting enough and needed to be supplemented.We didn't want to go through that kind of uncertainty with our second child and the Hatch Baby changing pad/scale has been a fantastic way to track her growth and feeding patterns. She also ended up having problems with weight loss in her first week but our anxiety was mitigated by the fact that we knew what was going on and how to address it quickly. Mommy is also able to record her milk production trends to understand how her production tracks with baby's consumption.In addition, we used an iOS app (Baby Connect) that cost $5 to track feedings and diapers with our first child, but the Hatch Baby app is free, integrates with the scale, and has much of the same essential functionality but with a more modern interface. The recent addition of Alexa integration is an unexpected bonus and I continue to be entertained by the ability to ask Alexa to record diapers or how long it's been since the baby was fed or changed.Even if you do not want to purchase the changing pad/scale, I highly recommend the free app for parents with infants.The setup for the device was awkward but not any more so than for other similar devices and the included instructions were good enough so that we didn't run into any problems, but it's nice to see other reviews indicating that the company is responsive to support requests.
