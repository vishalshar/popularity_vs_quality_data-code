Some would question the protection of the front of the phone with this case but I became convinced as I watched a car accidentally roll over my phone (face up) and there was not a scratch/dent/crack.  It is a little heavier than the plastic cases out there but it will not flex and the edges are well protected.  There is just enough clearance on the front to lay (face down) on a flat surface and not expect a glass issue.
