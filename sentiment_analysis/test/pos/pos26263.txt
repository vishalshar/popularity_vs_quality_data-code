UPDATE 9/23/16:Enter the USB-C port on my Note 7. I could not get a single USB-C Male to Micro USB Female adapter to work with this... Even the one from Samsung. What has worked for me, were a generic set of USB-C Male to USB-B 3.0 Female + a USB-B Male to Micro USB Female. It makes the system look a little goofy, but who really cares, I'm using a thermal camera on my phone! I've attached pictures.Original:I couldn't help but buy one of these! Thermal vision for $215? Yes please! Here's the good and bad as I see it:Good:*High resolution sensor compared to similar thermal cameras (206 x 156)*Capable of great range of temperature measurement (-40şF to 626şF)*Sensitive enough to see the wooden studs in my walls on a warmer day (68şF inside, 83şF outside)*The unit is compact and doesn't require separate chargingBad:*THE SOFTWARE IS VERY BASIC, it will get you by, but don't expect too much*Can't measure temperatures after a picture has been taken (I can interpolate by pixel value, but that would be an easy software addition)*In the previous version of the app, you could have the phone camera and seek camera images side by side, this is no longer possible. I'm wondering if it's a patent issue with Flir. If they tried, I'm sure they could find some legal way to overlay or at least compare a normal and thermal image...*Scenes where the temperature is fairly uniform are very grainy (put something even 10ş warmer in the scene and the image clears up significantly)*Won't plug into a phone with a heavy case on. My Note 4 with Unicorn Beetle case needed an extension, and my Note 7 already needs an adapter, but still. I don't know why the frame wasn't made just a little longer. Most people put cases on their phones.Middle Ground:*There's a focus ring on the standard Seek now. I'm not sure if this is great or terrible. It's nice to be able to focus, but focusing with such a low resolution image is a guessing game... I'm not sure if an infinite focus would be better or not.*The camera calibration clicking isn't a problem for me, though it does seem to have trouble when the camera is pointed straight up (it's much better than a manual calibration!). This click is audible on videos shot with the camera, but if you're shooting a Hollywood movie, you probably want other audio sources anyways...In conclusion, I would certainly buy this again! For what it is, it's amazing, but it has potential to be more. I do hope the app continues to be improved. I've seen that the SDK will be released soon, that's another opportunity for improved function!
