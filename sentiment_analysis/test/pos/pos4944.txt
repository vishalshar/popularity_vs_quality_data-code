I really like the Quad Lock system.  I have mounts on my road & hybrid bikes.  They're very secure and I feel very confident that my phone is safely mounted.  Between the two bikes, I've ridden 200 miles or so in the month I've been using the Quad Lock mount and case.  The phone feels very secure.I like the "Out Front" mount better than the handlebar mount that comes in the kit.  To look at your phone while riding, you have to look down from the road ahead.  With the Out Front, you don't have to look down as far.  Going back and forth between looking ahead and looking at the phone is a bit more comfortable and feels a bit safer using the Out Front mount.That said, the Out Front mount only puts the phone about 2" forward compared to where the phone is positioned using the handlebar mount, so the difference is not real big.  But it's enough to make a difference.I thought about docking 1 star from my rating because of the price:  Quad Lock stuff isn't cheap, and Amazon sells other handlebar mounts for smart phones for less.  But Quad Lock is a very well-designed product, and well-made (including the phone case).  To me, that's worth it, and worth supporting the company.  But if I had a modest income, I'd probably look at cheaper options.
