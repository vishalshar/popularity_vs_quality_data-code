I absolutely love the Hang-O-Matic! My wife bought it before we moved, and it made settling in to our new place a breeze. I wish we would have had one before we moved into our last place, I had to patch so many holes. The design is brilliant, and the product is very durable. I dropped it off my ladder and it wasn't damaged at all. This is easily the best $15 my wife has ever spent!
