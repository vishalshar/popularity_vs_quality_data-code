I've had this for about 48 hours now and can say I have no major issues to speak of.Within the first day I ran it through a couple of tests which I used water/CO2 cartridges (no way I was going to waste beer if there were leaks or unable to hold pressure.)  Pressure is definitely not an issue as I set it for 10 PSI, ran through a couple pints, and it still maintained.  Then did an over night test and it was still fine.  Now I have put beer in it, since yesterday, ran through a couple glasses of it and again pressure is maintained.Now while no major leaks there is a leak when you depress the handle/right above the spout.  Nothing major and I've reached out to Growlerwerks b/c based on design I think this might be expected to see some leakage.  Here is a quick video showing it when I was using just water:  https://youtu.be/41uT2_Z_K-YAesthetically it's 99% perfect.  There are some tool marks but again nothing to be worried over.  See the pics for yourself to make your own determination.  When I took this to a local brewery everyone was like "What is this?", "That is awesome looking", "I want one"  So yes, you could scrutinize over some small marks, but in reality most people don't notice them.  And I knew first batches of anything from KS are usually beta at best with numerous things that get worked out.  It's part of backing a project is that you are getting a first run of a product and there is potential for issues especially when you are dealing with overseas manufacturing.Also, I like many others, are a backer on Kickstarter.  I knew going, in as I've funded many projects on KS, that when we get the reward could be a long wait.  So being also impatient I went out and purchased this from Amazon for a premium.  As to why Amazon got this before individual backers I can only assume they backed in bulk and were one of the first to do so.  Again, I'm assuming but it is logical.Anyways, as of this writing I have zero regrets b/c I have a working and eye turning growler.
