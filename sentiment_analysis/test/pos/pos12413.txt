What an awesome kit. My 9 year old spent 3 hours putting it all together. He hardly spend 30 minutes putting anything together. The game itself is intuitive and educational. Great introduction to circuit building. One caution though. The buttons and switches are difficult to snap into the bread board. Young kids may have difficulty snapping them on and the pins may bend. Overall though, I highly recommend.
