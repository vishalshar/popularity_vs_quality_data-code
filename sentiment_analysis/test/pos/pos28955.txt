I really wanted a smarter phone than my flip but could not deal with the gargantuan sizes out there....too inconvenient for my active, outdoor, lifestyle. This phone rocks. I have had it over two months now and have not experienced any of the problems that other buyers have. I use it primarily for calls, texts, and email so don't do any multimedia. I can't imagine that folks that what to spend a lot of time on the web, watching movies, fb etc would find the phone adequate but it is wonderful for my needs but also have extraneous app that may come in handy (gps, etc). Battery life has been great. Customer service is great. I received email from a real person promptly when I needed help.It could be a little bigger: it is actually smaller than a credit card. The keyboard is very small but the voice recognition is very good. I also purchased a stylus from Stylus.com that fits the earphone jack and is only 1/2 inch long and it works great. If you wear glasses and forget them, you may be in trouble. I do need reading glasses but have been able to navigate and read the phone when I don't have them. I love the size. It fits in the watch pocket of my jeans or in the front of a sports bra.
