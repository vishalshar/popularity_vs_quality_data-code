As a sufferer of pcos I have severely irregular periods. I can go months at a time bleeding then go months at a time not bleeding. Anything I have tried so far has failed at regulating me to try and be able to conceive. I have been ttc for 6 years now without success. I know the first step is getting my period on track which is why I decided to try Premama fertility. It comes in a box of 28 which is 28 packets that you simply pour into 12 oz of water. The powder doesn't change the taste of the water which is a huge plus side for me. I have been taking it once a day for 27 days now I am down to my last packet before I open the second box I bought and I am that satisfied with the product that I bought myself a box for next month! It has regulated my cycle, I have stopped bleeding irregularly so far. I do not notice any side effect and it doesn't upset my stomach. I do notice I use the bathroom a little more but that might be from the fact that I am drinking more water. The one downside is I wish the box came with better instructions like if it mattered when I started taking it and if I should take it in the morning or night or if I should wait a full 24 hours before taking again. There was a few things I would have like seen disclosed before taking but I just went on instinct and drank every morning. I am unsure if this will help me get pregnant I can only hope it will but for now I will continue to use it and pray to finally see that plus sign.
