Cute little Robot and it is kid friendly for use. We got this for our 9 year old for Christmas and he was beyond excited when he opened it up because ordered Wowwee in easy package. So he was excited because there was no picture on the box. The app that can be downloaded in the app store works great and is a life saver when the remote go missing.
