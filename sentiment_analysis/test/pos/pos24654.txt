My tracker did not work in the beginning.  However, after troubleshooting based on the included directions all was well. Then after about a month of using it with no problems, I went out of town and left my bottle at home.  When I returned, the bottle was not working.  I changed the battery, turned it upside down to reset, reset the app...I tried just about everything.  I went to the  H2O pall website and requested assistance and expressed my concerns. The team went out of their way to make sure I was a pleased customer and  I was sent a new bottle!
