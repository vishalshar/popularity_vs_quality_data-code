WOW! this crunchy pillow filled with Bamboo charcoal that you hang in a car really does work. Like most people I use my car for all kinds of errands and sometimes it can be smelly and odoriferous. Plus I smoke in the car and take the dogs on drives so the car has had it's share of Febreeze,solid air fresheners,Yankee candle scents and even those darn tree hangy deodorizers to try and keep the car smelling clean. They do work somewhat but always smell artificial and stale. This Purggo pillow thing REALLY DOES REMOVE and ELIMINATE all the smells. I lugged 4 bags of garden soil with manure on a hot day a few days ago and the car smelled like well...manure. But a few hours later no smell at all...even with my cig smoking the car doesn't smell stale or smoky. It lasts a whole year and while it doesn't give off its' own scent-it removes any offensive smells. Awesome product,earth friendly and a great idea.Give it a try-you won't be disappointed-I wasn't.
