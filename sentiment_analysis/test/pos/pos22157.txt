We are very happy with this coupler and walking our 2 large dogs is a breeze as I only have to use one retractable leash. I'm able to adjust the length of the leash but not the coupler. I agree with another reviewer that an adjustment to the coupler would be helpful. I'd personally like to adjust the coupler so that my dogs are walking closer together but that's personal preference and based upon my dogs' behavior. Regardless, this is a great item and I'm happy we purchased it. I'd recommend it although am not sure how it would work with smaller dogs.
