The concept behind these bands is great, I just have a few issues with them. The weight is barely noticeable for people who work out. I ordered the large ones and find them a bit bulky but still not heavy. The price is another issue I have with these. I would order a second pair because I don't think the product packs enough weight as is, but due to its price I decided not to. As a concept it's great, but the weight and price are an issue for me.
