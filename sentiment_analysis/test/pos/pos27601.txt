Amazing Laptop! Super light and thin. Great for students, professionals or anyone really. Superior quality Asus build. I love the aluminum metallic finish. Boots up super fast. You can multitask photoshop, a video program and game at the same time.This thing is better than a MacBook Pro but more than half the price.Add another 8gb ram easily for ultra processing, gaming or video editing. Monitor is ok, I just use a IPS external monitor. This way I have a desktop replacement at home. I made a video review on v=VfWmC8zmPuk
