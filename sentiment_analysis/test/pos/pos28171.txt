I use this TPMS on a Honda Goldwing.  I have owned the product for three weeks and recently returned from a 3,800 mile trip.  The TPMS worked flawlessly...easy to install, set up, and monitor using my Iphone.  I installed metal valve stems but if I had to do it over again, I would use the T-valve for easier access.  Overall, I am very pleased with the system and would recommend it for anyone considering a TPMS.
