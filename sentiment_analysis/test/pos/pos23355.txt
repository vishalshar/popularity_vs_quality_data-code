I'm currently on day 4/10 and I saw this morning that several little mushrooms sprung forth. This evening, they have easily doubled (maybe tripled) in size from what they were this morning. I'm honestly surprised at how quickly they've picked up the pace. It takes a few days for them to get going, but once they start, they go fast.
