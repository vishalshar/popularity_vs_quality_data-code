I am probably in the minority of women, but I really don't like the look of mascara!  It always looks artificial to me.  I've been using this paraben-free lash masque for years and am (obviously) very happy with it!  It makes your lashes look darker and adds a bit of length without in any way looking like you have some cosmetic on your eyelashes.  I love it, but if you like the look of a true mascara, this may not be dramatic enough for you.
