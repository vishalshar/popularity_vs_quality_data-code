In my quest for the perfect non-plastic cup, I've tried a dozen of brands. This cup fits the bill for the most part.I like that this cup is glass and thus non-toxic, can handle warmer liquids, and does not alter the taste of liquids like metal cups.We haven't had a problem with breakage yet, although my toddler isn't super gentile with things.The fact that the cup does not have multiple valves that have to be disassembled and cleaned is a huge plus in my book.Now, the cons. The silicon sleeve molds easily on the inside. If the cup left out overnight, it's guaranteed to have mold spots in the morning, althoughI disassemble and clean it as frequently as I can. The silicon sleeve isn't easy to remove, but I understand that it is supposed to be snug.The small mold dots are hard to get out but they don't bother me as they don't touch the liquid itself. It's not THE perfect cup, but it pretty good if you are too fastidious.
