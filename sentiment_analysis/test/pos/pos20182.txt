These phones are great in my opinion. We own 2 of them. i have had mine for a year and the best thing about them is that the battery is replaceable, i bought 2 extras but the originals are still working fine. The operating system (android 4.4) is installed with minimal "loaded" apps so you can customize and remove the ones you don't want - not the case with some other devices i have used. Add an SD card and you can basically put everything on it without the constraints of a partitioned phone memory that only permits a small amount of apps. the octacore processor is quick and reliable, i have never had freezing issues - but i will confess that i do not game on my phone so i cannot comment on the phone in "high resource" usages. Some say the phone is too big but my wife and i love our phones and use them for just about everything. The camera while not super high grade, is adequate for average users. I would definitely recommend this phone.
