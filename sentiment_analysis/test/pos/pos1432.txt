This is a great little device. I am an electric power engineer and familiar with infrared imaging used for high voltage equipment diagnostics. I saw a colleague use this device for electronic trouble shooting...spotting hot components on a circuit board. I immediately bought one for myself and used it the next week to spot a failed 13 kV lightning arrestor. I also found an electric strip heater that was stuck on in my house and the root cause of some high electric bills. I was also able to see a small water leak. Since then, I purchased two more for gifts to other engineers.This device has the practical functionality of units costing thousands of dollars. Its real advantage is that it fits in my laptop bag and is always available and handy. Highly recommended.
