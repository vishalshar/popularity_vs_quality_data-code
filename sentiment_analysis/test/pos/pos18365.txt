Great product! Keys don't make noise anymore and I dont hhave keys jab me in the pocket anymore. Its a great tool as I work on having a minimalist lifestyle. Not for someone that has too many keys or for someone that takes keys off there key ring often. I have 4 keys and an additional  car key on the outside. Highly recommended!
