I like these briefs. I review a lot of products on Amazon and these came up in a recommendation I was looking through and I could not decide if I wanted them or not.  I am student, and live on a budget, sometimes I want to be able to smuggle something into a venue- save some cash.  These are pitched as a way to smuggle in a flask.  Towards that end- I think they could be fun in a novel way- but I am not sure how practical they will be in the real world.You can see from the photos my flask, which is a normal size flask, easily fits into the front pocket. But, when I put them on, it still weird to have a flask hanging out in front/in top of my groin.  It produced a bulge and it is a metal container between your legs- which I imagine could lead to some interesting questions on the dance floor.  Also, I think keeping a flask in there would be found any place that might actually be checking.That being said you could probably keep other things there - money, condoms, identification- with less worries than a wallet.  One of my buddies has a bad habit of drinking too much and losing his wallet.  this could be a good hiding place for emergency cash/credit cards.Also- it would be nice if they also opened in the front to make using a restroom easier.  So overall- a fun novelty gift. Maybe some practicality, but maybe not.I am reviewing these 'Speakeasy Briefs: Men's Stash Underwear' in an effort to help other Amazon customers through relaying my experience with the product and providing any insight I garnered. Had I not liked this product, I would state so here in my review.
