I really like Kinsa's products.  I recently updated this product from their initial offering.  I wanted to avoid using the plastic protectors and the ability to track temperatures via the app.  The in-ear option was something I was willing to upgrade since it was quicker at reading times and my hygienic than the stick model.  Overall, this does a great job of conveniently taking temps and logging it in the app.  The only complaint I have is what the general reviews have stated, which is the connectivity issue.  I don't know if they can update this via the app, but it does become a pain in the backside when you want to take a temp and it does not want to connect.  A couple of times, I had to delete it from my Bluetooth list and re-add it to get it to connect.  Does it happen a lot... no, but it's enough to concern me.  Overall, it's a good product.  It's quick, easy to use, and a good way to track temps and symptoms with the app.  I would recommend if you don't mind dealing with connectivity issues every once in a while (mini 1-star).
