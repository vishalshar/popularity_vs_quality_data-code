I have had the jamstik+ for 4 days and have found it to be an excellent product for learning the guitar.Pros:1. No difficulty connecting it to an iphone 6+.2. Short size makes it easy to move around and work with.3. No worry about incorrect tuning.4. Great feedback on fingering.5. Arcade practice is great.6. Staying on the Fun with Arcade Mode step in the Getting Started lesson because it is fun and challenging enough. Once I feel comfortable picking the correct strings without looking while the notes stream down the screen, I will move on. I did spend a little time on the chords lesson but felt I was not ready to move on and so far I am not bored with the practice.7. Having said that, I have also branched off the given lesson to learn some chords (E,A,C,G). The feedback has been excellent, letting me see when the finger placement registers with the system correctly and also displays the chord letter on the screen when strummed.Cons:1. First thing I noticed when I started was the plucking sound in addition to the sound of the note coming out of the iphone. Not having any exposure to guitars (I purchased a cheap guitar maybe 20 years ago and bought a beginners book but lost interest in the first lesson) I do not know whether electric guitars have the same issue. After a while the plucking sound is not noticed.2. There may be some minor bugs in the software when switching back and forth between jamstik apps that caused the sound to disappear after a switch. Restarting the connection remedied the problem.3. My lefthand fingers really hurt. I hope the calluses some soon.For me this has been a worthwhile purchase and when I start a non-credit beginning guitar class at the community college in two weeks, we will find out if I have learned as much as I think I have.
