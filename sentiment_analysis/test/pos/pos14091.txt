This is great.  I really like that she can use it to help teach her how to hold a sippie cup in the future.  It does tend to tip over more than not.  Great concept but not completely built for my daughter.  She whips her head back and forth really fast to keep herself awake so she tens to get it on the floor somehow.  LOL.  She uses it to teeth on too.
