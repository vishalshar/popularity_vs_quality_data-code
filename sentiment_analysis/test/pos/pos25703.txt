We're pretty impressed with this product. My husband works a swing shift, and sleep is often difficult. He's used melatonin, dark rooms, whiskey (don't judge), but sleep was still frequently poor. This isn't a magic bullet 100% of the time, but he's able to get good, restful sleep much more often. We will continue to use!
