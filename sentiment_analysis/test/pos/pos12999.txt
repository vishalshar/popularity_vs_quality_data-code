Ticwatch is my first smart-watch. I was searching for a watch that would let me track my runs and affordable. This one fits the bill: you get GPS+heart monitor and simple interface to start the activities. The watch is very light (same as my mechanical watch at ~60g) and not too big so you don't notice it. The silicon band keeps the watch snugly on your wrist which helps for the heartbeat acquisition.Notifications synchronization with Android works without issues and Mobvoi support seems to be pretty on top of their game to add features following community requests. On the running side for example, they added synchronization with Run-keeper app and said they would add interval training notifications soon, which is really the last feature I could use regularly.So globally I'm very satisfied and yes the product is still getting better with every release which is a good thing in my book plus it's not breaking the bank. So what's not to like?
