Works as advertised.  You get what you pay for, in a lot of respects.  This clearly sees hot & cold, but as others have stated, does not see heat differentials through walls or at great distance.  I bought this to assist in sealing up my house, to help in hunting down a water leak, and other homeowner-related tasks.  Alas, the seek has not given me any idea of what is happening with the plumbing buried in the wall.  Neat device, fun in some regards, but does not work miracles.  I'm still going to have to do a demo & reno on my bathroom.
