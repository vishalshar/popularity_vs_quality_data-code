Love the way this product is made.  Doesn't take up much space and is right on the sunvisor if needed. (It comes with the holder for it to be on the sunvisor.)  No hunting for it if an emergency arises and you need it.  I hope it is never needed BUT, if it is?  It will have paid for itself in one use!  Cheap.  Bought this for my son-in-law that works in the medical field.
