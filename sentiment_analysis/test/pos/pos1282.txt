The Anti-Gravity case from Mega Tiny Corp not only protects your phone but allows you to stick it to most smooth surfaces for selfies, photography, and keeping your phone out of the way.The case is super easy to put on your phone.  The case also comes with a plastic peel off sticker on the back to protect the stickiness of the case during transport and storage.  You just have to peel off the plastic and then start sticking the case to any smooth surface.I tried sticking the case to a painted wall.  It stuck pretty well but for a short time.  I then tried sticking it to a glass window and the case sticks really well to glass.  It is amazing how it sticks but yet when you hold it it is not really sticky feeling, it just feels textured.  I also tried sticking the phone to a glass table top and that was also very successful.  I like being able to do this as my son is 2 and a half and can not pull the phone off the table after I stick it to the table.  This helps keep the phone where I leave it and also stops anyone from accidentally knocking my phone off the table.  Another great use is when I cook I use recipes that I find online and do not want to take up prep area using my iPad so I stuck my phone on the tile backsplash and read the recipe, prepped the meal and cooked without having to touch my phone with my messy hands.This case will collect dust, dirt and anything else you lay it on just like any other case.  The difference is you can wipe this case down with water and it becomes brand new with its sticky ability.  I like that the phone is secured in hand with the extra grip the case provides because a lot of phone cases make the phone harder to hold on to.I think the intended purpose of this case is to take selfies.  This case sticks to glass so well that sticking it to a mirror and taking your picture is fast and simple.  I use the Galaxy S6 which can take pictures using voice commands so I can stick the phone to the mirror and turn the camera app on then back away from the phone and tell it when to take a picture.  This way I can get more of myself in the picture and eliminate camera shake from my hand.  You can do this at home, on the go (in and out of the car, at friends houses and anywhere you can stick to a flat surface.Now I do believe the price of this case is a little high as Amazon has a lot of phone cases on it for under 20 dollars but do not have a sticky back. In retail locations you will see phone cases for 25-50 dollars so this case come in at the high retail end but it is a small company so prices have to be higher to make a profit.  This case is every bit as good as the 50 dollar cases and is under warranty.I like the case very much so I am giving it 5 stars but the price may push people away from the case.  Do give it a try as it is a pretty nice case.[i received a discount off this case in exchange for an honest review.]
