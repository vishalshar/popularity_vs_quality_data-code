Pricier than getting the cracked screen/glass replaced at an apple store, but you get the necessary tools along with the replacement screen.  Took me ~45 minutes following the online video and phone is good as new.  Would definitely recommend for anyone who wants to replace their iPhone screen.  Good quality tools to get the job done.  The glass screen protector that comes with on it pre-installed is okay.  A bit too thick and edges not rounded.  Still a nice inclusion.Update: the replacement screen had some minor issues. Upon contacting iCracked, they send me a new screen.  Glass screen protector on the replacement is thinner. Great customer service!
