My 4 year old absolutely loved the grow your own mushroom kit.  He has been obsessed with mushrooms growing in our yard so I ordered the kit when it had a lightning sale.  We soaked the soil overnight and watered it two and even three times a day.  After about 1.5 weeks the mushrooms started to sprout and were ready to pick by day 3 or 4.  My son loved checking his mushrooms every morning and every night to see how much they had grown.
