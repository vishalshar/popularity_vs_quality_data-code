A very cool solution for fermenting foods. This fit perfectly on wide mouth jars and continually burp CO2. Just be careful if you're fermenting something thick like hot pepper mash. In one of my jars, gas bubbles formed underneath a bunch of the mash and pushed it upward, which plugged the vent hole and led to liquid leaking all over my countertop.
