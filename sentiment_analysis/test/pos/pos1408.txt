I'm a techie person so anytime I see a new home automation product I jump on it. This device is great if you understand how new technology works. It gets the job done but it's not perfect. It kind of reminds me of the 1st generation of Kinect.ProsIt works petty well. It found all my devices except for the Xbox One. Apparently support for consoles is coming. It works with HUE and other smart home devices.ConsIt is quirky. The "shush" function rarely works for me. This mutes your audio. Doesn't work with consoles like the Xbox. This isn't a huge deal but it bugs me. It needs infrared!!! Does not work in the dark.I recommend this device if you're a techie person and like to explore fun technology. Don't expect a non techie person to understand this device.
