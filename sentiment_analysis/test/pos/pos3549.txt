We LOVE this game and everyone we introduce it to loves it so much they end up buying their own. It's so well built and totally worth the money. We even had a question with a scenario that happened and wasn't in the rule book. I emailed them and the owner directly emailed me back specifying the rule. I was so impressed and it helped end our family debate! ? Great game! I HIGHLY recommend it!!!!
