I love the compartments that can be customized with the use of the spacer. It gives me options. I love the fact that I am not packing a lunch every day using several plastic baggies or individual containers that can get lost. I love the easy cleanup. I love the seal on the container...so far no leaks.I like the insulated Thermos which doesn't quite keep the hot food...hot. My kids eat lunch 3 to 3 1/2 hours after I pack their lunches. Feedback so far from the kids is that the intended hot food is "warm" or "kinda warm" at the time of eating. That's just fine with me. And quite frankly, warm or kinda warm food from home is much better than the subpar hot lunch they can get from school.Other notes:Prepping the "thermos" with hot/boiling water before putting hot food in helps a bit.Some foods stay hotter longer. My daughter loves soup and it retains the heat well.I have only been using this lunchbox for about a month (five days a week) so I can't comment on long term issues.
