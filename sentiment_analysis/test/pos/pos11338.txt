Let me first note that I've owned a pebble steel, and i've gotten my gf a pebble round as well.Pros:1: NOT TOUCHSCREEN. Remember the days when you could blind-text under the table at school? This is one advantage of physical buttons, you can be certain of what you're clicking even without looking at the screen. + it keeps things simple and saves battery2: Battery lasts for 2-3days and fully charges in like 15min. Literally if you're down to 10% battery and about to head out, plug it in for 2minutes and you'll have charged it up to 30% which would usually last you for many hours.3: REALLY SLIM and looks REALLY NICE. Pebble really understands that watches are often used as a FASHION accessory. This watch looks really nice (i have the black one, i got the rose gold one for my gf and she loves it. Her and her friends constantly compliment on how pretty it looks)Cons:1: The "feel" of pressing the button seems inconsistent. With the ones in stores, the buttons feel firm and clicky to press. My gf's one (rose gold) is fine too. But with the first one i got(black), the button felt REALLY sloppy, kind of mushy to press and barely 'clicked'. I got a replacement for it which felt better since it at least clicks, but seems flimsy. Imagine it being loose for the first half of pressing down before you get any resistance that pushes back at your finger.2: With the iphone, you have to keep the pebble app at least in the background for it to work. This is not pebbles fault but more the fault of iOS's restrictions on apps. However, i've had little problem with this since i can just open the app during the morning or if i accidentally close it. But this is something to keep in mind.3: HORRIBLE voice dictation. I've tested on both pebble round watches and the accuracy of the voice dictation.. on a scale out of 10 is around a 3. Sure it gets SOME words, but it misinterprets most of your words. But a bigger problem is that it IGNORES words (i'm guessing that's when it doesn't understand it). This means is essentially unusable. + to activate the function, you must PRESS BUTTONS, to finish talking, PRESS THE BUTTON, perhaps this allows people to add text input to the app easily, but completely ruins a "hands-free" concept of voice control. As a side note, the only way to use the mic is through the voice dictation software (converted voice to text) so if you're thinking of any walkie-talkie or voice communication, forget it.4: Really small app store. This is linked to the very limited functionality of this watch.5: Connectivity distance is really short, d/c if i walk out of my really small room.6: I've been developing apps on this watch and i feel that many things are somewhat sloppily done. Something many regular-users would notice is that third-party apps (at least on the pebble round) DO NOT HAVE ICONS (they're just circles of colors instead). While this is a minor problem, it shows how LITTLE EFFORT is put into the software if something that could easily be fixed is not fixed (imagine if the iphone showed the the time as 10::::30pm(extra colons) and apple doesn't fix it for MONTHS even when everyone knows it's a problem).Overall:This is simple smartwatch: it gives you notifications, tells the time, looks nice, and has decent battery life. Although my list of CONS is longer than the list of pros, as long as you don't expect too much from it, you'll learn to love this watch.
