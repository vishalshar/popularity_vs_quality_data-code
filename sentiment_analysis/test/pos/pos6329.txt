These are great!!  I bought these a month ago..I have used them for Parm, Cheddar, and Blue cheeses, in separate bags and the cheese stays fresh - no drying out so far..  Amazing, since using plastic wrap made the same cheese start to go bad after 1-2 weeks.  I've recommended these to several friends and family members.
