My husband and I did a house remodel and we wanted to listen while listening to music while working on the house. This thing has been around insulation, saw dust and drywall dust and it's held up beautifully. You can hear it throughout the entire house, the battery lasts FOREVER and not that we're finished with the house remodel, it's a great speaker for day-to-day general use. Also love all the colors. Really like the orange. Thanks Outdoor Tech!
