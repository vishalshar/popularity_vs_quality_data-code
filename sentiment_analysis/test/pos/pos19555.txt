My boyfriend has a snoring problem as well as restless sleep. I purchased this pillow as a gift for him for christmas, and he absolutely loves it! although it has not been long enough to see if it helps him with snoring, he has had more restful nights because of it. I have tried it myself and I do agree that its a very comfortable pillow. The packaging was nice as well. In the future I hope he purchases me this pillow in return!
