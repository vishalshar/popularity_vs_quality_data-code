This Drone is as advertised and then some. The drone is very responsive to the controls and the pictures are amazing!  VERY comparable to the DJI Phantom 4 but costs a lot less. Comes with a ton of extras that other "stock" kits do not, to even further increase the value. A great hard shell case ($90value), 64GB microSD card preinstalled ($50 value), extra set of propellers ($10 value) and a lanyard ($5-10 value). That is an extra $150+ in additional value.  You know what you get with DJI... The Bird, battery, controller, and a beer cooler. That is it.  Is this better than the P4, maybe not, but it isn't $500 better.Another huge selling point for me was their customer service... top notch
