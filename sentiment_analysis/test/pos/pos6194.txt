These do work well and give you extra ground clearance, however once installed, the drone no longer fits inside the 3DR backpack. I didn't want to have uninstall and reinstall for each use so I returned the legs and the seller provided me with a refund. 5 stars for working well, being well made, and for great customer service. However, if you use the 3DR backpack, know that these will make your Solo unable to fit in the backpack.
