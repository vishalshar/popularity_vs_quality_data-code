Its ok, it does make you ovulate. I feel good taking it. I just haven't gotten my period in about 6 months after fibroid surgery and I was hoping this would help but it hasn't. But not due to this company, its my own issue to figure out. Never missed a period prior to the surgery and I'm willing to keep trying until something brings it back, as we are TTC.
