I'm going to pretty much echo what other reviewers have said about the Libratone ONE Click. I had been shopping bluetooth speakers in local retailers, and It seemed to my ears as a semi-pro musician who's spent a ton of hours in recording studios that most of the speakers on the market are engineered to deliver X-TREME SLAMMIN BASS BEATS!!!! Some of these tiny terrors are really amazing in this regard (e.g., the JBL Extreme), and can literally shake the windows at max volume. This is great for some kinds of music. But when I'd pair my phone with these units and play MY music (lots of acoustic, Americana, trippy world music and such), the bass was simply muddy and overwhelming.The ONE Click delivers a really balanced frequency response throughout the sonic spectrum, and does not over-emphasize any frequency range. So you can play folk music, symphonic and chamber music, mainstream jazz, and just about anything through this unit with amazing results. My favorite aspect of this speaker is that it doesn't "beam" to a sweet spot directly in front of the unit (I'm talkin to you, Bose). I've tried placing this in a number of spots in my listening space, and as long as it's within about 12" of a wall, it really doesn't matter where you are in the room, it sounds the same. What's truly amazing to me is that you can be totally off-axis, and still perceive the stereo soundstage. Amazing technology.So, FOR ME, this is a five-star purchase. If you want something truly loud (like bumpin down the road setting off car alarms loud), you'll need t look elsewhere. If you're jammin 50 Cent or Rihanna, this is probably not going to give you what you're looking for... as another reviewer pointed out, the claim that this speaker delivers more bass than the competition is simply not true. The bass is balanced... and when it's an acoustic upright bass in the recording, that's what it sounds like (rather than like a digital bass synth). This speaker is all about clarity.  My first try-out was with one of my favorite albums ("Chinatown") by one of my favorite bands (The Be Good Tanyas), and the acoustic guitar and mandolin sounded like they were being played in my bedroom... the upright bass had that rich, "stringy" quality. I think a pair of these could be used for studio monitors if they were capable of cranking out more decibels... they are that precise.Haven't played with the hooks and handles yet, but I reckon they will come in handy. I've looked at the app.  Not much there to talk or worry about, which is just fine with me (if I'm using an app to play my music, do I really want to have to run another app to control my speaker?  Hint: no).I am 100% satisfied with this purchase. Already thinking that I might need another one....
