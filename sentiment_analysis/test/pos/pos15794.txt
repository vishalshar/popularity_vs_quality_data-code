The pipes arrives quickly and seem to be of good quality. They work very well, too! My ONLY complaint is that I made pickled chili peppers and now that particular pipe smells like peppers, even after washing by hand, then in the dishwasher twice, and after soaking in bleach. So, that one is single-use now, which is a shame. Otherwise, wonderful product!
