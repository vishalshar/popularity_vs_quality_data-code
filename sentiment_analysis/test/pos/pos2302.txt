I have perioral dermatitis. My face looked awful. Raw red bumps around my nose mouth and chin and eyes. If i washed my face they would immediately swell and get even more red and inflamed. My dermatologist did nothing to help me. She prescribed Elidel..... it causes cancer and has other harmful side effects. I came to Amazon.com and typed in perioral dermatitis and MetaDerm popped up. I bought it. It said to use it for 12 weeks. It started working in one week. First the inflammation disappeared. I could wash my face without looking like a tomatoe. Then the swelling stopped. By the end if the week bumps started disappearing. I can't believe this worked. I will never be without it. This is my second week and my face is 90% clear. Its affordable, natural and no side effects. I'm so happy. Thanks MetaDerm.
