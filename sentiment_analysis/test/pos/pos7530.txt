The product is exactly what you read about, and knowing what I was getting into, I'm extremely impressed and happy with the Dash.  Bottom line: 1. Works great indoors with decent Bluetooth range 2. Doesn't work well connected to Bluetooth outdoors unless you hold the device you're connected to above your waiste line  3. Calling works well,  better than I expected, but noisy background environments drown out your voice 4.  Battery life is excellent, have had no issues making it through a work day, or day at the pool with family.The only issue I have is not knowing if the Bluetooth connectivity will be resolved with software updates or if it will require additional engineering of the hardware. Here's to hoping it's future software updates...
