Everything is extremely easy to set up and the app gives you step-by-step instructions as to how to make sure things are connected properly (both physically to the door/window and to your network). To allow someone access to your home, you can just add them to your circle remotely using their email address and they can disarm the alarm. It's exactly what most people need in a home security system without any unnecessary features that make it cost-prohibitive.
