I first heard about this product on Cook's Country which highly recommended it. Being a cheese lover buying a good variety of cheeses that often spoiled before I could eat it all this sounded great so I had to try it for myself and I have been very pleased. I can honestly say it does keep my cheese fresher longer then any other storage method I have tried. Well worth the price to save the cheese!
