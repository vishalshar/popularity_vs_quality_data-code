I originally bought a spool of their black filament. It went down smooth like warm butter. I then decided to give the bright green a go. Normally I'm not a fan of bright green anything, but I decided I wanted to do something out of character. I'm certainly glad I did because I've gotten so many compliments and inquiries as to which filament I use on Thingiverse. Honestly, prints look amazing in this bright green. I've gone on printing sprees with this filament and I've already run out. Once I pick up a few other colors, I'm getting another spool of this. Seriously, spend a few extra bucks, get good quality filament. I bought some Inland filament at Microcenter for about half the price of this stuff and I'm regretting it. It goes down about as smooth as expired milk and I'm trying to get it used up so I can get it out of my workshop.
