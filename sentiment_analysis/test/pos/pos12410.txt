A wonderful introduction to the technology of computing. The kit is beautifully constructed; the pieces are easy enough to assemble that my 7 year old could do it with only modest help from me. He is learning to just try things; that hardware need not be a scary mystery, and he is really enjoying figuring out why things are not working as he expected.The construction of the computer is intrinsically rewarding; it then gets even better as the modified-Minecraft game kicks in, and he has to figure out how to relate the buttons and wires - and their connections and relationships - to the actions on the screen. He has never been frustrated when stuff seemed not to work - rather, he just says "we'll figure it out Daddy!".We had a couple of problems we couldn't get past; the Piper support team were fantastic. Strongly recommended.Can't recommend this toy enough.  Great stuff!
