A really good moisturizer. I love how it feels on my skin and use it mornings and nights before bed. I have very dry skin and apply it liberally. I purchased it to replace Tatcha supple moisture cream because of the outrageous price, and although I prefer the Tatcha line, this is a great price and feels smooth, nonsticky, hydrating and dries quickly so I don't feel line I'm leaving most of it on my bed pillow. The main difference in the feel is that the Tatcha feels like silk but after using two full jars, I didn't notice any difference in fine lines so truly wasn't worth the $150 I paid for the first jar or the $100 for the second I bought on Ebay. Jonre is a good replacement, so I will continue to purchase.
