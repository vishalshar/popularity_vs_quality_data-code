Purchased for my husband.  They are a cross between a dress sock and a work/sport sock.  These are not thick heavy duty socks, but they are perfect for casual or at the office.  He found them to be comfortable and great for Spring and Summer wear.  He wears a size 8 and has a narrow size foot, these fit him just right.  They've held up well through washing and drying.  Color is a nice medium grey.
