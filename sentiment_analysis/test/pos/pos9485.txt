I have only had my device for about a month. I have rec'd several requests for a review, however, I think it may be too soon to give a full and perfect review. Things I can say: It is a very well made device. It has an auto shut off timer. I does not tip over. The googles don't seem to reduce the light much so that is a concern. However, I am trusting that the manufacturer has provided the proper protective wear. I wish this was addressed in the info. I have not noticed a reduction in lines around my mouth yet or the "11 lines" between my brows. There is a noticeable reduction of the creepiness in the cheeks area. I have used it more than once on some days and missed a few others. I have used it for a 10  minute session with no side effects, although maybe not recommended. It doesn't say.Instructions say "no more than 4-6 inches away. I try to place it at close as I can. I have pretty healthy skin for my 64 years with just a few light to moderate lines.No device will be a miracle worker immediately, but I am very happy so far and will con't to use. If you want the best outcome, as an adjunct, I suggest a good, mostly chemical free skin care and FACE EXERCISES. Facial massage will also firm underlying muscles and "botox" the tight ones.
