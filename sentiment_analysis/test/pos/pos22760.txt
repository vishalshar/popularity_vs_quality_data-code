I've been using Trophy faithfully for almost 8 weeks.  I am 49 and have good skin, but I am noticing a fuller more youthful appearance.  I am excited to see results.  My husband who is always skeptical of my purchases says that he thinks my skin looks younger and it has softened lines and wrinkles.  I will update my progress later.  But so far, so good!
