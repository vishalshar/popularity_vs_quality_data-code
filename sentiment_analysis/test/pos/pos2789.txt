My husband bought this as my Christmas present. It was fairly easy to set up, the design is beautiful and feels more like a light weight bracelet than a fitness tracker. It also seems to keep track of my steps. The MoonBeam and my S Health show about the same (I don't always walk with my phone on me, so the tracker has more steps). So far I love it. It's elegant, beautiful,  seal and it works! I'd give 5 stars but the app is bland, and there's no heart rate or gps.
