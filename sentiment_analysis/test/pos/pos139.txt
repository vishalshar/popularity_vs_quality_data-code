I did a lot of research before I found this shampoo & conditioner. I sampled every upscale brand under the sun (including Aveda - which, by the way, has sulfates in it!!!). I bought this one because it is free of sulfates, parabens, alcohols, sodium chloride (salt), carcinogenic (and potentially carginogenic) substances, and formaldehyde-releasing ingredients.My hair is fine and dry, so I wanted something that cleaned and moisturized it without doing any damage. It definitely does the trick, and leaves my hair shiny, strong and SUPER soft. It gets rid of scalp itch, too. My sister and boyfriend both fell in love with this stuff after I let them try it. I will definitely buy this again when I run out.
