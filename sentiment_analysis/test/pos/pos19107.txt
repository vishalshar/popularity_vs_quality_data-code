The "Normal" setup up was too tight for me, so I went with the looser setup and they are a tiny bit looser than I'd like. That said, the ease of slipping my shoes on and off quickly trumps any complaint I'd have. I've used them for a couple weeks now, every day, and only once has one button come undone. Rebuttoned and back in action within a few seconds. I truly love these things, and will be buying another set when these eventually wear out.UPDATE: 5 months later, almost to the day, I had one break. I have two extra, so I can make do, but I do wish they'd last longer.
