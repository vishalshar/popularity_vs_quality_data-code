I find it a little frustrating how low the rating of this product is. I would give it 7 stars if I could to bring the score up. Not because the low ratings are not warranted. I am sure those low ratings are an accurate reflection of those peoples satisfaction.  But, the problems those people have are not particularly important to me. I don't care about Alexa, and from my experience,  Color Tigers support is good, so I think they will get that fixed.To me this product is EXACTLY what I have been looking for. I have been a user of the Anymote app for many years. When I lost my IR blaster functionality when I upgraded from my Galaxy Note 4 to my Galaxy Note 5, I thought I would get over it.  Well, I couldn't get over it. I missed Anymote, a lot.Now with Anymote home, not only do I have my favorite remote control app back, it's not going to be taken away from me again if I upgrade my phone.With this setup, I have all my devices cramed into one on screen remote. This includes 2 TVs, one Tivo, and one A/V unit. With Plex (Rasplex) and Fire TV control through the TVs ARC. And the devices that are new enough to be on the network blend into the same remote.I have not found any thing else that will give you this level of customization,  including the Harmony I returned.For people like me, this thing is THE smart remote! I am afraid others like me might miss out on this great thing if they take the star rating at face value.
