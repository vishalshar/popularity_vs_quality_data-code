I have heavily processed hair (half pale blonde/half black like Cruella de vil) and the blonde side was damaged significantly when a salon botched my dying. This has been a lifesaver! I use it twice and week and after the first use there was a HUGE difference in the amount of frizz and knots on that side. I will definitely be using this for as long as I keep up this color. :)
