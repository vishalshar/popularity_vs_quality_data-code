I bought this 6lbs bag for my 19 year old snowshoe who had lost some weight due to an illness and needed something that was better than his high fiber prescribed diet. He loves this food. He was eating it like there was no tomorrow. He has perked up, his coat looks better and he has more pep in his step. It has not helped with his poo issues which is why he was on a high fiber diet but  to make him happy, I mixed the food so he can have it as a treat. It turns out that this food was a hit with my other cats. They liked it so much that I ended up buying two 12 lbs bag for them. It is a bit more expensive than I planned but if my kitties like it, I can spare a few extra bucks for them. Now, if this was on a subscribe and save, that would make me happy.
