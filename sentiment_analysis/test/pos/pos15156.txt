I have read a lot of reviews complaining that this circuits will not hold up after being built. This is just a tool for prototyping and teaching NOT a long term solution. Why would you plan on building something for long use at this price?? If you want to build something long term then get some solder wire,capacitors,resistors, and arduino board etc.. Don't expect this to replace a real circuit, that's ridiculous.Taught my 4 year old how to build a circuit in under 4 minutes! I think he is going to do well in math class...Great prototyping and teaching tool.
