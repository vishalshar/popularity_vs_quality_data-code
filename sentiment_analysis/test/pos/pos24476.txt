Better Back is awesome. I have poor posture, and with that comes along with severe neck/back nerve pain. I just can't correct my posture on a subconscious level. This has helped eminssly. I work a desk job so this portable (and cute) contraption is star sent. When I put this on, the pain is immediately much lower on the pain scale. It also helps with muscle memory, so I walk straighter after using this. If I had to change one thing, it would be bigger knee padding. I'm super thankful for this item. One of the best amazon purchases ever!
