Day one so no long term results yet, but so far I'm really enjoying my PL fitness tracker. I got the band and app set up easily and quickly and have enjoyed my reminders throughout the day to be moving as well as seeing my activity tracked as the day wore on.  The graphs/history are easy to see and I'm excited to see how mine develops over the next several days.  I would never have forked out the $$ for the name brands that most of us think of.  This fits my budget and meets my needs!  Thank you Pivotal Living!
