Our dog LOVES this food, and I love how healthy and vibrant she is eating eating it. Her coat is beautiful, she's bright and playful, and no digestive issues to speak of. We've run through a lot of high-end foods, even tried raw (which our dog wouldn't touch and we ultimately decided against for food safety concerns) and ultimately this is the perfect compromise of convenience and quality for us. We are confident in it, and Maggie is happy and healthy. (For those of you considering for your own pup, our dog is a young, medium-sized mixed breed. Moderately active but we prefer higher protein food, as does she.)
