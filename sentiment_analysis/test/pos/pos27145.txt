This is my 3rd Pebble watch. I have the Pebble Classic, Pebble Time, and now Pebble 2 SE. I like this one much better than the others I've had. It is lightweight. The screen text is much more clear especially compared to Pebble Time. My only complaint is the size of the text which is very small. You can change the text size of notifications but that is all as far as I can see. I've only had the watch since Thursday but I still have plenty of battery time left. For the price, this watch can't be beat!!!
