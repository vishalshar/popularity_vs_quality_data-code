This is the best backup battery and charger I've found. I love that it has built-in prongs so I can use it as both a charger and battery in one and I can recharge it when I'm out and about at coffee shops etc. Most of these backup batteries have to be charged separately with their own cable which is kind of a pain. This one is very well designed and portable and works perfectly.
