This lash conditioner is the best thing ever! I put it on twice a day, once in the morning under my mascara, and once after my shower before bed.My lashes are large, thicker, and stronger. If I stop using it, the results only last a week or so. This product is barely colored, but just enough to see if you missed any lashes. Highly recommended.
