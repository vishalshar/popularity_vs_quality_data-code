Great set of headphones. I've had razer and turtlebeaches. And these definitely beat them! The downside is that I can't connect my phone to them while I'm  gaming like I can with my turtlebeaches. If you have the extra cash I would get them, very simple and easy to use. Sound quality is the best I've had so far!
