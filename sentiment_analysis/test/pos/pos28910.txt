Excellent phone for the price.  Wish it had a micro SD card slot to expand the memory.  It only has 32gigs of internal memory and 26.45 gigs of usable memory. Had to buy a sandisk wireless flash drive to load all my media into.  Only drawback is that while connected to my wireless flash drive, it has no internet service,  maybe I havent figured it out yet. Compared videos against my lgv10, and I liked the l640 better. I'm on the T-Mobile network in Houston Texas and this phone works great on LTE.
