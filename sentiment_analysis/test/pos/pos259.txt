I bought these about 5 months ago.  After the two updates, the connectivity has improved tremendously.  The fact that they can receive updates, makes them a product that can only get better with feedback and time.  There are a few times either one or both ear pieces disconnect, however to me, I think since they are wireless, it is going to happen.  They still function 95% of the time as advertised, so to me you can't beat that, to include the other functions they have that their competitors don't.  For instance the water proof feature is awesome.  I sweat a lot and have had other bluetooth earphones die on me within two weeks to a month and a half.  These have lasted the longest.  Additionally, the fact that you can talk on the phone and be clearly understood is great.  Lastly, by the earphones being able to store music play lists within the internal memory is fantastic!  I don't have to run with my phone anymore for my music.  I love these earphones and although they are pricy, they are well worth the price.
