I love these.  Easy to use, shoes fit just like they had laces in them. I really like the idea that I don't have to worry about tying my shoes anymore, because of arthritis tying my shoes was becoming a problem, now I just slip them on and off. The pack had a few extra in it, but that is a good thing.  Looking forward to ordering a couple more for other shoes.
