First, let's talk about the product. This product works. Period. It is designed well, simply to setup, easy to use, and works phenomenally. The six compartments allow for a good portion of food for larger animals, and work well for smaller animals like cats that can push their food up against the side of the bowl and miss it. The speakers that are used to call your animal can be adjusted from completely silent to very loud using the volume control knob on the back of the device.Now, let me tell you about how it works. We have two cats. Both are on prescribed diets because, well, they were both fat mooks. They eat on a schedule: small portions, five times a day. That worked out in such a manner that, before we had this feeder, we could not go out and do anything that took longer than about three hours. It also meant being woken up at O' dark thirty to our cats whining and complaining that they were dying of starvation (not that they were, but egads man - they thought they were). I purchased two feeders, and we followed the instructions for setup. It was cake. Just use the WPS function on your modem and press the button on the back of the feeder. Done. Then we logged into the portal, registered the devices, and set the schedules. Just like that, it was done. The first two days was trouble, but only because the cats ran to the wrong feeders. A little guidance, and adjustment of the volume control on the feeders and BAM!Finally, let's talk about customer service. On the day we set everything up, the times on the devices were off by about 40 seconds, so Cat A's feeder would go off and both cats would run to it; then Cat B's feeder would go off and both cats would run to that one. I spent a few minutes getting the synchronizations close using the web interface, but it was off all day, so I sent a suggestion in requesting that the times synch up via an internet/atomic clock via the website in the early afternoon. At 8:15ish that night, I got a call from their customer service department.Well, I thought it was their customer service department until he introduced himself as Alex Stone. That's right, one of the creators of the Feed and Go called me. He cordially asked me if it had been a full day since I plugged it in. When I advised him it hadn't, he let me know that the device would synch up to clock in the wee hours of the morning and my problem would be gone by tomorrow. When I thanked him for calling and stated I was surprised he called in after normal business hours, his response was one of the best things I've heard in awhile: "You just spent over $500 with my company. The least I could do was call you back."
