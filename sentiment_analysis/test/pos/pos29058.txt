I got this thing to use for a photo-kiosk for my sister's wedding. I had this thing hooked to a TV for hours and it just worked, perfectly showing the phone's display on the TV. It has its own usb power-plug, so you can keep the phone powered constantly. I can see using this as a cheap media player too. Lovely little thing, with an actual framerate (as compared with wifi mirroring and the like).
