Initially, I was not sure that I was going to keep my Activite as the tracker on the face of the watch did not calibrate with the steps indicated in the Heath mate app.  Kyle, at Withings customer service gave me some suggestions to correct the problem and now I am loving my Activite.  I had a Fitbit and a Pebble steel and my Activite is my favorite.  It is certainly less intrusive on my life than the Pebble and while it does not give me as much information as the Pebble it gives me what I want without interrupting my life.  This may not be right for everybody, but for me it is a pleasant change.  It is a fine Swiss time piece that looks elegant and provides me all of the features that I liked on my Fitbit and Pebble.  It feels good to have taken back a piece of my life from information overload.
