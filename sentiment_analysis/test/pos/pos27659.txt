Just a great innovation! Coravin has changed the way I drink wine. I am no longer afraid on spending money on a good bottle of wine and being worried that it will spoil or I have to drink more than I need to! Just coravin it and keep for years! Now I started collecting wine :) Some people say wine changes its taste after a while, but I have not noticed any changes after a month. I will keep testing and if I noticed anything, will leave a note for you.
