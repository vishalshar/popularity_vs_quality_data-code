I bought several bags of these at my local health food store for $2.99 each before I thought of mailing some to my grown children and granddaughter. I was delighted to find them at a lower cost with free shipping through Amazon.com...what convenience.My younger son's comment was, "Mom, these are friggin delicious!" They hike, bike and camp. His wife is in medical school, studying long hours. What could be an easier snack? Each bag has the equilivent of 5 organic apples. They're crisp and sweet, with 29 calories per serving.These are a hit with our family. We'll be ordering more.
