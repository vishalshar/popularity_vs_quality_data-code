This 3-pack is around $55 at petco, so finding it for under $40 is great. Having it show up without having to think about it (subscription) is great, and much to my surprise, it works very well. I have two cats, one is a HUGE orange cat that can barely fit in a litter box and I have had to make custom litter boxes out of rubber tubs because low profile boxes could cause some nastiness on the wall or floor if my tabby decides to not position himself correctly, but for some reason the scoop free system works, for both cats. I used to use Fresh Step litter, in the 40 lb box, it was the only litter that I felt really worked well, and 40 lbs is heavy and I have had a couple of them break open in the grocery store, major pain. When I tried out the ScoopFree litter, I was really surprised at how effective it is. Also, not having to clean a litter box anymore is a dream. I suspect this might be a bit more than buying traditional litter, but for me, in time and cleanliness, this is great. With two cats, I typically get between 60-75 cycles of the litter, if I get close to 70, I can definitely smell it, but with the subscription, I just have it come once a month and we are all good.Changing the litter is simple, the box is the litter box, the lid goes on the bottom, you dump in the crystals, let the box do its thing, then when the cycle counter hits your magic number, take the lid off the bottom, put it on top, drop it in the garbage. It's probably great for people who live in small places with limited space so guests don't have to look at a litter box when they use the bathroom.I use Amazon to shop for a lot of household items because they are cheaper, and its convenient. This is definitely the world we are headed towards. It would be nice to have a litter box with a sensor, or bluetooth that could order the litter for you, but that will come along soon enough.If you think automatic litter boxes don't work, give this one a shot . The litter does work.The one thing I don't know is if the litter for automatic boxes is interchangeable or not, I haven't researched it, I'm sure the answer is out there. If you are buying the ScoopFree litter box, the plastic hood is a nice touch, but its too small for my Tabby so I can't use it, this makes me really appreciate having the waste moved out of site.
