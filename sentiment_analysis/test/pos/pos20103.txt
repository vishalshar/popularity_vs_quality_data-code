If you are looking for your next phone, look no more. This Nextbit Robin is fantastic. I had a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ prior to this phone and I was simply tired of all the bloatware and lack of freedom I had with that AT&T branded phone. The Nextbit is a breath of fresh air. It's simplistic design, lightning fast speed, surprisingly long battery life and affordable price put this phone at #1 of all phones. This phone harkens back to the good old days of Android where you own your phone and the ability to customize it to your liking. No forced bloatware, no infrequent upsates, no locked bootloader, no nonsense. The 32GB built in are more than enough for the average user. The added bonus of 100GB cloud storage that is seamlessly integrated into the experience is bar none the most easy to use, most useful cloud backup service. This phone just looks, feels, and performs like a top notch device. The fact it receives regularly scheduled updates directly from the OEM vs. your carrier means your phone will always be up to date. My coworker, a diehard iPhone user, actually bought his own Robin after using mine. He doesn't miss his iPhone 6S Plus at all.  Don't be fooled into thinking there are better phones... There aren't.
