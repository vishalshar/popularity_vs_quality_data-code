I paid too much ($129.99, it goes down regularly, but I didn't catch it), but I love this watch. I had the previous pebble and loved it, but two of them died. This one works great. The UI is a little strange on my phone, not the same as the old one, harder to see where to get apps, etc. The band is nice and soft, but water gets trapped under it for a long time. It sticks to me in a weird way and every few days I freak out and have to get it off of me. But that's short-lived and then I love it again. I love getting messages without the whole world knowing. I work with kids so it's preferable not to be texting/looking at my phone during my time with them. Makes it easy to get info.
