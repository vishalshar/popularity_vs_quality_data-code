The whistle GPS tracker give me peace of mind when I'm out on a hike with my dog or even when I let him out of the house.  If he runs off after a squirrel or chipmunk on the hiking trail he's never really out of sight with the tracker. I used to start calling the moment he took off. Now I learned that he really doesn't go too far. I did lose sight of him in a park the other day, but checked the tracker and found him in the next field.
