Great product! Order arrived faster than expected. Simple design, easy to use, easy to clean.I am travelling and it's very convenient to have with me. It's unexpectedly small - about the size of a 500mL water bottle. I love using my MiniPresso instead of drinking the gross coffee/espresso that is typically available while travelling.As recommended by some reviewers, the system works much better if primed with a round of hot water prior to making your shot (this results in better crema). I doubt that it's the full pressure of a "real" espresso shot but it's similar - it's definitely produced under pressure like espresso, so it's definitely not coffee. I recommend three rounds per serving: (1) only hot water to warm up the parts (2) with grinds to make the shot (3) only water to flush out the system.I recommend this product for people who don't have access to reliable good coffee/espresso or can't have a huge espresso machine with them at work/home/travelling/etc.
