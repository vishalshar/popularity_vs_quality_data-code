I really like the case. I actually ran over my phone with my jeep and the phone survived unscathed. The case had some small blemishes but it too survived. I love the magnetic back aswell. It always draws a sideways look from people when I stick it to a cabinet or something. It's very handy. My only complaint is that the opening for the headphone jack is a little small and some times requires me to remove the case to use certain devices.
