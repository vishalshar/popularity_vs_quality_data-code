I am a Flight Attendant and therefore I have a terrible time sleeping with time zone changes, being confused with where I am, etc etc. When I get home I want nothing more than to sleep but sometimes I just cant. Ive tried sleeping pills, melatonin, changed eating habits, shot of whiskey, everything lol.It has now been a week sleeping with Eight and I seriously haven't slept this well since I was a teenager. I guess I didn't realize the temperature of the bed was affecting my sleep so much. I love the warming, I can schedule it to go on automatically so i jump in without thinking and its the right temp. It would be a good function to be able to set the warmer per days of the week so you could do different options for work days vs weekends, etc.. Everything else is cool ( i need to play around with the options more:) but I bought the device mainly for the warming. I love the email recap of  my sleep trends because this heps to see overall sleep quality and helps me see why i did or didnt have a lot of energy. And I use the data next to my Fit Bit data. It would be cool if you could pair the two...maybe in the future. I haven't quite tried to alarm yet but going to tonight. Anyway, great product overall and im enjoying actually sleeping.Thanks Eight!
