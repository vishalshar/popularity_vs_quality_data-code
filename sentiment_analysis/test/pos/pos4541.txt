The unit was easy to connect to my house wifi and mounting it to the wall was a breeze. The camera feed comes in clear and even works at night! The customer service is what really makes this product excellent. My dog decided to chew up the power chord, which left me with a non-functioning camera. I reached out to support and they were able to get me a new power chord within 2 days! They definitely exceeded my expectations.
