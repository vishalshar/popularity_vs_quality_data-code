I have been using 3D prototyping for a long time, longer than most, even when it was a bit over the top in price.  Having said that, my first go around with a personal 3D printer was this unit, the ROBO 3D R1 Plus.  What I like about:  Can run any filament (1.75mm) from any manufacturer, so I'm not bound to this guy or that guy who builds the printer.  Largest build volume for units under $1k.  Fits on my desk in my office.  Not very loud.  Runs with the SD card.  Dirt simple design (which as an equipment designer, means that this was well thought out, well engineered, and put the user first).  It has cool lights when it's running (it'd be cooler if they were something other than white, but I can change that).  And something I noticed when running large circular parts...it sings!  Not really, but if you listen to the motors it sounds like an electronic symphony.  Seriously, this has been one of the best engineering investments I've ever made outside of my longtime subscription to SolidWorks.  I may end up buying four more.  After several spools of material, it just hammers it out.  The documentation is great and the phone support is unlike anything ever.  I called about 1 AM CST, and "Jake from State Farm" was up and got the communications issue sorted (which happened to be a lag with my computer and internet connection for the firmware update, not the actual printer), so I was stoked.  I like the fact that it is made in San Diego, I like that fact that their phone support was not Mujibur and Mohinder, but a guy named plane old "Steve".  Two minutes on the phone and DONE!  Within 1 hours of opening the box (had to prep a space in the office), I was off and printing.  No calibration, no "check this, check that", put the filament in and GO!  I blew through the starter spool in 36 hours running known tests of existing parts and the dimensional accuracy cannot be beat for this price...the end!  Moreover, I cannot see how this machine will difficult to service or maintain due to its design.  My biggest CON about this, and it's because we also design linear motion equipment, is the fact that the bed will have a slight rattle during circular interpolations and quick short bed strokes.  This is due in part to the fact that the bed is supported in the center (by the geometric conditions) and the linear bearing guides could be a bit tighter.  I could probably fix this on my own with little effort, but this is a money maker.  They should call this the ROBO 3D R1 Plus Money Making Machine!  Very Impressed and very happy and very ready to buy another one.
