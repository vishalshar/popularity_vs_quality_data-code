This is a great product, and the kitties love it.  The vet loves it because there is nothing in the bag except dehydrated chicken. Shop around for the best price because it can vary by as much as $20 with shipping added in.  The Subscribe and Save price was very good but it would be shipped in a box with other items that would crush the delicate pieces to a powder, so watch what other items you are ordering at the same time.My CRF (Chronic Renal Failure) kitty was able to eat it for the duration of her illness.An alternative way to serve it is to take the inevitable powder left at the bottom of the bag, plus a few pieces, and grind them superfine, and mix with tepid water in a little dish (see Duralex 2-oz. Lys Stackable Prep Bowls) for a nutritious "cat soup".  You can add Fortiflora for additional flavor & probiotic benefits.  Our CRF kitty would be so busy with her "cat soup" that she would ignore us administering her subcutaneous fluids!As other reviewers have said, the texture of the pieces do tend to vary from bag to bag.  Some are soft and some are harder.  I tend to think that happens in the dehydrating process.
