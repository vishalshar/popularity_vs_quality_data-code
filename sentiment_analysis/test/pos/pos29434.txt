I love these storage bags! I bought similar ones last year to use to put snacks in for my boys' lunch. I felt guilty using ziplock sandwich bags everyday to separate the snack from their lunch, so I looked for a reusable option. I like this set from Blue Avocado because it has different sizes. The bags are durable and thick - very high quality in my opinion. I've very happy with my purchase and highly recommend them.
