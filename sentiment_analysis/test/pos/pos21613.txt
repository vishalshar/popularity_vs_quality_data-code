I recieved several makeup brushes over Christmas and began to break out because I didn't know brushes were supposed to be cleaned daily to weekly. This is an awesome product which has stopped the problem and made my brushes look like new! The directions are easy to follow and the cleaning solution gets my brushes squeaky clean. My only wish is that it came with 2 of each of the 4 sizes of brush guard instead of only 2 of the middle sizes.
