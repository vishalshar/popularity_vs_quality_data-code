Great smart watch.  If you have another Misfit product, set-up is mostly intuitive.  However, the insert showing how to set time isn't intuitive.  The method to set the hands is a bit frustrating to get the hands set exactly on the correct hour and minute (I wish the app simply allowed you to type in the correct time and the hands would then automatically set), and for the AM/PM to register correctly if you plan on using the alarm feature, you need to make sure the Misfit symbol shows up in that tiny window when setting the time...and this is difficult as the symbol is hard to see in that small window.However, once set up and going...wonderful looking watch, great functionality.  It's really quite elegant.
