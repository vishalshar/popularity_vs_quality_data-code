I have an 18 months old Labrador Retriever and I live downtown so until now I have rarely had the opportunity to actually let my dog run free and had to keep him close so he won't jump on people or mouth whatever he found on the ground. I got this check cord because I've tried to let him free a number of times and he totally forgets about me or about the training that he got so far and I wanted something that allowed me to keep him in control should the need arise but still allow him to be a dog and run around.I previously had a long nylon rope that was about 15 feet long. It was too short, it was thin so it tangled easily and I got rope burns pretty much the second time I used it. This check cord is the right length as my dog doesn't really want to go beyond 30 feet away from me and the rope is thick enough so you can easily handle it even if you forgot to put your gloves on -- which are still recommended.I initially was worried because of the size of the clip. For a Lab, it seems a bit flimsy and I was worried that he might break it. He did run once away and I had to stop him and the clip seems durable enough however I learned that the point of using a check cord is to actually just stop the dog from doing things that he likes but you don't really enjoy (running and jumping on other folks, running after some dogs, eating some poop) but during the rest of the time your dog should just drag it around. A smaller clip makes the overall footprint a bit smaller and your dog will forget he has a lead sooner, so I'd say that's actually an advantage.Other than that, there's nothing more that I can say. I can safely let my dog run around, it also helps me with his training in new places and I'm not worried any longer that he might run away for some reason.
