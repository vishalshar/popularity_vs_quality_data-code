I was looking for a supplement for our dogs to assist with liver, joint, and bone health, all without animal products/ byproducts. This is the one! We have one dog with a liver that cannot handle too much protein or animal products, one with a thyroid issue, and one with sensitive joints. Also a semi-stray cat we adopted who was limping for months, but would not let us get close enough to take him to the vet.This has aided in helping our dog's liver function, he is noticeably more active, energetic, and in a better mood. Same for our dog with a thyroid issue who can be very lethargic at times. My older girl is walking fine and is eager to run and play and wakes me up early now to do so! Also, eye discharge has cleared up! Shortly after giving to kitty, the limp began to dissipate to almost nothing!! We give our dogs a scoop twice daily with each meal, in conjunction with a mostly plant based diet and other vitamins. This seemed to be the magic ingredient though to see noticeable results in everyone's health! They also don't even seem to notice the powder in their bowls and eat like they normally do, no aversion whatsoever. I've already finished the first container and repurchased! :)
