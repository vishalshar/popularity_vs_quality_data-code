ive had it a little while now, I'm not a computer / electronics type person.  But it works pretty good as far as the laser is concerned, gets stuck sometimes.  I'm confused on set up, I don't think I did it right ?  It makes random clicking sounds like it's taking Picts , it's prob something I did or didn't do ?  I'm going to get ahold of the company, hope it's just something I did or didn't do right ?
