After using other similar products for years, this one does the job better than others. Seems like all the cons from other similar products have been addressed in this product. Here is an honest comparison:Pros:1. 2mm Stainless Steel makes a very sturdy product compared to other similar cheaper products available. Will last for years.2. Turning all skewers simultaneously makes it easy to cook on grill and especially on indoor oven.3. This rack is 0.5 inch taller than other similar racks that keeps the meat from sticking to the grill.4. Saves from facing the blasting heat of indoor oven for longer time as would be the case with other racks. (my 10yr old loves this feature of turning the skewers like a deck of cards)5. Wider spacing between skewers helps to put larger chunks of meat.6. Locks the skewers on rack firmly making the handling very easy. (a few times I used empty skewers and rack as a base for roasting turkey in the oven. Just put a tray under the rack for the collecting the drippings)Cons:1. Big size of rack makes it a little difficult to wash. However, the positives of bigger and sturdier design outweighs this point.2. Right out of box took a while to understand how the system works. But a little bit of experimenting made it clear. If the product comes with little more directions would help.
