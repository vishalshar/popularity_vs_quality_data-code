Best wheat pasta substitute! I cook the penne in water with a dash of salt and a few drops of oil for just 6 minutes as I do not like it to get mushy. Topped with any sauce, it is very satisfying and has that good pasta "bite."  There is a slight nutty residual flavor, but it is not too strong to overcome a good rich and spicy tomato sauce.  It should hold up well for other pasta recipes including casseroles, as well.
