Where do i start? I am more than happy with my Nextbit Robin. It has been a pleasant unboxing and feeling after getting this phone. Everything was fast and snappy, the camera looked good, it has a nice screen. The reason I am giving a 4 star instead of 5 is because of the Fingerprint scanner. Its kinda effy at times, and wont recognize it at time. it takes a couple of tries at times, nothing major, just a small inconvenience. Other than that. its an awesome phone for $145 on amazon. Battery life is alright i guess. It does drain its battery fast at times, but I always have a battery pack so it is fine.I would recommend it to everyone.
