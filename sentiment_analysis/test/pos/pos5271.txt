My golden retriever puppy, Eli and my 7 year old border collie, Bella love the Victor Select Hi-Pro Plus Formula.  It was proving a challenge to feed them two different, age specific foods so this Victor formula was a great discovery.  A special thanks to the previous reviewers who helped me with my decision to try this brand.  I was going crazy trying to find something that met both dogs nutritional needs, as well as something they both liked.  Also a brand that was not made in China. My dog's doctor is really happy with how healthy my dogs are now.  Bella was diagnosed as diabetic and with a hypothyroid several months ago and we could not get her to eat any brand of dog food, but she likes Victor Select and it also meets the nutritional needs of our puppy Eli.  Thanks Victor for a great product!!!
