This was my 10 year old son's christmas present this year, and it was a huge success!  The kit comes with a booklet that has step by step instructions to build several robots that do different things.  After that, it encourages the kids to come up with their own ideas using what they have learned about the robotics pieces included by building the existing robots.  I will say that if you don't like small pieces, avoid this.  I don't mind, and Santa left my son a storage container with the kit so he immediately had a place to keep everything.  I'm sure we'll be buying expansion parts on this as his knowledge grows.  Excellent product!
