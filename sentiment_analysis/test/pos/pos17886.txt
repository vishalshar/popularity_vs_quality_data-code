Got this today and it is working as expected. I am using it as standalone meaning it is not connected to any security system and I am the one that turn it on and off from the app. Set up was easy enough although it could improve a bit and the sound is OK. I turned WIFI off to make sure it works outside of home WIFI and it worked fine with just cellular connection. Remember when it asks you to reboot you only need to unplug and plug it back in and give it few minutes and it will be back to normal. Next , I will try this outdoor to see how effective it is outside.
