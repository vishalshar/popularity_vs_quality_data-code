For the price this is awesome. I find it is very accurate on the step counter and I love the sleep tracking. The app was recently updated and is much better now, the sleep tracking is vastly improved, syncing is easier and overall the app is more polished. I still get stop error occasionally and sometimes the band or app has minor issues. For example it have me an activity reminder outside the set times for this reminder today. The big thing is they keep improving the product and for the price this is a great product.  The battery life is awesome. I would be willing to sacrifice some battery life for an always on clock display option. Not sure how much this would kill the battery but with an OLED display it can't be much. The only other thing I wish it had was a waterproof case like my wife's Garmin vivosmart along with the text message and interactive display. The stiff part of the band is on the large side so if you have small wrists it may look and feel off and they don't offer multiple sizes, "one size fits all". The display is very scratch resistant and if you do scratch it you get a new device every year for super cheap. And if you lose or break it you are only out $15! Bottom line: It may not be the top of the line tracker but it is impressive for the price and features set. For $15 anyone who is interested in improving their health should buy this. This should be your first tracker and for a small investment you can decide if you want to spend 6 times as much on another band
