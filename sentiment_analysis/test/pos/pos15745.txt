I was a little skeptical about buying this product as wrinkle creams always claim but no results!  I read the positive reviews and decided to try it..was I completely amazed! I have very dry skin and 44 years old ..wrinkle damage from too much sunbathing. I have been using it for 3 weeks now..in the winter months my skin is extra dry..omgggg..what a difference. .I have received so many complimentstories on how beautiful my skin looks! Will b ed buying again for sure. .just remember. .a little goes a long way:).Miracle in a jar..thank you Jonre!
