I purchased this device mainly because there's one place in my old (1925) house where the access panel to a bathtub is on the exterior of the house, and one winter the pipes there froze. I now have heat tapes wrapped around those pipes controlled by an Easy Heat EH38 pipe heating cable thermostat -- but I wanted some way to be SURE that the pipes would not freeze again, and to be sure I needed to know how cold it was inside that access panel.  Now I do.  The ThermoPeanut sits inside the wall between the tub and the access panel and sends updates to my iPhone.  The app graphs temperatures where the pipes are so I can see not only what the temperature is, but also where they've been, and what the trend is.  It'll even text me if it's getting too cold in there (or too hot).  I really like the sense of security I now have about those water pipes!I have also used the gizmo to help me check up on the performance of my new Honeywell programmable thermostat. First I placed the ThermoPeanut right on top of the thermostat on the main floor, and then a day later I moved it upstairs next to my bed in order to "see" the current temperature and track that over time (overnight, mainly, because I bought the new programmable thermostat so I could lower the heat settings while I'm asleep).Really the only "con" I found was the rather limited range of the ThermoPeanut's bluetooth. I have to put my iPhone within about 10'-20' to get a good signal from the ThermoPeanut. But to be fair, I have probably really limited its range by placing it inside a wall, behind an old cast iron tub. With a little better range, I would have given this five stars.I have been very favorably impressed by SensePeanut's service.  The original battery died after only about three weeks, and I emailed them to complain.  They apologized, and said that this was a known bug; there has subsequently been an upgrade to the ThermoPeanut's firmware, and hopefully that has solved that issue.  (When I first opened the device up to replace the battery, I thought I saw it had been installed upside down, however SensePeanut assures me that it would not work at all if that had been the case.)  Also, they mailed me new batteries from France!Dec. 29: The second battery lasted from Nov. 18 to Dec. 22. The app reported battery condition as "good" until the unit suddenly stopped sending reports (due to battery failure). Is the battery draining so quickly because the device is situated inside a thick wall, behind an iron tub? Maybe so. Perhaps I should go for a wired thermometer instead... Anyway, other than this fast-draining battery issue, I have had no problems with the ThermoPeanut, which has done what it is supposed to do.
