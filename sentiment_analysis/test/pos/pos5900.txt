My family has 2 large dogs and 2 small dogs (18lbs and 10lbs) and we have used both the underground and the wireless collar systems for about 10 years.  These new transmitters have only been available for about a year and they are REALLY nice for the smaller dogs.  I ordered this for the smallest dog and it doesn't seem clunky at all like the medium-size receiver.Don't waste your money on the PetSafe replacement batteries though.  If you go on youtube, it will show you how to EASILY modify the battery holder to accept a $1 battery instead of the PetSafe RFA-188. You just trim away a couple of tiny pieces of plastic and the battery pops in and out.  I needed one (RFA-188) in a hurry and it cost me $13 at Petco.  After I modified the batter holder I ordered 5 batteries online for $9 with shipping.
