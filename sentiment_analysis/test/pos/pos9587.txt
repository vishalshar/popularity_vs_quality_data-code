I would definitely recommend this product, but encourage cat owners to take the time to properly install the fence and train their cat. It took about 2-3 weeks before we could just let the cat out (and even still, your pet should be monitored). Our cat now purrs when I put the collar on because she knows she gets to be outside. We're able to let her out longer and more often than before since we don't have to worry about not being able to find her if we need to leave. We live in a very rural area and while we're far from the road, our house is surrounded by woods. Our cat was disappearing far into the woods for hours and while most people in the area let their cats roam day and night, they also often don't have their cats for very long... so we decided to invest in this fence. There is no physical fence around our yard, so I wondered how well an invisible boundary would really work. So far, so good - although I expect her to test the limits when she has the opportunity.The manual that comes with the fence outlines two training methods, which we combined. For the first week of outdoor training, she was on a leash. This was difficult. There's a reason why you never see people walking their cat! The receiver collar did not bother her, but the harness and leash really did. The collar makes a beeping sound when the cat approaches the zap/correction zone. At this point in the training you encourage her to turn around by pulling the cat back and saying "run away!" while waving a white flag (and feeling a little foolish). In the next stage on you let her get the shock (correction), and then pull her back before she gets beyond the boundary line. I won't lie, this is a little traumatic for both you and the cat! It was a rough week.The second week I used the "tie-out method" - and staked her out at different points in the yard. leaving the length of the leash just long enough for her to get into the "correction" (i.e. shock") zone, but not through it. You really need to watch your cat if they are staked in the yard - ours would manage to get the leash tangled around herself and objects all the time. She did not enjoy being staked and would at first pull and pull when she got to the limit of the leash. Eventually she figured it out. Honestly, the leash aspect of the training was more difficult than the shock training in some ways.She did run through the boundary several times during the leashed and unleashed training. We needed to adjust the boundary width (i.e. width of the warning beep and correction zone) and the level of the shock/correction, and this solved the problem. She now rarely receives a shock because she responds immediately to the warning beep. Success! She has adjusted much better than I could have imagined to having limits on her wanderings and we no longer have to wonder where she is and if she's been eaten.My 4/5 star rating (instead of 5) is because Petsafe really should let you know that you can replace the batteries yourself, rather than purchase their expensive replacements. Also, keep in mind that an invisible fence isn't fail-safe - your cat can still get outside the boundary. However, it greatly reduces the likelihood that they'll do so. Our cat is happy that she gets to be outside, and we worry less. Excellent!
