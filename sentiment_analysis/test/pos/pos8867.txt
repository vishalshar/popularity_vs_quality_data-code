I have already begun my journey into 3D pen art with the 3Doddler Start.  It's fun, but has a finite color palette, so I wanted to try this one too. So far, I love it.  There is a lot to say, so I will break it down into pros & cons.Pros:It has a slim body, making it easier to handle.  Many of these have rather chunky bodies, so they are tiring to use for any length of time.It has 2 heat settings, for PLA & ABS plastics.  Not all of these pens do.It comes with a nice assortment of filament sticks, to start you off.The company sells a wide array of colors and styles of filaments (including clear, opaque and metallic.)The included instructions are very clear. (Do read them all the way through before you start.)The company's website has loads of videos and project plans to teach you to use it and give you ideas. The site is www.the3doodler.comCons;The filament can get jammed (but tools and instructions for unjamming are included.)  To be fair, I suspect this is true with other 3D pens, as well.It takes 3mm sticks of filament, which means that you are best off using their product and there is only so much of it available in stores. ( I can get some colors at Michael's, but mostly I have to order it.)Finally, some suggestions;The tip of this pen (or just about any, but the 3Doddler start, which is made for kids) gets rather hot.  So keep it away from your fingertips.Also, plan to have a heat-tolerant surface where you can put it down, when you need to.  A silicone pot holder with do nicely.Check out some of their accessories. I have found the Doodle Pad ( a plastic overlay) and the extra nozzle set especially useful.Spend some time with their basic instruction videos.  This takes some learning.The fun is as limitless as imagination!
