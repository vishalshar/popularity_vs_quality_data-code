This tunes my guitars much better than I can.  I've used it on two different guitars, a Takamine EC132 nylon classical and a Martin custom D steel acoustic and the ending result was, well, amazing.  However, it does not seem to go far on a charge.  You'll want to make sure it is fully charged before tuning something.  It does not take much time to bring it to a full charge, but make sure you take the time to do so.  I did not have a full charge when I tried to tune the 4th "D" string on my Martin custom D, and I think it was having trouble communicating with my cell phone, so it wound the string so tight it broke the string.  While installing a new string, I plugged it in to the charger and when I was done with the new string, it had a full charge and worked fine.  It tuned the Martin much better than I could have ever tuned it with my ears.  If you have multiple instruments, or want to change the tuning, just remember to have it completely charged before you begin.
