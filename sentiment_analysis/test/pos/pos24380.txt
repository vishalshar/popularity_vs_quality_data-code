Being introduced to Bizzy coffee has been wonderful for my daily life.  As a long time sufferer of IBS, I cannot begin to tell you how great it is to drink a coffee with very low acidity.  The coffee gives me a natural energy boost and no side effects (normal coffee can cause acid reflux issues, etc).  I mix this concentrate (1 bottle gives me about 6-8 servings of coffee)  with water and soy creamer and the taste is great.  I would highly recommend!
