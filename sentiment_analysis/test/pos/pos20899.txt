I have played 1 round with Game Golf, and really like it.I had previously attempted to track my rounds with a few different phone apps (most recently SkyCaddie).  But I find that a few holes into a round, it just gets to annoying to have to turn on your phone, unlock it, tag your shot etc etc.  It messes with your routine.  I could never get myself to tag an entire round.With Game Golf, you just have to remember to tap the grip to your belt.  No phone required.  I forgot to tag 4 shots in my first round, and the web-site made it fairly painless to add those missed shots when reviewing the round.My shot data appeared pretty accurate, with a couple of shots appearing just a few feet wrong on the course map.  One hole, a short par 3, had the primary tee box under repair.  So we had to tee off about 50 yards away in a temporary tee box.  I thought that would mess up Game Golf, but the shot appeared just fine in the website, from the temporary tee.The only thing that threw me off a bit is there is no way to enter a penalty shot while on the course.  So I had to remember those when editing the round on the PC afterwards.  I may attempt to double-tag each penalty shot just as a reminder.The simplicity of this thing is the key feature.  Using it did not feel like a chore.
