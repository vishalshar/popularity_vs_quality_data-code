I do a lot of air travel for my job and have been really impressed with the BlueSmart product. Mainly traveling on flights from the East to West coast, I find my electronics always low on battery and the charging feature is so convention to make sure I remain connected.Pros:- TSA laptop sleeve: it's never been so easy to deal with my laptop going through security.- Charging function: plugging in anywhere (airport or airplane) is convenient.- Locking function: this feature keeps my items secure in large airports as well as notifying me on my phone if I move too far away.- Sleek and compact: I'm a big fan of the overall design with the BlueSmart branded features. It makes the bag recognizable without being overly obvious.- Lightweight: the scale makes it easy to know how many LBS you're packing but even at full capacity I was able to walk around Downtown LA for a few miles without breaking much of a sweat.Could be a bit better:- Size: the bag will fit on any airplane and fits enough for 4-5 days on the road but am hoping a larger model is coming soon for longer trips.Overall, very impressed with the product and look forward to trying more products from BlueSmart in the future.
