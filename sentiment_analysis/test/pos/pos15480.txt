I had the Tagg for several years, and had many complaints about the device, the service and the iPhone app (really a mobile web site, never updated). My main complaints about Tagg were that it easily detached, even when the dog wasn't active, and the GPS was fairly useless because I you would get only the nearest street address. The Tagg finally fell off in the area of a construction site with little remaining charge. I must tell you their customer service agent worked with me using Google maps and Street View for about an hour, but I couldn't find it. (If it had bluetooth that would have solved it.) I agreed to purchase the newer Whistle.Here are the pros and cons of WhistleWhistle Pros: Battery lasts several weeks instead of days, the attaching mechanism is different. Instead of a flimsy spring clip on each side, the device slides firmly into the holder. Whistle locating and mapping is better. The Mapping service is superior as you can see the outlines of houses, fence lines, walking trails. Whistle customer support superior.Whistle Cons (vs. Tagg): much slower response after dog has left the home area. Tagg notification of breach was slow, Whistle is slower by minutes. I found Tagg's website extremely helpful as I could see my dog's 24-hour daily activity in 10 minute increments. This was extremely useful when my neighbor angrily accused my dog of disturbing him by barking by the fence for hours at night. The Tagg site showed she was sleeping, not moving, at the exact times he was calling me to complain (My phone was turned off, but the voice mails were time-stamped.) Tagg only reports total minutes of activity within 24 hours. That's moderately interesting to me, but of no real use. Most of her exercise is walking on leash with me and I have a pedometer app on watch.Another problem with both devices has been the size and shape of the home zone. My lot is about Àù acre, but the "home zone" covers much of the property on either side and also the street in front. She was escaping repeatedly until I found the problem with part of the fence. I didn't receive notifications because the home zone is much too large. This is made worse by the time it takes for a notification once she's outside the covered area.Whistle has a feature request area that has not been activated. I see that the public forums are beginning to get some actual customer questions and answers, so that's good. Before it was just cute photos of dogs.Whistle is the pet equivalent of a Nanny Cam, however. I had a house/pet sitter for a week and noticed that the person did not walk my dog the agreed upon one hour every day.To sum up, I'm happier with Whistle because of Tech Support, mapping improvements and superior battery life. I miss the 24-hour activity tracking.
