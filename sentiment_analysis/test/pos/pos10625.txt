This is a great phone for my husband who doesn't care for all the 'fancy' stuff. Second one he's had. Little 'fancier' than the first but still within his tolerance. Setting it up was a breeze through the Jitterbug website. He could keep his old # which was very convenient. He loves it, I love it. I'll stick with the 'fancy' stuff, thank you. Couldn't be an easier, better phone for most everyone. Takes pics, he can text, magnifies, and a few other slick features. And you can't beat the price! Very, very satisfied.
