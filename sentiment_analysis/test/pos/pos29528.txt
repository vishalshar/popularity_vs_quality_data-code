At the end of this review is youtube link that shows our cats reaction to being 'statically corrected'. We were skeptical about trying this fence out for our cat but really had no other choice. We have an 8-year Bengal (Taz) who is extremely territorial and aggressive toward other cats. We had been trying to make him an inside cat after some expensive vet bills. All was going well until I decided to start feeding a stray and make her our 'outside' cat. Our Bengal pretty much decided to start spraying everything in the house (and I mean everything) to channel his dislike at the situation. This was our only option before deciding to either take the outside cat to the shelter and/or possibly put our Bengal up for adoption. Part of our backyard has an existing chain link fence that we decided to string the wire onto so there would be an extra barrier and to minimize our effort in case it didn't work. Taz tested it a few times and would retreat to a patio chair and start scheming of ways to test it again. We didn't put the white boundary flags out at first but later did since Taz seem to recognize the boundary better. The collar would beep but it was so quiet, I don't think he associated it with the shock. Anyway, this fence worked by itself for about 30 minutes until Mitzi, our outside kitty strolled by in front of the fence. Taz immediately ran past the boundary, jumped up to the top of the fence, and took off after Mitzi. It basically slowed him down for about a millisecond but for him the shock was definitely worth the chase that ensued. So we ended up extending the height of our fencing by about 2-feet with black mesh wildlife netting to see how this would work. This was definitely the trick in combination with the invisible fence. He has tested it a few times since but he can't really see the netting until after he jumps and then realizes that he can't make it over all the while getting shocked (sorry "statically corrected"). Now when an uninvited guest strolls by he stands near the boundary screaming but that's it. I definitely think this product is useful for your average cat and is a good start for those 'special' kitties if the fencing can be supplemented with some other deterrent. [...]
