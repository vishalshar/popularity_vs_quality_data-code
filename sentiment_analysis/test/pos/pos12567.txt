This product was okay but I did not find it much better than using dry shampoo. I gave it higher ratings because of all the building fibers I have tried this one was by far the best.  I am a female with some thinning in my crown area.  I am also a blonde and finding products that actually match the blonde is very difficult, this one did.  But for the price I think dry shampoo would do just as good of a job.
