I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son who has an oversized wallet that holds his phone and everything. He would take out his phone and mislay his wallet ALL the time.WELL NO MORE! He loved it. I wasn't aware of the credit card type, but this worked out great. He said it was easy to setup and had no problems. He wants to purchase another one for his keys.I admit I did shop around for the better deal.
