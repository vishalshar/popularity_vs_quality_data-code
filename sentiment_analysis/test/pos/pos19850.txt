I got this to replace another Bluetooth speaker - I had a Braven BRV-1 that let me down: 1 day at the beach, a rinse off, and then it stopped working.  It's possible the unit was defective, so I was debating on another BRV-1 or perhaps the BRV-X but didn't like the (large) size of the BRV-X.  And then I came across this guy.  I have to say, this is an excellent little speaker - and it is little.  While it's a bit larger than the BRV-1 (the dimensions are different so that has some to do with it as well), it is definitely small.  Certainly smaller than the BRV-X.It sounds great for a small Bluetooth speaker; better than the BRV-1, and it doesn't have the directional problem that the BRV-1 does.  Like any small speaker it is certainly bass-challenged, but overall the quality of the sound is very pleasing, even at full volume.The fact that I can change the "jackets" is pretty cool - honestly though I'm not sure how often I would do that.  But it's cool to know that I can.The build quality is just top-notch.  Nothing feels cheaply made about it, the materials used do not look nor feel low-end.  All the buttons have a nice tactile feel to them.And the thing I love the most: it's full-on waterproof.  I'm looking forward to the opportunity to use this speaker out in the "wild!"  I've already completely submerged it in my sink to make sure it is indeed going to be okay near water, and it continued playing without a hitch.  So far I love it!My only are gripes are that to skip to the next song, I have to press the center button and the "+" (volume up) button at the same time (to go back a track, it's the center button and "-" (volume down) at the same time).  While I get the logic behind this decision, I would have preferred a single button that let me skip tracks, but that's just because I'm lazy I guess.  This really isn't that big of a deal.  Also, the speaker talks to you when you do stuff (like turn it on).  It's a bit of a novelty, my concern is that I don't think you can control the sound of this guy's voice via the volume buttons.  Meaning, when you turn the speaker on, the dude is going to be like "the speaker is on" at the same volume each time, regardless of where the actual play volume of the unit is set to.  So if you are trying to be quiet or something, just keep this in mind.  Also, not really that big of a deal.  Lastly, I don't think this unit has an auto-shutoff.  Even if it isn't playing anything, it will continue to stay on.  Maybe this isn't such a big deal, after all it will last around 40 hours at 50% volume, so maybe staying on for a couple hours with no sound coming out doesn't really use that much of the battery.  However, I still would have preferred it to shutoff after a while if it detected no sounds.  But no big deal.
