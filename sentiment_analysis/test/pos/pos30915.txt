This is a great little stove. Little as in light weight, but study for what it is intended. I won't cook my cub scouts meal on it, but it has worked great for myself. I do have to watch it, but in these dry seasons that is as it should be.It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but it fits in the pack anywhere then!
