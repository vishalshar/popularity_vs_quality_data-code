This is a super fun game for kids and family.  It's easy to learn and can be played by all ages (though I'd suggest age 9 and up, depending on reading skills).  My teenage kids and their friends love it, and they don't stop laughing the entire time!  We also took it our family Thanksgiving, and had 3 generations of players all having a great time around the table.  It's convenient and quick to set-up, can be stopped at any time (so you don't have to commit to playing for hours), doesn't have a bunch of little pieces to keep track of, and can be taken to friends' houses or on vacation easily due to its relatively small size.  I highly recommend this game - it became an instant classic at our house!
