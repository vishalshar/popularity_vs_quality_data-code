I needed a reusable soap dispenser, but wanted one that would be easy to clean. Lo and behold, this pump and an old mason jar did the trick. The stem of the pump is reallllly long, but was easy to cut to the right size. The pump dispenses just the right amount, about half of what a prefilled soap dispenser will pump (which is usually too much).
