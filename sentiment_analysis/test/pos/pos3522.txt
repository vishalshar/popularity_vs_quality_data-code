This is the second one we've bought. We were amazed how after four days the mushrooms seemed to appear over night and we loved watching it grow. We bought this one for our five year old niece because we knew she'd get a kick out of it, too. And when they are done growing, they tasted delicious in the pasta dish my wife cooked!
