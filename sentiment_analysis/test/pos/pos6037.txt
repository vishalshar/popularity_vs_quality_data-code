Exactly what I was looking for. I do a fair amount of traveling for work, and had been looking to upgrade my carry on. I was considering the Bluesmart and comparable hardshells from Tumi and Rimowa, and ended up with the Bluesmart, which was the clear winner in value with what seems to be comparable construction and design, plus additional tech functionality.Pros:1) Design: Thoughtfully designed, clearly optimized for the frequent business traveler. Love the accessible front compartment with lined pockets for my laptop and tablet and the internal dividers. Capacity-wise, just enough space to pack for 4-5 day business trip, though I travel light. Also looks pretty slick.2) Charging/Autolock: What distinguishes Bluesmart from other mid/high-end luggage. Have found the charging and locking to be particularly useful, and contrary to other reviews, have had no issues with the iOS app. Charging stations are a hot commodity during layovers at airports, and having the Bluesmart gives me optionality. GPS is also a nice to have, though hoping I wont have to use it.3) Customer Service: Prompt and thorough responses to my questionsTo be seen:1) Build Quality  Shell, wheels, and hardware have held up well so far, though the real test is how it performs over years, not months. The bag uses the same materials as Tumi, Rimowa, et al so would expect similar performance.Cons:1) Size  Would love to be able to use this as my sole piece of luggage for a longer personal trips, but the capacity is better suited for a weeklong trip or shorter2) Other Tech  Dont see myself ever using some of the other functionality, e.g. using the app to track my itineraries, or weighing the bag.This is a five star product to me, despite the cons. Why? I knew what I was getting  the specs are clear (34L capacity is not a multi-week bag), and I knew the tech Id use were the charging and locking. Overall, this has worked beautifully for me, and Id recommend it to any business traveler.
