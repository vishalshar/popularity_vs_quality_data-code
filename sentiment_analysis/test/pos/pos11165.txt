I had two issues that were solved by upgrading the software(get the link from Posh) I got a message saying the phone had been rooted and I couldn't get the bluetooth to recognize and pair with my headset, both solved with the upgrade. The phone is large which is why I wanted it, but fits onto my lap pillow tablet holder so I don't have to hold it much. I use a headset to make phone calls. Browsers seem fast enough.
