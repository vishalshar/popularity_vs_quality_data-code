I bought this item to link with my Amazon Echo through a WINK hub.  It is a good thing that it is named Quirky, because it is a bit Quirky.  Two of the plugs are capable of full electronic control from the hub, and they are independent of one another.  The other two plugs are more traditional plugs.  There is an off-on switch on the side of the device.The first thing you notice is that it is very bulky - much more so than a traditional outlet strip.  And the cordset is also very bulky.  The device snake-like configuration can be reshaped to some degree, but it almost seems pointless. I guess there might be some location that would benefit by the flexibility of the device, but the device is so large that I cannot imagine the flexibility having much if any real advantage.I really like my WINK hub, but I learned the hard way that although light bulbs can be controlled directly from the hub, and directly from the Echo, whenever there is a power outage, the bulbs come back full on.  This was a real pain.  I had purchased the Quirky to control some decorative bulbs and was pleased to learn that after a power outage, the Quirky device comes back to whatever state it was in when the power went out.  If the outlets were off, they come back off.  This is a HUGE advantage for me, as I live in Florida where power outages are common.Now for the problem..it is very difficult to link the hub to the Power Genius strip.  The manufacturer has rigged up a clever way to have your Android or I-phone do the work - you hold the phone against a sensor on the hub, and the phone will actually program the link to the hub.  Or at least it is supposed to.  I could not get mine to work, so I called support.  I got a lady who said she lived in New York.  She led me through the steps, and was incredibly patient.  Finally she discerned that the room where I was doing the programming may be too bright (it is sunny in Florida), and also she recommended that I tilt the phone slightly to avoid reflections influencing the programming.  She also suggested that I deactivate any APPS on my phone that I could so as to insure that the flashing light signal from the phone to the strip would work in the proper timing sequence.  And much to my surprise, her suggestions worked and viola!  The darn thing was programmed and has worked flawlessly ever since.She also recommended that I plug the WINK hub into the power strip, so that after a power outage, the devices would sequence back on in the correct order and prevent the need to reset anything.  Like many men, I hate to ask for directions.  I feel like somehow I have failed my gender if I can't figure it out myself, and usually the 'help' desks can not help.  This was the exception.  This young lady (at least she sounded young) was very patient and thorough and led me through the steps that solved the problem. Kudos to this company for actually having a HELP desk that helps - and as a bonus, she spoke good English and we could understand each other with no difficulties.
