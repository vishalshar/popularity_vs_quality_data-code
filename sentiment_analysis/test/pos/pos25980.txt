Picked this up for my 7 year old nephew for Christmas.  He got the hang of it pretty quick and seems to really enjoy it.  The propane bottles make this the best money you can spend for a scooter like this.  I read that the electric scooters only hold a charge for around 30 minutes of run time.  This scooter is said to go 40 miles on a $2.75 tank from Walmart.  We've never really clocked the hours or mileage that the scooter runs on a single tank, but we've never had to tell my nephew that he has to wait a few hours for it to recharge..
