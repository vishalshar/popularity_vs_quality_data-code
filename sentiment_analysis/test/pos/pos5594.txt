SO, I work for a production company and travel a lot.  I set large events including lights, sound and video for corporate events nationally.  needless to say our days sometimes go 20 hours straight.  While the work is tough, going form sweaty to dry to sweaty multiple times wreaks havoc on your....well.......between the cheeks.  We call it "gig butt".  You get chaffed and raw.  Not only do I use one if I have to use the restroom, but if we unload a truck and I get sweaty, before I dry out from slowing down, I head to the restroom and use one of these.  NO burning or anything, just cool and almost leaves you feeling like you just used powder once it dries.  I put one in my jeans pocket when I head out of my hotel room to the load in for the show and if need be, grab another in the afternoon.  I highly recommend these for any guys that do construction or any kind of job where you get sweaty and then dry out and and often get chaffed.  NOONE looks cool doing the "duck walk" because your ass is so chaffed it feel like sandpaper rubbing together.  These take care of it!!
