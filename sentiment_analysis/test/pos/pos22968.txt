Great game for the grandchildren.  Took a while to get the rules down (and some still are not perfectly clear).  Good news is it provides a fun, competitive environment for children while they sharpen their math skills - and can still be fun for adults.  My 4 year old is studying it closely.  He has the addition, subtraction figured out.  He is now grasping multiplication and division and showing promise.
