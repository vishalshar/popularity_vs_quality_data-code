I recently received this item and have been using it for less than a week now. The device does everything the company said it will do. I even find myself just wanting to do random exercises just so I can see the device count on its own. I go to the gym 5+ days a week to lift weights. I used to use Jaybird Reign before but it just was not cutting for what my work outs involved, I rarely do cardio, nor do I enjoy it so this device is perfect for the other Gym Rats out there. For questions I had about this device that some might find helpful is this device currently does not support a step tracker, sleep tracker or certain machine exercises such as leg press, cable machines and etc. The heart rate monitor is not a continuous heart rate tracker (you could turn it on for the whole day but you will not be able to go into any other options on the device). There are certain work outs it will not track if not done properly. A good example would be sit-ups, if your hands are not behind your head as shown in the video, it will not track it. The screen can be easily scratched. The band is a bit uncomfortable if wearing as intended (above the curve on your wrist). The device does not fall out of the band, I have showered with it numerous times and inside the screen does not fog up nor does it leave water marks inside the device. Interface for the app is not the best in the market. It does take up to 10-20 seconds for it to sync up completely with the phone. At the moment, there is no timeline data for previous work outs to present. Compared to other fitness wearables, it is a bit uncomfortable. The heart rate monitor is pretty on point depending on contact with skin. If your exercise only consists of running, I would recommend you use something else until the company incorporates exercises proprietary to cardio. Attached are pictures of proper wear of the device for best accurate reads from heart monitor, the marks the uncomfortable band leaves when worn in proper area for best read and scratches on the device after 3 days of use.Update 20160129: week 2 at the gym with this device now and sometimes it has difficulties tracking reps because of form. No big deal, I just adjust them on the watch itself to match my actual reps. Some of these reviews are coming from stupid impatient people, if they would have actually sat down and gone through everything, they would know you can track more than 15 workouts at once by creating your own workout from the phone and installing it on the device. I have work outs made for arm days, chest, legs, shoulders and back all with over 15 different workouts. If crossfit is your time, create your workout with a time based instead of rep based so it can still be fast paced. Don't just give bad reviews on device because you do not know how to function it. But I will drop to four stars because sometimes I noticed when I did alternate dumbbell curls, it would register it as barbell curls and triceps dips would register it as pull ups sometimes...I would recommend not to use freestyle too often.
