It worked as advertised. Fast, simple and easy.  The only thing I've noticed is that sometimes after the computer puts itself to sleep it will give me a message that it was improperly shut down and i have to reboot it.  I've never lost any open windows so it can take more time to reboot but isn't that big a deal considering how easy it was to double the available space on my computer and how fast it was to install and get up and running.The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is it is a more expensive way to add memory and the fact that the pricing is strange because the cost per gigabyte as the storage size increases not down like most storage solutions.
