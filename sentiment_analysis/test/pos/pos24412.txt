I expected it to hold up my iPhone 6 Plus which it does until I make a turn and it topples over. I found a way to make it work for me though, especially when using my navigation, I put it right on top of my dash sideways and although it still moves forward or backwards when accelerating and hitting the brakes it works most of the time. I might just end up using it as a stand for my phone when I'm on my laptop at home.
