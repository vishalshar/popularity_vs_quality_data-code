I was looking for a replacement for dogswell treat that didn't make my dog sick or give her a allergic reaction, made in the USA, and had quality ingredients.  Since there was no reviews I thought I would take a chance on this product after careful research I decided to take the plunge. I am really glad I did. They look and smell like real meat, the dogs love them and my only complaint is the price, however with prime I do not have to pay for shipping. I like that they have pork, beef, lamb, and chicken to choose from. Try them you will not regret it.
