It was real easy to use.  It doesn't stick up so high you are afraid of hitting something and breaking it, or in my case knocking it over.  You also don't need a special top and cork for it all to fit together.  One piece that you know is food safe.  Some of the corks that were used for the other contraptions, I wasn't so sure if they were food safe.  I like this, and have already recommend it to a friend.
