This bulb, nay, this experience, allowed me to transform the entire atmosphere of my own bedroom. With naught but my phone in hand, I can turn my room into a reflection of my own emotions... reading sad poetry alone? Paint the room an eerie blue. Hot date? Have your ilumi romantically fade through the color spectrum.All in all, great product. Easy to use, tons of flexibility of use, and limitless potential for ambiance.
