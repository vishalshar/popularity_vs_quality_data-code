This computer kit is awesome!  Binary code is the basis for all things now in our digital world.  Kids who can learn how to create webpages, games and apps will change the world!  It has parental controls which is great, I can limit their use of the internet and get them to play the KANO games first, as they age you can change the settings as their responsibility grows.
