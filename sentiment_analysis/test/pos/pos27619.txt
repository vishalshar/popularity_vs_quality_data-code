The main reason I bought this product was because it is used with my phone. I am the type of mom that likes to keep records of my daughter's temperature and symptoms when she is ill, and the app that accompanies this thermometer does that for me. I bought this thermometer within the last month, and I've already had occasion to use it. I do feel like it accurately measured her temperature. Also, the set up of this thermometer was simple. It's as easy as downloading the app and connecting the device to your phone or iPad.
