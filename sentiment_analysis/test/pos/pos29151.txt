I was using another very popular best selling brand until I  learned they had about 1,000-2000% DV of of a few vitamins. I was concerned so I started researching other brands and chose these. I liked that they were made of whole foods and non-gmo (a must for me).  My kids love them  and I feel better knowing they have the correct amounts of vitamins and less sugar. Is a bonus.  They are lacking vitamin D , but i give my kids a seperate vitaminD tab daily already  so it worked for us.  Will definitely be reordering.
