Made these waffles with my pre-k class. The only pit fall was you had to make one at a time which prompted us to make them a head of time and just do a demonstration. The kids loved putting Olaf together and creating different poses before gobbling them down. Yes, I would recommend this product. It was fun and made great waffles.
