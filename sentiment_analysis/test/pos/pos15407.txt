Bought a bottle of this product through Amazon after looking at reviews of other products. My son wanted to keep the broken-in pair of gloves he had during spring training, but sticky was completely gone.He started practice three weeks ago and uses this every two days. He is our running back, so he touches ball almost every play. So far he really likes this, has shared with teammates, and looking to get another bottle in a couple weeks.Hoping this gets him through the season without having to buy new gloves.....
