A mouse that definitely proves that quality, and proper engineering can make or break a product. The buttons are a dream to click, and work regardless of where you press, the sensitivity is perfect too (no more missing double-clicks, or accidentally doing them). The two side buttons are placed in a good spot, easy for my thumb to find and press either of them with perfect accuracy. Only complaints i have are minor ones, that really only detract from the user experience, rather than the overall high quality of the product. The scroll button is smooth, but to me feels a little mushy as I roll it. I'm used to Logitec mouses, that are known for having beautiful, really crisp ratcheting scrolling, or ice-smooth glide free-wheeling. However, the scrollwheel, like everything else on the mouse, works perfectly, just the small user-end issue of the feel of it. Second complaint, and a prominent one for why I detracted a star, is the thumb grip on the left side. it's rubbery, feels nice on the touch, but it makes my thumb sweat a fair bit, and gets quite slick from oils, and sweat. Also, the finish on the mouse is matte, so shows off your fingerprints and hand-oils rather annoyingly. It's a regular thing for me to clean it with alcohol wipes. The rest of the mouse is perfect; great, smooth texture, that doesn't make my palm sweat or stick. Love the extra long reinforced braided cord on this thing, and the weight and feel of the mouse is very balanced. It's a lighter weight mouse, but doesn't feel like a flimsy piece of cheap plastic. Another small downside is you -must- have a mouse pad for the optics to track properly, they will sort of work on solid, dark surfaces, but very erratic, skittish, and inaccurate.All in all, this is a very solid mouse, that has great performance, top-notch ergonomics, and looks and feels great too. But with the downsides I listed in mind, for $70, this is a little pricey. If you can get this little guy around the $40-$50 range, go for it, but otherwise you might want to consider waiting for a 2nd iteration of the Mionix Castor, or pay a little more for a Razor, or a little less for a Logitech.
