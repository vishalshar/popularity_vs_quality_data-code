Let me just say... VERY FUN! Lots of zip and power for a small scooter! I had a small glitch when I first got it, but this companies Customer Service is so good that the owner personally called me and walked me through how to solve the small problem. I recommend this product to anyone who is a gadget person like myself, or is looking for an alternative commuter vehicle. Enjoy!
