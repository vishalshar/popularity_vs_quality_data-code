I hadn't heard of this product until I saw it on Amazon. It really works! I have little kids who constantly knock over my coffee. I haven't had a single spill since I switched to the might mug.I would have given it 5 stars, but sow times the lid leaks a bit. It doesn't always seal on my first try twisting it on. I've never had that problem with other mugs. And it doesn't keep my coffee as hot as my Starbucks mugs. But as far as no more cups of coffee being dumped in my lap by my kids, it's awesome!
