I have really enjoyed flying this drone! I have a helicopter that I fly once in a while, but the x star is much more stable and easier to fly. The pictures are extremely sharp and clear.  Recently the drone crashed because the screws came loose on my propeller guards. The company honored  the warranty and offered to repair the drone. The customer service has been excellent. They respond quickly to emails and my calls.
