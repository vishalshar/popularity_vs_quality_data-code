This is a great case. I am able to use the entire screen with no problem, and the case provides excellent protection when dropped. I had an Otterbox prior to this, but the case interfered with using the edge of the screen for dragging icons. I have no problems using the buttons to adjust volum, or for powering on and off. I am planning on Rokform protecting my future IPhones.
