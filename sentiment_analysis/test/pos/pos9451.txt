Very happy with this keyboard. Cherry MX Black switches have no tactile bump, but can still bottom out and make a clacking sound. This was resolved using some rubber O-rings to dampen the sound. I couldn't be any happier and this keyboard works well if you like simple and yet a solid build. Rated 4 Stars because it isn't USB 3.0.
