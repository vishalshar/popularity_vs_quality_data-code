Very well made.  I have a Toy Australian Shepherd and she loves to play fetch.  I literally just got this thing 10 minutes ago in the mail, and she's already chasing the balls.  She's wary of the sound of the machine,  but still runs and catches the balls.  And hoards them.  And doesn't bring them back.  There will be some training to do.  Balls are good for toy breeds,  any bigger and I would ONLY recommend the full size version. The balls for this smaller one are like golf ball size or under.  They're small.  THEY'RE SMALL. Now that everyone knows that,  enjoy the product,  it's only worth say $30 in technology and resale, but I'm glad I bought it.
