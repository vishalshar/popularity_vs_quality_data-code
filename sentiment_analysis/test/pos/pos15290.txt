Worked great for what we needed it for. Our new puppy was so small he couldn't go up and down the deck stairs to go in the grass. It also happened to be record snow fall that year therefore the pet loo worked great. As the warmer weather approached and he got bigger, there was no need for the pet loo anymore. And thank goodness for that. We washed it daily and the smell still lingered. I know they sell stuff to put in the tray to help the odor but it was the fake grass that began to stink. Like i said, we washed the entire pet loo daily and let it dry well before putting it back together for use and it still smelled.We still have the pet loo in outside stoarge as it might come in handy if our dog should ever need it again (older age, illness, etc)I would recommend buying additional 'turf' to be able to switch it out while the other is being cleaned and sanitized.We also used newspaper to line the removable tray to help with the urine removal.I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it did exactly what we needed it to do. But had to take a star away for the smell that became increasingly more and more difficult to get rid of. We only used it for approx. 4 months.
