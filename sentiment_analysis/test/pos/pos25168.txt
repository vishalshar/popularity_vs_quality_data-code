after living with the starry station for a couple of months i really cant say enough good about it.this wifi access point is unlike any other ive ever been around.  its so much more intuitive and easy to use than anything else.  the initial setup was actually fun, and helped me pick a very unusual network name.  i know that seems silly, but our network name is "unruly llama."  i mean come on... thats just cool.i really like the ability at any time to walk up to it and check the "health" of the overall network.  at a glance i can see if there are any issues with devices.  i can easily check my network speed from the device, no need to go to a website on a phone or laptop to do a download test.i have had absolutely ZERO issues with this thing.  no reboots needed, no errors, no nothing.  it has been rock solid.  i cant say that for anything else ive ever used.its expensive compared to other access points out there, but to me the features are well worth it.  im very happy with this product.
