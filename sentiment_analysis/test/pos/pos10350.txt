While pretty much every wearable on the market is either only counting steps or giving (mostly inaccurate) heart rate measurements, the Spire instead is focused on helping you be aware of your state of mind by measuring your breath rate. It also counts steps, but what makes it really different is the breath tracking. Based on your breath patterns, it determines if you are "calm", "focused", or "tense" (compared to your baseline) at any given part of the day. The app even syncs with your calendar and location, so you can connect the dots of how the segments of your daily life affect your state of mind. The notifications are very customizable, so if you have certain stress-related goals in mind you can focus (no pun intended) on them. It's a pretty amazing experience to get a vibration indicating that I'm getting stressed out before I even realize it. It reminds me to breath deeply and more slowly, which helps me calm down before going into a stress spiral. It may sound a bit counter intuitive that being notified about your stress would help you calm down, but it really does help to have that little reminder to breathe.
