I am an engineer that does work with Electrical control panels and mechanical equipment.  I was looking for a way to have have thermal imaging capabilities to examine equipment at job sites in the event that my customers were experiencing issues.  I purchased this after looking around at various units and decided to give it a try.  I used it ever so briefly this past week to see how it worked and it appears it worked wonderfully.  The comment from a previous review about lack of focus close up was not my experience and so far am glad I tried this unit.  I am able to focus within at least a foot or two of the object.  (please see photo of control panel interior).I cant comment how this compares with the more expensive fluke or flir units.  I do not have a basis of comparison.  I will say I was impressed with what I have seen already.  For someone who needs to be able to do this type of quick analysis, this product appears to be more than capable.  I am eager to find a problem panel or mechanical unit to see how well I am able to pinpoint a problem with it.  I like that I can keep it in its nice case in the console of my car.  If I show up at a site I have it ready to go and it was not a bank breaker by any stretch of the imagination for this type of equipment.I played with it around the house.  It is a fun novelty to see where all the cold breezes are coming from but I would not have a need/desire to purchase one if it were not a helpful tool in my industry.  Note that you can take pictures with the data points shown (other sites have stated you can not) which is helpful for reporting purposes.  I will update this as I get more time with the unit.  It is really tiny and seems to be well built.  It does have manual focus ring that does work.
