Such a life saver! Our vet wanted urine sample from Bubba. Bubba was having none of it. So the vet gave us a half a cup these plastic chips and told us to clean the litter box really well then put this handful of black plastic chips at the bottom of the litter box to collet the urine. Again, Bubba wasn't having any part of it. So I gave him back his litter, and I searched online and found this product in order two bags just in case.
