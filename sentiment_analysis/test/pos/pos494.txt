Arrived well packaged. After reading several of the reviews about how 'fragile' the attachment of the Wi-Fi portion could be, I was careful removing the covers and activation strip, and when I inserted the battery into the detector.  The set-up using my phone was straight forward with the chirping connection (reminded me a bit of an old modem).  It connected to my Wi-Fi no problem and has not lost connection.I have a single roost battery in a hardwired, interconnected smoke detector system.  The battery is in the detector that is closest to my Wi-Fi router so it gets a good signal.  I tested the smoke detector that is 'farthest' away from the Roost battery, and since my detectors are interconnected, all of them sounded the alarm.  Within 10-15 seconds, I had a notice on my phone that the alarm had been triggered.Since this battery is the backup power in the detector, I am hopeful that the battery lasts a decent length of time.  The package states that the battery portion is replaceable but I can not seem to find where to buy only the battery.My wife is set up as a monitor too which involved downloading the app and sending/accepting invitations.  It would be nice if the app allowed multiple alert numbers and/or emails without invitations.  I travel out of the country and being able to be alerted by other messenger services would be great because my US phone number is not in service when I am out of the country.
