Finally someone released the desk clock I've been waiting for. For years I've searched around for a smart home style clock that would not only keep time, but allow me to customize what time zones I want to see, run timers, add apps, etc. In my opinion, LaMetic really hit this one on the head.Now full disclosure I already have a lot of WiFi connected devices in my home such as Philips Hue lights and the Netatmo weather station. Having these kinds of products will greatly increase your enjoyment of this device as it increases the versatility of things you can do.I think the best way to describe how useful this gadget is, is to describe how I'm currently using it. So, as of right now I have the local time displayed for about 30 seconds. I also have a little animated Christmas tree (this the season) that displays on the left hand side of the time. After about 30 seconds the time sweeps away to reveal the date and day of the week. After that data from my Netatmo station is displayed, the order is indoor temp, indoor CO2 levels, indoor sound level in DB, outdoor temp, and outdoor humidity. Next it sweeps away to reveal news headlines, and finally, a countdown to Christmas.Now for the really cool part - I have the LaMetric synced to multiple Twitter accounts such as CNN Breaking News, local area news, NWS weather alerts and a few others. These are set up not to constantly display, but to play a little alert sound, and scroll across the screen as they are posted. I can't emphasize how cool this is to me. I can be sitting there watching TV, hear a bunch of sirens out the window, and moments later see the news scrolling across the LaMetric from my local Twitter news feed. It is very cool.On top of all this, nearly all facets of these settings are customizable, so you can adjust how long you want things to be seen, how loud the alert tone is and what kind of tone to play, etc. LaMetric did a very good job with designing these tools and it really shows. I've also noticed LaMetric releases a lot of firmware updates (sometimes 2 per week), so they are very active with addressing user needs and bugs. Impressive.Aesthetically this thing looks great. The LED's are soft and not too harsh so it can be displayed next to a TV or computer monitor and not be too distracting. The sounds and volume for alerts are fully customizable and can be muted if you don't want the audible alert. The little icons on the left hand side really add a fun touch to the information it displays. I can't comment on the Bluetooth speakers as I use this in a room with a HiFi stereo so have no need for them. Overall product build is solid and feels nice with the exterior coated in a soft-touch rubber/plastic.Over all I am really happy with this thing. Sure it's a bit pricey, but after a few weeks with it that sting goes away and you're left with a really cool gadget.My only recommendation is for LaMetric to implement a way to mute the alert sounds during different times of the day, such as 'mute alerts from 11PM - 8AM. I like the alerts when I'm up, but not so much when I'm trying to sleep.Other than that, home run LaMetric. Awesome product.
