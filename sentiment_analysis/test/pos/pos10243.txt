It's very simple to use--once you get it going. I had to charge it first. Battery must have been dead. Then the app wouldn't work. It kept going in a loop. I powered down my phone and tried  again. It works great. Simple procedure. Simple results. No need to press. Just put thumbs in place. Nifty little gadget.
