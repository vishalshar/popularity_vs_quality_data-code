I have been searching for the perfect bike mount for years. THIS is by far the best, close-to-perfect solution I have come across.I have 100% faith that my phone won't dismount and fly off my bike when secured with the Quad Lock. The case itself has a nice high-quality texture and feel to it. It was easy to install and I'm impressed that they included both rubber band and zip tie options (I'm an NYC biker, and anything to make my bike accessories more theft-proof are appreciated).It makes using Google Maps during biking an absolute breeze. It also perfectly positions your phone to be used with corded headphones if that's your thing (safety first!).Customer Service is great. One of my bands was broken, and they mailed a packet with new bands and zip ties at no charge whatsoever.Sure, it's more expensive than other options, but well worth the premium.
