It is very good & better then the Uno version.  I carry the duo in my backpack purse so I don't have to use disposable utensils. I bring a cotton napkin, Gocup & a Preserve plate in apple green color.  Whenever there is a potluch meal, I chose to bring my own thing so I don't use disposables which adds much to the landfills.
