After having a cheaper mount snap on me going over a curb, I resolved to throw down some real cash on a proper mounting system. Holy hell, was this the one I was looking for.Putting the connector on my Galaxy Note 4 was a cinch, being nice and streamlined to make slipping it in and out of my pocket smooth and easy. The adhesive is no joke either, I don't see this thing coming off without some serious elbow grease anytime soon. Attaching the base to my bike was very simple, using the included loops to clip the thing on. If you're doing any rough riding with your bicycle, I would suggest following Annex's advice and using some zip ties to attach the thing, as it can slip down with the loops, though not in a dangerous fashion. Mounting the phone is very simple, requiring a simple 1/8th turn, confirmed with an audible click. Pulling the release down and doing it in reverse gets the phone unmounted, which is just as easy.You're probably asking yourself how well it holds onto the base. This thing simply DOES NOT MOVE UNLESS YOU WANT IT TO. I have brought it through nasty cobblestone roads, wooded trails, and more than a few drops. The phone stayed attached.
