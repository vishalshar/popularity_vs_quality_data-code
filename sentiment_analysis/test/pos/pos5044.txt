I try to stick to vegan, cruelty free options when it comes to hair care so I thought I'd try this. The bottle is so fun and cute. My sister is 10 and she loved it! It smells rashly good too. My husband smells my hair all of the tI'm now!  I don't use much, only 4 to 5 pump mists for hair past shoulder length and this bottle lasted me about a month and a half. I really like that it is a leave in conditioner and detangler all in one. Good for kids as well. It really makes your hair soft.
