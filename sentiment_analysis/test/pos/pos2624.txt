The device tap and rotate interactions are what you'd expect from a XXI century device. The app still needs polishingfor example, in the way it shows values while the sensors are still being primedbut it's still quite usable. Support service has been great.Update: I kept finding bugs and interaction design issues. I decided to return it, will check again the product in the future when the software is more reliable.
