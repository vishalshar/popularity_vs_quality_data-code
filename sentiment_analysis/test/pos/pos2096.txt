I now have two Lutron Hubs and 8 light sets controlled.  One hub is in the house and the other is in a separated garage about 130 feet from the first hub.  The first hub was easy to get set up.  I have an older Apple Airport Extreme wifi hub that I plugged it into and I could immediately see it and connect to it from my iphone 6s.  I had several switches installed and working in about an hour!  The second Lutron hub goes through a D-net switch that is also connected to a low-cost NetGear wifi access point for travelers.  So there is some routing that has to take place.  I could not see the Lutron hub from my phone with this setup.  The app timed out and would offer an expert page where the IP address of the Lutron hub could be entered.  Having had this issue with other non-Lutron connected things I recognized it.  I knew I would need the IP address.  I then logged into my DSL modem's (Zyxel) web interface page and checked on the connected devices list.  The list shows the IP address and the MAC address for each device on the network.  After dealing with a bad network wire and reconnecting it I found it in the list by looking for the Lutron's MAC address which is printed on the label on the bottom of the device.  I could then use the IP address from the list and enter it on the expert page in the app that comes up when the app can't find the hub.  The app then connected to the hub and I've had no issues since.  Some companies are able to make their search apps look across network switches and this one should too, thus the four stars.  Other things to note.  Siri doesn't seem to recognize most of my lights by name such as Dining Room.  I think this is a Siri home kit issue on Apple's side however.  And Siri doesn't seem to be able to deal with useful commands like "list my lights" so you can find out if Siri even knows about them.  My wife has the Lutron app on her phone and the two apps work great at controlling the lights.  The system works really well both at home and away over the internet.  I have switches on different floors and have had no issues with fast control of the lights (no interference from walls and floors).  Lutron has a white paper on what their system goals are which is worth reading if you like to know that sort of thing.  The Pico remotes also work great.  Be sure and follow the directions to pair the Pico with the hub and not the switch.  And lastly another reviewer mentioned the lights would come on after a power outage.  Mine stay in the state that they are in (if off they are off when the power returns) so I have not experienced this - it would be a very serious problem for me if they did.
