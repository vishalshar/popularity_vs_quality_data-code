I have used the Coravin system for about three months now and have gone through three capsules. This system works as advertised and I'm totally pleased with the results. The three used capsules works out to about a bottle a week where each glass from a bottle is as good as the first one. Since my wife and I don't typically drink a bottle in a twenty four hour period, before Coravin we would end up with a lot of undrinkable, oxidized wine. I have tried other wine preservation methods including the vacuum products (don't work at all in my opinion), the gas back-fill products that are meant to be used after the cork has been pulled (extend the life for a day, maybe two) and the refrigerator (better than vacuum systems and not as good as the previously mentioned gas method). With Coravin, we are drinking better wine, more frequently, and it is costing us less. We are also less concerned about trying out a more expensive wine since we know we will be able to drink all of it and can spread the time out over days or even weeks. The system costs $300 and the cartridges about $10 each, lasting for 3-4 bottles - or about $1 per glass. If you drink a $30 bottle of wine twice a month and leave half behind, as we often did, that's almost $400 of lost wine every year. In this example you recover the cost of the system in less than a year and enjoy better wine all the time. Of course, if you are drinking wines in the under $10 category, only buy a bottle once or twice a year or you usually finish a bottle the same day you open it, then this product is not really for you.
