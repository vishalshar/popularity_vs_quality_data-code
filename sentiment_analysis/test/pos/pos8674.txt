My indoor/outdoor cat disappeared earlier this month. My son and I were very distraught, spendnig those days passing out missing cat fliers, searching the roads, posting signs at intersections, putting ads in the paper, searching yards within a half mile radius, and all the other things you do when your beloved family member is missing. He showed up in our front yard five days later, limping and bleeding. Turns out he had had a nasty fight with a feral cat, sustained some injuries, and went into hiding until he felt safe enough to return home. Not knowing where our cat was during those long days was very distressing, and I vowed we would never go through that again. That's what lead me to purchasing the Whistle GPS tracker.Pros:Accurate tracking: I tested it last night; my cat was at the exact address the tracker reported...one street over, lounging under a car in a neighbor's drivewayHuge tracking range: Some trackers only work within a certain radius. This one will work anywhere it can pick up the Verizon cell network (you do not need Verizon service on your phone for this to work)Light weight: Even though it's a bit bulky, it's not very heavy. My cat isn't bothered in the least by wearing this deviceBattery life: Lasts about a week before needing chargedCustomer support: Helpful and knowledgeablePhone app: The phone app is pretty cool, and shows your pet's exact location on the map.Price: Compared to other trackers I researched, this is very affordable (I did purchase directly from the Whistle site which was offering $20 off, bringing the price down to $59.95). The service plan isn't bad either; I paid upfront for a year of service, which equals $7.95 per month. The total cost of the tracker and service plan is less than what I spent in full color missing cat fliers, poster supplies, and a newspaper ad.Cons:Bulky. I would give this a 5 if it weren't for the bulkiness. The company states this product is for dogs and cats, but unless your cat is on the large side, you may want to try another tracker. My cat is a big boy at 15 lbs, so it works for him.All in all, I would definitely recommend this. I love having the peace of mind that I will always be able to locate my cat.
