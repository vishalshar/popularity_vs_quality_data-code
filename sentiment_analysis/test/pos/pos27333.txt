Didn't expect this robot to be so much fun but he does a lot. I think the app you can download is what really makes it fun and user friendly.....my 8 year old loves it and his little brother wants it for his birthday now too.  I would definitely recommend buying rechargeable batteries and then there is no issue with having to keep buying them.  Pretty neat toy!
