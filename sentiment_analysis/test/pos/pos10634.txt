Works as advertised but this bottle only contains 3 grams if I'm not mistaken.I'd get this size as a first time buyer to color match and make sure it will work with your particular hair issue.From there get a larger bottle.I have frontal thinning and have a weird part on the back of my head from consecutive horrible haircuts.This product did significantly reduce the thin look up front and for practice, I put a bunch on the wierd part on back of head. Part not really noticable now.I don't have really bad thinning or hair loss so I can't vouch for effectiveness on severe problem areas.  For the price, give it a try, not much to loose.I must say, I recommended a proper anti-thinning/loss/DHT  shampoo and minoxidal as a daily base treatment. So far I've had great results with that and I will use this product to touch up my hair in the morning aftet using other products to combat thinning.This product only hides the problem but does a a good job at that and is not noticeable unless someone is up close  looking for it.I'd give it more stars if they weren't so chincy with the amount in the bottle.
