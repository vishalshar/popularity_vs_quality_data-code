My husband bought these for me because I get sea sick when we go sailing sometimes.  I've used Dramamine (hate it - makes me sleepy, only halfway works) and other OTC drugs you can only buy from Bermuda (which do work but have a side effect that it "may cause temporary blindness", yikes!).  I had these with me on one of our sailing trips and it worked great!  The seas were only partly rough so I can't testify for a full blown storm-like rocking situation but I felt queasy, ate one of these and felt a whole lot better!  And they were really tasty too!  I had a couple extra which I've had to chase my kids away from because they like to eat them too but they're "mommy's medicine bars".  I didn't know about these when I was pregnant but I could imagine they'd be great for morning sickness too.
