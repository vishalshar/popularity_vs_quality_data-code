This is actually a great little scanner once you learn how to set it up and use it. Of course, like a typical guy, I didn't read the booklet that came with it, thinking I could figure it out myself. I tried scanning with it and it was a disaster. I had a stormtrooper toothbrush holder that I bought and wanted to scan, but no matter what I did the scanner just sat there trying for a couple hours and not really do anything but place some random dots on the screen.So I contacted Matter and Form Tech Support and Travis H. was not only quick to respond to me; he also set up a training session that same morning. He walked through the set up with me and explained how to properly position a model so that the camera can accurately pre-scan light and dark colors the way that it should. It made all the difference.After our session the scanner worked like like a different machine. I won't blame the company for my initial issues when I didn't bother to read the instructions. That's all on me, and their quick response to my request for help earned them a five-star review. Highly recommended.The screen grabs below are just raw scans, before the meshing engine smoothed and healed the surfaces.
