Expensive and cozy. Only real downside is that it's very slippery (can't drape over you without sliding around) but this is also a pro as it means that dirt and sticks don't get caught on it making it nice for camping. It will slide around if you're trying to use it on a bed. I also have the Rumpl Superfleece which I love. If buying for indoor use, get the superfleece, for outdoor, get this one.
