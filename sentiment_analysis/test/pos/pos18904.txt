I saw these and thought they looked interesting, but then decided against buying them because of the price. Well, then we started our baby (our 4th) on solid foods and the plastic coated Gerber spoon and our other plastic baby spoons were really hard for her to get the food off, and her face would be a giant mess afterwards. That is when I asked my wife to buy these.My wife tried these spoons when they first showed up and said it was great. So I used one the next day while feeding our daughter and was really impressed at how easy it was for her to get the food off and to stay clean. A little mess on her chin and that was it. No longer getting food all over her cheeks and practically in her ear. After that experience, I would say that these are worth the price. They seem very durable, so they should last through multiple kids (if you are going to have more). $16 for 2 spoons that work really well and could last through all your kids? Not actually so expensive when you look at it that way.
