Up until the last minute I debated between this and the Flashforge Creator Pro (which also seems like a great deal), but I didn't want to bite off too much on my first 3D printer, as I only recently had started teaching myself Autodesk Fusion 360.I couldn't be happier with my choice! Almost a year later I question any switch or even upgrade, because it does everything I need it to do. I print mostly Nylon, and it has no problems. Any jams I experienced were caused by me, and easy to remedy anyway. I was sold by the auto- bed leveling feature, and it has been rock solid.BTW- I don't use this to download Christmas ornaments someone else has designed. I create prototypes for my company which I have seen successfully go into manufacturing now many times. No $4k printer, no $6k software.The only upgrade I made was investing in the Simplify3D slicer software, which really is smart & easy. That being said, the free version of Matter Control software included gets the job done too. I just liked the flexibility of extra control once I gained experience.Anyway, the Robo3D R1 Plus has changed everything for me. Had I made the wrong purchase, I may have bailed on 3D printing & CAD design altogether. Thankfully I've never looked back.
