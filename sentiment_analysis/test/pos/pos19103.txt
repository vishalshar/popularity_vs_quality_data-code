After reading all the reviews for this projector I decided to go ahead and try it myself. It was a great decision, this little projector is great. Everything you need comes in the box. All you have to do is charge it and choose your input source and you have a instant theater. Some reviewers complained about the quality and brightness. Full hd projectors with high lumen output can cost thousands of dollars so if that's what you want be ready to pay for it. You can not beat the portability and quality of this cube for the price you pay. As far as the sound it is not great and it shouldn't be for the size, but it can get you by. Just plug in your own speakers and have fun. Great investment.
