I am very pleased with my case so far! The elastic band is very nice and well made! I wish that the actual case part had a bigger lip on it to protect the screen more. I haven't had any issues with it yet. I love how unique the case is and the fact that I don't have to carry my wallet everywhere I go! This case is great for college students who need to carry their I.D. with them.
