EZ.  Unlike the skydrop which I got for Father's Day and hassled with for three nights and afternoons (when their tech support blamed me for their useless wifi) I was done with them.  Blossom.  Pure simplicity!  A half hour to install.  20 minutes to program.  Done.  My yard is watering as I write.  One of the genius ideas blossom uses is to bypass wifi, a wall network device solves all the stupid problems those other guys had me fuss with.  Dude, this is the way to go.
