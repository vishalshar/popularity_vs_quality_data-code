Really, I do feel like Michael Winslow when I wear the Moff Band.It adds the sound effects to your life that you've always wanted. From the swords, to the punches, to the sports, to the music.... it's a blast and a half. When I first put it on, I started thumping on the drums the beat to "Hang On Sloopy", and the USA Guitar feature makes me feel like Jimi strumming the anthem in front of fifty thousand.I like how it adds the sounds and stimulates the imagination. It's like a Wii, but you're not confined to a screen.More than likely going to get one for my 4 year old nephew....
