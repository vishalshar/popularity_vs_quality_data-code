Got some Hatchbox Glow in the Dark PLA.Unless you want to destroy your brass nozzle you NEED to get a played nozzle and no one does it better than Micro Swiss.The only reason you would have to not get this nozzle is because you're considering getting the all metal nozzle instead.But that depends on your budget. For $15 this is a cheap upgrade where you really can't go wrong with.I personally put this on my Monoprice Maker Select v2.1 3d printer. (In 0.04mm size.)
