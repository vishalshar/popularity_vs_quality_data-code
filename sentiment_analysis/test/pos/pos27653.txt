My husband and I love wine, but we live in the real world with kids and responsibilities.  We cannot finish an entire bottle on a weekday with just the two of us. The products we have tried that are supposed to remove air from an uncorked bottle... yeah, they don't.  On a recent trip to Napa, we found several wineries using the Coravin during tastings.  They had great things to say about it.  The reviews online suggested it works well.  Figuring that over time the cost of the device would be made up in savings of wine we don't have to dump, we decided to get it.  It is fantastic.  If you're buying $10 wine from a grocery store, this is not a product you want.  The cost of argon capsules will overtake any benefit.  If you're buying higher quality wine and sometimes just want a glass or a taste, this is definitely worth it.  We are enjoying our Napa purchases in a whole different way - during the week sometimes instead of just our "Saturday Wine Night".
