This antenna has worked very well so far for an indoor model. Where you position it will greatly affect what stations you receive. If you're not seeing a station that know you should be getting within your broadcast range, then move the antenna around slightly. That happened to me...i moved it and then it came in. These are *that* sensitive to positioning. In other words, the less walls or obstructions between the antenna and the broadcast signal, the better...and getting it up higher will make a difference as well. If you don't have mountains and hilly terrain in between you and the broadcast tower, you'll get more channels. I feel this is well worth the money. To "fine tune" your alignment, check the internet for what stations you should be receiving where you live. Then when you auto program your TV to find stations and you review what you can watch, you'll know if you need to move the antenna to get stations you might be missing.
