I am holding out for a vintage receiver, but until then I needed something to replace my crappy Bluetooth speaker. This stereo system is compact and doesn't have a lot of features but it works great. There's a reasonable amount of bass and Bluetooth works great. Very easy to setup. Perfect for listening to music while I clean the house.
