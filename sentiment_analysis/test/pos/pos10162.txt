I ordered this hot sauce on a whim and have to say...it is really an excellent product. It has some Southeast Asian flavors, which I've found to be a great addition my curry recipes. It is also delicious stand-alone sauce and tasted great with the omelette I made this morning.I was initially apprehensive about the heat level, as there is habenero listed in the ingredients. However, the spice level balanced well with the sweet ingredients.I'm very satisfied with the quality of this sauce. Wuju definitely has a new customer! I'm looking forward to incorporating Wuju into my future meals.
