The controller was easy to set up There was a small snag during install but their customer service is top notch and was immediately available for a quick fix.  The app allowed me to go out in the yard, with my cell phone, and test each zone.  This has been a pain when starting up the system for the season and now it will be much easier.  I sent an email asking about watering reports and it is an enhancement that is on the way and they got back to me within hours. In my experience a company that pays that much attention to customer service is one that also makes some of the best products.
