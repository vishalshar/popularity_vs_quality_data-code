I don't understand why this is so cheap? These things rock and in the world of home automation, are at giveaway prices.I run Wink in our barn and Smartthings in the house. I use these strip plugs to run xmas  lights, a model train set, and security floodlights over Wink. For $18 (latest price), you get TWO controllable outlets and a couple of dumb outlets. You just cant beat that price as most automated SINGLE switches stat at $25 and REQUIRE a Wink or Smartthings hub. This strip requires no hub as Wifi is built into the strip plug - it connects to your home wifi. That's right - all you need is this strip plug, the free Wink app (or IFTTT) and your'e in business and controlling two devices from anywhere in the world for $18 - what's not to love? Example: Hook this strip up to a fan and use IFTTT to monitor your home towns weather temp, if the temp hits 70 degrees IFTTT turns on the fan - our chickens love this idea - possibilities are endless.Grab 'em while you can. They wont last forever.
