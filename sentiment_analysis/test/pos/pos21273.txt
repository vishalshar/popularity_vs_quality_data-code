Don't let the other reviews fool you.  This is the best biometric gun safe I have found on the market. For the fingerprint scanner, you don't hold down the sensor like another reviewer posted. You push it down once to activate it and leave your finger resting on the sensor.  It opens for me every time. It helps to program both fingers at multiple angles, that way you have a higher success rate of it opening.  The blue light flashing can be annoying if you place the safe below your bed next to you at night.  Just put something over it. It's not perfect but it's very close.
