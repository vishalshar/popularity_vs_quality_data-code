We bought the Robosapien for our son for Christmas, he wanted a robot that ran and danced, and this fit the bill and seemed sturdy enough for a 3.5 year old. Christmas morning he was a hit! Our son loved Robosapien, he found the remote easy to use, but had enough functions to make it interesting and interactive. My son loves his features and funny quirks (he signs, makes yawning sounds, etc.) This is a great product. The only complaint we have is the dongle to turn your phone into a remote did not work when it arrived, we contacted the company, and they sent us a replacement. When we received the replacement, that too did not work on our old iPone (play phone), however, it did work with my husband's newer iPhone. The only problem is that it connects into the phone jack, and this made the phone need to be upside-down to be used with the dongle, and then the interface did not switch to upside-down. So we have not found the dongle useful, which seems like would be easier for a 3.5 year old to use than the large remote.
