Cool unique case. Case is smooth. Seems cheap but is doing the job so far. Dropped my phone a few times already and no issues. Magnet feature is nice to have. Phone will spin on its back, but is secure and won't move on the face. Will slide easily if leaned on any of the sides.There is another similar style case with what seems like a better build and quality out there but unfortunately comes with a rediculous price. I also put my phone in my pocket, but I don't wear skinny jeans or put pressure on it. I wear scrubs a lot. If your gonna be doing anything to put any type of stress on your phone then I would recommend taking it out of your pocket, case or no case.
