This is my first adventure into the drones.  I have not even purchase a toy version.  I purchased this for my son's birthday with the stipulation that his older sister gets to use it, they are very close.I am extremely impressed with the product so far.  I have not had any issues, so I have not tested the customer support that is suppose to be so great.  I am very technical so maybe that is why I have had very little issues with it.  The App that installs on your iDevice is extremely nice and very easy to use.  We read some of the basic instructions while everything was charging.  The battery for the drone itself charges very fast as far as I am concerned.  The Remote charging took FOREVER!  But you do not need to charge the remote very often so once we charged it the first time it has not been a big deal.The drone itself is very easy to fly but be smart.  My daughter took the first flight and thought that using the auto-landing from 90 feet was a hands off thing.  It is not!  The drone will float from side to side so you need to help it out if you have a bunch of trees in the area.  She flys about as good as she drives, scary.  I actually found landing manually is actually easier and less stressful.  The battery time goes very fast!  So I understand why people say to get a second battery.The camera on the drone is unbelievable.  The 4k is just amazing in the clarity and how far you can see in the distance.  We barely move it around because it is so much fun just to gain height and see the world from a different view.  I can not wait from a distant thunder storm with lightening that we see in the south during the late summer months.  Taking it to the mountains during the fall will also be amazing.  We just have so many ideas.  This is quickly turning into a family drone.  We are even carrying it with us to Austin in a week and maybe catch the bats.If you want a drone, this is the one.  It is durable, crashed it twice and nothing is broken.  This package comes with everything you need except a second battery.
