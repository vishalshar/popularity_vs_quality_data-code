Just bought this on a recommendation and it is everything we had been hoping for including being something we could actually afford.  The'installation' was more like just sticking the tags on the doors and a window and plugging the stick into our router and then letting the app guide the configuration, no tools or wires or anything.  The whole process was complete in less than 20 minutes, and no tech skills needed - that was a relief because we don't have any!  Everything seems to be working fine, and it's LOUD when it goes off.So now we are setting up our security circle of friends who we can notify from the app.  Feeling much safer.  Probably some of them will get Korner systems too and we'll all be much safer.
