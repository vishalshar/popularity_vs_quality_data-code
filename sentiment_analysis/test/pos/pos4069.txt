Fantastic. I have another Bluetooth keyboard from a competitor, which was also great, but I am in love with this one. It fits perfectly with my iPad mini4 both physically and aesthetically. The battery life is great as well. Cannot complain. I have yet to have issues with it holding my iPad firmly in place.I was not paid in any form for my review. Just wanted to give my own opinion.
