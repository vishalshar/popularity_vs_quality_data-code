If you look back at the 2015 Shine 2 product, which is now listed as discontinued, you will see that the majority of the reviews all said the same thing: love the tracker, HATE the band. So many people disliked the band and actually lost their Shine 2 that Misfit heard the complaints and did something about it. I ordered this new 2016 version on Feb 12, 2016 and it arrived today. The sport band has indeed been changed/modified/updated, and it looks like they have made some big improvements. Obviously, we've only had it for a very short time, so I will start my review at 5 stars and will definitely update it if that changes. So far, no pop-outs! The short-term result is Misfit has their winner. See the photos for a look at the new band and please let me know if you have any other observations! NOTE: we also received another Shine action clip, which appears to still be the same as it was on the previous Shine 2.As far as the tracker goes, it is definitely an improvement over the Shine 1. We have seen more consistent results when syncing to an iPhone and the data appears to be as good or better than what the Shine 1 gathered. Really like the multi-colored LEDs as well. Overall, a nice improvement and advancement to the Shine line of trackers.UPDATE: 2.25.16 - Band is still working great. ZERO pop-outs.UPDATE: 3.07.16 - Shine 2 has popped out one time, as a result of getting caught on some clothing. Other than that, no issues.UPDATE: 3.09.16 - Added back photos. I guess Amazon strips out the original photos when you edit a review. Good to know!
