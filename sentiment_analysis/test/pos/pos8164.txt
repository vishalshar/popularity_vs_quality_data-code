I really, really like this product. I find that I look forward to wearing it not only while I work at my desk but also while reading and while watching television. It has helped ease my chronic lower back pain and hopefully will also help my shoulders and neck with time. As a side note, I'm not certain if there is any clinical evidence for this, but I feel as if the BetterBack has also been helping me focus more as I work; the product helps me feel grounded and centred on the task I am on. I have high hope for the BetterBack.
