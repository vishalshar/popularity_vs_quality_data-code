We just received our Switch Witch and are thrilled with this quality product. My daughter loved being able to put the witch in her caldron. Even though it's early, we read the story and loved it. Both the story and illustrations captivated my two year old, and that's saying a lot. We can't wait to catch our Switch Witch getting into trouble and more importantly swapping treats for a special gift. Oh I also must mention the handy log in the back of the book. Now we can track all our little one's Halloween costumes and Switch Witch swaps. So fun!
