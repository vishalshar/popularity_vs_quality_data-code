I'm loving my Misfit Ray! I'll start off by saying that I'm a previous Misfit Shine user, so my goal for a fitness & sleep tracker is a sleek, stylish feel - I don't want something that is this big/techy thing on my arm that gets unwanted attention on my arm. Also, I'm a big fan of Misfit because of the accuracy - as a previous FitBit Flex owner, I can tell you that Misfit as a whole is way better as far as accuracy and Misfit Ray is no exception! It's accurate, my activity is automatically tracked, it looks great, it's very comfortable, I get phone and message alerts (there was no problem at all with syncing and it stays synced all day), the vibration is good but I haven't used it as sleep alarm yet and I'll admit, I could see that being a little weak and not working for a deep sleeper. But other than that, IT'S AWESOME! I definitely recommend, especially if you're upgrading from Shine, you'll love it!
