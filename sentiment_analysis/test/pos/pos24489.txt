After using it for two weeks, Remocam is a great multi-functional home security device at an excellent entry-level price. It is much more than a security camera alone; yet the mobile app is intuitive and easy to use. Setup couldn't be simpler. By being able to speak, listen, and turn on TVs in line-of-sight, Remocam puts in you your room from anywhere in the world. Highly recommended especially with the very low overhead investment.
