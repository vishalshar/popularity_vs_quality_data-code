I am so glad that I discovered Barnana! My favorites are the peanut butter coated and the "original". There was some concern about the peanut butter coating melting when it is hot out. In my case they put the product in an insulated bag with ice packs in the shipping box. There were no problems with coating melting. Thumbs up to Barnana for their attention to detail and their desire to get the product to the customer in perfect condition.
