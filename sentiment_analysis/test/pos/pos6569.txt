Let me start by saying I have NEVER met a water sprinkler system I have liked - until now!  It is a bit odd that there are no controls on the wall of my garage but those things rarely worked correctly anyway.  Once you follow the easy setup process it is all done in the palm of your hand.  My family hate how much I love it because I keep talking about it.  I SIMPLY LOVE IT!!!
