I am extremely happy with my MEVO, this is exactly what I was looking for.I am using it to livestream through Facebook live and i found it very plug and play ( i could stream literally 5min after opening the box ! )I travel a lot and tend to live stream outside of urban areas (aka no wifi) so the ability to use my phone LTE is very convenient as well as editing on the fly. I am usually not really good with editing softwares but I found this one pretty easy to use.So far no regrets ! Very good gift to myself :-)
