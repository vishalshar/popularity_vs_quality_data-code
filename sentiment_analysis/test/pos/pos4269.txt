My only complaint is that it's a bit hard to get it clean. There's a small groove inside near the rim, which can get gunk in it. And it's hard to see all the way down to the tip to make sure it's clean. But it's a great size, the strap is the perfect length (although I have to be careful not to get my mighty Viking beard in my beverage). And the package and instructions are amusing.
