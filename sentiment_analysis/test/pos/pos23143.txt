I have been using this for over a month now, and it has quickly become my favorite water bottle. I've had no leaking. It's great.I love how easy it is to wash. I really love the handle. Most of all I love that the square shape means it won't just roll around in the passenger seat like other bottles.UPDATE: I purchased this back in January, and it is now mid July. The bottle has seen several washings and tons of use. I'm happy to report that there are no leaks. One thing that I did notice is that sometimes when I fill it, water can spill down the side and end up inside the bottom cap. It doesn't really hurt anything, but sometimes a few drops of water end up on your shirt. Since the water appears to be coming from the bottom, it can give the appearance that the bottle is leaking when none has actually occurred. Still a 5 star water bottle.
