I was a little unsure about this case because of the clear plastic.  I had a Rokform case for my old iphone and it was extremely durable.  I was really surprised at how nice and solid this case was.  The clear plastic helps the iphone show through but it's not cheap plastic at all.  This is a very nice durable case and it looks much better on the actual phone.  Very nice case.  This was going to my case for mountain biking and I planned to use an Apple case for everyday, but this one is so nice, I'm leaving it on all of the time.
