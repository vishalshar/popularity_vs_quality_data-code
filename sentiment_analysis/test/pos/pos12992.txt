I've seen a lot of car mounts but this is the most ingenious one I've ever played with. I have a 2012 Toyota RAV4 and the CD slot is a little wide. No problem, the extra insert made the clip perfectly snug. I have an iPhone 6 with the Apple leather case. While the adhesive on the metal pad that fits between the case and the phone would probably prefer a more smooth surface to attach to, once the case is on it holds the plate in place just fine. I've seen comments about rotating the phone and the stiffness of the ball joint in the mount. I found this complaint to be completely irrelevant as it is much easier to just rotate the phone itself. Yes the magnet holds the phone tightly to the mount but not so tight that you can't remove it or slide it around to a horizontal position. Other things I love about this is the fact that it won't ever be obsolete at least until cars don't have CD slots. It is east to move from car to care and the magnetic plate can be moved to another phone when you get one.
