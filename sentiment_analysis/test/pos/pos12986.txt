2/2/2015 Review:This is a great product.  I had a high hope for using it in my car for mounting my iPhone 6Plus.  It looks good, has a nice quality, minimalistic design and feels solid. However, when I used in in my car, due to the fact it stands out from the vent and weight of iPhone 6Plus, it would tilt down constantly.  I do not have this problem with the Kenu AirFrame Plus I have.The other problem I faced that is it not mentioned anywhere or by the vendor is removal of the metal plate once you stick it to the back of the phone.  Fortunately, I had a Skinomi TechSkin on the back of the phone.  Due to the super strong glue on this plate, I could not remove it using my fingers. I used a knife to wedge the plate but that did not work either and I was about to damage the phone.  So I pushed a sharp utility razor between the plate and phone to cut it loose all the time fearful I will scratch and dent the phone.  That was not entirely successful either.  So finally I decided to remove the entire TechSkin and the plate along with it which I did until I reached the area around the back plate. It would not move.  Finally, after 30 minutes of trying different things, I was successful in removing the whole thing but resulted in bending the plate. I was impressed by the Skinomi TechSkin protecting my phone while I used all sorts of metal tools. I have no idea how you will ever remove the back plate if you stick it directly to the bare back of the phone. I immediately placed another TechSkin on the back of my iPhone.By the way, I did not experience any issues with the operations of the phone (even compass) while using it.2/18/2015 Review Update:I was contacted by iOttie Support shortly after my review and they provided another iTap device since they believed the original one may have been defective.  The support representative was very nice and helpful which goes a long way in consideration of buying items over the Internet.  This time I used the inside case plate which has a small sticking area using an older full cover iPhone case I had.  The new device works much better in terms of not tilting down using my iPhone 6 Plus.  However, I am still wary of using the back plate directly on my iPhone's back due to my previous issue. According to iOttie, the back plate should come off easily without any residue on the phone.  To be fair to iOttie, it may have been the combination of the Skinomi skin and the back plate glue that made it very difficult to remove it. But I am not ready and willing to test that on my iPhone at this point.As I indicated previously, this device is of high quality and well made, has a nice idea and design, does not interfere with any aspect of iPhone operation and now, I know it is backed by great support from iOttie.  Therefore, I increased my rating to four stars and changed the title. In general, I recommend this product to everyone.
