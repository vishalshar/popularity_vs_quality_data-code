Very easy to setup and use out of the box.  The app is very well designed and easy to navigate as well.  Light output is plenty bright and the colors are extremely vibrant.Where this product stumbles a bit for me is with possible Wifi issues if I decided to add multiple Lifx bulbs to my network.  I feel the mesh network created by the Philips Hue lighting system makes for a more robust solution. Additionally, the lack of Apple Homekit support would force me to purchase another smart home hub in order to integrate it with other smart home devices.  In fairness, LIFX advises Homekit support is coming very soon.  As an alternative, IFTTT support does give you some workaround recipes.In the end, my concerns and needs led me to returning this product and opting for Philips Hue instead.  It is a great product, but didn't necessarily meet my requirements.
