This tiny device is great - I did exchange my android SEEK for an iphone fit - the android did not fit my notebook, as I had hoped, so thanks to the wonderful seller on Amazon, they willingly exchanged mine for a SEEK that fits the iphone 5s - the size was shocking, since it's so small, but it gives back big results - we live outside of town, in the country, and sometimes have small animals prowling the property - our dog was constantly getting sprayed by skunks, so this hunts them out when they are on the prowl and gives us a heads up for getting the dog inside.  We're in the process of finding several uses for our SEEK - it's fascinating and proving to be quite useful - we would highly recommend this item -
