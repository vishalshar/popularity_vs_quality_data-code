This is the first 3D printer I bought, largely because of its large build area. I can see that work has been put in making this printer easy to use right out of the box, but it will still require maintenance so I would recommend buying this only if you are comfortable diagnosing and fixing minor problems.On my first print the 9-point alignment function would sometimes try to bring the print head up instead of down onto the platform, and as a result start printing in mid-air about 0.5in off the print bed. To fix this you will need to ensure the horizontal rods on which the extruder moves are level. These rods move on two independent drive screws (and with two limit switches) and these can get out of alignment. Simply turn either the left or right side z-axis threaded rod until the extruder rides parallel to the print bed. When aligned correctly, during the 9-point alignment the z-axis limit switch will activate only on the side next to the extruder (and ~both will activate when extruder is in the middle). Whereas if not aligned, only the switch on one side (that is below the other side) will activate.Also note that when printing from SD card I get best results when I wait to disconnect until after the calibration routine is completed and the printing has started. The software still warns that disconnecting will cancel the print even though it does not. I do not fully trust the queuing system because of that, and have been doing one print at a time.Pros:After I got it up and running, it has been printing without issue. 9-point leveling works really well.Huge build area for the pricePrinting from SD card (this has been much more useful than I thought, since prints take many hours and I can disconnect my laptop and leave the printer running the rest of the day)Everything necessary for printing (except for the computer) is included in the box (filament, glue stick, some other tools) so you can print right away, I had the calibration print done within an hour of getting the packageClosed loop temperature control of the print bed and extruder, also control of the print-cooling fan speedCons:The print bed wobbles a bit, leading to slight wavy vibration patterns in the printed structure. This might be fixed by re-mounting the bottom bearings that hold up the print bed.The heater for the print bed is not really centered, so large parts will be printed on the unheated sectionThe handle for holding the filament spool allows the spool to tilt sideways which can cause it to get stuck. This is easy to fix with a rod (even a pencil or pen) and some tape.This printer does not have position feedback or real software limits, so it can be programmed to print outside the physical print area which leads to unpredictable results. Also if the print bed hits something which blocks its full range of motion the entire print will be out of alignment. Note that this is true of every printer within this class, so should not really be a basis for comparison.Overall, if you are comfortable with tinkering a little bit I definitely recommend this printer.
