I was very skeptical about ordering a mattress online....especially the ones that come curled in a box.  But I needed a bed and after looking online at many reviews, I decided to take the plunge and order something.  Ghostbed seemed like a good neutral bed according to the reviews, so I ordered it.  One word...WOW!  I've never slept on a latex/memory foam bed before...always a spring mattress.  I absolutely love this bed.  The first night, it was a little "weird".  Not a bad "weird"...but I guess my body was used to the old crappy spring mattress for MANY years that my body didn't know how to react.  I absolutely love this bed.  I toss and turn less in my sleep and I fall asleep faster.Thank you GhostBed for making such an awesome product!
