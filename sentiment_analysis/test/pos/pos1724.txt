So far so good! This has been a pretty handy little device.  I have it attached to my keys.  Due to my highly space cadet tendencies I lose my keys a few times a week.  Ugh.  Instead of tearing up my house looking for them,  it now takes me under minute.  Unfortunately,  now I can't use the excuse "I can't find my keys" any longer when I'm late.
