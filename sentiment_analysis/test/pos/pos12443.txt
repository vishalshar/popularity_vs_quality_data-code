Much like the LIFX, the LIFX + has all the next level color, brightness and awesome functional features of its sibling. If you want my thoughts about all that stuff see my review on the new LIFX A19. In summary, theyre great. 5 stars.Now, the LIFX +. I liked the idea (its a bit crazy James Bond tech feeling) and hey, I was getting LIFX anyway so figured Id get a mix. The main difference is that the + have a whole added channel of light for night vision enhancement. Whenever the bulb is not set to visible light it puts out infrared that is invisible to the eye (it also switches it on when theyre set to super dim).Why did I bother? Well Have you ever been lying in bed at night and then there is a creepy noise? You and your significant other have a bit of a debate over whether or not it needs investigation or who will go check and you're kind of freaked out? Solution: just set up some little cams at key locations in your house, along with a couple of these babies and use an app to check from bed. And if there IS someone lurking about just turn all the LIFX in your house on red with said phone and totally scare them off! Problem solved.Yes, cameras do work without LIFX + boosting the vision but I figured Id rather upgrade the lights and have fewer cams as that was less 1984-esque. Another thing I've noticed from my testing so far is that the super infrared makes windows really easy to see through (normally hard with cameras at night) and lights up all those weird nooks and creepy, dark halls in older places so it is a big improvement on just the camera alone.Some potential bonus uses that might add some value: hilarious night time pet antics captured, proof there arent ghosts in your house, know who is raiding the fridge, watch your baby sleep, see whos stealing your paper at dawn the list goes on.In summary: this is already a 5 star product but with super innovative functionality added in that you cant get in other smart lights.
