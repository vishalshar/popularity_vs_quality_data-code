This is a fantastic product. The overall quality and attention to detail is obvious, and the sound quality is excellent. Some reviewers have criticized the volume it produces, but with 15 people in and around our pool last weekend, we had to turn it down so you could talk without shouting. I looked at many different speakers before choosing the Fugoo.  They entered a crowded field that includes some big name companies, and in my opinion they came out on top.
