I purchased this a few months ago for my lab/h ound mix who likes to get out and run. 3 times now it has performed well, lol wing me to track and find him before I get a call that he is out on the local roads. Resolves my awful fears and anxiety about losing my dog. Love that it warns me when it's battery is in need of charging. The support staff were very helpful in assisting me with set up
