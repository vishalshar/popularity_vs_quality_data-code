i bought the whole kit because i really needed some nice cup to put my brushes in normally, and i figured this would be the perfect opportunity with all the extras (shampoo, washing station, towel and guards). while i will never repurchase their brush shampoo (olive or baby oil and dish soap are much cheaper and work just, if not more effectively), i like having a towel i know is specifically for brush drying and a washing station (it does work better than a hand). when my brushes are guarded and drying i use the cup for that, and then dry it out and store my brushes upright on my desk. it's not too costly for what you get, since i know that everything is specifically for my brushes. if you are on a budget however, buy a mixed pack of guards and substitute everything else. i just wanted to buy the kit so i had everything specifically for my brushes.
