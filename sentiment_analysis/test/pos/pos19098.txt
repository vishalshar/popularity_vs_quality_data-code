I couldn't be happier with this product! For the size and price, I am impressed with the video quality and how easy it is to use.Please note that if you are wanting to hook up your iPhone to the Cube, you will need to have an HDMI adapter. Not a big issue, just important to know to have an awesome experience.Battery life is decent-I've kept mine plugged in to watch continuous hours of Netflix. I'd recommend using a bluetooth speaker as the speaker that is built in doesn't carry too far (again, based on the size). You can plug in your headphones into the Cube no problem.I can lay on the floor and project videos up on my high ceiling; I'm looking forward to putting up a massive sheet outside my house over the summer and having a couple movie nights outside.Will recommend this to my friends over and over again!
