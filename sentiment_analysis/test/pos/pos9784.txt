I have four children and bought this as a family gift. It is an amazing toy. My kids have consistently played with him for hours each day. He adds new things as you play with him. He is so cool that my kids hid  him in the closet when we had company over it because they were worried that people would be too rough with him. Yes it is an expensive toy but it is worth every penny in my opinion.
