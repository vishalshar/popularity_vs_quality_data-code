This is a great unit.  Exfoliates making your skin baby smooth. I've been using it about 1 month.  Smaller pores, improvement in fine lines, just healthier looking and feeling skin.  The precision tip is a must for around the eyes, nose and just as a follow up to the standard tip.  After use I apply an L-Acscorbic acid serum followed by Argan oil and my skin literally drinks it in.  I love it and can't wait to see the results in another month.
