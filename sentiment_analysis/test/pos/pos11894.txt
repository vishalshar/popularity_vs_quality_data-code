I've had this for about five months now.  I received a Google Cardboard viewer as a gift over the holidays and was instantly addicted to mobile VR ( as was the rest of my family who couldn't stop playing with it ).  This is much more expensive but also FAR more comfortable on the face, offers the option to focus each lense and buttons on the right and left sides  to control on-screen prompts.  The buttons are a feature which many competitive models do not offer and you will find to be a MUST!I'm using an iPhone 6S.  YouTube on iOS now supports VR, simply do a search for "VR videos", a small icon will be in the lower right corner for videos that are supported, click that and you are in VR mode.  In the App Store or Google Play simply search "VR" to find compatible apps. The number of apps, videos  and games is growing day by day.  If you are on the fence about VR start with a Cardboard viewer,  if you think it's one of the coolest things you've ever seen, this might be worth the money for you. It was for me it makes quite a difference from the basic.
