I picked up the "out front" mount for my road bike. The locking system is easy to snap into and very secure. The case is a little bulkier than I'd like and the buttons are recessed a little too much for my liking. There are a few literal rough edges where the flashing from the mold hasn't been fully removed. It's mostly worn down in the few days I've been using the case.Overall it's a sturdy case with a nice secure mounting system built in. I'll most likely be buying the car mount kit next.
