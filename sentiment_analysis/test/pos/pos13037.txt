This filament is working great for me in a FlashForge Finder, giving models with a nice smooth shine and opaque black color. The filament was nicely wound on the spool, not brittle and the models I have made with it (some of which are mechanical parts) are robust and strong.I highly recommend this filament for its quality and as an excellent value!NB: if you are going to use this (or other non FlashForge) filament with the Finder you will need to make an external spool holder such as one of the designs on Thingiverse because the Finder apparently uses a smaller (non-standard) spool size.
