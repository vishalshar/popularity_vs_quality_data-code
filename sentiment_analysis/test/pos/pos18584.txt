This Coffee Maker is GREAT.  My husband drinks Decaf.  I drink regular.  THIS Coffee Maker solved the issue of our having TWO coffee makers!!!  It looks nice, is fairly compact, and works GREAT.  The water fill gauge on the front is easy to ready.  It is just a wonderful appliance that I use EVERY day.  VERY pleased with this purchase.
