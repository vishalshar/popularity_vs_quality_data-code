I've been making my own almond milk and storing it in large mason jars, but pouring from a mason jar is no easy task. The result was a mess that looked like a 5-year old had done the pouring. If anyone can pour liquids from a mason jar without dribbling it all over, you deserve a gold star. The reCAP pour cap was the answer to inner peace, harmony, and non-dribbliness. Mind you, it's not a perfect gadget. When you're pouring, you need to hold that little flip cap up or it's going to flip right down on the stream. The result is a bit reminiscent of that 5-year old in your kitchen. Still, holding a flip cap takes a lot less skill than pouring directly from a mason jar. This is a real winner.
