after an easy install along with a little help from their helpdesk I had this up and running in no time.  Compact unit taking up very little space.  More importantly I have already saved the cost of the new controller in my water bills in less than two months.  Excellent product with great service/technical back up if required.  Also very ease to use and track water use on my Samsung phone.  Much more user friendly than my old Hunter controller which was good but outdated
