It isn't an easy task to buy a microwave online so you take your chances and see what others say and place an order, right? That's what I did and I am not going to return this item. And I'm going to tell you that it works OK and I made a right purchase.  I will tell you that it is externally larger than I thought it would be on the countertop. Hard to judge in advance.  Also, because you cannot see inside what is cooking you pretty much have to trust it's going to be OK. The metal quality seems to be a little bit on the thinner side - not high level as what you might expect from brands such as Panasonic, but again you get what you pay for is the way to justify.For a simple all white - which is what I wanted, no black, this countertop unit is designed to warm things without turning it into a major appliance. I would recommend it.
