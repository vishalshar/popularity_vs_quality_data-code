Great wallet, great quality, design and feel, after a short time it gets a lovely distressed worn in look that just makes it nicer to use. It doesnt tear, and fits a lot of items in it, the expanding quality is genius and makes it universal. I plan on buying the plain white one so i can draw and design my own.
