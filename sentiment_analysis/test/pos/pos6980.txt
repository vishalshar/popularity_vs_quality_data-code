Unfortunately like any Version 1.0/2.0 device it has some quirky issues. Early prototypes of the Glyph had an earphone top loop that rotated on a pivot point down over the eyes. This first release compromised on that design by making it a solid half-circle. The point seems to be to have a 2-in-1 device: headphone and cinemaphone. Unfortunately the design winds up awkward for both purposes. Headphone mode is somewhat uncomfortable and goofy looking due to bulkiness.  Cinemaphone mode is a little better but the earphones put a bit more pressure on my ears than i like. For the rest of this review I'll concentrate on cinemaphone mode since I find much less expensive headphones that I would choose over this.The primary purpose of this headset is for viewing entertainment video. And in this respect the headset does a decent job. I have a 50 inch TV I sit about 7 feet from at home and the Glyph screen seems maybe 10% bigger by comparison.  Once youve had the headset on and movie playing for a few minutes you become immersed. Very nice for watching movies. Even SBS 3D movies. I successfully tested the 3D SBS mode using VideoLan, YouTube Flash and Cyberlink PowerDVD and it worked great. Video quality was very nice.The unique technology in play is a Digital Light Processor (DLP) similar to those used in older generation big screen TVs. Light is bounced off the DLP and projected into your eyes. This technology holds a lot of promise but in most cases other innovations will be needed to fully exploit this technology. You see, because the headset projects the light into your eyes, anything that interferes with the alignment of light source and retina results in an imperfect scene. The headset has adjustments for static calibrations like eye separation, eye to ear distance, nose pad height, and  eye focus. But it does not currently compensate for non-static things like eyeball movement. In short, if you arent looking straight ahead, it's hard to see.  Which works fine for movies but not so much for games or trying to use the headset as a PC monitor.But there is hope. A short while ago Avegant released updated firmware that enable SBS (side by side) 3D support and head tracking. The 360 degree head tracking is the potential killer feature. Hobbyist UAV users are already using this feature.  I think this feature in combination with something akin to an "Extended Desktop" Windows mode that uses the feature to scroll the desktop to move things into your center of view will make it more useful for PC desktop work and gaming.  That and reduce the weight by 30% and improve comfort a little.[TIP] To upgrade the firmware: Download the "Gylph Companion" from the Android or Apple app store. Hold the power button on the glyph for three seconds until the LED blinks blue then connect using the app. In the ap main screen you should see the button to push to update the firmware. It took me several attempts and I had to switch my phone to WiFi.[PROS][+] Immersive movie watching experience[+] Portable[+] Excellent sound with nice bass[+] SBS 3D support[+] Decent battery life[Cons][-]  Limited uses for now[-]  Lots of adjustments needed[-]  A bit heavy and tight on ears[-]  WHY OH WHY DOES THIS HAVE BLUETOOTH BUT I HAVE TO USE A HDMI CABLE?????[-]  No Lightening or Mini Displayport to HDMI adapers included[-]  Packing box tough to open
