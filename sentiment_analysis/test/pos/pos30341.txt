I've used the kenu airframe and the belkin knock off of the kenu airframe and the iOttie is better than both of them.The kenu is better constructed than the belkin.  The kenu (if positioned correctly) allows you to insert/remove your phone with one hand.  The problem is that the part that clips onto the vents is shallow.  So, your phone doesn't have any clearance between the vents and the airframe.  I also bought the original kenu and it doesn't expand enough to fit the iPhone 6+.The belkin knockoff of the kenu does fit the iPhone 6+, but yo can't insert/remove your phone easily with one hand.  It does have more clearance than the kenu though.The iOtttie's ball mount that allows you to position your phone makes it much more flexible and dynamic in terms of configuration than the others.  Having a magnet instead of a "grip" to hold your phone is much nicer.  Makes it much easier to insert/remove your phone.
