My wife and I bought this because we have a cat that is very food motivated and won't let us sleep past 4am. We only feed the cat wet food, so we needed something that would keep the food from going bad. We chose the Feed and Go, and we have not been disappointed. We setup the feeder to feed at intervals for a small snack around 4am and a full breakfast at 6am. My wife and I sleep much better now.The feeder is easy to setup and easy to use. Our cat has broken into every feeder we have ever tried EXCEPT for the Feed and Go. He tries but never comes close. The added bonus is that this works well for travelling too. We have setup feedings and are able to see that our cat is eating using the webcam.And that is not all. I had a question and submitted it via the website. Within 10 minutes I received a phone call and was assisted. I was blown away as my question was not urgent. I know that this is a company who cares very much about the customer.I recently got a 2nd cat and now I am buying a 2nd feeder. Great product and great company.
