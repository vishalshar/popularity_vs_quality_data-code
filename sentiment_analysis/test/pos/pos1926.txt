Many people say that the wheel doesn't work on their watch but that is not the case with me. This works absolutely great with my watch. The bands are made of that soft plastic that feels like silicon but doesn't feel cheap at all. The watch itself is incased in a rigid shell. It honestly gives you the feel of an original Casio g shock. If you absolutely want to protect your watch then get this. It does have some downsides, such as the wheel sticking out a little more than it should and it turns on Siri when you bend your wrist a little too much. Other than that it's great!
