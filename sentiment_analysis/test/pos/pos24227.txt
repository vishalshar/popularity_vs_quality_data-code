Ordered this for my sons iPhone 6plus and he absolutely loves it. Does not stick well to textured walls, but that was to be expected. He has has it for a couple of months now and it still adheres well to flats surfaces. My son loves showing it to everyone we know and it has protected his phone despite some drops.
