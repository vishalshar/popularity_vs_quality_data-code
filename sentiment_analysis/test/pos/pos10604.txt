Arrived earlier than expected.  Assembly was easy, and our first trial run went smoothly.  Takes about 45 min. to preheat.  We used a little corn meal as well as some flour on the peel to ensure that the pizza would slide off into the oven without sticking and it worked perfectly. Make sure you place the dough on the peel before putting on toppings!  Pizza was easy to rotate and cooked in about 3 min.  Just follow the instructions included.  You may run into issue with bringing it up to temp. if your grill doesn't have at least 3 or 4 burners.  Ours has 4.  I highly recommend this oven.  I makes for a fun Friday pizza night.
