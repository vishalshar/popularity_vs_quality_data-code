This is probably the game to beat Cards against humanity and that's saying a lot. Best way to describe this game is imagine if charades met CAH, they fell in love, and had a baby!! This is the baby! It's as funny as cards against humanity but engaging!!! The creators of this game should deserve a lot of credit and thanks and I hope they see this review. Please please please support them and this game on Kickstarter.
