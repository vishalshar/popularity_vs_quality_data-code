I just installed this router and it's awesome. It's fast and easy to install. My house is over 3000 sq. ft., it's installed in a basement office and I still get a strong signal on the second floor. I was also able to eliminate my range extender. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is burgundy, not white as in the picture.
