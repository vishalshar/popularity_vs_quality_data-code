LOVE THIS BAND WAY BETTER THAN ANY OF MY PREVIOUS TRACKERS! I've had fuel,Fitbit, and jawbone. For the price this does way more than my last Fitbit. Tracks everything listed, you can set alarms to viberate, activity alarms to viberate, has a stopwatch, tells the time, has the great app ( way better than the other competitors apps) charging is so easy and requires you not to take out the computer in the band. All in all this is a fun and inexpensive tracker! I LOVE it! And getting the kids and husband them for Christmas!
