Yep, it's just as good as all the reviews say.My son has been using an old humidifier for white noise for about 6 years, and the thing is starting to make odd noises, worrying me that the motor's going to catch fire in the night, or something.  We looked at white noise machines at Brookstone, but they were huge, and cost a lot.  He debated whether to just stop using a machine, but in the end we decided to come look at Amazon.I too was interested because all my life I've lived in homes with forced-air heating, which comes on and off intermittently during the night.  Here in our new apartment, we have radiant heat, and so every little apartment noise (cats playing/fighting, kid sneezing, whatever) wakes me up.  So I ordered two of these.  Mine arrived first and I've been using it for 2 nights now.It is adorably cute - about the size of a 1-ounce jar of face cream - and nicely minimalist; not a lot of buttons or settings to deal with.  The first night, we put it on a volume that seemed acceptable, but clearly was too loud, because at some point in the night I reached over and turned it off.  However, last night I dialed it down one notch and hubby and I had a great night's sleep.A main feature for us to buy this model and not one of the other highly-rated LectroFan models was that we travel a lot; when we're in a hotel room it's even harder to sleep through odd noises, and this is beautifully compact for tucking into a carryon.  We recommend.  Son's is due to arrive in today's UPS, and if there are any significant reasons to change this review, I'll come back in a few days and do so.
