I purchased my H20Pal a few weeks ago and am really loving this product. The APP is VERY well designed and easy to use. I'm fairly active and really love how the bottle reminds me to hydrate. Looking at my daily intake, I'm certain that I wasn't drinking enough water. I've also really enjoyed drinking out of a glass bottle. The water seems to taste better and is easier to clean than other bottle I've had.
