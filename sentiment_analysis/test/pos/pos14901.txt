My kitty absolutely loves this stuff! I actually have to control how much she eats because it taste so good to her I guess. I've never had to control before which is a down fall but that's being selfish because she absolutely adores it. Great ingredients that I'm not afraid to give my little Dyna cat! Only reason I gave it four instead of five is that it's a little pricey but that star is debatable because how much is your cats good health worth?
