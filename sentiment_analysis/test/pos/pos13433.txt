My daughter loves to do yoga with CHiP and I love that it encourages her to be more active. She has CHiP follow her all over the house. The self charging feature is really nice and I love not having to remember to plug one more device in! ItÂ’s like CHiP takes care of himself! My Daughter has so much fun with the dance moves and voice commands too.
