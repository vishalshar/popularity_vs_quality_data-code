I have really loved this case with my phone and in my car. My only minor issue is that it did not initially play with the skin I had on my phone and it took a lot of tucking and retucking with toothpicks and the like to get all the bubbles out that it caused because the corners are *that* tight. Great for the safety of the phone, but a little annoying for me.
