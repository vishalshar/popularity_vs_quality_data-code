This is exactly what i needed to complete my mobile office.  Everything i have is powered by micro usb so now i have the "power bar" i need for my office!  It nicely powers my phone, HDMI widi receiver and HDMI to Display port converter.  And it still has ports available to charge my other cell phone, bluetooth keyboard and headset.
