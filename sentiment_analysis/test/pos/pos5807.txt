I'm a huge fan of this device. In my case, my computer is on top of my desk, and the USB is installed in a visible port to me...it's very close.My key fob ends up under the desk, in my pocket. With the applications slider sensitivity set at the third position, I have no issues whatsoever; it locks when i walk away, unlocks when i sit down, and no false signal drops where it thinks I've walked away.I played with the USB in the back of the computer as well, and the range shortens by a few feet. If i set the sensitivity any lower, i would get the accidental lockouts.The functionality is extremely helpful in my case, where i walk over to help another developer, and my desktop simply locks, so no passing C level would get stressed out seeing an unattended open desktop.I ordered an additional USB and synced the same keyfob to my home computer as well,so when i sit at either machine, it's unlocking automatically  for me.If you have a situation where unattended, open machines get your bosses panic attacks, get this device. it is awesome.
