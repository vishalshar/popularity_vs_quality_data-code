Our purpose in purchasing this product is very specific. We have a highly intelligent, extremely oppositional child who is determined to leave his room late at night despite our house rules. This has resulted in a lot of messes and finally a small fire started in the microwave by him. We can't hear him when he leaves his room and we needed a system that will reliably warn us when his door opens. We wanted the following:A "plug-and-play" system that didn't require wiring. The Korner is absolutely that. I was concerned that I couldn't find a manual or FAQ online prior to purchasing but this is truly as simple as it appears. You download the app to your phone/tablet, enter your info to register, and follow the step-by-step walk through in the app.An alarm that would send an alert to our phone rather than triggering a siren. The goal isn't to wake up the neighborhood. We wanted a "silent alarm" mode so that we get a phone alert like a text message. My elderly mother lives with us and we also have a younger child, and we would like to have everyone get more sleep, not just our little escape artist.Flexible settings. I wanted to be able to disarm the alarm at 6:30 automatically, so that he can get up and use the bathroom, take a shower, and get ready for school. This is easy with this app.Everything connects easily, both the hardware and the software. Maybe 10 minutes to install. App is simple and not glitchy at all: shows every movement of the door, whether the system is armed or not, intrusions send a push alert to your phone via the app and email. I obviously don't need to alert the police or my contacts if our boy gets up to pee at 1 AM, so this is a nice feature for users with security concerns beyond an 11-year-old hell-bent on watching cartoons all night and eating every bite of candy in the house. I like that the range can be extended and tags can be identified individually so that we could distinguish between an opening door or window, if that was a factor, that we can build the system out further with separate tags if needed (if this becomes an issue with his sister, for example), or that as my mother's memory continues to erode we can tag her door as well.Able to be controlled by both parents. App is on both our phones, we can disarm or arm alarm remotely. You can set a delay to arm the door as well if that's a factor.It's been a great deterrent so far for our guy to understand that Mom and Dad WILL know if he is out of bed, we will be alerted and he will be escorted back to bed. It's difficult to assign an immediate consequence to a broken rule and be able to follow through when we simply aren't aware at the time that the rule is violated.This product is functioning exactly as we wanted. No problems at all; we're very happy so far. Strong recommend.
