It is hard to believe that you can get such a full range, quality sound from such a small device!  And it is very loud if you want it to be!  What I like most about it is particular to my application.  I have clip on Aero bars on my ancient road bike.  This compact little unit fits perfectly in-between the 2 bars going forward.  I was able to secure it to the Aero bars with 1 viton o-ring.  The o-ring holds it very solid.  It does not move around at all.  I have my Samsung Galaxy S5 mounted on a "Quad-Lock" assembly directly above head tube and stem.  The "Turtle Shell" speaker fits perfectly right underneath the phone (literally an inch away).  This makes for a perfect Bluetooth connection.The controls are logically placed and easy to operate.  Pairing is intuitive and easy.  The only downside I have found so far is the Bluetooth connection can be a little sketchy if you put your phone in your backpack and your speaker is on the handlebars.  It doesn't seem like that would be a problem since the phone is only a couple of feet from the speaker, but it seems to have trouble transmitting through a human body (and I'm really not that fat!).  My wife has the same problem with her "Buckshot" speaker (also manufactured by Outdoor Tech) and she is super fit!  Other than that, it's fantastic.  I will update if I run into any problems down the road.
