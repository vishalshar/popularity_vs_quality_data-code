Chose this over Fibit HR because I did not want the risk of LED and measuring device to burn my wrist like it has some others.  The bluetooth sync was easy with this Misfit and it's a safer mechanism to get your steps and sleep.  Lightweight, you don't know you have it on.  this came as promised, easy download of the Misfit App. Fits well but the super size snap will come undone, you just fix it by using a clasp from your old silicone watch or buy a handful here on Amazon.  Love it.  It came off at the mechanics waiting room, they kept it for me, then I found my old silicone watch clasp and another and put both on, unsnap to slide off wrist for shower.  It also came out of the watchband during the time I was cleaning the litter box, and a second time when I caught it on the van door.  so, they need to work on their bands to have better holds, it should not be easy to lose.  I am grateful for the lower price, but fix the band Misfit! And give us traditional surefire holding bands.Buy it!, the reminder to move alone is so very valuable.  I lost 8 pounds and kept it off since Feb 8 when it arrived! It sincs with apple's Health app, and I use Myfitness App and it sincs with that too!
