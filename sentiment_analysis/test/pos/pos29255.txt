I just got this NAOS 8200 since everyone was raving about it being a pretty good claw-grip large mouse.So here is what the NAOS 8200 is:Inside: Its equipped with a fairly advanced computer on-board (An ARM Cortex-M3 model STM32F100R8T6 which can run at up to 24 MHz, and has 64k of its own flash memory) coupled to a nicely molded shell.  Given that its a fairly advanced computer in the mouse, it can do quite a bit of heavy lifting on the silicon without having to get attention from the computer.Outside: The shell has a very nice feel to it and a rubberized coating.  The buttons are comfortable, and it has lots of PTFE ("teflon") landing pads under it to give you a pretty decent mousing experience, especially if you have giant hands like me :-)  It has a nylon braided cord that is of decent length.  It has LED illumination with a few nice effects and many options.Software:  It is Windows 10 compatible.  This is a question I keep seeing.  I checked with tech support, they confirmed, and I'm running on Windows 10-64 right now.  The software is feature complete, but lags behind the best of logitech in some areas.  The good:  You can configure 5 profiles, each with 3 sensitivity settings (can be selected via mouse buttons), pointer acceleration settings, PC polling frequency, lift distance, LED effects.  The bad:  it due a major update. The 8200 software was developed pre-windows 10... It should be a WPF application that you can resize... right now, the UI is a static 800px X 600px window which can be quite tiny & ridiculous to operate on a 4k display or 30" monitor.  The lighting options while nice are inadequate for a mouse with this much horse-power... you have a Cortex M3 with 64k of flash memory for cryin out loud! Please let us use it!!! I should be able to program the LEDs for morse code if I want... :-)How it compares to the Proteus G502:Proteus has a better software suite, except on the newer logitech mouse software they're retiring the ability to set X & Y resolutions independently which the 8200 allows.  Also, I hate to say it... but I think the sensor in the 8200 feels a bit better behaved than the G502.  For a claw-grip user, the 8200 takes the cake.How it compares to the G9x:Again, Logitech has the software covered.  The aging sensor of the G9x still holds its own.  The G9x with the larger shell is still my favorite.  Also the G9x's weight-loading options have yet to find a competitor... The Proteus allows for weights, but the G9x lets you add weight literally over the sensor which the 502 won't allow.Annoyances:  I miss the logitech freewheel.  Its possible to modify this mouse a bit to reduce the scroll click.  If you don't mind voiding your warranty (or destroying your mouse in the process), the wheel click mechanism is caused by a notched flat tension-er who's notch I flattened out a bit with a thin nose hemostat.  See my uploaded pictures for the location of this notched tension-er.Insane ideas:  The Cortex M3 has a temperature sensor.  How about feeding the data back?  The Cortext M3 has two D2A converters... How about driving a haptic motor in there ("cell phone vibrate motor")?  The Cortext m3 has A2D converters... why not provide a surface galvanic sensor, or pressure sensors?Other thoughts:  Support is as bad as people say.  Don't expect a response for days/weeks.Summary:In my humble opinion, the NAOS 8200 is better than the Proteus... and in certain areas is the heir-apparent to the G9x minus the weight flexibility or the better g9x shell... but for now it'll have to do until Logitech comes to their senses and puts the G9x back into production.Frankly, I still think the mouse is a bit small but its the first mouse since my G9X that I feel comfortable with... And I took a Proteus 502 out of service and replaced it with this 8200.
