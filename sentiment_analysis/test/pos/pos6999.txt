I purchased 'Digestion' for my 7-year old papillon. She has had digestion issues (vomiting and diarrhea) ever since she was 2 month old. Having tried all kinds of dog food (dry kibbles, wet food, refrigerated food, frozen raw food) to no avail, my last resort was cook her food. She would get bloody diarrhea or diarrhea with mucous and urgency with every dog food I tried. The only 'dog food' that stopped her diarrhea was prescription diet I/D from Science Hill, but I could not think of giving it to her for the rest of her life due to nasty ingredients. It also made her lick her toes, bite her nails, and get anxious. So I am now baking her ground turkey breast and eggs mixed with cooked rice. She has tolerated it, did not have urgency, and did not throw up. However, her stool was somewhat loose.I added this to her food, my dog was very suspicious of the smell at first, but once she tasted it, she took it well. It did help her stool get firmer. She would still be dripping a bit of water, but she did well with it. I used twice the dosage (1/4 tsp per day) for the first couple of days. However, she started licking her flank (not sure if she was allergic to mushrooms), so I cut down the dosage to 1/8 tsp per day. She is doing fine since then, and it's been 2 weeks. I have tried probiotics for my dog, and while it worked for her stool, it gave her incontinence(leak pee-even the vet doesn't understand why). This product made her stool better but did not interfere with the peeing mechanism, so I am very happy with it. I also mix her food with 'DOG GREENS- Organic and Wild Harvested Vitamin and Mineral Supplement for Dogs - Add to Home Made Dog Food, RAW Food or Kibble such as Wellness, Blue dog, Fromm, Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance , Solid Gold etc - No Hassle-30 Day Money Back Guarantee! 12 Oz' for vitamins lacking in home cooked meals and it has helped make her stool better as well. Organic Pet Superfood has a long expiration date (somewhere in 2018), and it will last a long time for a small dog.
