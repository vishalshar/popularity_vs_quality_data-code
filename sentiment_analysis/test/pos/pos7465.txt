Excellent product, but not when I first installed it in the cd player where it bounced up and down with every bump in the road. At first, I was disappointed. However, when I installed the Mountek nGroove  device vertically between the center radio console and the adjacent moulding, it holds my cellphone device quite steady even over bumps.See image. I used the large magnet attached directly to the back/outside of the cellphone case. The mount allows for plenty of tilting and rotating to get just the right angle for using as a GPS.
