I often keep a pencil on me.  I like to journal and sketch.  There are times when I can't keep a full size pencil and need something to throw in my pocket. One can't throw a regular pencil in their pants pocket. This is a good way to keep a  pencil in your  pocket since the tip goes into the "bullet" part when not writing.  The only drawback is that sometimes the eraser comes off and I have to fish around in my pocket for it.  The lead is similar to a #2 pencil so works okay for both writing and drawing.  I wish they made a similar sharpener.  There are replacement pencils and erasers should you need them.  Nice.
