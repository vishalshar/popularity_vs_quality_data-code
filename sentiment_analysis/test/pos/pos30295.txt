My 5 year old has been enjoying the OmieBox thus far. It's nice to have the container for hot food, which is the main thing that differentiates this box from other bento style boxes, and everything seems sturdy. I would love to see a larger version with room for a drink. Disposable juice/milk boxes are so wasteful (non recyclable, etc). So it would be great if the lunch box could have an attached drink bottle or could fit a kids water bottle. At school the kids are supposed to have everything in one bag/box including their beverage.
