This product is what I've been looking for.  In recent years, since the purchase of my house, I have become frustrated with the lackluster performance of home wifi.  It is 2016, and there is no excuse for the only way to fix your wifi is to restart the damn thing.  In the past two years I have tried 2 different $200+ routers that both promised increased coverage blah blah blah.  With both I was left with dead zones in the house, disconnected smart home devices, and blotchy Netflix streams.  I attempted to solve my issues with a couple of repeaters, and though it worked for the most part my smart devices could no longer "speak" to each other when connected to different repeaters.Enter Luma, the mesh network makes all the difference.  Since I've had Luma I have no dead zones in the house, my streaming is always HD, and all of my smart devices are smart again.  The setup was a bit lengthy (you have to do it three times if you get the three pack), but it was very simple since the companion app handles everything.  I would highly recommend this if you are frustrated like I was with the shortcomings of other wifi systems.NOTE FOR POWER USERS.  I'm a software engineer, and very much a power user, I have servers running on my home system, and use my network for development/testing.  If you are a power user you can't get rid of your old router just yet.  Luma is designed to be a simple consumer product, and with that simplicity comes the loss of port-forwarding and advance network routing.  With Luma it is plug an play.  So for me the solution to this was to daisy chain Luma to my existing router and use my existing router for complex routing needs. Now I have the best of both worlds my home is running on a separate subnet via Luma, and my dev boxes are running on their existing subnet with no issue.
