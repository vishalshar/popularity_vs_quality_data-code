I have given myself a good few months with this case before posting a review on it. I have to say that it met all my expectations and even exceeded others. It's more than substantial as protection for your phone as well as being very sleek and aesthetically appealing to hold. My one glaring complaint is with the buttons on the side being very flush making it difficult to press the volume rocker and power button. There are times I have to push so firmly I end up hitting both at the same time on accident or the button I didn't really want to push. The other minor issue is that the locking system requires there being a bump on the back of the case preventing the phone from lying flat on any surface. Not that that is really a big problem, but if you lay your phone on a table and like to try and text that way or anything it's a bit difficult. Minor annoyances of course.Where this case really shines is as a mounting system. The expense can get a bit high as you are purchasing all the accessories to go with the system separately, but I truly have not had experience with a mount for any cell phone I have ever had that has been better or easier to use. I have both the car mount and arm band which work great with the case. Once the phone is snapped into place it is secure and easily accessible.Don't allow the somewhat higher price point deter you as you will like this case and system for all your needs. Well worth the investment.
