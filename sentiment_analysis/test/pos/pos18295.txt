What I didn't realize prior to purchasing and installation is that you have to already have a deadbolt because you use the lock side of a conventional deadbolt. The August Smart Lock replaced the thumb latch side of the deadbolt. So I ran out, purchased a new deadbolt and then installed the lock(s) according to the instructions. Upon completion, I was able to download the Android app and set the lock up on my phone. However, I ran into difficulties when trying to set up my wife's iPhone. We inadvertently set up multiple users ids that overrode existing ids and just made a plain mess. I called customer support and they reset the lock and I was able to set up the apps and lock on both phones. Since then, we have had no issues.
