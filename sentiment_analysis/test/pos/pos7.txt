well..after waiting some time here to decide, I think that I am ready to write a review on this item. My wife suffers from pain from pretty much everywhere..from her back to here shoulder, to her neck, to nerve pain...and has been for years and years. She has been on the strongest does of the strongest wearable pain med that she can get, and it has been starting to get to the point that it was having limited beneficial effect. ..plus..we were worried about her dependency on it.So searching for another way, we found this...and ordered it because the company has stated that if it did not work after 60 days you could return it for full refund.The first two nights were not good...even though she followed all the directions and did all that she could, it actually made things worse. I am not sure if that was because we were so new to it, or what...but after that, it stated to shoe a noticeable effect. The first, was that she could sleep again at night for more than 45 minutes at a time. To date, the sleeping has settled in to around 4 hours a shot..which is a miracle for her.Then, the ultimate test came along in that we had to change medical insurance, and they would only cover the pain patches that were 15% weaker in strength. We had to wait for 3 days (going without pain meds at all for that time) until we could get those as well. Usually, she would be climbing the walls if she missed two hours on the patches..but she made it the three days, only looking a little worse for the wear on the third day...and never got to point that i have seen her in the past when off the pain meds for even a few hours.Now, she has reduced her pain meds by 15% so far, and feels better than she did on the full strength. If that is not a testament that it works, I don't know what it.I also do not get what others are saying about their customer service. We had one of the electrode pads come in with damaged or faulty gel on it. It fell apart in days instead of weeks. WE called, sent a photo, and the send us out two new electrode pads to replace the one...and we received it in three days.I offer my unbiased inspection, use, assessment and honest review as a loyal Amazon user who seeks to try new products and get the word out on the street as to what to expect..both good and bad. I take my obligation to offer a truthful evaluation of these products seriously and can be counted upon to issue a review that is both helpful and accurate.....
