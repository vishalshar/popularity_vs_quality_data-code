Wow, this thing is phenomenal!  MIDI, USB, and more all function flawlessly. The first unit I received was defective, but was promptly replaced with a unit that is good. There's no lag between devices with the puc+. And it will power your devices via USB.  Has allowed my pedal controller rig to go completely wireless. Why are you still reading this?  Go buy it!
