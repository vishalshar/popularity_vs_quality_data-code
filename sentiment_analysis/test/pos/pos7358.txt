Pretty good, although they tended to hold the moisture in after wearing them all day. Great deal for three pair, though! I'm used to wearing cotton socks, so, the moisture issue is no different than what I'm normally used to. However, since I'm looking for socks that keep my feet drier, I think the next no-show socks I buy will definitely be wool.
