Lost a star due to price. I found the grey version on amazon at a significantly reduced price $39.99 vs $59.99) and still cannot justify the cost of this product. That being said, I do enjoy the product. I did not need it, but I find myself carrying it around with me throughout the house and wrapping it around my carryon's extendable handle when I travel (which is frequent). For many business travelers this pillow will be embarrassingly bulky if you are more accustomed to conventional neck pillows. However, for red-eye and early morning flights or road travel where you want to get some actual sleep done, this pillow has lullabye-esque effects. The bamboo material is soft, cool to the surface, almost satiny (For those who travel wearing makeup you may want to consider a barrier cloth between your face and the pillow fabric). Once on the plane, however, this pillow fits all the nooks and crannies of a window seat (my preference) and allows for real deep sleep in a way that neck pillows rarely allow.Also think it's a great gift for students. Thinking back on grad school I only wish I would have had this pillow in my library survival kit.
