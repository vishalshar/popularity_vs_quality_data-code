=== UPDATE Number 1 ===Recent updates to the mobile app appear good. I can now see more of my consumption historyÂ… which is awesome! However, my Pryme has had some recent issues with recognizing my hydration throughout the day. It could just be my individual unit, but it's been going on for the past couple software updates. I've had to manually input most of my hydration which is a bummer.The timeline view on consumption is good, but I'd LOVE to see a calendar view with a blue Pryme dot on the date if I hit Pryme and the numeric value in mL/oz I consumed as an alternate view of the data.Because of my recent experiences with the Pryme not recognizing my hydration I'm leaving my review at four stars. I will update again once this is resolved.=== ORIGINAL REVIEW ===I was skeptical of this unit. I've been waiting for the Mark One Vessyl for a while but they haven't released it and so I thought I'd give the Pryme a go.I tend to drink an awful lot of tea, but not as much plain water. The Pryme Vessyl has certainly helped me stay hydrated these past two weeks.THE GOODHelps me stay hydrated and encourages me to drink plenty of water.Lets me look back in time to see my consumption habits.THE SADThe lid is an extremely tight fit and becomes difficult to remove. Mark One recommends sliding the cap back and lifting the cap to remove the lid, but the amount of force required sometimes pops the cap loose and I've become uncomfortable with that. As a result, I find I often just don't use the lid, which is unfortunate.The white color makes the Pryme Vessyl look modern and sleek, but it scuffs and discolors easily with regular use. Which is a bummer.I use my Pryme Vessyl while at home and at work. While I've never run the battery all the way down, I would like an extra charging pad to make sure of that. But Mark One doesn't sell the chargers separately. A lost revenue opportunity I think.I wish I could see weekly, monthly charts on my water consumption. Maybe even a calendar view which would show the days I hit Pryme, or was at Pryme for a target number of hours.
