In my mind reviews are either bad or good, this is a good one. Does it work? Yes, it does. Is it perfect, no but that would require a lot more engineering.  As others have mentioned it spins a lot slower that expected, but with a lot higher torque. In cleaning my wheels that have a ton of vertical space that torque turned out to be better than spin speed.  Top Tip: treat it like an electric toothbrush and let the tool do the work vs. traditional arm scrub/movement.  Cut my cleaning time by 2/3rds and effort by 7/10th, so a certain win in my book.  Cons: different heads would nice, but something DIYable
