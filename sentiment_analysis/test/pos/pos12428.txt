Bought as a case for my girlfriends new Iphone. Very roomy in the back srorage, but the compact mirror is meh. Still, she has dropped it a few time and the case is really made well. No screen protector, so make sure to grab one from Amazon or another source. She likes it, now she doesn't  have to carry a wallet or purse when she runs around town.
