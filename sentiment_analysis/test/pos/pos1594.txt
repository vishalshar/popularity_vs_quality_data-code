This really works well for my needs. I wish they made larger models for my larger rooms.  I've bought 2 so far because they work so well.  I just put the thing on automatic mode and it does its thing.  It detects how much dust is in the air and then turns itself up or down as needed.  Also lets you know when the filters need to be changed. Perfect.
