My main, and pretty much only, interest in this Posh Mobile Micro X S240 was as a Smart MP3 player.  If you shop around, as I have, good Smart MP3 Players can run around $40, and that is not even touching the Apple MP3 market or the fact those other big brands don't actually run a full Android OS.  So for the current fifty bucks, just in the Smart MP3 Player market alone, this little guy is highly competitive.  And believe me, I have tried the cheaper ones, running between $20 to $30 bucks, and they can be frustratingly bizarre in the setup, use, or just down right trash bin fodder.All in one fell swoop, this has replaced my old iPod Nano 6 Gen, which I use daily, and two other little MP3 players, each running around $30 and weren't used that much because a) I really preferred a touch screen, like on my iPod, and b) the menu navigation on one of them is super wonky.  With this little baby, I get the touch screen, my already intimate familiarity with Android KitKat, access to my Amazon Prime Music downloads (via WiFi), and my Rocket Player Pro media player from the Amazon Appstore.Interesting enough, even though it is KitKat 4.4.2, the general interface is Lollipop 5.0, so guessing it is running one of those Lollipop shells.Yes, typing on that tiny keyboard can be teeth gritting, and I spent a half hour creating my various playlists, wishing I still had a Bluetooth keyboard on hand.  Still, for my purposes, it's not something I have to deal with regularly.  After manually transferring my already downloaded music from my PC to a Silicon Power 32GB card, installing my media apps, and setting everything up, I am more than pleased to finally shuffle off my iPod Nano and others off to friends and family.No, it apparently does not have OTG capability, but I can directly access the phone's memory via my PC through a USB cable for easy music transfers, as well as charging.  No need for iTunes, just drag and drop from my Amazon Music folders.  As for the out-of-the-box storage memory:OS Storage - 1.48GBPhone Storage - 2.52GB / 2.39GB FreeSD Storage - up to 32GB Micro SD cardDoes offer an option with every download to put the application on either SD or Phone memory.Battery life can be horrible depending on what one is doing and what continuously run utilities are being used - for me, battery longevity is far better than my aging iPod's battery life, and quite good as a "smart MP3 player".  Battery charging draw is really low for such a thing, about 0.31Ah (310 milliamps per hour), so no problem getting a full charge rate even off a personal computer's USB port, and getting a full charge takes perhaps 2 hours.I sort of get the repeated "USB charging port too deep" complaints. Every single one of mine fit, yet if I pick up and fiddle with the phone while charging, the micro head does like to pop out.  If left alone, though, they are fine.Zero issues with the AUX port playback, even while charging.  Does have Bluetooth, which seems to work a whole lot better than a Que 5.5" I had a year or so ago, definitely better than most LG smartphones I have worked with.Back is rounded and smooth.  I put some GT-5000 grip tape to give it texture, as well as to cover up the metal disc I stuck there to stick on my magnetic dash mount.  Front side edges are also rounded, not enough to give a protective bevel, but enough so finger swiping doesn't have any skin irritating angles to run across.All in all, supremely happy with this new little buddy of mine as a MP3/Media player, which also happens to give me Emergency Services calls (as required here in the US), and who knows... perhaps I'll throw a prepaid GSM card in there one day.  :)-Product provided for free or discounted price for consumer-end evaluation and review.Before acceptance, I read the product page like any consumer, and base my own user reactions in reference to personal expectations on how it may apply to my intended application.
