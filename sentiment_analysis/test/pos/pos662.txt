This product met my exact needs.  I am fair skinned with hard to see lashes and find mascaras make my lashes dry and brittle- and was looking for a product to darken my lashes while keeping them healthy- and this product does that perfectly.  It is comfortable on my eyes all day and is easy to take off at night.  This is a great everyday lash tint- I would not suggest it for a dramatic eyelash look and it does take longer than mascara to dry but is well worth the wait!!
