I just received my feed and go pet feeder a couple days ago and I can say I already love it!  My cat just recently started a diet which requires a strict feeding multiple times a day.  It is very hard to ensure that I am home during these times and going away on a weekend was completely out of the question.  Until now!  Thankfully this feeder has completely taken away any stress or inconvenience that came from having to do multiple feedings a day.The instructions were so easy to understand that setting this up was a breeze.  All of the features are exactly what I have been wanting!  It is so great to be able to look at the webcam when I am not around just to ensure that my cat is actually eating and getting the food.  The notifications after a feeding occurs to my email/text are very reassuring as well.  I love being able to use the recording because it is something that is familiar to my cat and he just comes running when he hears it!  The customer service from this store when ordering was beyond great.  It is so rare to find a company that really cares about their customers and I can say from experience that this company really does.  I was really impressed by the promptness and kindness I received when emailing the company about the product.I also have thought of a couple suggestions that might be useful for any upcoming updates to the product!- Since the webcam shows just the top of the current food portion, I have decided to write little numbers from 1-6 in a paint marker so that I am able to see in the webcam which number it is currently feeding.  It just gives a little extra peace of mind to ensure that the notification didn't send to my email/text by mistake without the dish actually rotating to the new food.- Another helpful addition would be to state in the instructions which way the dish rotates.  Although this is easy to figure out after the first use, my cat has different portions during the day so I wasn't sure for my first time dishing it out which way it was going to rotate.I am a huge fan of this product so just wanted to share these ideas in case other people would find them helpful.Thank you for this great product; my cat and I absolutely LOVE it!!  Definitely recommend to any and all pet owners!!!UPDATE: I am devastated but after 2 years, my feed and go has broke and I have realized that the warranty only lasts for a year. The motor seems broken where it will move the tray to have half of 2 portions showing in the area to eat out of instead of just 1.  Hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else but paying $250 for something that only lasts 2 years is a shame. Especially on a product that me and my cat have become so dependent on :(UPDATE ON UPDATE: I emailed the company to find out if they had any suggestions.  They gave me 2 options of things to try before they sent me out a new gear box for my feeder.  I was/am so impressed by the customer service, it is honestly so hard to find these days!!
