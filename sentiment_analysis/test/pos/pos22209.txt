After reading some of the reviews, I was a little hesitant and with the web site not showing my Liftmaster openers as compatible I decided to contact the company and explained that my openers worked fine with my adding additional "door bell" type push buttons.  They responded within hours and said if the system works with the additional push buttons, it should work fine, and if not I could return it for a full refund.  So I ordered one and it works GREAT.  The installation was very simple, the connection to my network was a breeze, and through the IFTTT protocol, integrated with my Homeseer system.  I am quite delighted with all that.  If I'm away, I get alerts that a garage door was opened.  Also there were times when I couldn't remember if I closed the door after leaving.  The only recourse was to drive back and check.  Now if that happened, I simply use my smartphone to check and close the door if it was open!  Likewise, if I'm away and want to give access to someone it's a simple matter to open/close the door.  WOW, neat...
