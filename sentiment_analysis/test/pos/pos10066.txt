I was watching a tutorial online on how to keep my make-up brushes in beautiful condition. And these really work. They look tiny and that they might not stretch alot but they do! Fits everything from an eyeshadow brush to a fluffy kabuki. These keep your brushes from fraying out but allow it to dry too. I also use it to keep my brushes impact while I bring it around. I love how I can bring my brushes back and forth from school and home and the brushes are awesome.
