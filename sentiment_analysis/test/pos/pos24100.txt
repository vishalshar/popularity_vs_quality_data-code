I purchased this product primarily as a streaming devive but find it also has many other uses not found in other stand alone devices due to its access to Google Play store. I set it up with a  Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse and conected it to my big screen tv with the included HDMI cable. I find it to be a little slower than my android smart phone but thats ok for my kind of usage and I like the fact that I can use a full size keyboard for input.
