I read about sugru on lifehacker, and what I noticed was its use in repairing a dishwasher rack (how's about that for first-world problems?!). The cost of replacing the rack is a ridiculous $160 (thanks for that, Kenmore) so I tried this. Sugru works great, and is kind of fun.Plan ahead so that you leave a full 24 hours on whatever item to cure and dry completely. I made my repair a month ago, and it was a total win. I even bridged a missing chunk of the rack with a random piece of metal, securing it at both ends with sugru, and it holds strong.
