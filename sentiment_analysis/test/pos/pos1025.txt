This is such beautiful piece of jewelry, I love wearing it.  I didn't realize when I bought it that you have to have a smart phone, and you have to have it on you in order for it to sync and alert your emergency contact people.  I am VERY SAD that cuff went out of business.  Does anyone know why they closed down?  I really thought they had a great thing going...
