I really like this deodorant. I have tried a lot of the natural deodorants and this one is the one I have found to work the best. I like the texture of this brand and the scents available. On the brand's website you can get all of the scents in trial size to try them out.Here's what I've learned from my trials of natural deodorant:The ones with baking soda fight odor the best. This is also the ingredient that most people seem sensitive to if they are sensitive to any of the ingredients. It could also be the essential oils.I've never taken care of my armpits before. It never occurred to me that I needed to. Now I moisturize daily before applying deodorant. Shaving your armpits really irritates them especially if you haven't been taking care of your armpit skin.If you get the red rashes/"burns", stop using this product and MOISTURIZE your pits until it completely goes away. I use coconut oil (now daily). It has some antibacterial properties and skin loves it. Try it again after you've been moisturizing. This is what I did and it greatly reduced the occurrence of the rash.You are more likely to get these rashes after you shave. I've cut back on shaving a little and it's helped. If you've seen the reviews with pictures of the rashes you will see that most (not all) are shaved armpits.If you keep getting the rashes, try a different product- a one without baking soda- and see if you still get them. Like I said, I've found the baking soda ones to work the best against odor. But keep moisturizing.You will sweat WAY more using natural deodorant. No matter what the product says. It's not antiperspirant.Most brands make a "sensitive" version. Try that one if you have reactions to the full strength version. But keep moisturizing your armpits.Since I've switched to natural deodorant and moisturizing my pits I've noticed that my natural odor is not as strong as when I was using Dove, Secret etc.Bottom line: Keep trying different brands/formulations until you find one you like and don't go back to standard deodorant. :)
