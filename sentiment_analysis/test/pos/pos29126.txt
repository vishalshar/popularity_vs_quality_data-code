Hi everyone! I want to tell my personal experience with the Leaf from that I got, cause I find very helpful reviews, so this is mine:I've been using my leaf for a month and a half now and I am happy with it. At first I bought it because I was wondering how much do I move in a normal day, without doing sports without having to wear a plastic ugly thing. And it works very good!  I can always wear it and I think is genius the clip thing! Its so useful when you just want a change.I can check after going to work how was my walk home and it tells it pretty precisely. With the app (very easy to use) you can set how much do you want to move a day, and it can be set without having to check on the computer or whatever :) that, I think is what I like the most .  For the sleeping sensor, it tracks pretty accurate when im actually sleeping and when I'm just laying in my bed. Some times it gets confused but mostly its right. As Im kind of a lazy person, I used to wear just rings earrings and a couple of bracelets that I never take off, even in showers. Although the leaf is not waterproof, I got used pretty fast to taking it away for the shower! I guess that I would rather have such a nice design waterproof, or maybe with protective case, so I don't have to unwear it, but it's ok. I usually wear it as a necklace, but for some days, that I prefer just to wear it as a waist clip or clipped on my t-shirt and I'm happy that I it doesn't make me allergic. At first I was worried about the skin allergies as I have a sensitive skin (I have to buy everything anti allergic earrings, creams and so on) and the leaf doesn't give me any skin problem.When I go to the gym, although that I know it can stand a little sweat, sometimes I get scared that its going to break because of the sweat, but it has survived well so far :)
