These are amazing! I was really quite skeptical that these would be worthwhile because they are pricey when you have a ton of brushes to wash and maintain! But after using them on my high end brushes that I've had for a year, I have to say these are worth every penny. Instead of drying and fluffing out, my brushes looked absolutely brand new again! It's incredible. I'm absolutely addicted. I've purchased 3 more in various sizes and won't wash my brushes without them!
