I bought one one of these as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend despite the negative reviews.  She is notorious for destroying and buying a new lightning cable every month.  She has now had this one without any problems for 3 months!  Normally she has issues with the cable fraying but not with these.  It gets lots of looks when she brings it around with her, but hey it beats having to buy a new cable every month.  Those complaining about the lightning connection breaking off is silly.  This is the most fragile part of any lightning cable you buy because of it being so thin.  Just be gentle with it and don't bend it while in your device.
