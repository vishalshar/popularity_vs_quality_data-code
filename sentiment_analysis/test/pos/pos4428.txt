I have 2 of my own LiFX 1000s and have gifted 1 to a friend and can say that I am very satisfied. Have tried a few other "smart-bulbs" that range in lumens and price, but even though these do have a high price tag, I was especially impressed with the output of the color 1000s right rom the start. They are well constructed and their many colors offer a very intimate aura to spice up any area.Also, I want to note that my experience contacting LiFX customer service was nothing short of professional. They handled my issue (had a legitimate malfunction with a bulb) via email promptly, and in less than a week, I had a new replacement bulb sent out to me at no charge without any hassle.  As a very satisfied owner, I will be buying more of these for sure.Cheers
