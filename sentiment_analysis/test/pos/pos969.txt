I've been waiting for an affordable thermal camera for decades. I now have one. I found this one accidentally and am glad that I did. This fits my Moto G and works great. Doesn't work on my RazrM.  I have already used it to determine where in my attic the insulation is missing/inadequate.I also see where my windows could use adjustment to stop air leaks. Oh and on a lark, I scanned my friends face to confirm her claim that her nose is cold, but not the rest of her face - yup. Many more interesting uses for this coming.
