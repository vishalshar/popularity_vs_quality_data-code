This is awesome. Not only can I slide key rings on or off as I like (house keys on one ring, car keys on another) but it's also a charging cord!!I have used it in my car and my office. The nature of this cord is that it is flexible but sturdy. So, for the car, it doesn't just lay there, you can kind of position it in a way so it's not taking up a drink holder or something.For the office, I plugged it into a pc that was a little too tall for the phone to lay on top. I bent the cord and it held the phone at an angle where it rested the edge of the phone on top of the pc tower and held it there without falling off. It was so cool.Works with my iPhone 6s and charges quickly. Also fits in otterbox.
