Fantastic wheel brush for removing brake dust and dirt.  I find most useful using Brush Hero for first pass to remove the bulk of the brake dust from each wheel.  I then make second pass using a soapy sponge brush for detailing and then a final 3rd pass with the Brush Hero to wipe down the remaining soapy residue.  Works great!  Highly recommended!!!
