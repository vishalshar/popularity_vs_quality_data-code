The real deal. Third solar lantern I've purchased I this price range. The others dimmed in comparison, by a large margin. Amazing how when you're trying to help the developing world versus just selling to affluent campers, your product actually delivers. I've done multiple tests at home based on a day of Minnesota spring sun and it burned for many hours. It actually surprised me by going more than six hours on high but I figured out it switches from high to low when the battery gets low. Smart feature.
