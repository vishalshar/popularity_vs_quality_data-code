I have a stand of banana plants in my backyard that produce all year long. I let them get slightly overripe, then mash them into this mix. I also throw in a handful of candied walnuts and Craisins. I'm becoming famous (well, in my family) for Nana's Homemade Banana Bread. I don't mention that it's a mix, or reveal how easy it is to make. (You don't even have to add eggs!) Because I like a slightly dryer bread that doesn't fall apart in the center, I bake this in two separate loaf pans. Each loaf turns out about 3 inches tall, and slices perfectly.
