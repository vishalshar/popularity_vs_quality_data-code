Great product! I just wanted a way to check in on my puppy while she was home alone and this is perfect. At first she was scared not knowing where the voice was coming from but once she realized that this thing gives treats, she's all good. It would be nice if I could have the video on my computer streaming rather than just an app on my phone that times out but for the price and what it can do, it's great. Have recommended and will recommend.
