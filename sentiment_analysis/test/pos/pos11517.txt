It truly does what it promises. I wear this under nothing but a thin white t-shirt, and it STILL can't be seen easily! I haven't had a single sweat stain since purchasing.My only complaint is that even the smallest size is not quite suitable for thinner men. It seems more fitting for a smaller, but not "skinny" wearer.Other than that though, I couldn't recommend this shirt more to anyone who struggles with finding good undershirts.
