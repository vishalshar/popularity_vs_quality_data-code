Great phone so far.Pluses:-nice screen-fairly clean android-Comes with great accessories (the screen protector is JUST the size of the screen and doesn't cover the whole face, though)Minuses:-I got the gold... it is a pretty pink-looking gold.  My wife asked why I had a pink phone.  I don't really care, but just so others are aware.-I was under the impression from another review that it had touch sensitive buttons on the bottom panel.  Not the case.  The buttons are on the screen.  I was hoping that I would get the extra screen real estate from the buttons.  Oh well.  Still a beauty.I will update as I use it more!Update: Going to increase to 5 stars.  It has performed perfectly for the first couple of days. The battery lasts well beyond all day. I actively use it for several hours during the day and still have 50% when I go to sleep. The screen is gorgeous with excellent auto brightness that you can modify. I rooted the phone with kingroot and was able to adjust the DPI from 480 to 400 which decrease the size of the menu buttons and gave me some more screen space to help address my misimpression that the menu buttons were not on the screen.  GPS was excellent. Speaker is good. Phone calls were flawless. Skype was excellent. And the camera is Leaps and Bounds beyond my past phone which was the iRulu V3. You can actually adjust the exposure.  I emailed Posh support and receive their response right away when I asked for an extra case so that I can try and modify it to have a face cover made out of PU. If I am successful, I will post some pictures.Update 2: Still love it.  I used greenpower on all of my phones and on my last one I would end up at 15% battery after a 15 hour night shift with heavy use.  This baby is sitting at 65% with the same settings.  Getting lots of compliments on it, as well, given what appears to be solid build quality.
