I like this pillow thingy quite a bit - I put it in a really yucky smelly old Pilot, that my husband uses for hiking. It smells like a "man cave" because it usually has his hiking clothes and manly smell about it. I tried shampooing the car carpets to get the smell out but to no avail. I bought this because it's supposed to last a year. So I thought, well 30.00 bucks for a refresher that lasts a year is worth it, right? When I first got it I decided to slide it under the car seat, because the website says you don't have to hang it up - it will work anywhere in the car you place it. The website said to let it sit in the sun for a bit before you first use it.....but I didn't do that. I just kind of twisted it a little to "activate" the charcoal and it worked just fine. The smelly car is not 100% odor free, but this took out 90% of the stale manly odor in the car.
