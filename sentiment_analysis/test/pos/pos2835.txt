I was a bit worried at first by some of the negative reviews.  However, I have one of DLink's cloud cameras and thought it worked well so decided to give this smart plug a try.  I also have 2 Wemos so have a point of comparison as well.  It's a decent looking device smaller than the original Wemo smart plug but larger than the Insight.  Setup was a lot easier with the DLink than the Wemo plugs.  The Wemos seemed to struggle a bit with finding the router whereas the DLink found it almost immediately (distance is about the same).  DLink also allows you to scan in the QR code to configure the device (I had to punch in everything with the Wemos).  The apps that control the device (from iOS perspective) are comparable and more or less easy to figure out and use though I'd say the DLink one is slightly nicer.  Response time of devices to both apps were about the same.  The DLink beats out the Wemo in price and all and all happy with the purchase.
