The first time I opened my Julep box, I didn't know what to think about this squishy egg-shaped, slightly wet sponge. I was like what the heck I'll give it a whirl. It came in my box. Though I did have to google it to find out what do I do with this??? After using it for about a month, I started getting all types of compliments on my skin! I've never had a single compliment on my skin. I mean, I felt like my skin was starting to look more hydrated but you know it could've just been in my head. Even the ladies at the beauty counter now tell me how wonderful my skin looks. Buy this, and love it, and cherish it and it will love you back!
