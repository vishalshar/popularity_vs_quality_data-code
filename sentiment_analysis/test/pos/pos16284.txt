I got the clear case and the Jet Black on my iPhone 7 Plus looks amazing through the case. However just like the Jet Black, it's also a finger print magnet which should be obvious since it's clear.  The magnet on the case is powerful and you'll feel confident placing it on the outside of your car without the fear of it falling.  The case is beautiful, slim and compliments the phone.  In regards to actual protection I'd would say it would protect the phone on a major drop but only once.
