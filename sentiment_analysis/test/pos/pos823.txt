Love these! What a great concept! My makeup brushes weren't cheap. This is worth every penny for my brushes. Keeps them in great shape, no frayed hairs. Looks like I just got them! I highly recommend these simple things for keeping your brushes in great shape! (They also work great on my paint brushes!!!)
