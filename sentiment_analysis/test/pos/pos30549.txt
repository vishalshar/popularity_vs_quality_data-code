I purchased the TRAKK ARMOR Smart App Enabled Bluetooth LED Light Outdoor Universal Backpack for Cycling/Hiking/Climbing/Running for my 8 year old son to make him more excited about having a backpack. He squealed for joy when this arrived, and I really dig it, also! It will be very useful for school, but I do not know how well it will hold up to the elements while hiking and long distance cycling. It would likely be fine if you are just using it when you go to school, etc.The front is a hard shell type material that maintains its shape, unlike ordinary backpacks. It includes the light on the front. When you unzip that compartment, you will see the usb to attach to a battery pack for the light. The battery pack is not included, and for the price, one really should be included. Luckily, we had several. Also, there is room for storage, tho no additional pockets.The next section is nice and big. It has a mesh zippered pocket that is for headphone storage and another larger pocket behind it. It has other storage for keeping multiple small items in order, and it has Velcro that keeps it assembled. But, you can unhook it and lay it open flat, which is handy. There is another bit in the bottom with Velcro, but there are no instructions explaining what it is for, and I honestly cannot figure it out myself.The last zippered section has a spot for a tablet and laptop and is padded. It also has room for more storage. There is another usb in this compartment, and I assume that is so you can use the usb on the outside of the backpack to plug it in and charge the items inside without taking them out of the backpack.My son was very happy to see that he could connect the backpack with clasps in the front so that it will not slide off of his arms or back. He also like that the straps are nicely padded.As for the light, you have to download an app to get the light to work. I had to download a scanner app to scan the code for the app, because I was unable to find it by just searching the name they gave us. It accesses your music library, and the lights will change randomly with the music. You can also just run the light without music. You can select the colors and how you want it to change with the app. We are really going to have to play with it to figure it out complete, as there were no instructions on how to work it. Though, we got the basics.I did not like that there were no zipper pockets on the outside for easy access, but that is a small complaint overall. It is an awesome and fun backpack, and the light will definitely provide safer travels!
