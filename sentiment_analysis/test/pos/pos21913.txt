I just got my 3Doodler a few days ago and it's been a blast to play with.  It takes a little bit of time to understand how to use it best, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty addictive.  I like making and playing around with geometric shapes - helps with conceptual thinking.  You can also use it to make random useful things - I needed a zip tie to close a bag of popcorn and couldn't find one so just decided to make one!
