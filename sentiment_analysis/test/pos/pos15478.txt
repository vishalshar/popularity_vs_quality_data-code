We've been using the Whistle Pet Tracker on both of our border collies for several months.  We initially purchased one for a blind BC who we wanted extra protection for, just in case he leaves the yard.  It worked so well with Ivan, that we bought one more for a seeing BC, Natty.  I run with each dog four times a week, so we're able to test the devices often, and without fail the tracker activates and alerts us that the dogs are beyond their "zone" every time I take them out.  It does take about a quarter mile to activate, locate and send a notification to our cellphones.  Once it locates the dog it will track and plot his location, note the cellphone screen capture.  We live in a remote area of northern California, sometimes we leave the animals in the care of a house sitter, and being able to check on the location of the dogs, if they are in their "zone" while we are away is very comforting.  These devices work great for us, the batteries stay strong even with a lot of use, and it gives us reassurance that our dogs are where they are supposed to be when we're away.
