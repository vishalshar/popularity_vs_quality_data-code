I've only been using this for a few days, but it is amazing.  I've been using natural shampoo and conditioner for years and have tried pretty much every brand out there.  This stuff takes the cake!  The smell is nice and not overwhelming, and the minty tingle wakes me up in the morning.  My scalp and hair feel healthy and soft and I couldn't be happier.  The price is also a plus!  Please never stop making this product!
