love this cute little cup! the only improvement would be that I wish it had handles, but all in all it is very cute and baby loves to drink out of it! (and throw it on the ground-- which it does stand up pretty well to being thrown down quite a lot, but we did break one cup--but they are easily replaced if you go to their website and they are a Michigan company which I am glad to support!)
