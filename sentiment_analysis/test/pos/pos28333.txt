My husband and I gave both of our mothers one of these stylus pencils for Christmas and they mainly use it for coloring on their iPads.Less than 90 days later, they have both told us MULTIPLE times how much they love it and how relaxing they find being able to doodle/color/draw on their tablets. One of the moms has already replaced the tips because she has used it so much.So, basically, this relatively inexpensive, small gift won Christmas for us and continues to hold up after LOTS of use by the two people using it.
