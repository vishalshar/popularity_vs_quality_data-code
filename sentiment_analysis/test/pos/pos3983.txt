I am so grateful for this product and the helpful reviews posted by others. To pay it forward, I describe my experience in detail below starting with a few quick tips: 1. Place potty pads under the grass to help reduce the amount of urine that pools in the disposable container. Change pads daily. 2. Line the disposable container with plastic wrap or ziplocks. Its much easier to clean! 3. Amazon couldn't ship the absorbing powder (pee pod wee sponge) to Alaska so another review suggested using kitty litter. It works great and eliminates odor.My story: I have a 10 year old minature schnauzer who has trouble holding her urine for more than a few hours. Working as a nurse, I was sometimes gone for 13-15 hours which meant I came home to messes every night! I live in Alaska so a doggy door just isn't practical. I purchased the medium size Pet Loo and it is the perfect size for my 12 lbs dog; I wouldn't recommend anything smaller unless your dog is really tiny. To train her, I placed the Pet Loo outside and put on her leash as if we were going for a walk. Just as she squatted to potty, I picked her up and placed her on the faux grass. It took a few minutes of confused "dancing" around the Pet Loo, but eventually she went potty on grass and was rewarded with many praises and treats. I then brought the Pet Loo inside so she'd get used to it. The next day before leaving for work I segregated a section of the living room with a baby gate, put down her dog bed with the Pet Loo near by. I checked immediately upon getting home and amazingly she'd used the Pet Loo several times! She has consistently used it every day since and can now free roam the house when I'm gone. I could not be more pleased!
