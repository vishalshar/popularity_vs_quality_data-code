I can't tell you how awesome it is to not have my shower curtain liner blowing in and sticking to me when I shower. I couldn't take it anymore, so I ordered these as a last resort before ripping the curtain down and putting glass doors in. These work. They aren't perfect, because my curtain still moves a little, but it is SO much better, and now I don't have to put in shower doors! Saved me money, time and my sanity!
