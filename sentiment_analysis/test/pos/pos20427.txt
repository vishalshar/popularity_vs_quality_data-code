The camera is pretty legit! There's some lag associated with the pet and laser interaction, but I suppose that is to be expected given the long distance nature of the communication. I wanted to see if my family from Russia would be able to see my dog using the cam, perhaps through a web browser portal or chrome based app. But no go. It's pretty much app based and there doesn't appear to be a lot of flexibility with that at the moment, or at least that I've been able to find.Always room to grow!
