Pretty slick.  It's essentially an 8GB thumb drive with on a cool bracelet.  The bracelet really is the cool part.  As mentioned, the LED display can be programed to display current time, date, animation, messages, etc.  At least 5, possibly 8 different items?  They are accessed with a press of a button.  Nothing ground breaking but very slick and well done.  The bracelet is very solid and well made.  Not flimsy at all, and rather stylish.  And only a true Minecraft fan would recognize it as a Minecraft accessory, which is probably what they were going for.I am sure the bracelet could be used for different reasons and/or applications.My 14 year old thought it was very cool.
