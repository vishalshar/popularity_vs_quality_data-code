TrackR Bravo is a wonderful product. Just one TrackR finder helps me find the TWO things I lose the most, my car keys or my iPhone. By using the power of Bluetooth along with its easy phone app, this coin-sized tracking device, you can use make the TrackR ring to find whatever its attached to ( like my car keys ) , or use the same TrackR to make your cell phone ring if you misplaced it. TrackR also alerts me when my car keys go out of the range of my iPhone. I found the TrackR have the normal behavior of any Bluetooth device except it seems to have much better range for maintaining the Bluetooth signal than other Bluetooth things. I'm happy to say my iPhones battery power has not been negatively burdened by TrackR.  So this TrackR device is great for most anybody who loses stuff.  I tried TrackR because my spouse was getting tired of helping me hunt for my iPhone or car keys over & over.  I purchased TrackR using Amazon Prime and my TrackR arrived in less than 24-Hours! Hooray for Amazon Prime! After seeing TrackR in action, its problem curing is only limited by your imagination.  Im so happy that with the Holidays coming, I will be purchasing more TrackR Bravos to give as gifts.
