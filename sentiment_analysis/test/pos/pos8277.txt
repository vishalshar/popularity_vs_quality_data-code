Great phone but I hate the physical buttons.  The happier feedback I get from the phone when touching the home,  back,  and recent apps button is week as hell.  I would recommend this phone to anyone because of it's really crisp screen,  how fast the phone is,  and just overall just using the phone on a daily basis was better than any phone I've ever used.
