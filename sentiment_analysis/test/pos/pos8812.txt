Those bands works wonderful.My partner has problem to tie his shoes properly, a way that you might think there has to be some kind of disability there for someone to NOT be able to tie their shoelaces. So whenever we need to go out or go for a jogging, you would see him struggling with the shoelaces while my face needed to turn to the other side simply couldn't bear to see what was happening. So, to make long story short, he is happy and I'm happy because of those elastic bands.The installation of the bands are very simple, if you know how to install your shoelaces, you know how to install them. When I firstly installed those bands, I had some concern for whether those bands will be holding up properly to go through a jogging session. Experiences to share with you is, don't worry about that, we have done more than three jogging session, in each session, more than 10kms even with hard pouring days, no problem at all.So, best solution for those who really have problem to tie up their shoes or couldn't bother to do that. This is the right production for you.
