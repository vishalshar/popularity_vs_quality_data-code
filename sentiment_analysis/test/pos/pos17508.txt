Great Spool! So far no snags.Great diameter consistency, +/- 0.02 accuracy, most of the rolls are either 1.75 or 1.73mm.I didn't really find the color that attractive, It's slightly transparent on thin layers giving it a yellow hue. But this is just probably me nitpicking.The purity is good, no nightmare black particles found from some other popular pla over here.Overall recommended!
