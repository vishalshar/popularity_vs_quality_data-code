It is quite pricey, but I'm happy with the case.  I love the aluminum feel.  It gives a nice weight to the phone too.  I haven't dropped the phone or anything, but I'm confident that when I do it'll give the phone some protection.  I did have to contact the manufacturer and get the newer version of the liner and it's WAY better.  I'm not sure how else you could order one and ensure you get the better lining, but it is a night and day difference.  So if you get this and the buttons are hard to press, reach out to rokform and ask for a replacement.
