The Netatmo unit works very well, and seems to be accurate. The app is well designed for the iPhone and iPad; the user interface adapts to a landscape or portrait view on the iPhone, where the landscape view shows dynamic graphs over time of the various measurements. The iPad app interface provides a more comprehensive view, similar to the Web interface. Setup with your home WiFi network is easily done, with step-by-step guidance when you install the app. You can tell that the Netatmo folks are serious about making this product a success. For example, they have apps for Windows Phone and Android phones, as well as the iDevices -- plus a browser-based interface.After setup, it took 10 or 15 minutes to start to get readings from the outside sensor. I tried to trigger an alarm, as suggested, by exhaling onto the indoor sensor -- to raise the humidity and CO2 levels. The alarm did go to my iPhone, but later the CO2 level dropped to 0. I suspected that the sensor tried the auto-calibration of CO2 level while I had it raised to a warning level, and that messed it up. So I opened the doors and windows to get fresh air in and did a manual calibration (simple, as described in the device info), and that fixed the problem. The reading is now 400 ppm, as it "should" be.I've messed around with various weather instruments for over 45 years, including teaching meteorology many years ago. It is a delight to have such a capable instrument to record weather data, with such easy access to the data, at such a relatively modest price. Devices to get more accurate and more complete weather data recordings would be 5 to 10 times the cost (and more!). The "crowd-sourced" weather data plotted on a map is a fun addition. I'll be adding the rain gauge soon.Another bonus for techies is the software development kit (SDK). Want to use the public or private Netatmo data in a different way? -- you can write your own app for that, maybe even sell it. For a simpler approach, you can also download text data files for your device and massage them in an Excel or Numbers spreadsheet. More to the point for most people, the fact that the Netatmo has an SDK means that you have a growing collection of apps for this weather station.The installation instructions are diagrams only, sometimes a little cryptic, but that's a very minor quibble. You can install the outside sensor either on a wall with the included hardware, or on a post with the included Velcro strap, but in either case, the unit must be shielded from direct sun and rain. Looking through their product information on the Web helped. Overall, this is truly a 5-star product.
