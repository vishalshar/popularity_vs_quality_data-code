I'm not a big fan of most mascaras available, but the Natural Lash Builder Tint and Conditioner is a really good product for those women who want their lashes to look dark and natural.  There is absolutely no clumping or build-up with this product.  I haven't noticed any smudging and no irritation.  So glad I went on Amazon and found a product that's exactly what I wanted for my lashes.
