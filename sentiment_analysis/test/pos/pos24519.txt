I love this bag! Very high quality,  no plastic pieces,  all metal.  Holds a lot of stuff.  The only downside that I will mention,  and I only say this because it was in some one else's review and I agree,  is that there are too many pockets.  I know, sounds like a stupid problem,  right? But when the front is almost identical to the back, I am constantly going back and forth when wearing it to remember which side I put a particular item. But besides that,  it's amazing and I recommend it.  I have gotten multiple compliments.  I don't have kids but I can imagine this would be great as a baby bag too.
