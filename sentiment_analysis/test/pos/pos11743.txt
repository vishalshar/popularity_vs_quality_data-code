Worked perfectly & easy set up. The only issue is that it doesn't work with a 5.0 connection. I tried over & over to get it to connect and it kept saying it couldn't (and it wasn't readily apparent what the problem was). Then I tried my 2.4 connection, and it connected. I bought 2, and the 2nd one set up took about 3 minutes. Used the Wink app. Connected to Alexa Echo.I can't believe how cheap this thing is! All other Smart plugs are at least $35.
