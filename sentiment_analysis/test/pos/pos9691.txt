Got this for my 10 year old son for Christmas and he loves it now that he downloaded the app on my cell phone. Without the app it was cute but not as fun as he couldn't do as much.  Once he downloaded the app, and connected the Mip to my iPhone it opened up a whole new world- he can dance, make funny noises, you can drive him around and take control of him (so you don't have to use had signs) he even toots (which my kids thought was hilarious..) he can bring you thinks, and if you have two Mips they can box each other. We tried to download the Mip app on the our kindle fire as well, but it seems to work better with the iPhone. With the app, it's probably my sons favorite Christmas gift and now his 8 year old sister wants one too :)
