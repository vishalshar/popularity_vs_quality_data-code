Hands down the best, grain free, refined sugar free mix on the market!To say that it is challenging to find ANY mixes that have safe ingredients for some of us is an understatement. This mix hits the mark on SO many levels!!!It felt so "normal" to open up a mix and make pancakes and waffles, just like the rest of the world.As an aside, when making the waffles I messed up the mix and put in more oil then necessary. However, I was able to mix some of the dry mixture into it (without adding any more eggs since I figured the oil had taken up some of the liquid the egg would have provided. Turned out great!I love this mix so much that I ended up ordering a pack, just so I wouldn't run out again!
