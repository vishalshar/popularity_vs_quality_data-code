So far this works flawlessly. I did a full sprinkler system check up after I installed it.  All I had to do was walk to each head and turn them on with the app.  This helped me find a major leak on one of my heads which has probably been leaking for years.  So far I haven't used the schedule. I just water when I see that the plants and grass are dry. Super easy. Definitely would recommend.
