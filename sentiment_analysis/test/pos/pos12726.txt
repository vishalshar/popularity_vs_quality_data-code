I have the Smart Lock, Connect and now the Keypad.  Well worth it and easy to use.  Highly recommend it.  In the past I didn't use the auto lock function of the lock since I didn't want to run the risk of walking out and getting locked out of my house.  Now I have the lock set to auto lock after a few min.  And if I am outside and want to get back in and I don't have my phone or keys on me I just use the keypad.  Nice and easy.
