These bulbs are fantastic. They are easily pairable with your wi-fi, easily controllable by your phone, and look great. The app is a growing work in progress that the Lifx team is constantly updating, so any issues with it are quickly fixed by the very attentive Lifx team. Sometimes, bulbs drop in and out of connection to the app, but it's not a make or break. I'd put these bulbs in every socket in my house if the price were a bit lower, which I'm sure will happen with time. I've recommended them to friends, who have now bought seven, four, and three respectively. We definitely dig 'em.
