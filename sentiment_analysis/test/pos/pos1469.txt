Another fun toy to play with.I had to do a search to find the application, but it installed easily and works fine.BEWARE! If your phone has an Otterbox protecting it, you will need the extension cable that is available on the Amazon web page for the SeekIR. I made the mistake of not purchasing it as I got the SeekIR, so it took me a week extra to get going (I also bought the wrong cable, to start with, SIGH!).Other than those, I love it.
