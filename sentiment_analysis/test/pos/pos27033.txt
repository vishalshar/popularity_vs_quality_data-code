I've had this for a few days now, and I absolutely love it. It promises a lot, so I initially took things with a grain of salt, but as I started to go deeper I saw the amount of things you can do with this AnyMote.Don't get me wrong - if you want it to be simple, it can be simple. You just add your remote and be done with it - they even have a tutorial for that, and are very responsive over email if you need any kind of help.But if you're like me and you want to control your lights, tv, receiver & set top box, all at the same time, you get that as well. I believe I have a very custom setup, so it wouldn't have been possible for AnyMote (or any other product for that matter) to create anything automatically for me, and it doesn't even try. There is manual setup involved, because this isn't your run-of-the-mill universal remote, but it's well worth the work.
