**UPDATE Sep/02/2015One of the top laces plastic was worn off because of the friction that shoe made with rubberI recommend Lock Laces***********************************So the Installation was a breezeI got new Nike Flex 2015 Run GRY/OR 709022 from DSW onlinethe shoe laces that comes with it is Grey so I ordered Grey one but the nike grey was little darker than Hickes Grey but not alot of differenceI wanted to buy this so I dont have to tie my laces again and again for 2000+ times a shoeAnd also When Riding bicycle if your shoe laces get stuck in chain or gear.  You are F*cked up (Be prepare to trip and fall down)so that is why i bought thisIf the laces are shorter than expected Stretch them and it wil be stretched to use for your sizeI am going to buy one more. Black color to match/ use it for my bowling shoes
