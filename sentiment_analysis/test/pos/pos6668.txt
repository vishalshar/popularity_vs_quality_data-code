LOGISTICSI paid $390 to have it shipped and it took more than 3 weeks for me to receive... no I don't live in the middle of the jungle, desert or ocean.When I tried to register the product the website only accepts addresses in USA and Canada... and no reply yet from Enclave regarding this issue I raised with them.SUMMARYAside from the logistics and registration problems, this is a pretty good product for the price range and package size.Set up was very easy as you can read from other reviews.The remote control is very slow, so you may have to deal with some lag time when you press the buttons.SETUPI experimented with plugging in my sources to the Center Channel and then from the Center Channel to the TV; I found this more troublesome as I had to keep switching input sources using the Enclave Remote which was so slow or perhaps even faulty.  I ended up plugging the sources to the TV and using the Optical Cable to connect from the TV to the Center Channel.  This way I only needed to use the TV remote control which controls my TV, the DVD player, Netflix and now the volume of the Enclave Speakers.  However you will need to set this function up between your TV and the Enclave Speakers. (In the Enclave Menu its under CEC)BLUETOOTHWhen I need to connect the Enclave Speakers to Bluetooth devices I have to choose Bluetooth as my input source.  Because I connected my sources to the TV input, there was no video input from the Enclave Speakers to the TV,  I could not see the Enclave menu....  So I have now connected  one of my TV HDMI inputs to the Enclave Speaker output.  Every time I need to see the Enclave Menu when making adjustments I have to switch my TV input to the HDMI channel connected to the Enclave Speaker.  I know all this description sounds crazy but it would look a lot easier with diagrams.ADJUSTMENTSYou can adjust how loud each channel speakers sounds by making adjustments in the Enclave Menu.  The volume of the Bass Unit can be increased by placing it against a wall.  Otherwise I have to adjust it to its maximum because I have it placed in the middle of the room.SOUND QUALITYIn all honesty, these speakers sound pretty good for their size and price.  I mean you can't compare the sound quality of these speakers with say full sized speakers that come with full sized price tags.  I use the Enclave Speakers in my bedroom as such a small size is a big deal to me.  Besides I don't need a loud volume in the bedroom.  I can use the big speakers in my living room when I need volume and space.Speech is very clear when watching movies. And action movies with Dolby really come alive!I've heard the SONOS at a show room and wasn't impressed at all; all I could hear was the Bass and muddled spacing; maybe they didn't set it up correctly.  BOSE is nice but where I come from, a BOSE system costs sometimes 2 to 3 times what they cost in the US and a comparable BOSE system in the US would definitely cost a lot more than the $1,199 for the Enclave.  Dollar for Dollar you are getting a big bang for your buck with the Enclave.I have but one big issue with the Enclave Speakers, you can't play old recordings on them, well not that you can't, but I suspect they have not been programmed or tuned to play old/poor quality recordings.  The music comes out sounding really strange and lost.  Trio Los Ponchos sounded out of tune and some jazz masters sounded like music from transistor radios.  However when you play newer recordings like Diana Krall the speakers come alive, you can feel the presence....CONCLUSIONI love the Enclave Speakers for their Price/Quality ratio and their Size/Quality ratio, they are perfect for a bedroom sized environment.  Besides the  biggest selling point is the WISA Technology; there are no speaker wires running all over my room!
