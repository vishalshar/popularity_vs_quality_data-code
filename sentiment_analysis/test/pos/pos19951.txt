I bought this to entertain my 2.5 year old and 5 year old on a 17 hour car ride.  It was bigger than I expected, which was great for my 5 year old.  But it was a little difficult for my 2.5 year old to hold on his lap.  The magnets are very sturdy and it is good quality.  I was hopeful that they would play with it a little longer than they did.  Once they put the magnets in place they were done.
