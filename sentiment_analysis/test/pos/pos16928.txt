Just received this today. I ordered this type of adapter because it was sleek, had a variety of ports, and even matched my new gold Macbook. I'm loving it so far. It's a nice aluminum gold that pairs nicely with the computer. Give it a good push into the computer and will sit flush against the side. It is level with the computer as well, so doesn't add any extra bulk that would make the computer lopsided.  What I was pleasantly surprised with was the fact that I was able to plug into my iPhone 6 into the USB port and it actually worked to charge my phone. I had read that many adapters don't pump out power for devices, but looks like this one does!! I would say the only downside of this wonderful device is the fact that it gets very hot very quickly. You can especially feel it on the hot metal casing, so be aware how long you're keeping it plugged in. Also, a little pricey, but it's definitely a nice luxury adapter for someone who doesn't want a chord dangling like other adapters. Otherwise wonderful device, and I hope it stays that way for years to come!
