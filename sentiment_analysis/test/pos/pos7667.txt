My cats really love this food! They don't need much of it, because of its high protein content. They also have wet food in the mornings, so that also makes consumption go down. It'll last me about a month (4 lb), which is great, and they eat everything in their bowls. I also really like it because it doesn't have corn, wheat, or soy, nor artificial colors or flavorings, and the meat seems much higher quality than it would be in the cheap food with "by products," etc.I say to get the smaller bag, introduce your cats to it [properly], and test it out before investing in the large bag.If your cats don't like it, you could always give it to the local animal shelter, which I'm sure could use more cat food!
