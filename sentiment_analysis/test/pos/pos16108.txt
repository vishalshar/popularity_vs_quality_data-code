the Radmo is a great idea, but needs a little more.  It fits quite well in my cd player and the phone sits well in it, but in my VW golf at least it makes the phone pretty much unusable while it is in there.  It is a bit too wobbly.As I am usually driving solo this isn't much of a negative as it keeps me from fiddling with my phone while driving, but when I have a GPS app going and my copilot tries to manipulate something you pretty much have to remove the Radmo or the phone from it to do anything.Not the worst, but I might see if I can find something to sit behind the phone so it can be accessed but that might cut off the air from the vents.
