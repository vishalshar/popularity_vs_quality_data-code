It is great for filling in thinning hair to make it look thick and youthful.It does absorb oil, so by the end of the day can clump a bit, but nothing noticeable, except if you scratch your head.  I first purchased it without the applicator.  I probably wasted a lot of product that way.The pump is not the easiest to use.  It's a combination of pump and squeeze, but does localize the application and is less wasteful.It causes a little itching, probably because it dries out the scalp a bit.  I have semi oily hair, so that's not all bad.I pretty much use it everyday if I am going out.
