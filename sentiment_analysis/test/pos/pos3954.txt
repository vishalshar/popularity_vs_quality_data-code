I spent days looking for a sock that went high enough (up to the knee), was the right color, and wasn't too heavy or too light.  The Galiva gray socks seem to fit the bill.  I was a bit skeptical but when they showed up (in a nice display box to boot) they fit perfectly and were the right thickness.  I've been very pleased with them so far.We'll see if they are durable and hold up over time.
