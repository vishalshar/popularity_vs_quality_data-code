If you love your cats try this! My cats think it is great and I mix it with the wet food, they really gobbled it up. Most cat foods are just sketchy,stay away from rice ingredients too, and just buy the better brands. It saves in vet bills in the long run and we do want our fur babies happy.Hands down this stuff is a winner.
