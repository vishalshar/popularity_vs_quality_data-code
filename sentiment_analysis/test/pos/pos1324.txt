Forgot a dog, this little guy doesn't poop and still does tricks.It's cute. It's got personality and spunk, and it's fun to play with.Let me give you a tour of Cozmo through my eyes.  To do this, I need to give you some background on me.  Im a soul-less red-headed 40ish year-old single American male.  Im not living in my parents basement with a shelf of full of unopened action figures in pristine boxes. And Ive never played a single game of Halo.  But Ive wasted a week or two of my life playing Plants Vs Zombies and have made Angry Birds my bitch.Im into machine learning.  I read up on neural networks and generic algorithms in my spare time for fun.  Im looking forward to my self-driving car leaving at night to get its own oil change, drones that deliver pizza, and teleportation that can beam the poop directly out of my colon to the toilet.this is the only plausible reason they dont have a single bathroom on the Star Trek.When I first heard about Cozmo, I was curious about how far Artificial Intelligence  in consumer products had evolved.  Apples Siri and Alexas voice recognition are slowly improving past asking them for a fart sound, but nothing has knocked my socks off.  I even unloaded my Roomba years ago after it kept getting stuck under the couch.I was hoping Cozmo would change my life foreverI ordered it via Amazon on pre-order thinking it would come in a month.  It showed up in two days!First I had to free Cozmo from its plastic prison.  It looked nice in the box and after slicing a few pieces of tape, I opened the box and flipped through the manual in a few seconds and then tossed it in the trash. The packaging release plastic thing that secured Cozmo to the box was tricky to release (this is why I'm not a mechanical engineer)  and the cord around the USB was tied like a knot rather than twisted.its the small things.I plugged in the charger, plugged in the USB and sat Cozmo on his base, thinking I would have to charge him for hours before I got to play.  I didnt.  Just a few minutes was good enough.  (It fact the app mentioned how much charging time was needed once I got it connected)I downloaded the app on my ipad and went to connect it via the instruction on the app.  After about 4 attempts of attempting to read the WIFI code shown on Cozmos tiny screen and mis-typing it in my iPad, I was about ready to send it back.  But I persevered and finally got it.Overall, Cozmo was entertaining in both the sounds, his movements and his attitude.  He seems a bit drunk when you first ask him to do a new taskit takes him a while to figure it out.I went through all the games pretty fast and then got bored tried to play endless games of quick tap trying to boost my energy to 100% to release other stuff.I really wanted the explore mode to be able to allow me to snap a picture of the cats as I taunted them with Cozmo.Things I liked- The beep sounds when it backs up using the Explore app.- And the snore sounds when it goes to sleep.- He rarely decided to roll of my table.  He seems to stop most times.Things I wish where improved- I wish it would connect via Bluetooth.  Having to go into my WIFI settings and connect each day I want to use it, is a pain.- The fact that it needs an app. to use it all the time, is a disappointment.- I wish it took a picture of each user.and when you played the games, would show your user picture (instead of the generic user icon)- Easy way to find the sleep and turn it off in the app.- I wish it would find its own charging station like the RoombaI look forward to trying the SDK.Did Cozmo chance my life....eh, not really....but it did provide some entertainment.
