I am so pleased with this item.  I am a big cheese lover and this really does solve the storage problem associated with cheese.  It keeps the cheese fresh and flavorful.  The sheets can be easily adjusted to the size of your cheese, so you can use one sheet for more than one block.  In doing so, the sheets last a long time and you get a lot for your money.  I highly recommend this product!
