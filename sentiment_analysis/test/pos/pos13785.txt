This is the best invention.  My husband and I used it on one of those giant bottles of wine that we never wanted to open because we could never finish the bottle in one week, let alone one day.  We originally used the Coravin on this particular bottle about 5 weeks ago, and today each glass is still as fresh as if we just opened the bottle today.  Totally worth the price.  It's also a great hostess or house warming gift.
