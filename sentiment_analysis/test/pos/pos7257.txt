It came boxed very nicely and the accessories are really nice. I think the Sphero itself it's very sturdy and sure can take a beating. It doesn't scratch so easily and the main app on iOS works very well. Although Android users might find it disappointing because the main app it's by far very simple. Doesn't have the "gaming" interface and I didn't catch any "tricks" buttons on it.From the rest. It's a very fun little toy and really fast from what I spectedKudos for the Orbotrix people
