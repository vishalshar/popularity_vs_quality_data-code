This thing is great!  I am Cordon Bleu trained, and the way we were trained (long ago) on this technique, it was a pot on a burner with a thermometer, and you manually regulated the temperature.  Hello age of electronics and closed negative feedback loops.  This keeps the water temperature constant without manual intervention.
