Fantastic product! I had my cats in the front yard unsupervised for the first time yesterday. So happy. Make sure you shave the lower neck though to ensure good skin contact. I tried buying the cat specific collar from both Petsafe and EBay and neither would sell to Australia, advising me to buy their small dog collar. Not only is this the best global seller but by far the cheapest.
