Love love love this. I got a cheap one (another brand) which was a bear to pair if and when it did and had to be recharged every 3 days. I finally junked it and spent the needed money on this. Well worth it! It pairs automatically with no hassle. The battery lasts about 8 months it says. And it pairs with the weight watchers app beautifully. And you can shower and swim with it on. I bought a second one for my husband.
