This system is worth the price - it has engaged my grandson almost daily since Christmas! That ain't easy either! I'd say Words and Masterpiece are his favorites - Newton not so much. The others pop up periodically, but he seems to really enjoy Words and Masterpiece. Works seamlessly with an Air2. Great product, great idea.
