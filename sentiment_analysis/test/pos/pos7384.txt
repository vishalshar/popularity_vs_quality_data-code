After reviewing several similar  products on Amazon, I ended up purchasing this product to keep an eye on my two cats.  It did not disappoint!  Super easy to set up. Love the app. Great quality of visual footage. Love how I can move the camera lens around the room through  a touchscreen on the app. You can see all the way around the room. Also love the night vision and laser beam toy. All around an excellent product, especially for the price. So much so, I ordered a second one, which will be added as a room selection on the app.  Wish I bought this long ago!!  Would also recommend it for keeping an eye on your children when you have a babysitter in the house.
