Every household/car owner needs one!!!!! It came in the mail today, I took it out of the tube, connected it to my garden hose and proceeded to rid my car's rims of brake dust in minutes. A steady stream of moderate water pressure combined with the self-spinning and maneuverable brush head is sheer genius! Was able to get in all of the small openings and crevices in the rims and they are now cleaner than ever. The result was so much better than the spray at the car wash (and cheaper!). There is a handy shut off valve on the handle so you can pause between rims. The self-contained/one piece construction unit is very sturdily constructed; I can see it lasting for a long time.  I couldn't wait to use on the other cars. Will be buying my work associates each a Brush Hero for Christmas and, I was so excited, I almost bought it for them now so they could keep their cars clean during the summer.Best new product I have ever bought and been immediately fired up to use. Well done Brush Hero, well done!
