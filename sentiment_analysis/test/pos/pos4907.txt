The ONLY thing that has worked.We have two very clever and patient cats.  Our yard is totally fenced in which is perfect for keeping dogs in, however cats climb over it like it's nothing.  Our cats love being outside and they will stay in the yard while we are out there.  As soon as we turn our heads, poof, they are gone over.  Having a busy road behind our house, we don't want to find them squished on the road.For years I've tried to engineer barriers.  I've googled all kinds of solutions.  I ran electric fence wire on top.  These clever cats simply step over it.  Ran electric fence wire on the posts.  They climb next to it.  I hung chicken wire down which I found others on the internet found effective.  Nope.  They would breach this too.  They are geniuses at outsmarting my engineering efforts.My last ditch effort was to fork over the money for this shock collar solution.Finally, our cats stay in the yard.  They stay on the porch.  They know where the limits are and obey.  I can leave the fence open and they will stand right near the line and watch, but never try to exit.Some pointers:The collars they come with are terrible.  Pulled our cats hair out.  Easy to fix.  Use a normal (we use break away collars) and punch 2 holes for the electrodes.  Take pliers and unscrew the electrodes from the receiver and remove the junk collar and use your own.I'm glad to recommend this system, but I refuse to be continually gouged for batteries.  Collars use standard CR1 3V batteries.  Get them here on Amazon for cheap.  The batts I use have a plastic wrapper that you need to cut off first to use them.  Just break the old battery out of it's original casing and install one of these cheap ones and you are good for 3 more months.We no longer have our collars set on shock.  They are now set on beep (warning) only.  The cats will occasionally test this.  They hear the beep and jump back without getting shocked.Running the wire is the hardest thing.  I bought a spade shovel and pounded it in with a sledgehammer to make the slot to bury the wire.  There is a machine that you can rent to dig the trench.  Sprinkler installers use it to cut through turf.  I did it old school.  It's not that hard to bury the wire.  If you have lots of property, buy more wire or get it locally.  Most of my wire is stapled on top of the fence.Keep in mind that the wire transmits through walls.  I brought the wire up on our fence that meets the outside of the house.  One day the cats were walking along the wall of our bedroom when the beep went off.  Fence is on the other side of the wall.  Ooops.I've installed other invisible fences for friends for their dogs.  This seems like a quality product and the cats don't mind the receiver on their necks.  Highly recommend this system.  Just don't use their collar or batteries.[...]
