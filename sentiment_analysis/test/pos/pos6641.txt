Literally what I've been looking for for quite some time, and I;m so happy I tried it out! When looking over all the Solid Gold dry cat foods, I wanted something that was high in protein and low in fat/ calories and this was the one. 30% protein, 8% fat, and only 330 calories per CUP. My cat is 9lb and I feed her 3 times a day being 1/4 cup- which is just the right amount. With the previous cat food she would get a lot less and the pebbles were so much smaller, so she's finish it all in 30 seconds- I swear. It was bad. But, thank god the pebble size for this cat food is PERFECT, seriously. She's now slowed down and actually been able to chew it versus just swallowing. The smell of the food is super bearable too, and she loves it- just the right amount of "meaty/ fish" smell for me and her. I've been transitioning it into her diet for just over a week now and she loves it.If you too are looking for something with no by-product, good nutritional value, grain-free, and had a good pebble size this is the one! I will be coming back for more :)
