We have tried several products, trying to get the awful stench out of our Son's hockey gear. Who knew a 10 year old could produce something that could smell that awful? Anyway, this stuff works magically. It is best if you can start with clean gear and then use HEX every time afterward. It literally takes away all the nasty smell. Do they sell this in 55 gallon drums?
