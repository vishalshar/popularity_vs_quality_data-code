Everyone's tastes vary, but I personally really enjoy Coffiest. I haven't had it refrigerated yet... only at (cool) room temperature. It's great for a kick, and also kicks the hunger that typically kicks in around 11am. It makes me feel a little better that it's not just sugars, and at the end of the day, I actually do feel better for drinking this, rather than just a couple of extra cups of coffee.So, I've reduced my caffeine reliance a bit, I feel more energetic, and for me, I would drink this just because it tastes good, too.
