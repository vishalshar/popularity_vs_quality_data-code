Bravo works much better and looks much cleaner on your keychain. It is very easy to hear when lost in close range and the crowd sourced GPS also works very well. Additionally you are able to find your phone through the reverse tracking capability by using the bravo device. I love using it to find my wallet, keys, eye glass case, and remote. Those are the four items that I have my Trackr's connected to and they work great
