I've been contemplating which way to go with smart light switches in my home for a long time.  I decided on the Plum Lightpad for multiple reasons: First, they are hands down the best looking smart light switch out there - nothing else compares to them.  Second, they are one of the only smart light switches that works with 3 way switches.  So if you have a ton of 3 switches like I do, this is definitely you're best bet.  3 way switches for those that don't know are when you have multiple switches that control the same light. Many of the other popular mainstream brands out there do not work with 3 way switches - so do your research.  I'm really glad I decided to go this route.  Product was really nicely packed, instructions were detailed and installation was very simple. Looks beautiful on the wall once it is installed.  The colored light around the switch that you can change the color of not only looks cool but is extremely functional when it's completely dark in your house and you're approaching the switch and it lights up - shows you where the light switch is and gives off a decent amount of light that allows you to see the area around the switch.  Overall I'm very satisfied with these switches.  Installed one of them on my outdoor light and was able to turn the light on and off while on vacation - because everyone knows if you leave the outside light on all day you're probably out of town. Do yourself a favor and buy these light switches - you won't regret it.
