Excellent support from Alex and the team at DeviceLinked. Installed the GLink on a Genie Silentmax 1000 and found that the Genie wall switch was consuming too much current to keep the GLink powered. (GLink draws power from garage opener and does not need Esperanto power supply, which I consider a huge installation advantage over competitors). Alex quickly identified the issue and promptly sent me a special "low voltage" version of the GLink. (3v version verses 5v standard model). This allowed me to keep the Genie wall switch and have full door and light control from the GLink. I have found the Bluetooth range at least equal to the standard door remote and actually more reliable. I was looking for a product like GLink because sometimes my door would simply not open using the genie remote or my Homelink in car. The gesture control (3 taps on the phone) is a great idea and I always try it first, but have found that it is only about 20% successful. The IPhone app does clearly state this feature is in development. I look forward to future software updates when this feature is further refined, but for now it is not a big deal. I did also receive a door position sensor from the Device Linked team (thank you). This allows the phone app to show the state of the door in the picture (open or closed) and gives nice visual confirmation it is working. I had read earlier information where the sensor also enable advance automatic door closing, but DeviceLinked advised they are no longer allowing this function. I have found the Bluetooth connection hooks up very quickly when you come into range of the door and it works even when your iPhone is using Bluetooth for other activity, such as music or phone calls. Overall I really like the added convenience this product provides and found the GLink price point to be very competitive with its rivals. Recommended as a real alternative to placing a key pad outside or for anyone that is looking for increased flexibility and door opening options.
