I bought this simply to have a speaker upstairs which wasn't Bluetooth so wouldn't have to be paired with one person & then another constantly.  After initial trouble getting it onto my network (I didn't point my iPod at the appropriate microphone) my Cube works great.  I use mostly Pandora, but sometimes am in the mood for the Radio features.  The sound quality is wonderful.
