These are the best things to happen to my work shoes since that waterproofing stuff. these things hold up to 12 hours running EMS Calls non stop and make my work shoes easy to keep clean and bio hazard free. would love to outfit all of my kicks with these but at around $15 a set i would suggest prioritizing shoes that you wear most often and need a slip on feature that can still hold up to a full out sprint.
