Right on schedule (per the instructions), the 'log' got bumpy and the next day the oyster mushrooms were recognizable.  The day after that they had grown noticably.  This kit is easier than the white mushroom kit as you can have it in any room of the house near a window (NOT direct sun tho).  That is easier than needing a chilly room with no light (the other kit).  It grows MUCH faster than the white button kit as well.  This will be fun to watch.  I'll post more photos as they grow.
