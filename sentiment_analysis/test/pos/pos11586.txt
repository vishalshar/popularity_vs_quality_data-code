I'm a huge coffee drinker. While tea will never replace coffee for me, the three energizing teas in the energy tea gift box are complementary to my daily caffeine intake. My favorite is the sencha matcha bliss, which is a nice blend of sencha and matcha green tea from Japan. This takes out the need to use a whisk for making matcha. I just steep the loose leaf like a regular tea - super convenient!Impressive packaging as well - the box is in a drawer format and can be used to store all of my leftover teas.
