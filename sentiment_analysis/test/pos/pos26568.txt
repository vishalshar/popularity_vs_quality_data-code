Like a few other people, I had problems day one with the Roost, but they've been resolved and the Roost is working as expected.When I first tried installing, I was getting four beeps (diagnostic signal stating that the Roost couldn't log onto the WiFi network. (I tried on two networks, one open and no password, another one is WEP protected.)I notified Roost support, they responded the next day saying that there's a firmware update to fix the problem. Since my unit wasn't online, it couldn't update itself that way, and the support folks sent a replacement module (the small part on the bottom of the battery). I received it quickly, added the Roost to the WEP-secured network, and it worked exactly as expected.I installed this at my Mom's house. Now I will know if she does something to set off her smoke alarm, and that piece of mind for this straightforward bit of technology is worth a lot to me.This is a new-to-the-market product, but Roost provided mainstream-quality support and solved the problem I had.  If you're on the fence, I hope this review helps you out.
