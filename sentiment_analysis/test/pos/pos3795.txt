Super LOUD when struck with a driver. First time I thought I broke my driver (low 90mph swing speed) and for the rest of the round the same sound comes when driving it. Hitting on the sweet spot too so it's not because of poor swing. Other than that the ball feels heavier and requires more "Umph!" to get it going. However, it does have very consistent performance and it does feel longer than the Pro V1x I was testing against. One thing that I also noticed was that it was more receptive to side spin. Example, I hit two MA 1.0 and the ProV1x. Hit MA1.0, then ProV1x, then another MA1.0. Same swing, same target, the two MA 1.0 ends up fading and both ended up about 3 yards apart while the ProV1x had less fade and a different spot altogether. Still near the green but it just seems to perform differently. Good spin off short irons and wedges. Cover durability is on par with other quality balls.In short, it may take a bit to get used to but it's consistent, feels longer, and feels like you have to muscle up to launch the ball (but you don't). Good quality ball.
