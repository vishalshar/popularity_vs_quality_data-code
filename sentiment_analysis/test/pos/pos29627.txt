I owned a DJI Phantom 2 vision + prior to purchasing the Autel X-Star Premium.  Purchased the Autel based on price, features and at the time they were giving away a new battery as a promotional item.  The free battery made it a great deal.  I have used it several times now and so far I have not been disappointed with it's flight characteristics.  The only problem I have encountered is that I run Ubuntu 16.04 on most of my computers and unlike the older DJI, the Autel will not allow me to download the SSD card via the USB cable.  I have to remove the SSD card from the craft and put it directly into the computer's port to off load the videos.  A minor issue.
