I bought 2 of these for my younger sisters (21) as gifts. They are both swimmers as a part of their workout routine. The watch works great for swimming laps (outside of kicking laps, which makes sense for something on your arm) and goes from casual to work to fun easily. It looks like a normal watch and isn't too bulky on either of them (they're both around 5 ft tall).The only complaint I've gotten is that since the watch only counts steps when your arms are actually moving it's WAYYY off after a shift as a waitress (kinda hard to swing your arms when you're carrying food LOL).
