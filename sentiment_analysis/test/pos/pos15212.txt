The set up themselves are amazing. They have about a 90% connection success rate. Alert systems works great and the quality is beyond acceptable. One thing of note, customer service is amazing and will not hesitate to recommend to others.One more thing: the newer version comes with the lighting shield and def improves quality of viewing at night.
