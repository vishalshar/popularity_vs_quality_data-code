I didn't get this for free.  I paid for it, and was skeptical.  Took a while to warm up to it.If you have an inventive mind and are always tinkering with things around the house, give this a try.  It's an entirely different kind of product.Plan on wasting a few packs figuring out how it works and what it's good for.  The uses I saw online weren't necessarily how I ended up getting the best of Sugru.My tennis ball shoe holders fell off the wall.My iphone cord repair cracked and broke the next week.My toy car fell off the wall and left four black dots.The leftover pieces were the pieces that ended up working best.  Does better on non-wall surfaces (wood, metal) but painted walls seem to work less well.The molded hook is still up and holds an led flashlight or some binder rings.The leftover sugru I used to glue the halloween hand to a shelf ended up working the best. Made little tips for the end of dowel rods and hung stockings under our office TV for christmas.Have a pen holder molded to the inside of the glove box in the car.Mended a broken ceramic angel figurine that was knocked over and broke in half, is strong and barely noticeable.Look up the stuff in other people's reviews and on their site to get some ideas, then keep it in the back of your mind.  You'll end up finding cool uses before long.  I keep a memo in my phone and do a few repairs at a time since you only have a little while to work with the pack.  Also, can't spend too long contemplating as they expire in 6 months.
