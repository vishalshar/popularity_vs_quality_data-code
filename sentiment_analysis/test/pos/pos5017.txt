Perfect set of tweezers for everyday carry on a key-chain.  They lock nice and tight in the key-chain holster and it's ever fallen off the key-chain yet.  I can't tell you how many times I've used these while out backpacking in the southwest. Cactus needles are easy to pull out because the silver gripper is large enough to get a good bite on the needle and the silver grippers have grooves etched into the metal tips for gripping thorns and needles. I like that it's also made in the USA! I highly recommend these tweezers!
