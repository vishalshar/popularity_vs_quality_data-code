Really great stuff but cost and shelf-life make it hard to give 5 stars.  This is the best stuff I have found for repairing Apple power cables.  It molds to durable strain reliefs better than anything else I have found.  Cured polymer has no tack, yet remains flexible.  Packages are about 2X what I need for most cables and even refrigeration and heat sealing fail to keep remainder of the material useful.  Even factory sealed packages eventually harden.  Sadly this is a product that is incredibly useful, but almost impossible to keep on the shelf for when you need it.  That and the relatively high cost make it hard for me to give 5 stars.  Cured fixes work well but don't look factory new.  Still well cheaper than replacing expensive power cords.
