While this is not a scientific measurement tool, it's a pretty amazing device for $200. I used it at work to look for hot spots in coaxial transmission lines operating at high average power. If I'd waited a while longer I might have opted for the slightly more expensive version just announced, which has an adjustable focusing element. I did by the macro lens adapter sold on eBay which focuses at a couple of inches. This makes it more useful for inspecting circuit boards for hot spots. It's also a great gadget for educating my grandchildren about infrared radiation.
