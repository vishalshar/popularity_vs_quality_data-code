Amazing product! I literally use this every single day along with my large wide mouth blue Mason jar.  My only suggestion would be for the manufacturer to allow the lid to extend all the way back as there are times you bump it on your face and it falls off.  I had it fall into the ground of public transportation once...it was gross.  But honestly this lid is amazing! It doesn't leak, you can pour liquids from it too.  I also use it with a straw.  I am definately going to buy more of their products. I like how this lid allows me to be green and use my favorite glass Mason jars to drink out of.  I'm going to explore some of the other types for food storage. Thanks ReCAP!
