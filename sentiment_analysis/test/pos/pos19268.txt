Awesome headset!, doesn't seal or feel as comfortable as my old headset  ASUS ROG Gamer headset *discontinued model* but the mic boom is simple and the braided cord is a nice feature. Overall I recommend it. Also, as others have noted, the headset sits somewhat awkwardly on your head meaning if you don't wear it a certain way, it somewhat hurts jaw/cheekbone
