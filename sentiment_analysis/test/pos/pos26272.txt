The Lytro camera is quite interesting. It allows you to take "live pictures", that allow you to select where you want to focus at after the picture is taken. It also allows one to slightly change the perspective from which you see the scene, so that you may move up/down and sideways slightly changing the angle in which you see the scene. That gives quite a 3D view of the scene. If you take two of the views (left/right for instance) you can easily create a 3D image (using an appropriate display that is). This version of the camera has 16GB of memory,which is rated to hold 750 live pictures. While the 8GB versions of the camera hold around 350 live pictures, the price different makes this version worth it. It would be nice if we could choose the colour we prefer though (as of now the 16GB camera is only build in Red Hot colour).You get better results if yo utake pictures that include some object(s) very close to the camera and some other(s) pretty far from it. If you have three or more distance layers things get even more interesting. You can see your live pictures in your computer or publish them in the Lytro website, from where you can share it with friends. Such process may improve, but it already proves useful, If I were to decide now whether or not I'd buy this camera I would definitively do it again!It would be nice to have a replaceable front element, that could protect the lens. I did acquire a 37mm adapter for the Lytro camera, which allows one to use a 37mm UV filter, but that may be a bit too clumsy to be used daily. Time will tell...Keep on shooting!
