I have wider feet and find these more comfortable in many pairs of shoes and boots. The grey is very neutral - casual, the white I wore once with running shoes when I was wearing jeans, but they are casual too. Cool, comfortable - perfect for me. I'm a 9.5- they fit me quite well, but I would certainly also order them if I were a 10 or 11
