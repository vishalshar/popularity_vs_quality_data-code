I was impressed with the product. Only problem I have is the fingerprint on the home button no longer works but I suspect that has more to do with the condition of the phone before the repair than anything. Make sure you have a hair dryer for some of the steps to listen the glue. I won't but any other kit....my daughter has cracked several and this is the best. Great color photos in the directions.
