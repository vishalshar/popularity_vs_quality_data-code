I have been hunting for true no-show socks for years, and finally have founds some!! These and the Vero Monte Mens Elastic No Show Socks are both awesome. They are thin enough not to be uncomfortable in boat shows, thick enough to actually feel like a sock, and have an unobtrusive no-slip grip on the heel. I ordered a set of both to compare, planning to send one back - I'm keeping both of them! They fit a little different, especially around the side of the foot, so I can see them fitting different shoes better.
