This is a great all around oil.  In the past we have stuck to coconut oil and avocado oil.  I had thought avocado oil had the highest smoke point, but apparently I was wrong...algae oil beats it out.  Coconut oil has a much lower smoke point.  It has a mild taste and can be used for pretty much anything that require oil.  We have been using it for about 3 weeks now and have been extremely happy with it.  In fact, I just purchased 2 more bottles so that I won't have to wait when it runs out.  I recently made a batch of home made almond butter.  I usually mix in a little coconut oil to make the process of churning a little easier.  This time I used the algae oil and it turned out great.  There is no change in the taste of the better.  I highly recommend this oil.  In general, I think all oils should be used in moderation, but this one goes to the top of the list.  I will probably use this in place of avocado oil and keep it in the collection along with coconut and olive oil.
