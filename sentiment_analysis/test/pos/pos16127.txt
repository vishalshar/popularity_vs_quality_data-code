When tasted raw, the taste profile is a umami bomb reflecting its primary ingredients (fish sauce, soy sauce, molasses and worcestershire sauce), with perhaps the fish sauce dominating a tad too much).  However in cooked food its a good deal subtler but effective, delivering a good meaty punch.  Overall I really like using this on steaks, but its too pricey for use in larger volumes.  Using a slug of balsamic with a slug of kepis manis (or soy paste, or any of the thicker versions of soy sauce) is just as effective for sauces and stews and a lot cheaper.
