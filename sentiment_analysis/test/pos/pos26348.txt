Filled my bottle with water and ice cubes, went for a drive in my jeep with the t-tops off. The bottle got warm from sitting in the sun and to my surprise, when I opened it to take a drink the water was still cold and ice cubes were still present. Got home, left the bottle on my kitchen counter and when I opened it the next morning, ice cubes were still floating in the water.Love it!!! I would never get that from any other bottle I own (nalgene, camelback).
