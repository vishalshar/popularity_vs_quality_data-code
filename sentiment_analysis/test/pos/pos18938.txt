We'll see how it holds up but after testing it before wrapping it as Christmas gift (11yo girl who specifically asked for it) my hubs and I were impressed. Put in batteries and download app and it's pretty amazing! May have to purchase one for my hubs too - he couldn't quite playing with it. Great packaging too!
