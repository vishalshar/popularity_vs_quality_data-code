Very solid built and nicely designed dice! It's a bit weird amazon asks for the "educational value" of a set of dice. In case I wanna teach somebody basic math and probability theory...? Anyway, totally satisfied. It could be made better if I could have a couple extra D6 though. Would like to spend a little more for more handiness. :)
