It's the best consumer OBD2 tracker/logger on the market today.I've been using it with an iPhone 6+ and have had no issues with the Bluetooth connection.  It connects easily and stays connected, even when I'm also using Bluetooth with my Apple Watch and my stereo.The software for this is really cool, but it also works with 3rd party apps such as DashCommand which provides all kinds of diagnostics and a dashboard of instrument readings.My only complaint so far is that the safety score tracking docks you for driving over 70 regardless of the speed limit.  I wish this was user setting as I'd like to track and dock points only if 75 is exceeded.  (Yes, I understand the developers want people driving under 70 due to their gas mileage beliefs, but we'd like the option of changing this).Also, DashCommand is able to display lateral g-force, so shouldn't Automatic be able to use this data in the safety score?While I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars, I would recommend this to anyone interested in such a device, and I wouldn't be surprised if this gets updated to 5 out of 5 with firmware updates, app updates, or backend server updates.EDIT 6/5/2015: I was unaware that the unit does track trips when the iPhone isn't present and then syncs when it's connected.  It does do this, which is really cool!  You could use this to track when someone is borrowing your car (like the kids) or if you simply forgot your iPhone.Automatic seems to be pretty responsive to user feedback, which in of itself is a huge plus, so I wouldn't be surprised if I'm editing this review soon to give it 5 stars.
