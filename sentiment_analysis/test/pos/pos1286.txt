VERY VERY HANDY AND VERY VERY GOOO FOR STORING YOUR CHEESE.  WORKS JUST AS ADVERTISED.  REALLY HAPPY WE FOUND THIS PRODUCT AS WE ALWAYS HAVE A SUPPLY OF CHEESES IN THE HOUSE FOR USE.  I JUST CUT OF THE CHEESE LABEL AND LEAVE IT IN THE BAG TO KNOW ONE FROM THE OTHER.  THE BAGS ARE PROBABLY REUSABLE BUT WE HAVE NOT TRIED THAT YET.  LEAVE IT TO THE FRENCH TO COME UP WITH A GREAT PRODUCT TO KEEP ALL THEIR GREAT CHEESES FRESHER FOR LONGER PERIODS.
