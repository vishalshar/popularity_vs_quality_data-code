Pros-Easy to set up if you read the instructions-Incredibly comfortable, completely covers your ear so they stay comfortable for hours-Decent sound quality especially for the price-They seem reliable and sturdy, though mine have already broken where the speaker meets the headband but in the headphones defense fell of my head from about 6 feet onto hard wood floor-Volume control is very nifty (aside from the on off buttons)Cons-a little heavy on the bottom half, causes them to slip off your heap if you look down. (thus mine fell and broke :(-When you lay on your side the large ear piece makes a popping noise every time you put a little pressure on it-Because of the location and large surface area of the on/off buttons for the mic and game volume, when you put your head up against things, it turns off either the game volume or your chat function-the warranty is pretty much like all lame warranties where nothing is really covered unless it is broken out of the box-with xbox, the audio pretty much freaked out every time i tried to use the wireless audio. It will cut in and out when the controller turns off- mic makes obnoxious buzzing if you try and charge it while you use it (only your friends can hear it, so its not that bad) gets me muted a lot thoughUp for debate-I have yet to experience the customer service side of things-Not sure how i feel about the detachable mic, I lose little things but i also enjoy not looking weird when I were them just as headphones-Other headphones that are equally good are available at 150 price tag, but most don't have all the extra feature that you get with these headphonesOver all-It was a pleasant experience, but like all things engineering, there is still plenty of room for improvement-I would recommend getting a pair of these if you need gaming headphones and you have 150 to spend, but i am still on the fence about replacing mine
