I was having the worst issues with my shower curtain liner blowing in on me at my new place. Constantly having to fight off a clingy liner is not my idea of a relaxing shower. But these Shower Curtsy magnets work like magic! Just tried them out and my curtain didn't assault me a single time. I am very happy with this product!If you are having issues with your shower curtain getting a little too touchy feely, the Shower Cursty is exactly what you need!
