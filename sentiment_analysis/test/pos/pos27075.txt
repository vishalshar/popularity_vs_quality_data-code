First, I have used thermals from $25k and up. I was looking at a major brand for about 1500$ but when I found this, it was a no brainer.Pros:SmallGreat image and video qualityThe case is very sexyThe packaging is very sexyCons:It needs a 180 swivel built into it, and/or a 6 inch extension.My camera faced forwards, so that makes it useless unless you get an extension cable. IMO the manufature should include this 1$ cable.It gets 4 stars for this reason only. Manufacturer, Go to monoprice, buy a case of these things and offer to mail them out.Make it so!This was beyond my expectations. I am using it for Project Tango to Fuse data and object types together.
