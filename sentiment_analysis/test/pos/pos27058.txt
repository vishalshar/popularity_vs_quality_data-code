I'm a longtime Sonos owner and Spotify Premium user, and like many I have been disappointed at how the integration between the two has languished. Spotify features in Sonos are now a couple years behind and not improving.  So I have been trying to figure out how to get the newer Spotify features on my Sonos sound system.  This Gramofon device with Spotify Connect is the answer for me, and at the right price point!Spotify sent me a link to a deal on this item, and I ordered right away.  Setup is fairly easy, and I am using a 3.5mm male to male cord (NOTE: not included in the package; see more below) to plug this into the line-in port on a Sonos Play 5.  Now I can play Spotify Radio stations on my Sonos system, and control it from my iPhone.  It doesn't play the music from the phone, so you can actually turn the phone off or leave the house or do something else with it while the music is playing.  This is exactly the solution I have been looking for. You still get all of the Sonos zone controls, but now you also have access to the latest features in Spotify.Tip: Turn up the volume setting on the Spotify app on your phone to the max.  It won't overdrive the line-in to the Sonos, and will provide the best signal.Footnote: The Gramofon comes with a 3.5mm to RCA cord (that's a headphone plug to the red & white plugs), which isn't actually the cord needed to connect to the Sonos - you need 3.5mm plug on both ends of the cord. I happened to have the correct cord at home already, but if you don't have one and you want to replicate this setup, you'll need to get one.One minor complaint: the lighted ring on top of the thing never turns off.  This is attractive to my toddler son, who is then tempted to mess around with it looking for buttons to push.One minor wish: if the Gramofon had some kind of digital output port, it could be plugged into a device with a high quality DAC chip. But at this price point, that's purely wishful thinking. Audiophiles who want that will probably spend the hundreds more to get a receiver that has Spotify Connect built in.Summary: Sonos owners looking for a better way to use Spotify, this is the cheapest, best solution out there.
