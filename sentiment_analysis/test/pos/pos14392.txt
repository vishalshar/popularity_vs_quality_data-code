I want to like it. I really do. But I should have heeded the warnings here and so should you. It won't levitate. The saucers zips to one side or another but won't take off. So. Bummed. Out.----UPDATE:Customer service contacted me immediately. Within a week I had a new one and it works!So thanks for that. A few quibbles now that shouldn't surprise anyone. 1.  Needs more precise volume control. One click up on volume is still too loud sometimes. 2. The sound effects are cool but super loud and I'd like the option to control or turn off.
