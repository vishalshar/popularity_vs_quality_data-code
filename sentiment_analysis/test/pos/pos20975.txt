My daughter loves this cord. Only downside she thinks it's a bit short as she like to use her phone while charging. She feels it doesn't allow her enough feedom across her room. Heaven for bid she should be without her cell phone for one minute:)  She sill would recommend this as the moving light even impressed her.
