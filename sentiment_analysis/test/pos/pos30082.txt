I recommend this company to my patients (I'm a medical doctor) because it's a fast and discrete way to get tested in their own home. This company is making STI screening quick and painless. All you need is a finger prick for the HIV test and a vaginal swab for the gonorrhea and chlamydia. You mail in your samples and then call a number in about a week to get your results back. Super simple and very easy to do. For people pressed on time, this is a great option.
