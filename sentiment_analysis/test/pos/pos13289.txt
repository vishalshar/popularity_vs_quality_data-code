What's so great about this mount is that it fits not only the CD slot, but also the gaps on the dashboard. I've installed the mount within 2 minutes on my WRX. Technically it only took a few secods to install as most of the time was spent on finding the slot to preserve my mp3-CD player slot. It fits perfectly in the gap right on top of the CD player without blocking the retractable cup-holder! lol yey! Another point worth mentioning is that the thumb screw tightener makes it really easy to install and remove when needed. :)
