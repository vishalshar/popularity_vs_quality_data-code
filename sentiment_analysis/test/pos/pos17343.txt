I'm fortunate enough to live in a city that sells this brand in-store. But it's awesome that Amazon offers this Prime-able because it is, IMO, an imperative item for cheese lovers; competitively priced here, anyone whose local market/cheese shop doesn't offer it is no longer out of luck.I'm seriously trying not to grow into the insufferable cheese snob I fear I may become. Lecturing strangers that they may be suffocating their cheese is not a quality I want to pocess. However, anyone who appreciates value--getting the most for your dollar--will eventually admit that to be a resourceful consumer, ya just got protect your cheese; the stuff is too pricey to throw out prematurely. Even mass produced cheese from the big box store will get a major lifeline from correct storage.I have both the Formaticum cheese paper and bags. The bags win...You just mark the bag by circling the cheese type, write the date on the provided line, pop your cheese in and fold. Painless and time saving. The stickers provided with the paper roll version are indeed fun, but the bags are ultimately more convenient.Though I personally don't double up cheeses in each bag unless they're the same general type, these are large enough for double, even triple duty. I'm solely a soft stinky stank cheese girl--and those are usually the types that need a bit more babying--but these are roomy enough for large parm blocks and your typically more generously sized hard cheeses. Each bag is 6-2.5" x 11"; 15 bags per box.Tho perhaps considered a novelty to the less enthused or a luxury to others, I merely believe in the right tool for the job. These bags store and perserve your blocks of mold better than anything else I've tried. Well worth the investment.The humidity stabilizing materials really do work. Sleep peacefully knowing there's no homicide occurring in the deep, dark unknown of your refrigerator.They're made in France but don't hold that against them. It's a place that knows a thing or two about CHEESE.
