Overall, an excellent device. The accuracy is really nice (i.e., up to the tenth's place), and automatic reporting seems to work well. I haven't noticed any gaps in data either, but I've certainly been away from the device for 2-3 days and not lost anything (at least, it appears that way). It works exactly as described -- you can read the temperature on your phone and see the change over time.The most surprising thing with this is that the graphs really give this device use. While an normal thermometer/thermostat reads the current temperature, you can get a feel for how fast temperature changes with this. You can see overnight temperature drops, or when you kick on the heat, how quickly the temperature rises. Overall, I'm really, really happy with this!Updated twice: Original unit was DOA, but replaced by Sense after contacting support. Everything has been golden since then.
