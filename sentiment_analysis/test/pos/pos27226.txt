I am a guitar newbie.  I travel a lot for work, so I bought the jamstik+  to bring with me and practice. All I have to say is wow! I am so impressed.  It is so easy to use, and connects seamlessly to my phone or iPad. The note transmission from the jamstik+ to my Iphone or tablet is instantaneous.I am a big fan of the guitar learning app called Yousician.  So I connect the jamstik to my phone. That way, the phone can play the notes I play and I can see where my fingers are on the frets, meanwhile my iPad runs the yousician  app and I can play along with the lessons since I can hear the notes that are coming out of my iPhone.  I couldn't be happier!
