I like this phone because of it's size. Yet it is thin and can fit in a back pocket or small purse. I just signed up for Cricket Wireless using AT&T services and the only issue was having to manually configure settings to get my text and picture messages. Other than this, I like this Posh phone for the size and is different but  has decent specs, it's fast and sleek. I would recommend to those who like big smart phones. For those who like smaller phones, this would be too much and is about the size of a Samsung 7" inch tablet. It looks nice and the display is bright and crisp. The sound is decent and apps store on the sd card without issue. Sparks up conversations around the water cooler. I like the fact that I can see everything and not have to carry an extra tablet along with my cell phone as this does both very well.
