I am quite picky when it comes to sound quality. I will always pick sound quality over cost. I have been using the JBL flip and although sound quality is ok, this speaker is amazing. Bright mids and highs without losing bass from a small speaker. It easily reproduces sound that is very natural and does not sound like it is coming form a small single speaker.  Violins , bass drums, vocals and even fingers sliding up and down guitar strings sounds exactly like they should. It may not be as loud as the UE Boom 2 but details are so much better. If you are looking for something really loud you need to go much larger. The largest Marshall has the bass and really pumps but it is the size of a carry on suit case.At nearly 40 hours of play back you can't beat it. I do wish it had the ability to charge my phone as I can't play music from a dead phone.It looks great and is extremely solid. I can't wait to attach it to my bike, take it to the pool, and beach or wherever I want. So great that I don't have to worry about sand water or anything else.
