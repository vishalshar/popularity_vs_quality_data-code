Simply put, if you need to expand the storage on your Apple laptop this is the best option. I made the mistake of choosing 128Gb for my Macbook Pro last year, so I was running low on storage in no time. I was looking into buying a 256Gb SSD on eBay to replace the current one, but the pricing was ridiculous and the idea of voiding my warranty to add storage wasn't very appealing. I searched forever for a good solution, and I landed on Tardisk. I am glad that I did. I decided to go with the 128Gb model to double the storage in my laptop.The quality of the hardware seems high; the product seems like it is built to last forever. The instructions were clear and the installation process was straightforward and quick (less than 15 minutes). Because of how the product's software works (it basically uses the Tardisk and the laptop's SSD to create a single Logical volume just like Apple's fusion drive), real world performance and benchmark numbers are pretty much identical to the SSD alone. This is because it keeps your system files as well as commonly used Apps and files on the faster SSD, while infrequently used files are moved to the slower Tardisk storage. So while the read and write speeds of the Tardisk itself may be low when benchmarked, when combined with your SSD, the difference is practically imperceivable to the user, and performance will be the same 99% of the time. All you really see is the expanded storage! Just make sure you are ordering the model that includes the Pear software.The only real trade off is that the SD card reader becomes unusable, but this probably isn't an issue for most people. If it is, a $10 card reader will do the trick.I have been more than impressed with the Tardisk and Pear software, and I recommend it highly. The price might seem a little bit steep for the amount of storage you get, but the seamless experience that Pear provides is well worth the investment.
