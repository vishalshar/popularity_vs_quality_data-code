So I have had the MyKee for a bit and have used it for multiple applications.  So bear in mind, this is not a knife.  Also, bear in mind people often freak out when you pull on a pocket knife and cut something.  Unless it's a knife that's super small like a Gerber Curve or keychain Swiss army knife, then they say "How cute, a little bitty knife".I carry on my keychain:  -MyKee  -Gerber Curve  -Titanium Bit  -Nitecore USb Rechargable flashlight (with about 1 foot of gorilla tape around it)PROs:  -It's light weight, barely notice it weight-wise  -Useful for opening packages:  Boxes,  paper and plastic shipping envelopes  -Alot of poke and cut functionality, while not a knife it can poke and tear through quite a bit (When clean cuts don't matter)  -Tear tags off of newly purchased clothes  -Clean out narrow pathways with sharp end  -Pop keys out of keyboard  -Used the sharp end to cut through kitty litter plastic to open the bag  -Cut open cough drop bagsCONs:  - In your pocket, You will poke yourself.  Just not badly.
