I purchased this unit for a 2010 Tacoma, and the factory DVD has a  groove molded in the center of the slot to make it easier to remove the CD/DVD. Unfortunately this groove prevents unit from securing itself within the slot. Upon hearing about my problem the company offered two other solutions without cost to me. I am pleased to report the alternative solutions work great. I am please report the company went above beyond to obtain my satisfaction. I highly recommend dealing with this company because you can assured your satisfaction is important to them.
