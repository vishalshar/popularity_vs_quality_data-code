I mainly bought this chair for its functionality like adjustability factor, and I especially love the fact that I can recline the back almost all the way down if I want to. I'm surprised it's not a standard feature in office chairs. Not only does it look like a car seat, but it reclines like one too. It's pretty darn comfortable and attractive. Very well made and the lumbar and headrest cushions are great too. I'm very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it. I was really happy to get rid of my old office chair. One last tip, if you're at all confused during assembly, just go to the helpful video on their website.
