I was initially introduced to this by a blog post by Death Wish Coffee.  While I don't consider myself a coffee expert, I do enjoy experimenting with different brewing methods, and I own a Chemex, Aeropress, make my own cold brew, and now with this have the ability to make a fantastic cup of espresso!  It's absolutely easy to use, and the fact that you can get a beautiful crema from a device that costs a small fraction of a high-end espresso machine, I can only say that even if I wanted to make multiple shots of espresso at a time I could buy two of these and still only spend maybe 10% of what a normal countertop machine would cost.
