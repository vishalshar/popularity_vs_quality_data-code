I finally decided to splurge on this pitcher after being continually disappointed in Brita's awful design. We don't "freak out" about stuff in our water and usually just let filters lag anyway. (Yes, we do drink water straight out of the tap). The purpose of this pitcher is basically to have cold water ready in the fridge. Maybe someday they will make a filter that will keep sticklers happy? Either way, the design is great. The hands free filling feature is really cool. No leaks, flying lid or crummy handle here! Plus it's beautiful.
