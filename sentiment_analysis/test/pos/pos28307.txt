These are a MUST for anybody who uses makeup brushes.  It makes cleaning them so much easier and it allows the brush to keep it's shape if you're storing or traveling with them.  I don't use every single brush in my collection every day...so I just wash my used brush, pop on the guard, allow it to dry, then store the brush in the guard until it's ready to use.  It lets me know which brushes are dirty and which are clean and keeps the brushes from squishing each other and ruining their shape.  What a great idea!  Now...if they'd only come up with a drying "cup" that ventilates at the bottom to allow air to circulate and is large enough to accommodate my daily brushes without packing them in, I'd be thrilled.  (Also, shipping was fast and easy).
