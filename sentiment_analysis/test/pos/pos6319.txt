Does what is says. Opens and holds a deck of cards. Easy to open and easy to close. very light. Folds into a card tray which is an added bonus. The card try is not the best but it does the job well enough. Card Caddy is very light but made from sturdy plastic. Overall it is well worth the price. Would recommend product to any one looking for a card carrier.
