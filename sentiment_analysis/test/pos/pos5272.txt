Been trying to get this food for the past three years to hawaii. I've got 2 dogs that I brought in from Texas and they both were on victors before they arrived and there body's were girthy and muscles definition.  Been using other 30/20 brands that I could fine locally and there were ok but not giving me the results I wanted.  Now they have been back on Victors for almost a month and they are gaining back there weight and muscle definition and they look forward to there feedings. Best dog food out on the market.
