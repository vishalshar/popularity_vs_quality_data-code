I only registered in Amazon to buy this bodyshave oil (not too happy with Amazon's behavior towards women lately regarding equality, diversity and inclusion). I'm a swimmer and I prefer to shave my legs if I don't have time to wax them. I discovered this product at my friend's house while I was staying with him. I have very sensitive skin and while I have experienced rashes with other products, I never had a reaction with this one. The oil leaves your skin smooth and I never had any cuts while shaving with this oil. I love the texture and smell. My legs look great and my skin is moisturized after every shaving. I love it!
