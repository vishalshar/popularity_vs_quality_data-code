By far my daughter's favorite thing to do with Osmo.  She is 6, so the Monster game is very engaging and she has spent a lot of time drawing and watching him drag it into the Ipad.  Very cool, and very fun.  I have read you can do this without purchasing this particular kit, but it is a nice white board with good markers and a cute package to keep them together.  So while not the cheapest way to do it, it works!  Only complaint is the orange marker for some reason is so much harder to erase than the other colors, not sure why that is but it really sticks to the board.
