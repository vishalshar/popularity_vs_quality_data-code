Because these treats are meant for dogs, they are rather large for cats. I actually consider this an advantage, because with small treats we would usually give multiples. The cats find it really fun to chase after one large treat and gnaw on it for a while.I love knowing that there is only one ingredient in this product; there are no fillers or surprises, it's just chicken breasts. They're a little pricey for what they are, however given the fact that we spend the money to buy whole food kibble for them, I don't think it's unreasonable to spend a little more to make sure they're getting a healthy nutritious treat. Our cats are a part of our family.Both cats loved these treats from the first time they tried them and have not gotten tired of them over time. In fact, this is become our new standby treat because it is both healthy and a real hit every night at treat time.
