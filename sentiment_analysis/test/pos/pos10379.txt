Best bang for your buck! Perfect for learning how to fly a quadcopter. The controls were a bit confusing at first but you get the hang of it pretty quick. I recommend getting some extra batteries and props because 10min of flying time just flys by... (you see what i did there?) and you're going to crash, quite a bit. Also... put the guard on...just trust me you'll be happy you did.
