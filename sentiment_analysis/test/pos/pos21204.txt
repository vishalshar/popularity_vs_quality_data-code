I've been using iCracked products since the second screen I replaced on an iphone 4. The quality difference between iCracked and the cheaper versions you can find is worth the increase in price. Each replacement comes with a quality tool set, well written step by step instructions, and as of late- return packaging to recycle your broken phone screen (a huge plus in my book). Out of about 15 phone screens replaced with iCracked, I finally got one that isn't quite up to snuff. There are some blotches on it (possible stuck pixels?). But between Amazon's return policy and iCracked support, I really haven't had an issue getting it exchanged. And let's be honest- there is no product out there that isn't going to have a bad one come out of a batch at some point so I really can't mark it down for that.Overall quality on the screens is great. They come with a glass shield pre-installed and to be honest I can't tell the difference between the original Apple part and the iCracked replacement.
