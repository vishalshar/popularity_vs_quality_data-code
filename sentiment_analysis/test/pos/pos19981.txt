My dogs simply love these treats. They look for them every morning before they are fed. Since we have been giving them my dogs with mild hip dysplasia have shown improvement. They are not as stiff when they get up and have their bounce back. We are never out of this wonderful product. My only wish would be a bigger bag. :)
