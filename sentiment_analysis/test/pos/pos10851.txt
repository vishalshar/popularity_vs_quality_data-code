I used another type of face cream before, but at age 35 the wrinkles are became more and more visible around my eyes. I've been using this Yonre Smoothing Hydrant Anti Wrinkle Cream for 2 weeks, and the difference is quite visible. Even after applying it, I can see and feel my skin turning smoother, softer, and my wrinkles also started fading. I'm very happy with the result so far.
