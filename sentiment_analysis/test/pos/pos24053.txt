For clarity, this is my first drone purchase. As such, comparisons to other drones will be at a minimum.There is a lot right with this drone but a few things that are MUST fixes that Autel has to address. (Hopefully in the next firmware update)1. Yaw rate. The Yaw spin on this drone is jerky and way too fast for any serious video-grapher or really even for the weekend warrior that wants to take a nice smooth video of his/her surroundings. When trying to transition the drone via yaw left or right, you will find that the video is very jerky and almost unwatchable. For me, this is a huge problem. The reason I bought the drone was to capture stunning 4k video, I am disappointed so far with the ability to do so with this drone.2. Live video lag is abundant with this model during flight. I experience a "stuttering" video lag during flight. I have the latest firmware and have a dedicated Samsung Galaxy A 8" that is dedicated to this drone only - meaning no other applications or wi-fi disturbance on the machine. However, even with this setup, during flight, you'll notice the video will lag on every flight. I don't think the lag I experience should be acceptable.These 2 issues I think deserve attention from Autel. They are most likely already fixing these but in the off chance they aren't, maybe they will see this review and take notice.Also - my friend has a Phantom 3 and I notice his flys much faster and quicker from spot to spot - seems like the Autel is a bit of a slouch when it comes to GPS flying.
