Purchased and set this up 3 days ago after seeing one at the vets so knew what it looked like and how the app functioned first hand.  I have 2 Huskies on 3 acres known to go on unauthorized walkabout although they have electronic collars - maybe 70% effective deterrent. Well, I let them out in the early morning (5AM) and got the text notification they were outside the zone within minutes of the infraction.  There are large areas of rural land here so I was unable to get to them easily.  They were accessible within the hour after they went to the local elementary school yard about 2 miles away.  I was able to use the cellphone app and map to walk within eyesight and call them over into the truck and back home. All-in-all it does what I needed and was very useful and sucessful. Setup was average for electronic stuff.  Setting the unit into the charging station to make good connection took some fiddling the first time for some reason.  A little pricy but plan on getting one more for the other dog - very satisfied.
