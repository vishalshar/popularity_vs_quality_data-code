I've used Lutron Maestro systems in two homes over several years. The Caseta system brings everything to a new level, allowing control of every light from a phone app, as well as other programming of "scenes" and even timing. (we do not have Lutron drapes). It took me five minutes to hook up the hub, only because my router is not that accessible. So far, I've hooked up eight zones (not including PICO remotes), and can see attaching several more as budgeting allows. The dimmers do what they're supposed to. Lutron is easy to install. Their customer technical support has always been helpful and clear. For example, I forgot that once a dimmer is "registered" with the smart hub, you have to use the App to marry the dimmer to the PICO remote. Incidentally, with the App, you can program a PICO to control more than one dimmer. (You need a wall adapter if you want to mount the PICO to the wall. It's easy.) I suggested to Lutron that they produce better instruction material (they have many YouTube videos) on the uses and limitations of the phone app, but that's quite minor. Point is, I received a response within 48 hours. That's customer service.FYI, Lutron has a list of devices that it's hub "works with." I can only speak to the Honeywell internet-connected thermostats. True, the thermostats can appear on the list of devices on the App, but control is very, very basic (raise/lower temps) and does not come close to matching Honeywell's own App. Just say'n...
