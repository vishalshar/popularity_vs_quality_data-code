Phone case is awesome.  I love the added magnet for added places to hold my phone. I have some metal over the sink and have been able to watch Youtube while washing dishes. I had a rokform case for my iPhone 4 and it was more stiff and seems tougher. This case cracked in the corner where the vibrate/sound button is in 2 places. This happened while removing the phone to clean it.  I have requested a replacement case, and awaiting delivery.
