Well, what can I say about this? I have used the Dream Water liquid for a couple years now, and use it every night. I decided to try the powder because my WalMart no longer carries Dream Water and Amazons prices were much too high at that time. The flavor of the powder is delicious, and you really don't need water, but I wonder about it sitting in your teeth all night?? Anyway, I usually take a sip of water after to rinse my mouth. No bad aftertaste or anything, just to rinse it away. Now, I do have one complaint: The package opens really easily, however, it rips down the middle of the package, leaving reeeaaally no way to dump this in your mouth without getting powder everywhere. I have learned to rip it open at the top in the middle, and then putting my fingernail inside the little lip at the top and pulling that fully open, and then dumping it in my mouth like a funnel.
