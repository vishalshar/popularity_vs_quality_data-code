WOW!! I CANNOT EXPLAIN HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS THING!! I HAVE A 7 MONTH OLD PUPPY THAT I AM TRUSTING OUT OF THE CAGE IN MY HOME AND BEING ABLE TO CHECK ON HIM THROUGHOUT THE DAY IS WONDERFUL!! THE APP IS FREE AND EASY TO INSTALL. THE BUTTONS ON YOUR PHONE ARE SIMPLE. I LOVE HOW I CAN TELL MY PUPPY THAT I MISS HIM AND WHEN HE LOOKS AT THE CAMERA I HIT A BUTTON AND CAN TAKE PICTURES OF HIM AND POST ON FB!! I ALSO LOVE THE BUTTON TO HIT THAT SHOOTS OUT LITTLE 1 INCH IN SIZE TREATS TO MY LITTLE GUY!! MAKE SURE YOU USE LITTLE TREATS LESS THAN AN INCH IN LENGTH TO AVOID DAMAGING THE MACHINE. ALSO THE MACHINE IS ALMOST A FOOT HIGH SO YOU CAN FILL IT WITH ALLOT OF TREATS !! I ALSO LOVE HOW YOU CAN EITHER VIEW YOUR ANIMALS IN COLOR OR HIT A SIMPLE BUTTON AND CHANGE OVER TO NIGHT VISION!! SO EVEN IF MY HOUSE IS DARK IN THE MORNING/EVENING, I STILL CAN SEE HIM CLEARLY!! NOTE THAT YOU CAN TALK TO YOUR ANIMALS AND THEY CAN HEAR YOU PERFECTLY BUT YOU CANT HEAR THEM BARKING BACK. I ACTUALLY PREFER THAT. LOL! I ALSO LIKE KNOWING THAT IT FEELS LIKE I HAVE A SECURITY SYSTEM HAVING THIS PETZI CAM BECAUSE IF GOD-FORBID SOMEONE WAS IN MY HOME I CAN SEE THEM, TAKE THEIR PICTURE AND EVEN YELL OUT THROUGH THE UNIT AND THAT PERSON WOULD THINK I WAS SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE AND HOPEFULLY THAT WOULD SCARE THEM INTO LEAVING. I ALSO LIKED KNOWING I CAN CHECK ON MY TEENAGERS TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE UP TO. LOL! I GIVE THIS THING 5 STARS AND MORE!!!
