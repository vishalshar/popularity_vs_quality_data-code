Wow, I now understand all of the fuss about virtual reality. The head tracking and 360 degree views are awesome! The technology simply makes you feel like what you are experiencing is the real thing, as opposed to just looking at something on a screen. The device is comfortable and the adjustable lenses made it easy for me to get a clear picture. For thrill seekers, there are apps like Cedar Point VR, a roller-coaster app which is really exciting. I personally really enjoy more relaxing experiences like the storytelling apps called Walking New York and Inside Syria. What a great way to learn about the world!It's so great that I don't need to own an expensive PC or gaming console to experience virtual reality. All I need is my iPhone (6+ in my case) and this!
