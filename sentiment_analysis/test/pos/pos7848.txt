I've had my FBV 3 for a few weeks, using it with an Amplifi 75.  I picked this up because I found trying to use the Amplifi app to be too slow for switching tones, especially while playing, To me, this combo is a great practice amp setup, it might work for some live performance, but will probably be too lacking for most serious players.  The FBV 3 seems solidly built and was pretty quick to figure out, which is good because the Line 6 documentation is minimal at best and not targeted to this setup. Luckily for my configure it was basically connect the ethernet cable that comes with, turn on the amp, and start playing.  One nice thing is there is no need for seperate power, for both USB and Ethernet connections it is line powered.My only complaints are that the colored LEDs are not currently supported for this configuration, I think only the FBV 3 with the Firehawk 1500 support the colored LEDs.  As my title mentioned, at this time compatible does not mean all features are fully supported on all configurations. Hopefully, line 6 will update things so that everyone can utilize the colors, it would make sense since the Amplifi app appears to use the same color coding. If not, hopefully they well be a little more up front/clear in their marketing  The other issue is that effects are basically hard wired to specific switches.  This wouldn't be a problem except you can change the order in the app, but the controller doesn't reflect this. Looking at the FBV II, they used to be more specific on the pedal board.  The app shows when there is a pedal switch, but it uses the the app effect icon (s,d,m.) not the pedal board values (FS1, FS2, etc.).  It would be nice if the app showed the foot switch assignment instead. Finally, the software update documentation is completely lacking.  I found out that there was already firmware update, but couldn't figure out how to get it to work.  They don't mention you need to download the Line 6 Software updater app (it's kind of hidden on the website).  I ended up trying another line 6 update app before finding help in their forums.Even with it's minor challenges, I think if you have an Amplifi and want to faster access to the built in tones or better switching for when practicing, the FBV 3 is a win.
