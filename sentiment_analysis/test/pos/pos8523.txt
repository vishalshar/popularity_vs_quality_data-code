Brought a Piper Box for my son as a Christmas gift at Bay Area Science Festival. We have bought a number of items for our kids to build their interest in STEAM. But nothing close to the Piper Box. This is very cool box. It taught him what went inside a computer, how to build a box and play electronics with minecraft. My son is minecraft fanatic and having minecraft ties to electronics was a great way to teach him electronics and how they interface with minecraft. He was proud to show it to his friends and at a ibrary fair. Every school and school library should own a Piper Lab. It's a great tool to teach kids STEAM.
