We got 3 of these for our 5, 8, and 9 year old grandchildren. The older children are learning rudimentary programming with  adult assistance, and the youngest can play using simple built-in commands. Parents and grandparents find it fascinating to operate too. This little robot is surprisingly complex and capable, and is very cute as it does its jobs. Cute sounds too. Makes it seem like a little person. We're all on a learning curve as we explore and experiment with its capabilities and quirks.
