Amazing - our 40plus year old son asked for it for Christmas when he couldn't think of anything else he needed or wanted.  It was the hit of Christmas proving even grown men can have fun with toys.  Our other son, an old school friend, a son-in-law and a nine year old niece joined him around the race track for an afternoon at the races.
