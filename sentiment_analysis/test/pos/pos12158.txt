It took me a while to find a gadget to run this. My phone should have been able to, but alas it does not support otg gadgets (and Alcatel A564c One Touch Pop). My older tablet (Asus Transformer 300t) wouldn't either. And I went to Sam's club and Staples, and unless I wanted to buy a new phone that Seek says is compatible or a new tablet which Seek says is compatible, I was out of luck there. Even bought some cables and adapters to add battery power in case that was the problem (it wasn't). So I bought a  ValuePad VP112-10 10-Inch 16GB Tablet for about $90. It works very well with this. There is some lag as some people have said. I'm deaf, so I don't hear any clicking, but I assume it does. My tablet's usb host slot faces the wrong direction, so I had to use a cable to aim this, but that's ok. I'm glad their app includes an option to choose different palette's because I didn't like the default. A suggestion to the manufacturer: maybe put some feedback in the app if the device doesn't meet requirements? Like usb host compatibility or something? Just getting the "Insert device" screen when the device is already inserted doesn't help. Also maybe read your support emails better instead of sending a canned response? Maybe also keep updating the supported device list? Have the app offer to send needed device info to you so that you could do this?
