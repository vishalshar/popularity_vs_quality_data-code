As long as you know what you are getting, this is a great product. If you purchase just the gLink device (no sensor to detect openings and no Internet gateway to remotely open/close), you can only open/close when you are in Bluetooth range with your phone. The app also has no clue if the door is open or closed (without the optional sensor), so this causes your phone to behave exactly like a dumb remote opener. I actually like this, as someone could hack an online account to open my garage door with an "Internet of Things" solution.Installation is super easy, and app setup is a breeze. Just know what you are getting here and you shouldn't be disappointed. Also, the device is much smaller than I was expecting (and very light).
