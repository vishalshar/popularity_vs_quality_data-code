Quite possibly the best thing we have in our nursery. Our baby had problems gaining weight during her first month of life due to acid reflux and later diagnosed with a milk protein allergy. Making sure she was gaining at least an ounce of weight every day was important for us and the comfort of doing that at home was a huge relief. The added benefit of tracking exactly how much she consumes when being breastfed is a real relief factor to my wife.The other great thing about the device is the companion app. The guys at Hatch literally thought of everything you need to track for your baby. And the ability to share the app with other care givers is a huge benefit, especially when I am at the office all day.Thank you Hatch Baby for making an amazing product. I cant wait to see what else you guys add in your eco system.
