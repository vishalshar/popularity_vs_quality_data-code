This is my go to brand for Xylitol. I like using it in my baked goods mostly or to sweeten my tea. It is a great low glycemic and lower calorie sweetener that prevents tooth decay and kills yeast for those of us trying to avoid sugar for that reason. I grind this up in my Vitamix to make powdered "sugar" for making coconut whipped cream or marzipan and it works great as well!
