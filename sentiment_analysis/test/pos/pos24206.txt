This thing is awesome.  I was a little skeptical of how well it would work but have been blown away since it delivered.  It cannot be knocked over with any normal-style bumping and pushing that may occur.  And when you pick up to drink, it lifts of the table with no effort, no lag or tension.  It's literally like picking up any other cup or tumbler.  Great, great product for my house where the wife to whom I'm married leaves coffee cups 90% drank all over the place and my kids move around w impunity to knock them over.
