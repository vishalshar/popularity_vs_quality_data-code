I bought 2 of these so far.  Really like them.  The app is the instructions FYI.  I see people complaining no instructions in box. App walks you thought the installation. I have to say even easier to install than Wemo or Ring Video, all install pretty similar. This is just little even easier in my opinion.  I have found for all these devices you follow instructions and just give it 3-5 minutes more at the very end. Updates and connecting take a few minutes and if you are wanting it instant you will just get frustrated. My second one was for a gate and could not  use the laser for open or closed, but the garadget people pointed me in the right direction and it's working good now. Compared to what is out there this is worth the money. I plan to buy a few more. It will be fun to see new ideas added as time goes on. I sense they are thinking of new ideas for the app.
