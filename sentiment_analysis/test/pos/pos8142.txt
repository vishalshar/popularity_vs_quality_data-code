My dog was diagnosed last year with cancer.  After all kinds of tests due to lymph gland swellings, then vomiting regularly and blood work for tick borne diseases. He was fast going down hill.  Vet had him on prednisone and we all know that this is a temporary fix....I looked on your site and found testimonials on this organic pet superfood.  I purchased it locally while I waited for the box to arrive from you....WITHIN A WEEK my 13 year old dog who was acting like he was on his death bed (and I believe as did the vet that he was) was no longer lethargic, had lots more energy and by the 2nd week he was running and playing with my other dog. Swellings gone and bumps disappeared completely by the 3rd week.  We are now in our second year together!!!!!  We are taking this product everyday along with coral calcium and we will never go off of it....My vet even wanted to know what had helped my dog.  Trail rides are still on our weekly schedule once again, he keeps up in pace and the next day is never sore as he had been...I APPAULD YOUR PRODUCT AND THANK GOD FOR EVERY EXTRA DAY YOU HAVE GIVEN US!!!!!
