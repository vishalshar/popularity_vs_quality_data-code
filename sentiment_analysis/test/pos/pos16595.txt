My cat is a mutt, but it's obvious he has some Maine Coon in him. He's a big cat with a LOT of fur.We used to feed him Purina One, which in hindsight obviously upset his little tummy, and he would get hairballs and knots all the time. We tried brushing more, buying him self-brushing toys, hairball treats - you name it, we tried it.Finally, we switched to this grain-free, awesome dry cat food and poof! No more puking everywhere, only the occasional hairball. The food I think helped his coat quite a bit as it generally tangles less now, even with less brushing than before. He absolutely loves the stuff too.All in all would totally recommend and we'll be customers for life.
