I don't know why people complain about this. I take my coffee black, except iced coffee which I'll take with cream. This honestly doesn't taste too far off from iced coffee with cream, especially when chilled (which is the only way you should drink it.) It makes a perfect breakfast that's cheaper than 90% of my breakfasts anyway.I also drink one Soylent 2.0 throughout the day and I love it. The tastes of these two drinks is very non-offensive, so I'm surprised by the adverse reactions on here.
