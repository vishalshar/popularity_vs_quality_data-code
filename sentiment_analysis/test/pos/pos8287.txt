I love having a combo watch / activity tracking device.  This one still has room for refinement.  The watch face cannot be read in the dark (no backlight) nor in direct bright light (due to glare off the face).  In bright light, you need to keep twisting your wrist until you can find the silver hands against the black background (the white activity hand is always readable).  I find myself calibrating the time and activity gauge every few days because it tends to run noticeably slow after a few days, and the activity hand doesn't always reset to exactly zero.  Finally, the Withings app has taught me to keep the Bluetooth on my phone turned off unless I want to sync.  Otherwise my phone battery life will suffer significantly.  None of these issues make me unhappy with the purchase. I trust that Withings will continue to improve the platform, some of which could be delivered through firmware and app upgrades.
