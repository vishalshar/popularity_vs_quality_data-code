After watching Mythbusters about how difficult it is to get out of your car if you are going under water I went looking for an auto escape tool.  I choose this one because it comes in an convenient case that straps on your sun visor.  I received the item put it in my car and it fits great and is not in the way at all.  Now if I need this it is handy and with in reach.
