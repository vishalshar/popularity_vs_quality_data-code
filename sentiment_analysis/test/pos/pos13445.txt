These are the ones that are served on the airline flights to/from Florida, and they are delicious. My grandson is allergic to Pistachios and Cashews, and these are NUT FREE so he doesn't have to worry at all. Perfect size for school snacks (he's in grade 1). I was so glad to find them available on Amazon!
