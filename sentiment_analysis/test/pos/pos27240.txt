These headphones do work pretty well, and I am happy with the purchase.  The sound is good and surprisingly the microphone works quite well for phone calls (I took multiple calls while in the middle of a ski slope and continued talking while skiing once and my brother on the other end of the call could not tell that I was outside skiing).  A few other comments:- The size of the speakers are a bit bulky which puts a bit of pressure on your ears when inserted in the ear flap of the ski helmet.- You do have to be a bit patient with the operation of the buttons.  There is a brief delay of operation after pressing the buttons and you are not always sure you are actually pressing the button or not (through your ear flaps).  The more I used it however, the better I was with the operation.- The Walkie-Talkie function is not real useable/practical in my opinion.
