The product functions well as a cable holder and looks nice. However it is much thinner and more flexible then I would have guessed.  For the $16 that I paid for it, I expected it to be more rigid and thick. Even when used as suggested and avoiding wrapping the cord "too tight", the fin area of the holder bows in.  That concerns me for longevity sake but only time will tell. I would order it again, but only if I could get it at a better price.
