I had been keeping an eye on this key holder for a long time. I first discovered Orbit through Instagram, and it quickly caught my attention. After much deliberation, I decided to get it for my birthday.I have had it for a couple of weeks now, and I simply love it. It should be noted, the actual product is pretty small. I guess I had imagined a bigger piece of leather. However, this is perfect. Since it is really small, it can fit in my pockets, backpack, or anywhere I put it without any problems. The leather is soft, yet tough enough to endure all day in a pocket. Currently, I have three keys and the bottle opener, and it works very smoothly.Overall, it is a great purchase. This key holder is perfect for the modern man. Great and classy accessory. Although a bit pricey, I would recommend it. However, if you have more than 5 keys, I would not recommend you buy it, as this seems to work better with not-too-many keys.Cheers ~
