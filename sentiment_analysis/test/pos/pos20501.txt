bought an extra mount for my second commuter bike. Quad lock is a great system. Although I don't care for the case for daily use (but use it all the time) it isn't comfortable to hold. I do rely on it for daily use. If you are thinking of getting another cheaper system... I would recommend this over topeak - it holds the phone securely, and the waterproof sleeve is brilliant.
