We have 2 beagles and they both wear these collars.  We've been using them for about 3 months and so far no issues.  The battery seems to last a long time - we keep the collars turned-on all the time (even when the dogs are not wearing them), and charge them maybe once a week if we remember.  The beep to warn the dog of the fenceline is audible and after one enocounter with the shock from the fence, both of them listen to the warning tone and stay within the fence line.  We did have to use the larger prongs (included) even though are dogs are short-haired.  Overall, we have no issues and would highly recommend this collar.
