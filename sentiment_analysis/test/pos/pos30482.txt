Was searching for a good COLD BREW COFFEE - Even bought a cold brew coffee maker for almost $100 (all glass) didn't like that at all.  Started the search again in Amazon and read the reviews on BIZZY.  The great reviews helped me to make the purchase and I am SOOOOOO happy I did.  Made iced coffee within minutes of receiving the package and did a little happy dance in my kitchen.  It is SOOOOO good, refreshing and smooth.  Not bitter at all.  I'll be placing another order very soon - don't want to chance running out.  Almost wish I could order it in KEG form.....LOL
