These pillows are a bit expensive and a bit bulky to lug around , but like most reviewers have stated , they are multipurpose. I specifically bought this pillow for my husband for our long trip overseas. He has a ruptured disk and was bemoaning the fact that he would be sitting on a plane for 12 hours, but these pillows were a life saver. They helped take the edge off his back pain and made it more comfortable for him to sleep sitting. He also uses this pillow at home to support his neck and lower back while watching t.v.
