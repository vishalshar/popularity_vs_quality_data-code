This stuff is pretty good. Definitely recommend the "Thyme & Lemongrass" scent, it's pleasant and mild and appropriate for men or women.  My skin is very sensitive and develops a rash to almost every conventional drugstore antiperspirant / deodorant (especially to the aluminum salts).  The Pit Paste helps a great deal with odor control, but does little to stop sweating. (That's fairly expected, not surprising.)In my experience, this product is vastly superior to "Tom's of Maine" aluminum-free deodorant.  I also prefer it over "Schmidt's Natural Deodorant".
