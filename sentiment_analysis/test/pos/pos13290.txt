I have an 2011 Infiniti G25 with an HTC Sensation and this car mount works the best on it. I have gone through three types of car mounts and I was never pleased with anyone of them. I live in Houston and it gets really hot here in the summers. First one I ever tried was a vent car mount. Big mistake because I forgot that one of your vents gets blocked while use it. I was searching Amazon hoping that some one out there came up with a better idea. And there showed up the CD mount. Awesome! It works even if you are using your CD player. Already tested that. But in this day and age when cars come loaded with USB ports for smartphones and jump drives, who really still uses their CD players? LOL. The product is built well, I don't think it feels cheap at all. Just adjust the screw at the bottom to have it fit tightly in the CD slot, and you are off. This mount should work in all Infiniti sedans since they have similar interiors. I definately recommend this product.
