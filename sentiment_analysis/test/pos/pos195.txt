LOVE IT! The price, the quality, the convenience of the handle, the design, all make this the perfect kid's iPad protector. My grandson had an otterbox defender on his iPad for three years. While it did a great job protecting it, it's weight was clunky for small hands. When I bought one of these for his brother's new iPad, he wanted to switch to this. It's lived up to protecting the iPad from drops, so I'm happy.
