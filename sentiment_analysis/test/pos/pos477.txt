This is seriously the best litter I have ever used. I had no idea there was litter like this. I had been desperately searching for something as I was so sick of being able to smell litter perfume and cat poop in my small house, no matter what litter I tried.. This lasts forever if you scoop  semi-regularly and has no odor. Love it.
