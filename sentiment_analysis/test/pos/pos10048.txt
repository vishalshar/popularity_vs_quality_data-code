I never write reviews but I need to write this one. My 9lbs yorkie has been sick for over 2 months. He wouldn't open his right eye and was in constant pain. He would literally cry through the night and I would have to hold him and massage him as much as possible to ease his pain. After various vet visits, going to two specialists and $1k later they think my dog might have a tumor behind his right eye and if that's the case there is not much they can do and I need to be prepared to ease my dogs pain and put him down.Hearing that news was heartbreaking but I felt I was being selfish for letting him live in such pain. I was getting ready to make his euthanasia appointment when I randomly looked up dog cancer on Amazon. It has only been a week since my dog has been on this supplement and his changes are night and day!!! He no longer cries. He opens his right eye! He is completely off all the 4 meds he was on before (that never helped him). He started eating again!!! I was having to force this powder mixed with peanut butter down his throat so he would eat and I'm so glad I did! Even my husband who is a huge skeptic can't believe how well our dog is doing.I don't know how much time we have left with our dog but I'm thankful everyday for having my dog back to his old self even if it's for a short period of time.I have been giving my dog this powder two times per day at the maximum amount. It's only been a week and I'm really hoping he just keeps getting better everyday. Thank you for this product! My only regret is that I didn't look up supplements sooner. Sometimes the holistic way is the best way.
