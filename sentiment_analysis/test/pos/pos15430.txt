This 8-pack was a great value. This stuff is pretty amazing (5-star product) but the quantity is somewhat small. I used my Sugaru to mold "pads" for my roof rack that were custom-fit to my roofline. They look great and have held up great so far. For bigger projects like that, it would be great if the little packets were a bit bigger (docked 1 star for small amount of glue).
