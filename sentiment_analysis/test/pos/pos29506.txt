I wear it everyday! You can control Pandora and iTunes to advance music and volume change, but it doesn't work for YouTube. It gives you weather, encouraging start/end of day remarks about steps taking or sleep. It can be more accurate for sleep and heart rate, but it's absolutely fantastic to be able to answer a telephone call from the watch, which gives me extra time to reach for the cellphone. Also, I am less likely to ever  miss important alerts/texts/calendar items. I never take it off, and battery lasts at least 3-4 days. I love it.
