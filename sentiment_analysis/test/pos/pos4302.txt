I am a long time fitbit 'one' user. When i first got my Spire i was initially wearing both trackers as i couldn't get myself to part from my 'one'. The Fitbit is more flashy, has all the bells and whistles, connects with numerous apps and has a great dashboard with heaps of info, etc, etc.Spire on the other hand is more simple and plain. it's not like the flashy 'One', but there is something deeper here. It connects your feelings. It let's me know when i am getting stressed out, giving a gentle buzz so i can calm myself down. This is huge for your health, stress can accumulate and rear its ugly head in the form of disease. It also tracks the amount of time  i am calm or focused during the day. I got a similar step total wearing both trackers, so i ditched my 'Bit' and enjoy wearing the more useful Spire.They are still new, so the app hasn't been fully developed yet, but it's good enough to give you the data you need.
