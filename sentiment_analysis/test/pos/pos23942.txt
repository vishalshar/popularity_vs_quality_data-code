I love this speaker, It really looks and feels so great and durable. The packaging was beautiful that it came in and it was a great speaker to open. It was so easy to connect to the bluetooth and I was blown away with how loud the speakers could go.I am about to bike through Latvia and Estonia and I can't wait to latch this speaker onto my bike while I explore. I will post more pictures after my trip to show how well it latches!
