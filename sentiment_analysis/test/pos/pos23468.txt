I was over the moon when I came across this prenatal that both had the right kind of folate for my MTHFR diagnosis and NO IRON!! I cannot express how difficult it is to find a prenatal vitamin that meets both of those criteria that won't break the bank. As a perk, they're super tasty! I split my dose into a "dessert" at the end of each meal.  I personally cannot tolerate iron, even at low doses, and must must must have methylfolate. Thank you so much, Smarty Pants, for the perfect formulation for me. Please don't change it!
