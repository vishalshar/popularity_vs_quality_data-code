This is definitely a cool invention. Since I've been riding in breeches in the summer since they're cooler than jeans, this has been a lifesaver in keeping my phone near me since breeches (and I know running pants) don't have phone pockets. This really really does stay in place unless you have a horse that has a giant canter and is going at a good clip. So it's fine for runners and if you're a little more two-point when cantering.
