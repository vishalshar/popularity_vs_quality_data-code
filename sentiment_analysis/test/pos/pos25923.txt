:(I purchased a Pebble 2 after hearing a friend and my brother go on and on about how much they love their Pebbles. My brother has a Pebble Time and my friend has a Pebble (original) and Pebble 2 (KS edition.)  My daily driver when I ordered the Pebble was my Moto 360 (1st gen) which I loved, but was frustrated by the battery life.  I wore a Pebble original for a few days before finally pulling the trigger to purchase here on Amazon.I was instantly in love with how bright and white it was, but also scared that it would get dirty quick.  I can say that I've had the watch for well over a month now and it hasn't gotten dirty one bit.I am in love with the fact that I can go for 7-8 days before needing to recharge my battery.I love not dealing with Android Wear.I love that it feels light on the wrist and is super comfortable. I wear it all day, even to bed. It is way more comfortable on my wrist than the Pebble original.The always on display is fantastic - don't have to worry about any sort of wrist flip to see the time.Non-touchscreen - never thought I'd say that's a plus, but after accidentally calling people because my watch thought I pressed the call button, holy crap.It's definitely water resistant... I've showered and dunked my hand in swimming pools with this thing on. No worries whatsoever.All in all, I know that Pebble was bought by Fitbit and we have no idea what's going to happen to our watches in a year, but this thing is great. For the price you're paying for the device you're getting, it's so great. I am loving my Pebble 2 and am so so sad that I only came in to this right at the end of Pebble's short life.
