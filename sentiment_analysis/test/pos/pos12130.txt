I got this for my birthday and was so excited when it arrived.  I've never flow any type of RC plane, drone, etc. so I was worried that I would just crash this on the first flight.  It's now day 3 and I've flown a dozen times with no incident.  It's so easy to fly!  Let go of the sticks and it stops in its tracks and waits for me.  In 5MPH winds I can land it in my truck bed. The video is amazing as are the still photos that come back.  I was able to do a roof inspection from the ground. Everything worked perfectly right out of the box and the setup was a breeze. Nice job Autel!
