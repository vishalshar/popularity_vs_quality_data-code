I absolutely loved my Ticwatch but had to sell it due to terrible connection issues with iOS.  Add to that - none of the reply to notifcation settings work due to iOS and the watch was just not enough.... I don't blame Ticwatch at all. I loved the watch so much I momentarily considered switching to android. (Never thought I would say that outloud) I may try this watch out again in 6 months - a year to see if the connection issues remain.  Also hoping they can figure out a text-reply work around like pebble did....
