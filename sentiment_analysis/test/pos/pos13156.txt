Finally a fitness tracker that's focused on women! Sleep and activity features are pretty much what I expected and was looking for. They track steps, calories and sleep duration. I haven't noticed any issues and the readings seem accurate to me. The breathing exercises are relaxing, but I don't use them as much. The app for my iPhone is easy to use, although quite basic in some areas. Leaf is such a pretty little thing. I enjoy wearing it, and it really stands out with design. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase. I would recommend the Leaf if you are looking for a basic fitness tracker that also looks very nice.
