I brew  kombucha, which is a fermented, probiotic, naturally carbonated tea consumed for digestive health.  Through the brewing process the metal lids can have an adverse reaction to the tea.  reCAP has solved this issue!  The reusable plastic tops are perfect for storing this healing drink!  THANK YOU ReCap!
