Energize does a fantastic job! Like instant clarity of thought even in the midst of a hangover, with an added slight energy boost. Calm has given a mild change, but I suffer anxiety and I think it has a hard time breaking through that. Although I should say I absolutely still enjoy the effect. Had a super stressed out buddy (and fellow skeptic) use it when he was antsy and pacing. Had him chill in 15 minutes, he loved it. This device has great potential if it works on you. Not a toy or gimmick, it works people. Skip the latte, have a zap.
