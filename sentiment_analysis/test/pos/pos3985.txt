This is great if you live in a highrise, or if you are unable to walk your dog multiple times a day. We used it without the pee pods and just drained it into the toilet. While this works, i'm sure it's a bit more messy than using the pods. The grass will last for months, and you can easily find replacements online. MUCH better than using wee pads, and better for the environment! This is our second one, as we relocated and prefered not to bring the used one with. We've used Pet Loo's for about 2 years now, and absolutely love them.
