I own both the Mountek Grip and the Mountek Snap+.  I've had the grip for a year now, and it serves its purpose.  In my new car (Malibu 15) it doesn't stay in the CD slot as well as it did in the old car (Malibu 12).  The new version on the Snap+ was supposed to hold in the CD slot better, and it does.  When not in use, the grip takes up a lot more room than the Snap+.  I was getting tired of messing with the arm release on the Grip, so decided to look for and upgrade to a magnetic mount.  The Snap+ (versus the Snap3) was advertised to have HeavyDuty magnetic strength grip.  I was disappointed to find out it has the same number of magnets as the Snap3, even though it has space for twice as many magnets.  My hope was to stick the larger metal plate on the inside of my iPhone 5s kickstand case.  The magnets were not strong enough to hold it the case in this manner.  The case I have does not allow for applying the metal plate to the outside of this particular case.So while I've been very satisfied with the Mountek Grip, my expectations were set too high for the Snap+ and I feel I've been misled by their representation of magnetic strength versus the Snap3; to which I also assumed would be strong than the competing and less expensive competitors.  Other than that, I'm happy with the Snap+Update 2015-03-25 - I've switched to a newer kickstand case, that works much better with the Snap+. The Aduro Cache http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NB704L4 can accomodate the larger metal plate inside or outside the case, and still allow the kickstand to operate.I was previous using a case by i-Blason http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0098T62GA that the metal plates were not working with.  The magnet was not strong enough to work with the large metal plate inside the case, and the outside of the case could not accommodate the smaller metal plate and still allow the kickstand to operate.Update 2015-04-08 - I've switched to a new slim case http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IODNLYC  I've installed the square metal plate to the outside of the new case (the plate is too thick to use inside of this particular case).  The magnetic hold is EXCELLENT.  Very happy with the combination of the new case and this mount (with the metal plate on the outside of the case).I did order some replacement metal plates (the larger ones) directly from Mountek.  They were shipped in a padded envelope and received severely bent.  They did promptly replace them, and reshipped in an actual box :pAs for the title "does not appear to have a stronger magnetic hold".  I think the description of the Snap+ is actually misleading. I don't think they are trying to imply the magnetic hold is strong, but rather the grip into the CD player/slot is stronger.
