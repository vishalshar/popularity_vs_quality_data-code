Does pretty much what it's advertised to do. It's pretty much completely unspillable unless you do something completely outrageous to it. Unfortunately it isn't really the product for me though as it's far too expensive for what it does. If you find yourself spilling drinks a lot though I'm 100% sure it's worth the money!
