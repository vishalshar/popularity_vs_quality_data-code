This is the mac daddy of Apple Watch cases.Prior to this case, I had the catalyst case. It was a decent case but did not offer a whole lot of customization. It was just black.This case is a bit large for smaller wrists, that may deter some. But its very masculine. It has worked flawlessly in the pool and on multiple mud runs.I would suggest a different color, as this band the graphic does start to wear off over time.
