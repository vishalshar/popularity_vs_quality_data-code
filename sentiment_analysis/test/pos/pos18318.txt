Having a bunch of friends addicted to Cards Against Humanity, and the responses being pretty generic.... This game is a nice change of pace. Answers actually have some thought put in to them, and then can be as PG or ridiculous as you want to make them. Definitely used several times when drinking, and wound up being everyone's new favorite game.
