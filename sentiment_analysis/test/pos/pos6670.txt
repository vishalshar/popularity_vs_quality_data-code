This Enclave 5.1 system produces a very clean surround sound using the new WISA technology at a reasonable price.  Only took about 15 minutes to open the boxes and set it up. If you are looking for a wireless system that doesn't break the bank and sounds really good then this is the one to buy....YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
