cant live without this product. i was so worried when i was going on vacation and i was leaving my dog with a new dog sitter. it works through verizon. it shows the location of the tracker. it sends you activity reports. the only issue is that it updated on the network every 12 minutes so if the puppy is on the move you might not get the actual location but close enough.
