Got this working with or without a WPS enabled router with no issue (less than 10 min).Both the processes are simple and straightforward.The sensor works very well and sensitivity can be controlled from the app. The monitoring period is highly customizable. However my major issue is not getting push notification when motion is detected. If the device is disconnected I get notification but cannot set it up to provide notification when motion is detected.  The option does not even show up under "My Actions". I am using iPhone 6 OS 8.1.1.I have emailed customer service, if this issue is resolved I will give 5 star.
