Ordered these snacks for my brother's family. He has two girls ages 5 & 2. They loved every one of the snack packs. My sister n law didn't love the apricots, but the girls and my brother thought they were tasty.  Just ordered them a second delivery. LOVE how everything is organic and pre-packaged ready to take with you. They took a couple of the bags to Disneyland for some healthy snacks. Easy!
