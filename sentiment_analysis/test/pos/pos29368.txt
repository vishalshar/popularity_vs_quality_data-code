I've never felt the need to leave a review until I bought the Feed and GO Smart Pet Feeder; it has greatly helped our little snowball cat and given us the freedom to not worry about when we have to leave an event or work function to go home and feed her. Our cat is a diabetic cat and our work schedules are super crazy busy with travel and meetings. This feeder has definitely given us the peace of mind that we need that our cat is eating at her scheduled time each day and she's doing great throughout the day. I feel that her diabetes is very well controlled now that we are using the Feed and Go feeder and her blood sugar levels are controlled. Also, great customer service! Alex is very responsive and helpful. :)
