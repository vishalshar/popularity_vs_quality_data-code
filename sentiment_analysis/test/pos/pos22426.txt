I own an embarrassing number of headphones priced from  $12.00 to  $700.00. I am always looking for that set that stands out in their price point.Well after being blown away by 1More's triple driver iem's I thought I would give these a try. Well 1More has made a solid entry into this price point.The build quality is excellent with a very nice appearance. They come with a nice storage bag.No matter how good a set of headphones look only one thing counts and that is sound.These headphones have a very good sound for this price point. The bass is good with faithful reproduction. It is not bloated or unnaturaly boosted. If you are used to listening to cheap headphones, Beats or their spins offs with artificialy bloated bass to cover up poor audio performance these may not be for you.Mid's are smooth and not stepped on by the bass like so many low cost cans.High's sing a nice tune with a little sparkle and no perceived sibulance.The sound stage is fairly large with good instrument separation.I am very pleased with the sound of these headphones for the price. Are they audiophile cans no but for the money they give you a peek into what music truly sounds like. You will have a hard time finding a pair of headphones that match the sound of these at anywhere near this price.Update 8/14/16: Used the 1More burn in app and man their sound just got better. The bass got deeper and tighter. Mid's remained smooth and silky. High's improved with better sparkle and better accuracy. These are probably the best sounding headphones for the price period.While burning them in which takes about a week I placed the headphones on a omega shaped headphone stand. I had them adjusted to there smallest setting and placed them on the widest point of the stand to stretch the headband. This improved the clamping force making them more comfortable.
