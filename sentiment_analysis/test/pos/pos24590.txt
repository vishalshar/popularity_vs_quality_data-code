I've bought two systems already and ordering two more as gifts for my nieces. My grandson is seven and loves playing with his brother and me when he comes to visit on weekends.  My grandchildren in Maryland couldn't wait to get OSMO after I sent them the video of us playing Words.  The other games are fun, too.  Makes learning fun...very educational!I read reviews where parents are concerned because system can only work if IPad is out of cover.  We have never had a problem with the stand toppling over; however, if the company could come up with a way to play without having to remove the cover, it would be more convenient.  My grandchildren's iPads are in protective cases, so taking them on and off could become a hassle at some point.  But, as I have a tablet cover that opens like a book, having to remove it to play the game is never a problem for me.I had to contact customer service because I was missing a letter.  I was blown away with the prompt turnaround in responding to my request and shipment of replacement letter at no cost.  Exceptional customer service ever!  OSMO is well worth the money!
