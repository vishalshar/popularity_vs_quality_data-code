I love using this for searing foods in a super hot cast-iron pan. I've used it to sear fish, steak, and even grill foods. It doesn't have much of a taste, so it doesn't mess up my seasonings or marinades. I like using it in salad dressing too, if I want something milder than olive oil. All in all, great, as advertised! :)
