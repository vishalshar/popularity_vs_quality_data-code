These things are awesome. Very sturdy. It's got a nice texture to it, one that doesn't fee terrible but enough to texture to hold food without making it slip. It's got a nice thickness to it, so cutting through some tough meat shouldn't be a problem. I use it for ice cream to be honest because using silverware freezes the tongue. I've also just used it for salads, Mac and cheese and lasagna. Simple things that I pack for lunch, no problems.
