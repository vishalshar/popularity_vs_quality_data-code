I have never been more fit thanks to Misfit. I found the step tracking to be very accurate and cross checked it with 3 different devices and was very close. The form factor here is awesome and I get lots of compliments. The app that accompans is good, not great but with every update it gets better. Love the fact I don't have to take it off to charge and more important love the fact I can wear it on my ankle. I used the 8mm spring bars and made an adjustable leather bracelet to put mine on.
