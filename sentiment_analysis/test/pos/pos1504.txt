I have taken this to my game group for 3 weeks now and people love it. first off its great that we can play with up to 12 people cause sometimes we have even more than that wanting to join a game. second, the gameplay is so much better than regular accusation games because of how many cards you have and the accusation function. It's been requested ever since that fist week.
