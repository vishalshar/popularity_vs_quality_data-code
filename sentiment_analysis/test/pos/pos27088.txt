Have had for a few months and love this thing.  It just changes the taste and texture of a bottled beer to be more to draft like.There are some cons:1. Learning when to go from standard output to foam output without getting too much foam.2. Bulky, now thinking about buying the newer version from Fizzics, the Waytap.3. Causes me to drink the beer more quickly, thus increasing consumption of beer.Seriously, this thing is golden.  Restaurants that do not serve draft beer should invest in a few of these, it will increase the size of an average receipt per customer as they have one or two more beers per visit.
