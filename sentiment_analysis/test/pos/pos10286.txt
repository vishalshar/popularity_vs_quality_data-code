Recently I've been having headache and soreness around the back of my neck, so I've decided to give this one a try. I've seen other similar posture correction devices too, but they seemed too small and finicky. This one also seemed like  the best solution for me learning towards my laptop too much in an awkward posture that hurt my neck and eyes.ALEX won't stop the soreness, but it definitely make you think twice about your posture.Pros: It's easy to use and feels comfortable enough to use, even with my long hair. The legs are adjustable so you can change the shape according to your head. You can also customize your own alert setting, so it doesn't keep distract you while trying to focus on work - if you have a bad posture like I do, you can set it to vibrate once every 5 minutes. Thankfully, it does measure your posture quire accurately. Also the battery life seems quite long, so charges are few and far between.Cons: It sits on your ears, so it could cause problems if you wear glasses. If you wear it outside, you might look weird. To be honest, this isn't mean to be worn all the time.
