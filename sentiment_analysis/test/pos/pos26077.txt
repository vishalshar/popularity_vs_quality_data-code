A little pricey, but I absolutely love this case so I think it's worth it! The case is cute, classy, and even though I have stuffed a ton of cards into the elastic, it can still hold one card just as securely as 3 or more. I like that this case is protective and can hold my cards, but isn't super bulky while doing it. I did have an issue almost a year after I purchased the case in which the wood backing of the case cracked. However, I immediately emailed them, and a customer service rep got back to me within the day about a discounted replacement. Fantastic customer service and product!
