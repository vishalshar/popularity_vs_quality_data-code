My wife and I just had our first baby a few weeks ago, and we are already loving the Starling. As a new parent, there is so much information out there about what to do in the first few months and its so overwhelming. We learned about the importance of words for newborns especially, and having the Starling on our son has been helpful in reminding us to talk to him as much as we can. Its great to check our word count on our phones throughout the day, and actually a good reminder to make sure to put our phones away again when we see that our word count isnt as high as we had hoped. My wife and I are both very concerned about our sons education, and so it feels good to be able to start doing something to help him get ahead and be successful even way before its time for him to start school or daycare. It is a little hard to use the Starling for newborns because he is changing in and out of clothes all day, but once we got used to it its not that bad. And as he gets older I know well keep using it. I would recommend this to any new parent who values education and wants to make sure they are doing everything they can for their child, right away.
