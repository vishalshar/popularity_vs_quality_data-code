I actually love it but the reviewers mentioning the suction cups not working is true. Of course i made sure to clean the surfaces with rubbing alcohol first and for about two months, most of the suction cups would stay attached. But each one slowly stopped working until it no longer could stay on the bowl. It's on the floor now, but I need to figure a good way to attach it.It could be 5 star but I gave it 4, it could even be 3 star since I can't use it the way it is.I would still recommend it, just be prepared to find a better connection solution.
