I've been using Pit Paste for about 6 months now, have tried several scents, and it is the absolute best deodorant I've ever used. I am a major sweater, and this stuff keeps me dry. The scents are very robust at first, and then become neutralized a little while after application. I love the Orange Creamsicle and the Thyme and Lemongrass.  I also like the scent of the Lavender, but I found that it does not seem to work as long and does not keep me as fresh while working out.  I recently put Pit Paste to the ultimate test...a week-long car cruise through the south (The Hot Rod Power Tour, for those of you who are car enthusiasts), in 100 degree weather, with no a/c in the car. I brought a stick of Royal & Rogue with me on the trip, because I felt that a stick would be handy if I needed to reapply during the day.  Royal & Rogue is not my favorite scent by any means (smells like medicine to me), but boy did it work! After driving 3-5 hours each day with no a/c and then arriving at our outdoor daily events in the sweltering heat, I did not once smell, nor did I have to reapply! On day 5 of our trip, I could not find my stick:( - must have left it in a hotel room or dropped it somewhere from my bag?? I was crushed. I happened to bring a stick of my old tried-and-true Secret Deodorant in Oh So Summerberry.  Let me just say that the last 2 days in the heat were awful. I was sweating, a little smelly, and had to reapply.  Pit Paste is amazing, and I am more than willing to pay a little more for deodorant that works and isn't loaded with chemicals.  As a side note, I did have a bit of a painful breakout under my arms, after having used the deodorant for approximately 3 months. I switched back to my former deodorant for a couple days, my pits healed, and I went back to using Pit Paste with no problems since. Buy this stuff! I cannot imagine that you could be disappointed.
