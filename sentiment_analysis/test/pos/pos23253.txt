The GOOD: multiple colors, malleable, turns into a "hard rubber" on curing (not a plastic, still slightly soft, like a basketball), gives you the chance to fix things in the "plastic" world with more than just glue and hope.The BAD: once you open a packet, it's use it or lose it.  For most applications, this is just fine -- they give you ball of the stuff about the size of half a man's thumb ... but if you are looking to use it for something small (e.g. I've seen people suggest using Sugru to refill numbering on appliance knobs that have worn clear), then you're frantically looking for other places to apply this stuff before the whole ball cures and you have to throw it away.The VERDICT: this is nifty stuff and definitely does what it promises -- if you smush it around a wobbly plastic part, it will become a solid rubber boot to support that part.  When you look to use a packet, either prepare to toss the extra, or line up all your jobs at once and do them in the 30+ minutes you have - not difficult.HELPFUL SUGGESTION: if you're repairing something visible, get a razor blade or other flat piece of metal to help shape the putty (and maybe a spoon for curving).  Otherwise, your fix will look like a blob of colored silly putty, complete with thumb prints.
