For the longest time, choosey me chose either Jif or one of the nut butters from Peanut Butter & Co., until a friend turned me on to Good Spread. Since then, I haven't purchased, or wanted to purchase, another brand of peanut butter.Good Spread is a smooth peanut butter that easily spreads on toast for sandwiches or into combinations of steal cut oatmeal. It's also great for baking and the jars of butter never separate into an oily mess. Slightly sweeter than your average peanut butter, it's offset nicely with hints of sea salt. You might say I love this peanut butter and even eat spoonfuls out of the jar. And after polishing off another buttery container, I can feel slightly good about myself because some of the proceeds goes towards providing food for undernourished children through MANA.If you love peanut butter, then you'll love Good Spread. It won't fulfill your salty cravings, like Jif might, but it does provide instant happiness, a quick snack, and a way to feel good about yourself when your spoon finds its way back into the jar for a second helping.
