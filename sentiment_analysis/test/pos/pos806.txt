I highly recommend these nifty little glasses. I have three pair. I carry one in my billfold so I can read receipts such as in restaurants. I have one on my iPhone so I can read stuff on that little screen. And, I have one on my bathroom cupboard so I can read pill bottle labels. They are a great invention.
