Great keyboard; feels substantial and once I got used to the keys and the angle, my speed and accuracy increased. It took a while to adjust in my seat and adjust my hands to operate smoothly; did notice some soreness in my forearms since you are using different muscles than you may be using with the thinner keyboards. I think the indicator lights could use some modification. They are on the right-hand side of the roller above the keyboard, but they are difficult to see without lifting up the back of the device or leaning over the desk. Larger indicator lights or  placing them farther down on the roller would help; especially with the CAPS lock light. Otherwise, great mechanical keyboard and, so far, worth the price.
