Mama Strut has helped so many of my clients! As an educator and doula my clients look to me to help find real solutions to their problems. My clients have suffered from general pelvic pain, perineum pain because of tears and/or swelling, and prolapse. The Mama Strut Postpartum Support fits comfortable under clothes, gives my clients relief with the compression therapy and they love the cold packs! Thank you Mama Strut for this product!!
