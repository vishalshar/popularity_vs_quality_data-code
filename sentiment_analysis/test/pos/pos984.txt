I usually avoid caffeine, but when I've got a migraine caffeine is the only thing that gets rid of it, usually in the form of a Red Bull (chased by Excedrin, which doesn't work by itself).  TruEnergy works on my pain every bit as well as Red Bull, and it has so many healthy things in it.  It's got lots of vitamins, and it's sweetened with maple syrup and stevia.  It has only 20 calories and 5g sugar per bottle, and the taste is amazing.  I've included a picture that shows the vitamins and ingredients in one of these energy shots.I'm so impressed by TruEnergy, I've ordered the 16-count size through Subscribe & Save
