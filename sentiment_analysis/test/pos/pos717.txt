These come in a small pouch that you put into liquid. It's not a lot. And it has NO taste at all. You don't even know it's in your drink. It's just a white powder.As for if it works, one can only assume. I have been drinking it a few weeks now. I have PCOS and I was hoping it would help me have a monthly. But so far, nothing. I have noticed my nails are stronger, and longer. But that is about it so far. We don't really know if it's doing something useful inside. We can only hope. When you want to conceive, you will try anything. So why not.
