I bought this for my 3-year old for Xmas. It's perfect. I play horn, and he always wants his own brass instrument. He can get a big sound on this, and loves using the slide to change to pitch and play long sliding notes. He calls it his trombone.  He is on the smaller side, and he can't quite reach all of the positions on the slide; there are 6 positions and he can only get to 5th.It is easy to take apart and put together. I wish it came with a case of some sort, and I will probably get a saxophone swab to clean it out as it does get filled with condensation after playing it for a while. The mouthpiece comes off and can be washed. It is between the size of a trumpet & a trombone mouthpiece and is easy for my son to buzz on.This is a great introduction to brass instruments for young children. I'm really happy I purchased this!
