I had originally got a pack of one of each flavor from a random try it now pack from a local health food store before I bought mine from Amazon.The blueberry is my preferred flavor, and everyone that I had shared with, really liked it, including my extremely picky eater nephews. I would buy more but the price is a turn off, even with how good they are and the sheer convience of the packs. If you need a healthy, tasty backup road snack or hiking food, and have the budget for them, they are awesome.Maybe one day they can mass produce them to drop the price, but as of now, they are really costly.
