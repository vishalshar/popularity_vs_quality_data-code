Love that it has a thermal container to use in one of the compartments. It keeps food very warm for the 3 hours we need. It can be used with or without the thermal container. It's easy to open for my 6 yr old. I did draw an arrow so he would know which way to turn. It's very durable. It's heavy compared to other lunch boxes but for the short walk into school from the bus it's fine. The divider is movable which is nice to use with or without. The divider is not leak proof. The individual compartments are leak proof but not items separated by the small divider. Easy to work around. It is big all away around and it's very challenging to include a drink in our standard size lunch box when packing this. I'm not comfortable using it as a lunch box by itself. I can see food spilling if it's opened accidentally by children. I use it without anything else but for now I'll pack it into a zippered lunch box for my son.
