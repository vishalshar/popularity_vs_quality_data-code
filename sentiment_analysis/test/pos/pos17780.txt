No joke.  My cat has busted into four different types of feeders.  In some cases, in less than fifteen minutes and I had completely given up on finding one smarter than my girl.  So far I've had this feeder for a week and she's given up trying to get in!In addition to that, they're really easy to setup and program.  Also it was super easy to add a second feeder to my account.
