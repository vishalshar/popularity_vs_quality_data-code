If your main goal is to reduce ambient, background sound, this mic works OK so I'm giving it 4 stars.  But my main goal was to improve the sound quality of iphone videos where the sound source is someone speaking about 8 feet in front of me.  So I was also hoping for amplification of the straight-ahead sound.  It did not do that.  On my iphone 6, I tested the MightyMic against the phone's internal mic on a straight-ahead sound source at 3 feet, 6 feet and 10 feet.  The sound volume and clarity were the same for both mics at all distances.  I returned it and will continue to look for a mic that will enhance straight-ahead sound.
