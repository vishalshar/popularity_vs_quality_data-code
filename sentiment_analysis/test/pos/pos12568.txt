I received mine yesterday, charged them, upgraded to version 2.1, then used them for about 1.5 hours this morning.Audio quality is good. Passive noise isolation is ok, but doesn't replace ear plugs. I may not have the right fit sleeve size, yet, so this may improve.I can't shake or bounce these things out. I feel like I could be in a mosh pit and they wouldn't fall out. These are the first ear buds for which I can say this - even the Jaybird X2s don't stay in my ears, but the Dash do!Battery life is beyond what I have expected, but I'll test more and update. Charging is fast.Voice quality on calls is impressive. The person I called said it sounded almost as good as if I was just talking into the handset. And their voice sounds great in my ears.Audio passthrough mode doesn't seem very impressive to me, but perhaps I don't have the levels set correctly.The Android app works well, and the update process was very fast.Bluetooth connectivity/stability is quite good, perhaps as good as the Jaybirds. I can make it drop out if I try, but in general, there were very few gaps or skips while I was walking around with my phone in my pockets (left side or right side).I feel bad for everyone who has posted up bad reviews - maybe it's just bad hardware, or they are using older firmware. Either way, it's terrible that they haven't experienced what I have with mine. These things are amazing.I would not hesitate to recommend these to people. They are fantastic, and will be upgraded more in the future to enable more functionality. It's a great investment, for sure. The only negative so far is the price, but honestly, given what you are getting, I don't think it's unreasonable.I'll be doing battery life testing, local music playback testing, and sport mode testing (cycling) in the coming week. I will update this review as I go.For the record, I have no affiliation with Bragi, I'm not being compensated by them, I didn't receive a discount, etc. I paid full price for these. I'm just trying to help provide honest info to others who might be considering this product.=== Update 9 Sept, 2016 ===I am trying the Small fit sleeves now. There is a MUCH better seal, and passive noise isolation is MUCH improved. They fill the "bowl" of my ear much better. I may try the next size up tomorrow just for giggles. I highly recommend going to the trouble of trying different sizes - I expected small to be too big for my ears, but these may be the ones I stick with.I used them on a long conference call this morning, and the people on the other end said they sounded really good (as if I was on a land line). Nobody had any trouble understand what I was saying. I observed one issue (noted below in the issues list).I have used them for 2 hours between charges, and they don't seem to be running low on battery. I should have a chance to run them all the way down tomorrow, so we'll get a good sense for battery life then.==== Update Sept 16 ====I had contacted Bragi customer support about the issues noted below. I have heard back from their support team, and they are investigating. The response time was a little slower than I would have liked, but they are responding.I also requested a few features, and they said they would add them to their list.Battery life is very good. I got more than 3 hours of streaming the one time I was able to use them continuously. I'll try to test battery life more.I wasn't able to test the cycling activity tracker last weekend, but I will try this weekend.Audio passthrough works very well with the proper fit sleeve.One very noteworthy thing about Bluetooth connectivity - when I'm indoors, I get absolutely no dropouts, no skips, with the phone in my pockets. The Bluetooth signal is able to bounce off of objects and is rock solid. I only get some small amount of dropout when outdoors when the phone is in my pocket.====== Issues ======Once, the left ear seems to have lost the connection with the right ear when playing music. I heard a low hum/buzzing. I removed it from my ear, put it in the charging cradle, then put it back in and it recovered. We'll see if this happens again. (Update - this has happened 3 times.)During a long call this morning, I noticed the left ear dropping in and out occasionally (indicating that the near field magnetic induction wasn't working well - this may be related to the left ear buzzing problem I noted earlier). The right ear was stable. Bragi's web site seems to indicate that this happens sometimes with some phones (without listing specific models) and that they are investigating. We'll see if this happens again during calls this afternoon. I placed both buds in the charging cradle, which is the recommended procedure for re-syncing them.
