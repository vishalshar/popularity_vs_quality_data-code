I was in the market for a virtual reality device. Enter the Merge VR. Id seen favorable reviews on you tube and recent tech expos and decided to get it. The price was right with all the devices out on the market.When the Merge came in, the box and instructions made for simple and step-by-step set-up. I did not have to spend any time getting started. Weightless---the weight of the Merge makes for comfortable for long periods of time. Its extremely soft and durable. It does not bother me in the least. You can use the Merge several ways, I personally use it to be front row at a concerts and feel like Im part of a real experience. Youre not limited to the front of you, you can look everywhere. Stage crew and all.  But, there are cool games and realistic landscapes that are available. (Coasters, space stuff) thats available. Also, the Merge VR Website makes getting your apps easy and in one place.I think the Merge is cool for those who are highly tech savvy and even those less so. Because youre using your phone to drive the goggles.. so everyone can use it.
