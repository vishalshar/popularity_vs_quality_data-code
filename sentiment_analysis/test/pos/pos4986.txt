Updated:After my initial struggles with the documentation, I was able to get one of the units to work reliably, but the other unit only intermittently.  I contacted Orion Labs customer support with the description of the issue.They were gracious and suggest the unit might be defective and offered to replace it.  They did so right away without suggesting pilot error on my part, or wanting to explore the possibility that I damaged the device by overcharging it.I'd likely give the device 5 stars if I found the documentation more to my taste.  Before the device is connected via Bluetooth with a phone, as it is when first unboxed, the LEDs show a pairing code (some combination of red, blue, and white always on).  The problem for me is that this code has the highest priority, and will display instead of the power charging interface ("When Onyx is connected to a power source, the lights will indicate the battery current battery level. When all lights are solid white, Onyx is fully charged.") described in the "What do the lights mean" section of the online guide: [...]With a ~0.3A usb power plug it took roughly two hours to charge.Looking forward with great expectations towards the Q4 2016 Amazon Alexa integration release.Original:My anticipation and excitement about receiving the product earlier than schedules was sadly replaced with anger and resentment during the unboxing.  A displeasure so great I have simply put the product aside for now.  Hopefully I'll return to the product and write a happier review at a later time.The source of my unhappiness, it is the user guide.  I series of wordless youtube videos.  For a device emphasizing the communication of words this is a bizarre choice at best.The current state of the the LEDs and the behavior does not match any of the videos, or perhaps simply as I incorrectly interpret them.  (I feel like I'm playing some bad pantomime game.)  Nor does it match the "What the lights mean" section of the web site.Hopefully time will temper my initial reaction, but I even if I eventually pick up the device again when the Alexa support materializes, I'm afraid, my first reaction will always cloud and negatively bias my interaction with the device.
