If you aren't making your own lacto-fermented vegetables, pickles, salsa, beverages...your gut is missing out! Seriously! Fermented foods are the best way to bring healthy bacteria to your digestive tract and improve your health dramatically. Pickle Pipes make it easy and inexpensive to make fermented foods at home, and are very durable and easy to clean. We have made the best tomatillo curtido salsa and garlic dill pickles ever! Our next project will be genuine traditional lacto-fermented eggs...Pickle Pipes easily allow carbon dioxide formed in fermentation to escape, but let no oxygen into the mason jars to spoil and soften the food you are fermenting. They fit tightly under a mason jar ring band and do not leak. I also purchased Pickle Pebbles to use with them, which are perfectly sized glass weights to fit in the neck of the jars to weigh food down under the brine and ensure no oxygen gets to it to spoil texture. Both items are very high quality and will last a very long time if taken care of.
