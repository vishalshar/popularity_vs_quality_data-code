Box was ripped and partially opened from handling. 4 bulbs arrived broken, minor scratches on the frame of the mirror from broken bulb glass sliding around in box. Mirror seems to be ok, haven't noticed any scratches on it as of yet. Will set it up with new bulbs after Christmas and see if glass is scratched.Edit: after setting it up 6 additional bulbs do not work, and there is a dent and crease in the back metal frame of the mirror.Update: got a hold of Amazon customer service and they are working with me to solve the problem. thank you
