You know those shopping trips where you go into the store for ONE thing and you come out with a load of stuff you didn't even know you needed? This is one of those things. I was shopping for plastic wide-mouth lids, but they were an add-on item, so I had to spend a little more money. Amazon so kindly recommended this product to me, and I couldn't resist.I'm sure there are tons of uses for this thing, but we've been using it for homemade milk kefir. I keep a jar of sweetened, flavored kefir in the frig that we drink in small doses. Maybe I'm just lazy, but I get turned off by the thought of pulling out a quart jar, unscrewing the lid, pouring the liquid, then wiping down the side of the jar where the liquid dripped over the edge. (Because doesn't liquid always drip over the edge of a glass jar?)This solves all of those first-world problems. Pull out your jar, give it a shake if it needs it, flip the top, and.... pour. The opening is small and plastic, so there's no dripping. There's a rubber ring inside to give it a perfect seal. I'm not a fan of kitchen gadgets or gimmicks, but this I love.This would also be perfect for homemade salad dressings, if you're that kind of person. Or... do you make your own maple syrup? This is what you need in your fridge.
