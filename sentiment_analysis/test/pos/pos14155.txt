My 12-year-old son has absolutely loved this gadget. It took him only a couple of failed paper airplanes on the first day before he had a successful flight using the basic template that came with the kit. Now, he can get his paper airplane to fly all around the cul-de-sac.It has also been very sturdy. He does short flights in the house just flying it across the room and straight into a wall to test the flight capacity of new planes. It has not broken or had any issues.
