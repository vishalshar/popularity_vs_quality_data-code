We love Skeeter chocolate cookies and tried these for a change. My nut allergic daughter likes them, though I prefer the chocolate chip cookies better. We will continue to buy these as we love to have choices of nut free snacks and the individual packages make it very easy to bring to play dates, birthday parties, school snacks, etc. Than you Skeeter Snacks!
