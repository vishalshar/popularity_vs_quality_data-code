I first tried these just after their Indiegogo campaign, at the recommendation of a friend who is an 911 operator. She and I share a fascination for exotic caffeinated items, and when she told me these were up near the top of her list I had to try them for myself. Now my partner finds them indispensable, we're on our third 20-pack box. We keep some in the car for work commutes, some in our bags, and at our desks at work. If you don't like energy drinks (or like me can only tolerate one before the sugar/carbonation gets to your tummy) you'll love these. They actually taste good, a nice clean coffee flavor and a good texture. None of the bitterness I associate with poor quality caffeinated gimmick items (like breath mints) and I appreciate that the ingredients are all good.My only criticism is that there are apparently three flavors in a single pack, and I can barely detect a difference between the three flavors. I also find it peculiar that there are three flavors in a single four-pack, my OCD tendencies really want it to be an even number. It's an absurd thing to bother me, I know, but I suspect it is exactly the kind of thinking that Nootrobox people are familiar with.
