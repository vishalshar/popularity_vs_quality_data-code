Not one to take time to do this but Whistle is worth sharing ! I thought I wanted loca8 talked to a nice guy in the UK and was told sold out for 2 months wanted it because I thought it had a faster alert time . Engaged Whistle and have tested 2 times it alerts in 2 to 3 mins and is spot on with location of Chunk . The battery has not been charged since set up and after 2 test out of zone it has 80 % battery life after 9 days ! Whistle I have 3 other Labs they don't tent to roam but you owe me big for the endorsement as it was unsolicited  ! Send cash or collars ! ''
