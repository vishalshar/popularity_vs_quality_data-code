Decent resolution, software ok, works excellently with my Moto G (KitKat) and Moto G Gen2 android phoner running Lollipop.  I've waited for years for the price of IR cameras to come down and I'm very pleased with my purchase.  The camera has already isolated some major heat losses in my home that I wasn't aware of.  Both still and video pictures are excellent. I live in the northern US where we have a dramatic difference between inside and outside temperatures.  While doing a remodeling project, the Seek was valuable in highlighting areas where insulation needed to be improved and stud locations.  After about a years use, it still deserves the five stars.
