I am glad that we purchased this sleep sack. Our little one likes it and sleeps soundly in it. It is basically like a comforter baby can wear, which is very cozy. My little on seems to like being snuggled up in a blanket for sleep but blankets make me uncomfortable because he kicks them off or over himself. If I use blankets it is with supervision and not at night when I want to sleep. Needless to say this sleep sack solved our blanket problem. I had also purchased a Halo sleep sack which is nice but nowhere near as cozy and cush as this one.I got this at the beginning of summer. I was worried that it might be too hot for baby. I dress him in just a onesie and he seems to not be too hot. The inside is jersey knit, and the outside half velour and cotton. I like how it is adjustable and will grow with baby, and the snaps at top make it easy to put him in. It is well made and pleasing to the eye. When we started using it and noticed how comfy he was and how he slept more sound, we were sad we didn't know about this with our first child.
