This is so cool. I gave it to my niece for Christmas and figured there was a 50/50 chance she would either love it and become totally involved, or she would not understand/care about it and never use it. I have to explain to her what it was and walk her through putting it together, but after we turned it on she was hooked. We put it on the big screen and spent the rest of the day playing around with it exclusively.A couple things to be aware of. When you first start it up it will prompt for an email for the kid. I think you can bypass the step but we decided to create her an email instead. Not a big deal but takes a second to do separately. Another thing is the fact that it suggests updates before you can access the games. Again not a big deal, but they did take between an hour and an hour and a half to complete. We decide to let it update while ate dinner and it worked fine.Everything else about the system is awesome. Engaging to kids and applicable to real development education. The only thing I would like to see, is for it to make use of additional IO pins. It uses two to power the speaker but it would be cool if it came with LEDs or something that the kids could change the state of through code. Maybe they have expansion packs and I just haven't seen them though.
