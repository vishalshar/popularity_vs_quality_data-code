When turning on the TV, it seems about 1 second slower than the Harmony One I had before it.I bought this to replace my Harmony One due to the connection on the back of the previous remote being less able to contact the charging dock. This remote's doc is so much better, but occasionally I have to fiddle to get it to "count" as being in the cradle.I like that it doesn't need a computer to be updated, but I dislike that it decides to push an update when I am trying to use it to watch TV or a movie (this has happened 3 times, and the update process is not fast (like 3-5 minutes)).I really wish they would add a voice control to it, or integrate with the Echo so I could do voice control that way. With products out offering voice remote services, it would be nice is Logitech would get on that...
