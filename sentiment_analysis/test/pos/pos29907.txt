I purchased this with the hope that it would be 'almost' as good as my S7 Edge, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. Now, I will say this: If I did not already have my S7 Edge, this would definitely be my phone of choice. The latest update resolves all the problems that previous owners have been talking about (I got it last week, therefore did not experience those problems). My only gripe about this is the power button not being extended out enough to make it easy to use. The button is flat and even with the side of the phone, making it a tad too hard to deal with (but hey, that's just me). The photos taken in 'darker' areas were not even close to the S7, but the outside ones were, so if you're not that picky about photos, don't worry about this phone. I absolutely loved the look and feel of this but did have some 'distorting' issues with the speakers, when turned up all the way.
