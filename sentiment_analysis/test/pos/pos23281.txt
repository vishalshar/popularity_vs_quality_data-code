My son saved his allowance for over 6 months to get this and after a week of solid play it has been worth it.  Learning the controls is a bit of a trick and I find it a bit touchy but my 11 year old is getting the hang of it and is driving it quite well now.  The tricks are fun and it does go pretty fast (fast enough I end up often crashing an inevitably getting stuck on the wall).I am amazed how long the battery lasts (over an hour) and the range is about 30-40 feet.It is not sealed like the sphero so I don't know how long it will last with dirt and dust and it is certainly not waterproof.So far though it has been a great purchase.
