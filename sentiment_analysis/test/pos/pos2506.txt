I bought this for my 6yr old granddaughter and she LOVES this, so much that when I put her lunch in another container she got very indignant. Here's what we live: it's LEAKPROOF, I can send applesauce, yogurt etc in on of the compartments and not only does it not leak out of the box, but it stays in it own compartment and not all over the other food. It has a "just the right size" thermos container that sits right in the box (no more separate thermos!), not needing it that day? Oh no prob, just remove it! What? Yes its removeable giving you a large square compartment for a sandwich or salad (or taco and veg), it comes in great colors, we have the pink but we are definitely going to try to get another in another color. It also has a little moveable divider to separate other foods. So many pros, only one con and it's not that much of one, I had to have her practice opening the box itself and the thermos, once she did though, easy peasy. This lunchbox is everything we wanted in a new container. Thanks Omielife for this awesome creation.
