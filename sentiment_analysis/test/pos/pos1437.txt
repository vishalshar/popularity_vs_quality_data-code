I would give it a 5 star rating if the mini USB connection would rotate so I could use it how it was intended to be used. I bought a couple different adapters (Mini Female to Mini Male) and none of them worked, so it was not as convenient as I would have hoped. I was skeptical when reviewing this online; How could something so small do something so spectacular? When using it, I was very impressed with how accurate the temperature readings were. The "picture" quality is not perfect, but it does not need to be. This is not an HD camera, its a thermal imaging device.I want to make sure I am transparent with this review: I purchased this from amazon and the package never arrived (Lost in the mail or stolen off my porch) so I was not able to actually use the one I bought. I found out that a friend of a friend had one, and she let me use hers so I did not have to buy one for one project. I did use the exact same model. If I have a need for thermal imaging again, I will buy this again without hesitation.
