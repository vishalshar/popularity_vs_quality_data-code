This is easily one of the best jerky's that I've ever had. The first thing I noticed about this jerky is that it's not so hard that you'll break your teeth on it but it's also not crazy soft. It's just right. The flavors are incredibly delicious and this applies to all of the flavors they have. Thanksgiving just happens to be my favorite! I do; however, have all of the flavors in the house. It's gluten free, which is huge for my diet, and paleo friendly! So in other words, there's no junk in this product. It's a nice, clean meat and a guilt-free snack. I love having this for my morning protein snack or for a post-workout snack. This product is incredible and they have a lifetime customer in me!
