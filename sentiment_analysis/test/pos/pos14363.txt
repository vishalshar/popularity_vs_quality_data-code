Love my espresso, and this Espro Press is absolutely awesome. No grounds left in the liquid after pressing, and I used fine ground even though it may not be recommended. I measure in my grounds. Set up the filters with the round paper filter between the two baskets, let it sit over night in the fridge, because I like iced espresso, and pressed in the AM. So awesome. Best Espresso press I have ever used. I would definitely would recommend this product to others.
