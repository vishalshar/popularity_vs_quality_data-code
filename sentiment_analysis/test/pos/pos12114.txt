This works pretty well as long as you stay on top of keeping it cleaned.  It helps to have extra grass mats to rotate out and a good enzymatic cleaner and vinegar to spray on the grass mat.  I would not recommend this product to someone who is sensitive to smells.I did try using Glad press'n'seal under the grass mat, as recommended by another Amazon customer.  It didn't work for me.  I feel that the press'n'seal kept the urine from draining properly.  I wish I could order an extra catchment tray so I could switch them out right away.  My dog likes to wait until I am in the middle of emptying the tray to do his business.  I do use the disposable catchment tray liners that can be purchased separately.  I also sometimes put a little vinegar or bleach in the catchment tray to help with the smell.
