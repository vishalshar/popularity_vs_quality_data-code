This portable bento box solution is brilliant and absolutely adorable. It is of high quality and well designed. The no leak between sections is amazing because I've bought the stainless steel kind for my older two kids and the snacks, if wet, leak between sections. I'm so thrilled this design exists for my toddler. Perfect that she can carry it on her own and it's durable if dropped. Highly recommend this product!
