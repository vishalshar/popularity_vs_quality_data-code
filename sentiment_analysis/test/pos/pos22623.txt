There's not much to be said about the phone that most people don't know. If you know or use an android phone then you will understand this phone. This phone is on the huge size of that's what you are into. This phone is great for watching movies which almost gives you the feel of watching on a big screen compared to other phones. Finding a case is a bit difficult unless you want a bulky case meant for a tablet, which makes it nearly impossible to fit in a pocket. Without a case I found no problems fitting the phone in a pocket. I would also suggest using a Bluetooth headset or an earned headset to make calls because the phone is so large that it may look funny holding it up to your face. This is a quality phone for an amazing price.
