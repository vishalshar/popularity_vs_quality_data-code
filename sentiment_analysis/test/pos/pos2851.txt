The SunSprite is a marvel of innovation that does what it says it does.  It is about the size of a bluetooth earpiece and can be placed virtually anywhere, including on your earlobe if you want.  I won't replicate the very thorough and clear product description on this page.  However I would like to note that the phone app works flawlessly and the SunSprite itself is very accurate.  How do I know this?  I placed it at the edge of the therapeutic zone of a Bright Light therapy lamp and the SunSprite would only register a flashing light 'for beneficial therapeutic light' within the manufacturer's recommended zone.  One inch outside the zone -- no registration.USE OF SUNSPRITE FOR THERAPY LIGHT PLACEMENT. All therapy lamps have a range of effectiveness in distance. It is very easy to think you are getting an effective therapeutic dose of light when you aren't. The manufacturer of the lamp I bought has superb instructions (manual and on web) for placement. Still, if you are like me, it is easy to rationalize that well -- an inch or so at a different angle can't make a big difference. Well, I discovered it does.I bought SunSprite to check if I was getting enough therapeutic light from my light therapy lamp. I want to be clear that the manufacturer of SunSprite makes no claim to measuring the lumens put out by a lamp. The manual just says a light flashes rapidly if you are getting enough bright light for therapeutic benefit. So in other words, it can be used to check if you are sitting close enough to your light to get benefit. The device is so small you can attach it to a sweat band -- near your eyes -- and know whether you are sitting close enough to your therapy lamp.Anyway -- I discovered that I had my Day-Light lamp placed such that it didn't set off the rapid flashing light on the sunlight tracker deviceÂ Day-Light Sky 10,000 LUX Bright Light Therapy Lamp (DL2000). I rechecked the Day-Light manual, and sure enough, the lamp was at the right distance, but not the right angle. I was close -- but off. The reason I wrote this segment about Placement is that a small lamp has a huge advantage over larger units in aesthetics and placement -- but has a smaller therapy zone than some of the big boxes that cost three and four times more than the Day-Light. So placement can sometimes be critical if you have the lamp at the far end of its effectiveness zone. I am a happy camper because I still saved a ton of money by buying both the Day-Light lamp and the Sunsprite and I absolutely know I'm using the Day-Light lamp within a zone for effective light therapy.
