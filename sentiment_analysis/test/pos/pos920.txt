3/12/2016 - So I've had the classic 2.0 XL for a couple of months now and it's working out really well.  The larger size was a must for the laptop I had just bought, and the quality still holds up.The company supplying these originally had some problems with customers buying the XL and receiving the original Man-Pack, including me.  Part of the problem appears to be that the labelling of both is the same so the Amazon folks can't really tell the difference.  The supplier apologized profusely to me and made sure that I received the proper bag.I'm a big fan of Man-Pack.  I have both the original and the XL.  I especially like the fact that the strap is crafted so that putting the strap on your shoulder without wearing it cross-body distributes the weight so that its not continually sliding off.  For me, I wanted sturdy, a lot of compartments, and a place to hold my phone.  They have all of those.The phone pocket is especially well-placed.  It's on the strap so that you have it right in front of you.
