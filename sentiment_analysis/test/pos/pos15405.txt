Bought this to use on my Wilson receiver gloves.  I have been using these gloves for 3 seasons of 7 on 7 flag football and they lost most of the grip.  After trying several other methods of restoring the grip I decided I would try this.  It is amazing!  I followed the directions and as soon as the gloves were dry I was back to making one handed catches.  The gloves are better than new.  It does wear off fairly quickly if you are warming up before a game and doing a lot of ball handling.  However it lasts through a whole game no problem.  I will be buying more and getting my teammates to try it as well.
