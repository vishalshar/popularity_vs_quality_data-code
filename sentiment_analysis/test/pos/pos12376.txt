I didn't think this would work out that well, but for just a few bucks, I decided to give it a try. And it works! Not only do my brushes dry much faster, but they dry into a neat shape and look new! However, I would not use them for synthetic brushes because I feel like the bristles tend to "clump" together and not dry nicely. Synthetic brushes don't really have a problem with their bristles sticking out like a mess anyway, so you don't need this product for them. This is best for brushes with natural bristles.
