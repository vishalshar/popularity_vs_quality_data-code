I liked the one I bought about a year ago so much, that I bought a second one for use in another room. It works well and does all that it is said to do but you do need to read the instructions. The only minor criticism that I have is the color and brightness of the back lighting on the LED display panel when the unit is on, blue just doesn't go with the "old style" appearance of the rest of the unit but that is easily fixed with a yellow post it note cut to size.
