The Seek Thermal Compact and Seek Thermal XR are amazing devices with low prices that bring thermal imaging within reach of an entirely new audience. I have used both and would only recommend the XR with its much narrower 20 deg field of view for uses such as augmenting a scope. The standard Thermal Compact with its 36 degree field of view is great for general use and a much better choice.Pros:206 x 156 resolution (actual pixels in thermal sensor chip, much more than its closest competitor).Wide measurement range: -40 to +626 deg F. (much wider than its closest competitor).Powered from your phone, lasts as long as your phone battery.Software features multiple color palettes, still and movie modes. You can have spot/high-low/or selectable temperature emphasis shown.Cons:Cost savings are achieved by using a different lens material than high quality cameras.Appears to be less sensitive to small temperature differences than expensive cameras.No adjustment to calibrate for emissivity, making this more of a hobbyist device than a professional tool.Side by side display with visible/IR images in same frame is not as useful as competitor's overlay.This device does what it advertises and for a great price. Unfortunately some people who buy it will have unrealistic expectations fostered by TV show images of people moving inside buildings, etc. (those are fake). The surface temperature indicated is affected greatly by the material doing the emitting of the infrared. Shiny materials emit the worst and at some point become mostly reflectors/mirrors, leaving you trying to measure the "color" of a mirror. Don't bother buying this device to see inside buildings or cars. Ordinary window glass is completely opaque to far infrared. We can use IR to measure temperature because the amount of IR emitted is directly related to temperature, but it's related to a lot of other things too. Professionals can train for years to interpret IR images, and the answer to "can I see moisture in my roof" and similar questions must be a resounding "maybe".Most importantly, for a good image there must be a difference of temperature across the scene to provide contrast. If you live somewhere that the inside and outside temperatures are almost the same, don't expect to see the rafters in your ceiling. On the other hand when it's below zero outside and 70 degrees inside you will get a very good picture of where your insulation is weak.If you have a use for it, or $200 to spend on a fun toy, the Seek is a great value. If you don't have a real use for it, unless you are a serious imaging geek you may tire of it fairly quickly.
