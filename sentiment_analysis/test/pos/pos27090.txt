We were skeptical. Mississippi is hot and we like any beer as long as it is cold. We didn't think we had palettes sophisticated enough to notice a difference. We lined up 3 different beers and did a blind taste test. This system changes the taste of ALL beer and makes them better! We tried a Lazy Magnolia Southern Pecan, Southern Prihibition, and Modelo. We could all definitely tell a difference and pick out the beer that had been ran through this system.
