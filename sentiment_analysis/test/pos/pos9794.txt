Customer service was really great. They worked with me when I purchased the wrong one. Everything was smooth. They are on top of it and really great to work with if you run into any problems at all. I'm happy with them. I explain below about the differences between high quality TI and this TI.It looks great if you change some settings. When you get it, I recommend going into settings and put it on 4:3 instead of 16:9. Just my opinion. Switch between them and decide for yourself. I also disabled smoothing. I think it looks better that way. It really isn't bad at all ..quite nice after you change some settings. The camera quality on that 16:98 setting just didn't seem to be very compatible and didn't work together.I'll start off by saying that on the phone there is so much more programming going on than with $3,000 TI's and I know that sounds very odd but it's true. Showing different color palates and displaying temperatures is just incredible features and really makes this device worth it over any quality discrepancies.It does look great and quite clear after changing the settings. Very close to an expensive professional one that is $3,000. Frame rate is definitely slower, looks almost like 3 frames per second *cough* versus 30 frames per second on a $3,000 one and not As Pixelated. I must add that this is going to be quittte Pixelated while the professional TI is not pixelated at all, but still quite clear on the phone. Lastly, as I was saying before ...the expensive TI has no color palates ..It's only white/black or black/white. On the phone it has an incredible feature for targeting Set temperatures and coloring while leaving everything else chrome/black/white. Really Amazing feature, Love it. Those things make this device stand out a lot.
