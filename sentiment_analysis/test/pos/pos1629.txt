Very Happy with it so far. I'm using it with my wink hub and Amazon Echo, they work great. I'm using it with my Christmas lights so I can tell Alexa to turn them on and off :) Can be a little tricky to get it initially connected to your Hub/Wifi but once that is done it works awesome, only have to go through that once
