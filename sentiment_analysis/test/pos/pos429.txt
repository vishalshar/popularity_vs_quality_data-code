I am having a great time using Osmo in my special education classroom. It is absolutely fantastic! I initially purchased it to use at home with my own children. After a day of using it, I knew I had to take it to my classroom! My students, ages 3-5, have been thrilled with it! They ask to play it daily and use each of the apps but seem to prefer the Tangrams and myWords apps. I initially thought it might be a little too challenging, but they have risen to the challenge. The social aspect of it is great, too. Most of my students have autism, and Osmo does a great job of bringing them together interactively.  Thank you so much for making such an innovative product. I can't wait to see your future apps!
