When we first purchased this product for our 10 yr old boxer we where very skeptical but a good friend suggested it and so we tried it. Our boxer has arthritis and was starting to have a hard time moving around. We have been giving her this product for about 5 months now and it works great! She runs and plays like a puppy at times she still has her stiff days but they are few and far between and she is more active and even runs with the kids again. Highly recommend this product!
