If you are a downhill skier, or a snow boarder, and you are interested in improving your performance, this device will be a big help.  Rossignol is one of the biggest names in winter sports, and their willingness to market this device with their name on it speaks volumes.The business end of this thing is very lightweight and seems really solidly built.  It straps to your boot and measures performance on each run.  There's a free app for your smart phone that will collect, analyze, and graphically depict the data.  With a little practice, you will quickly become adept at reviewing the data, interpreting your performance, and planning ways to up your game.  The feedback is not immediate (because you can't actually view it while you are skiing or boarding), but you will be able to see it as soon as your run is completed.  This will help you refine your muscle memory, and advance to the next level.If your frieds have this gear and the app, you can form your own little community and push each other to higher and higher levels.
