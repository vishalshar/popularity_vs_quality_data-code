Just got these in, and my initial impressions are really positive.The packaging is top-notch. It almost seems like 1More spent more on the packaging than in building the earphones themselves. Solid textured box, and the design accoutrement on the inside flap is a nice touch. Individual cardboard sleeve boxing for the eartips, travel case, and documentation was unexpected (probably unnecessary) but spoke of quality nonetheless. Everything about the packaging made it seem like the company cares about the product they're selling. I appreciate that.The earphones themselves felt like good quality buds. Metal casing, metal buttons on the inline remote, and kevlar wrapped cord from the split to the end. I like that the 3.5 mm connector is slim, fits in my iphone with the case on with no problem at all. The connector itself is textured with micro-ridges, as well as the remainder of the cable to the buds that not wrapped in kevlar. Everything about the look, feel, and build quality of the earphones said the same thing to me that the packaging did...1More cares about the their products.Now for sound quality...these are impressive. The low end is very present, tight, and sounds good. Not muddy, not overbearing in the mix, but definitely there. High end is clear, defined but not excessive. Clean treble. Mids are interesting. I don't feel like I'm missing anything with the mids, however, on certain tracks with an alto sax, I can hear a weird scoop of certain frequencies. Most people will not notice. All in all, these ear buds sound fantastic. IMHO, if I were tuning these, i'd reduce the low end a little, even out the mids, and leave the high's where they are. Soundstage is about what you'd expect from in-ear's, could be better (but again, they're IEM's) but there's enough space to be somewhat musical.  Stereo separation is pretty good. As I'm writing this, I'm only a couple hours into using them, I imagine these will open up and settle in a little more after more burn-in.All in all, these are awesome earbuds for $199, the fact that they're selling them for $99 is ridiculous.***2/8/2016 EDIT***After some more burn in, these buds have settled in nicely...that mid freq thing i mentioned earlier has gone away, these buds sound incredible! no need for additional tweaking...Still can't get over the fact that these were only $99!!!
