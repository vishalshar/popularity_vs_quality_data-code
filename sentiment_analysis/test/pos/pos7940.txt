Tastes great! Has a blueberry kool-aid kinda taste but with light carbonation that reminds me a little bit of green monster. Rare to find an all natural energy drink and especially one with lotus flower extract. Everything in this drink is natural and even the caffeine is from arabica coffee beans. As you may be aware lotus flowers have mild psychoactive properties due to an alkaloid called nuciferine. This results in mild sedation, which is relaxing. At the same time you feel very alert despite this mild sedation. It's a unique feeling and I would recommend trying it if you are at all interested in such things. The ancient Egyptians were said to use blue lotus flowers soaked in wine to achieve a similar state. The cans don't list caffeine content so I emailed Lotus Elixirs and the CEO of the company emailed me back and told me it is 71 mg of caffeine per 12 oz can. Very quick response from the company and I was impressed that the CEO took the time to answer my question. Great product I highly recommend it!
