Amazing product!!!  I have super sensitive eyes and have horrible problems with mascara.  This is more of a lash tint and just coats your lashes with a hint of color to prevent a washed out look but you don't get all the flakiness and irritation like other mascaras.  Won't give you thicker/longer lashes, but is excellent for a day to day look when you need a little definition and color!!!
