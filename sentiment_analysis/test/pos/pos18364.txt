The locking mechanism and plastic strap are much sturdier than I expected! The keys stay in place, but are still really easy to move when I want them to. I can't imagine having keys without this! I thought I wasn't going to be able to fit all of my keys on there, but it worked just fine with 5 standard keys and 2 smaller desk / filing cabinet keys. Very pleased with this product!
