This was awesome! I took it camping. It comes with a small tripod... I used a real tripod so it would not have to be placed on a table. The graphics are great. We brought a white sheet with us and connected it to the tent. We used our iPhone (must purchase adapter separately) and used a blue tooth speaker. What a great time! Funny enough, there is a window behind the white sheet inside the tent so when the bugs were to bad we just went inside the tent and was able to watch the image without moving anything.
