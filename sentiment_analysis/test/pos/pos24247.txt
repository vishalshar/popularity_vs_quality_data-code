This tracker is pretty cool, I must say I had a great to poor to great experience with this tracker.  First month I loved it, battery lasted for almost a week and as a mapmyrun user myself, I completely loved tracking my dogs activity (or major lack of, she's a bit more lazy than I thought)Well, after a month I saw a quick decline in battery life, it was to the point where sometimes the battery wouldn't even last a day.  My first thought was, some thing is wrong with this thing, but then I thought maybe it's just a piece of crap.I wrote a review on Amazon saying yeah, cool idea but horrible battery life.  I was contacted immediately by Whistle customer service to try to troubleshoot what might be going on.  CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AWESOME!!! These reps are so friendly, so helpful, so supportive.So turns out the base station is more than just a place to charge your tracker.  Had I read the tips at the end of the little pamphlet I would have seen that it should be plugged in all the time and acts as a battery SAVER for the tracker when it is in the bases range.  It also shouldn't be placed near heavy appliances that can block the sensors (ie fridge). I of course was doing all of these things, and after moving the base station out of my kitchen, and leaving it plugged in, I was immediately back to full week charge.Shout outs to Trizza who was so great at following up with me and really making sure I was happy with the product.and P.S. my dog did go for an unapproved adventure and I was able to easily track her with this system and get her home quickly.  Totally worth the investment and subscription fees!
