I am using this product on a road bike, although it is strong enough that I would put it on a mountain bike too!  Your phone is solid in this thing, I've never even remotely worried about it coming out of the mount.I have logged about 350 miles so far with this mount and so far so good!  On some of the bumpier pavement I can sometimes get a vibration rattle sound, but just a quick adjustment fixes it.  I'm not even sure where that rattle would come from since nothing is loose, which makes me think I'm hearing some sort of harmonic vibration.Everyone in my group ride comments on how awesome this thing is!  All the other folks that use smart phones on the ride have the cheaper plastic mounts.  Even the mechanics at my LBS like it since its a solid piece of aluminum.I have seen some reviews mention that the stem screw isn't long enough, but I did not had this issue with my Specialized Roubaix.
