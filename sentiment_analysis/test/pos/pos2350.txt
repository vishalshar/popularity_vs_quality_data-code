Overall the mighty mug is just fantastic, not much to say since it's simply a mug/tumbler. It works really well and was surprised on how many surfaces it actually works on. Note that some surfaces work better than other. I noticed that wood flat surfaces don't seem to do well with this item, occasionally it will if the mug "sweats" when the beverage is cold. Also I seem to notice that it a much better job keeping drinks hot rather then cold. Don't get me wrong though, cold drinks stay really cold maybe for about a good 6hrs at depending where you are. But I'm giving this rating a 4 stars because I notice that when I don't use the straw, and try to close the mug, the lid popped off of the cup. There is notch missing from the detachable lid the cover the opening. I wasn't to concern about just wanted to point it out for others. I pretty much used this mug without the straw so far like once of the 15 some times. But very satisfied with the purchase. Would recommend to others:)
