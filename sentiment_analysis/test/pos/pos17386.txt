I received the Hello Naturally Friendly Extra Whitening Pure Mint toothpaste free from smiley360 to test and review. It came with a nice and simple soft bristle toothbrush made by Hello and a tube of their Hello toothpaste which used together. This toothpaste (and the toothbrush) are made in the USA, you can tell the toothpaste is natural, it's consistency is ever so slightly different than typical toothpaste and it does not seem to foam as much which is probably a good thing, less unnecessary chemicals. The taste was minty with cool and refreshing mouth feel. It was minty and tasted of menthol with out any burn I would get from my usual minty whitening toothpaste. There wasn't a funky after taste on so much of what I ate or drank after that, however my mouth felt no less clean for it and my gums were quite happy. I would recommend this tooth paste and even talked my husband into trying it. He also felt it was as whitening as the other brands and wished it foamed more. I am happier without all the foaming. The package is super cute and minimalistic, it comes in a brown box with silver/metallic print for a super trendy look in my opinion.
