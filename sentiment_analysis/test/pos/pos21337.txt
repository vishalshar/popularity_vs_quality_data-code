I was skeptical about this product when I purchased it.  It turned out that it does work.  If you smoke cigarette or cigar and hope it will get rid of  the smell, you might be a little disappointed because the smoke gets into the upholstery.  However, it certainly lessens the smell and the car does smell much fresher.  I would recommend it and in fact I'm ordering two more today.
