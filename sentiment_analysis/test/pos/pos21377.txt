Okay so I was serching for a little portable comb for my beard the other day when I come across "GoComb" producs which fit in your wallet, so I thought "Oh cool idea", I check some of the combs out and I find this crazy design with a bottle opener on it, I didn't think twice and got it. (Product delivered quickly) I got the product and immediately tested it and fit elt gooood on my beard, so I gave it a try with my hair and it was not bad also, put it in my wallet and it fitted perfectly, so yeah, awesome stuff!Last thing I want to try is the bottle opener, so I grab a beer from my fridge and voila! Hahaha pretty neat. So everytime me or some friend or family member wants to open something or I want to quickly fix my beard or hair, I take out my wallet, pull out GoComb and boom! It's funny the look friends and family give me and always asks me "What is that!?", great conversation starter!
