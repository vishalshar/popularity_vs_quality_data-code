I purchased this lid for my 8" pan.  It just barely overhangs.  You have to carefully place the lid on the pan so that the lid does not fall into the pan.  The lid creates a seal.  There is a suction issue when trying to lift the lid off of the pan.  You have to carefully slide the lid to the side to release the suction before removing it.  I really appreciate that the lid stays cool.  My only complaints are I wish it were just a tad wider and that the handle was a little more prominent.  Even with those complaints I really like this lid and have purchased it in three different sizes.
