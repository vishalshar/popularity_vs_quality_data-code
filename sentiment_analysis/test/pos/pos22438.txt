I have read a lot of negative reviews on Whistle since they purchased Tagg.  While I understand they may have some software issues with their first release, it looks like most of the bugs have been resolved.  We bought two units for our large dogs and they work well.  Minor issues with a few minutes delay in reception but I think that is the cellular connection and not Whistle.  The alerts work well when our dogs travel outside the safe zone.  The units held up well when our dogs decided to take a romp through the swamp.  If you have a large breed dog and a large collar, don't bother with the Pet Tracker Guard that is suppose to cover the tracking unit.  It is not large enough to fit over our dog collar.  I am confident Whistle will continue to make improvements and am happy with our Whistle GPS Pet Trackers.
