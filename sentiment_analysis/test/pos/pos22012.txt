i bought a securifi almond 2015 spring 2015: it came with a peanut. I also bought securifi door and movement sensors at that time. it's been fun watching the software for the router improve. I liked the peanut so much i bought 2 more: as far as zigbee switches go they are fairly priced, look good. and do what you want them to. Did I mention I live off grid using a solar system? Having lights in the barn 200 feet away I can control from the couch at two in the morning in the middle of a rain storm. Me like. PS. i would like super cheap low fi cameras for checking on the chickens and the barn. thx.
