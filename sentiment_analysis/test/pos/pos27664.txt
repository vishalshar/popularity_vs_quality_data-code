I bought this as a way to make JavaScript programming more concrete to my students at Portland Code School. It turns out that it's just a lot of fun, to boot.Some students enjoy it for the technical depth that underlies its capability and personality. But some of them just like to play when they are on break from class. And many of them offer it to their kids to play with when they bring their families in to open lab hours at the school. It's great to see a mom working on coding while her kids play with robots. Or a dad showing his kid how to program the little ball using one of the apps.One kid discovered on his own the concept of test harnesses and mocking frameworks as he figured out how to make the Sphero think it was rolling around and turning. It sparked a great conversation around how you might go about testing whether a routine worked without having to actually run around and let the little robot get into trouble.Next, I'm going to bring in a few quadcopters. I'm just looking for one that has a nice API and a rich set of apps like Sphero.
