This thing is amazing, I knew my heat pump was using too much power, but I didn't know how much until I installed this. now I know and have found out that the heat pump for our house is very undersized which is why it keeps kicking on the electric furnace in order to keep up, wasting way too much power.Installation:so I had to learn about power phase first which only took a few minutes on google, after that installation was a breeze, I wasn't able to make this unit fit inside the breaker box but that's OK. install took about 2 hours, instructions were very good and now I am loving this thing
