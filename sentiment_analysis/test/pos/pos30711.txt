I have only had these Air Freshener for a couple of days so really time will tell but first thoughts....1.  I drive a Ford Flex, it does not fit around the head rest, you have to take the head rest off and attach from the bottom.  Not a huge deal but just a very minor delay in installation.2.  I had food left in my car the same day that I put it in, as a 6 month pregnant women, my sense of smell is VERY good.  There was only a minor hint that there was old fries in the car.  I'm happy with that result.3.  I day later there was no hint of food in the car (I removed the left over fries).4.  It is well made and I think that it will hold up for the entire 365 that it says it will work.5.  My only complaint is they put a sticker on the box right over the instruction so I had to go on line to read the detail about leaving the air freshener in the direct sunlight once a month.  This could be a one time thing with an employee having a bad day but it was a uhhhh moment for me.I am happy with the first week of use.
