I have a DJI Phantom 3 - Love it! My nephew however was really interested in drones but I wasn't wanting to spend several hundred for a hobby i'm not sure he's going to take up indefinitely but I wanted him to have a fair chance at flying a drone and the cheap ones just don't have the auto hover features. You spend more time fighting with the drone than you do just enjoying the flight time. This Drone delivers what is promises. We've probably flew it 10 times and it's been able to handle a few crashes (lost a few blades) and it doe exactly what they say. It does "Auto" hover as good as you could expect with a drone in this price range, it isn't 100% like a Phantom but it's a slower drift and you don't really have to worry about fiddling with a ton of settings to make it stay in the air.Are you a beginner? Not sure if you want to invest hundreds into a quality drone but want some of the advanced features so you can enjoy flying? Risk it and buy this drone. I can't speak to the longevity of the drone as we  haven't owned for more than week or so now but the build seems solid.Another reason I choose this particular drone over some of the other drones that offer similar features in the price range is the 5 min flight time and 30 minute charge. If you do the math you can get like 20 minutes out of the drone vs the 10 minutes in other drones in as they usually take a while to charge (from my research).Con: You get replacement blades but they seem to go pretty quick and I haven't found any on amazon.
