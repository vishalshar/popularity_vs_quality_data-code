I have used it for about 6 rounds now.  Its very good for tracking stats and distances. The bad is it takes a while to remember to tap it on EVRY shot.  after every round you must go back and edit the round and if you use say an 8iron to ship, it thinks you hit your 8 iron 8 feet. so sometimes those numbers and averages get messed up.  once u get used to all of this, it works great.
