I have not had to use it on a bear or other animal but I did test it with some backpacking friends who said it was pretty loud.  This one is 130 db.  It is made well and easy to use.  I carry it hooked to my belt loop so it is always with me and ready for quick deployment.  I plan to carry this on a 2017 thru-hike of the Appalachian Trail.  I did not give it 5 stars only because I have not yet had to use it.
