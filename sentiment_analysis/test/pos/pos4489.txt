I write a review a little less than once in a blue moon. The tech support that I received from TarDisk needs to be lauded, though. I have NEVER had better tech support than that I received through "Wellington" at TarDisk. Wellington was proactive in my effort to get my order straightened out when I lost some identifying information. He also stuck with me for hours as we worked towards undoing a mess that I -- not TarDisk -- created (I entered a command incorrectly at the console level). BTW-- when you go into console mode, be sure to include the space character in the "fsck -fy" command. I noted that the TarDisk company describes itself as 'small but growing'. If the kind of tech support that I received from Wellington is representative of TarDisk's overall tech support personnel, I expect that new users will be extremely pleased with this 'small but growing' company. The company exemplifies the best in tech support. THANK YOU, WELLINGTON and TarDisk
