I've been using my leaf for a couple of weeks.This is my fist wearable device so I don't have a previous experience. My husband's been telling me about using a Fitbit for some time but I don't like the way they look so I've never been interested in those kinds of devices, so he bought me the Leaf.The fact that looks beautiful as a jewelry was the first thing I liked about it, thought I still wasn't very convinced with the product as a tracker and how much I'd use it. I started using it, and by having a register of how little I moved some days, I got motivated to have the Leaf with me every day and to re accommodate my schedule to balance my activities on the lazy days.The app is simple and easy to use, and I like that it includes the new meditation exercises. I also found very interesting that wearing the Leaf on your waistband, the app tells you how good or bad you have been breathing during the breathing exercise, so it even helps you to improve that!Being such a feminine product, I think It would be very useful if it had a monthly breast self-examination reminder (I always forget to do it, and it's so important and easy!).The cons I find on the Leaf are that it's a little heavy to wear it as a necklace, and not very confortable.Also I'd prefer if it could sync automatically at least twice a day, like at noon and at night; that way I could check how I did before going to sleep.Other than that, I think the Leaf is a beautiful tracker that can be used with different clothing styles. Almost forget, I don't need to charge the battery every week like my husband's Fitbit ;) .
