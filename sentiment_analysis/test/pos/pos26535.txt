I have installed and used numerous vehicle mounts in the past.  This one, by far, is the best to date!  All the adjustments you may need are included.  This is really a universal mount.  In the past I had to order specific to that auto.  Not anymore!  I am so pleased with this unit.  And it does not weigh 50 pounds once installed!  Appears rugged as well.  Thank you !!
