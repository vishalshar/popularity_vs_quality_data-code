I so love my Triby. What an excellent idea.Initially I couldn't set it up using the Android App as it needed a firmware update first, solved this by using a friend's iPhone to set it up and do the firmware upgrade - I can only assume that this issue will cease over time as the newer units will come with the updated firmware.My wife and kids love the doodles I can send from the App while I'm away plus the Alexa integration makes it a must have.Would I recommend this? I certainly would, compliments my Echo and Amazon Tap plus its portable like the Tap but has voice activation like the Echo.
