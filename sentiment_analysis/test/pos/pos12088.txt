After upgrading my phone to an iPhone 6, I looked far and wide for the best bike mount for my road bike and read lots of reviews.  Originally, I wanted a mount that was specific to my iPhone 6 because I didn't want to run the risk that my phone wouldn't fit tight enough in a size-generic holder and would fall out.  I found that those mounts were very expensive at my local bike shop and on the internet.  With some hesitancy, I went with the iOttie.  Since then, I have been on some bumpy roads and across wooden bridges at speed and while the bike shakes like crazy, the phone stays in place.  The package comes with enough filler bands (for lack of a better term) to ensure that the mount fits snug around the handlebars so that the mount stays at the right angle for me to see my phone as a I ride.  I think the mount would also work well on my mountain bike, but since my mountain bike hits the trail too often, I decided to only use a mount on my road bike.I highly recommend this mount.
