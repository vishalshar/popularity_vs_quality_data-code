I do love my smartthings home system but hate reading news stories (practically everyday) about the vulnerabilities in these devices it's nearly becoming a full time job......that I don't have time for. I just installed my CUJO as per the instructions ( that even I could understand ) and started seeing notifications almost immediately letting me know CUJO had already sprung into action, which its piece of mind I'm sure you will agree.Great delivery easy to set up and was protecting me from the get go...what's not to like. I stand behind my 5 stars!
