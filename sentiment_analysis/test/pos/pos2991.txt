I love everything about this computer with only a couple minor gripes. I got this mainly as a powerful upgrade that'll last to the future and in a big part for video editing. It works fantastically and is barely even trying when working and having multiple programs going. I only wish the screen was a bit brighter and sometimes lettering can be slightly, very slightly, blurred but it doesn't matter much at all. I'm extremely happy with this computer!
