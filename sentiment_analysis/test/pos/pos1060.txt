These are a nice product and look like they'll last a long time.  Guess they should since they're not the least expensive around.  The one piece design is nice and there's good flexibility to the edges.  The center of the blades is kind of thick however, so don't really act as a scoop at all.  I have an old Pampered C one that has a nice scoop shape to it and I wish these were constructed that way.  Overall, a quality product though.
