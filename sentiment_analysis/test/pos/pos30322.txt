Its been 15 days of usage and the product is so far working super smooth and crisp. Though Snapdragon 808 is a old processor now, it still delivers a powerful punch for all day to day activities. It has no bloatware and runs almost stock android with a handy nextbit cloud assist apps. Its a steal for $170. The fingerprint scanner placement is pretty weird, but then it made perfect aesthetic sense to use that space of lock/unlock button as an added fingerprint scanner. It freed up space for dual stereo facing speakers, and the speakers are the best in business.It is completely made up of plastic, but it helps keep the weight and costs down. Its a fantastic piece of hardware with timely software updates from the nextbit robin guys. They do release the software updates very fast. Overall, its an amazing phone at an insane price tag.
