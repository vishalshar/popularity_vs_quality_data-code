This soap isn't water-soluble! I feel like an idiot, scrubbing my hands for hours to no avail! If you want soap that lasts for hours and doesn't do anything, buy this chunk of bee-crap! Or a rock! Go find a rock and "wash" your hands with that. I call shenanigans! I've been duped by their busy bee ways. They've taken advantage of our idiotic need to scrub ourselves with nature! Great for Howard Hughes-types.
