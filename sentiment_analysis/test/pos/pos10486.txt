Okay! This is all that it's cracked up to be. I absolutely love this pillow. I ended up with a grey color, not my first choice, but I wanted it NOW! All my preferred colors were sold out. Yes, you can use it for everything and it is for everyone. The pillow is not as thick as I imagined, but there is no need. If it were overfilled, it would not be as comfy. I sit in my recliner, or chair with it around me and that's it. Being only 5 ft tall, I'm finally comfortable in furniture built for average sized adults.
