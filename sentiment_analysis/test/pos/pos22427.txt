I am a huge movie fan and love good sound. I love dynamic bass, high-highs and low-lows. I have found for both portable use and couch/home, leisure use that I prefer circum-aural (over-ear) to supra-aural (on-ear) to intra-aural (in-ear). I think the over the ear style speakers provide better sound quality and provides for a more comfortable long term experience. However, lying on your side in bed really limits the use of both over-ear and on-ear style headphones. Thus, I have yet to find that one system that is universal. My go to units historically have been the Bose AE2 wired circumaural set (noise reducing not cancelling), and Bose IE2 or simply the Apple EarPods, that come with modern Apple devices. These are okay for short periods of time, but there is some canal fatigue. However they work very well for lying in bed, for resting and for any position you can get in. These 2 pairs of earbuds also tend to stay in the ear better than many I have tested. Alas, the sound quality is not as good as the over ear. Thus, I prefer over-ear style for a better sound option.1More, a Shenzhen-Based company, is a 2 year old startup that was started by three former executives from Fox conn. They have sold over 10million earphone system is in China in 2014. The goal is to move into the USA and European markets, to challenge the market share that the Beats industry has captured. Their strategy is brilliant, offer cost reasonable quality audio systems. A Wall Street journal blog quotes one of the co-founders as stating Our strategy is to offer premium quality audio devices at mid-rage prices. We want to. be the Lexus in the global audio market, not Toyota or BMW, (Gary Hsieh). Overall, the goal of this group is to prove that Made in China does not meet cheap and disposable.Packaging:I have been given 1 More Over-Ear Headphones MK 801. They arrived in a very professional box, which is actually quite artistic. I appreciate the color contrast and the texture feel as the black cardboard is textured differently than the image of the profile of the headphone on the cover. This is very well done. The 1MORE logo is in a gold tinged color below this. It is minimalistic, but elegant at the same time. Opening the box, the inside cardboard is red, which is eye catching and draws you toward the black headphones encased in a molded foam. Removing these, you can find a box with included accessories, a 3.5mm headphone jack cord, that plugs into your device and the headset. This headphone set is a not a wireless system. You also have 3 pamphlets. First is a single white square with safety information. This cautions the user about frequent/recurrent loud music, not using while operating machinery or if you need to hear outside sounds, etc. Second, it comes with a marketing, square accordion style pamphlet, depicting more options from the company. They show the 1More over-ear headphones in red, a bear toy that uses a Chinese messaging application, WeChat (not available in USA), and multiple varieties of in-ear options. The last pamphlet is the instruction manual. It is very well written and provides visual and written information, in six languages. The manual details the Warranty, demonstrates caution with excessive bending of the headphones and displays the control module and contents. I was impressed that it was so well written. I cannot attest to the accuracy/quality of the other languages.Initial Impression:Removing the device from the packaging, you can immediately see the quality of the headphones. The black foam ear pads are incredibly soft. They are some of the most comfortable ear cups I have experienced, better quality than the Bose AE2. Inside of the cuffs, the company has a imprinted silver outline of L and R. The ear cups are on slides and allow for individualized comfort. Not only can they slide in the vertical plane, they have a small degree of swivel as well, which allows these to fit you perfectly. The top arch of the headphones are softer plastic, allowing for some flex. This is appreciated as more rigid systems tend to be more uncomfortable. The foam along the underside is comfortable as well. The headphones weigh in about about 7.7 ounces (cord and headphones).The controller is 4.5 inches from the 3.5mm Jack plug. The entire cord length is 4? 7? long. It is important to note that the 3.5mm Jack ends are not the same. The plugs are not symetrical/interchangeable. The piece that plugs into the headphones are more narrow than the plug that is designed for your device. The end closest to the controller will fit into your headphone but the other end will not. Unfortunately, there is no included 3.5mm Jack extension. The plug designed to go into the device is wider than I would like and it does not work with my Catalyst phone case, as it is the diameter is too large. It is not their fault that the plug does not fit my smartphone case (Lifeproof also), but this limits the usage of the 1More wired system. It is my opinion, if they are wanting to reach the masses, include a very narrow 3.5mm Jack extension to make the device universal.Sound:I test all of my headphones (all styles), with the same music showdown, which allows me to compare the sounds of each device. My initial song test is to listen to a few of my favorite songs, Paradise by the Dashboard light by Meatloaf, followed by Somebody to Love and Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen. I was pleased with the sound quality from these headphones. The foam is comfortable and provides a good sound seal. They are not noise cancelling, but do a good job at noise reduction. This improves the quality of sound available. My second test of the device is to evaluate the quality of the instrumental sounds. Here, I use my favorite 3 sound tracks: Far and Away, Braveheart, Gladiator. I choose these for the strong and varied bass, drums, instrumentals. This really tests the natural sounds of the headphones.Finally, to test the bass, I use the track Why So Serious? The Joker Theme from The Dark Knight soundtrack. At around the 3:27 point, the bass line builds and builds like a train. Unlike many cheaper sets, these speakers do have some good lower bass sounds. Many of the headphones I have tested have weak or minimal soundseakers that you cannot hear anything up until about 4 minutes. Thus, I use this track as THE test of the bass.You can control the sound on your smart device with the controller. You can answer incoming calls (touch the middle button) or decline call (hold button). These are quite responsive and work better than expected. While in muscle mode you can play/pause, move to the next track (double press) or move to the previous track (triple press). Interestingly, you can use voice control if you hold the button down. The other 2 buttons on the controller are volume up and volume down, again very responsive. The sound quality of phone calls is quite nice. The microphone works better than expected. However, like all of these mic systems, they do poorly in windy environments and pick up a lot of background noise. This is not a criticism of this device as this is what I normally find with the built in microphone on the controller.Summary:I have not had a set of Beats, with which to compare these headphones. The sound and build quality of the 1More Over-Ear headphones are good. I do have two criticisms of the headphones. The controller is too close to the headphone and you cannot see the buttons. There is a built in microphone, and this may be why it is positioned 4.5? from the headphone junction. However, once you have used the device a few times, you do not need to see it. The last criticism is the 3.5mm Jack at the device terminal side. This needs to be more narrow or they should include a 3.5mm jack extension. I will rate these at 4.5/5. They are comparable to my Bose AE2. Finally, I am a big fan of the Included drawstring bag, this is an added touch that proves the company is thinking about the consumer. I highly recommend you give these headphones a good look."This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.
