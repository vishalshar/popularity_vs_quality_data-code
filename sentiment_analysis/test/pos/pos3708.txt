So far so good.  I saw these in some house magazine and imagined how cool they might be.  Last night was their maiden voyage when we hosted a movie party in our backyard.  AWESOME.  I just ordered 3 more 3 packs.  I love that they are solar powered and that I control the colors and effects with an app.
