Expensive, but I wanted something compact that holds its shape for carrying my camera and lens.  It is neat and compact and works great for when I need to have three lens, my camera, flash, and a few cords, batteries, and filters.  I really wish they had added about two inches both to the length and the width and about and inch to the depth.  Still the best "easy to carry camera backpack" I have ever owned...and I own a lot of of them from small to very large.  Yes...it is expensive (over priced for its size) but given how much I have paid for so many other camera specific and general back packs I have already spent at least that much...so in the long run I have what I need.  If you can afford to spring for the cost I say it is well worth it.  I had a rough design on paper for something like this but as I noted I would have made it just a tad larger.  On an airplane it will fit very neatly under the seat or in the overhead.  I don't regret the purchase because of how well it fits my gear.  You can't pack everything so it forces you to consider what you really need to carry.  Obviously, you can't get a tripod inside the pack. It does not lock but not a major issue for me since it is pretty much always on my back..
