Bought it, used it a lot, and promptly missplaced it 4 days later.But man oh man, those 4 days were THE BEST.Works well with Paper53 (duh) and Penultimate. I'd suggest they produce this in some kind of obnoxious orange color. Or maybe with a model that screams if you walk too far away from it. So, you know, I don't lose it again.
