I give the Canary 5 stars because it does exactly what it is supposed to do, with style.  I have not experienced any of the problems discussed in the other reviews.  Each update adds items that only make it a better camera.  This camera is built solid, not cheap plastic like others, the craftsmanship, design and feel is comparable to that of Apple products.  I have also used this camera for other uses, inspecting wall cavities, underneath the house, and last but not least capturing the entry point for unwanted visitors (check out the attached picture).  This camera just keeps getting better and better.
