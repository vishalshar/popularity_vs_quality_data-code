Got this handy little gadget as an early Father's Day gift for my husband. He was thrilled when he opened the box to discover what he thought was just a fancy carabiner clip for his stainless steel water bottle -- with rubberized corners, so as not to scratch things up. To his surprise, I showed him how the end caps pull out to transform into a rock solid charging device for his iPhone. Not only is it rugged and steel reinforced, but it has a wide and durable connection to the lightning and usb, which will ensure a fray-free future (many of his regular charging cables have had to be trashed due to flimsy wiring). No more searching through piles of wire and drawers for cables, as it's permanently hooked to him or his gear bag. If you're on the fence, like we were about the price...don't be. The quality is top notch & completely worth it.
