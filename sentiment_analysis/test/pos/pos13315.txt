Pros:Pretty nice looking, gets compliments, which isn't something I've seen w/ any other activity tracker.It works well, I love the lack of charging required. (I'd inevitably take one off to charge it and leave it forever)Cons:Band could be more comfortable, app could be a bit better.Sleep tracking is flaky.  Said I slept 23:50 one day (I had also walked 2 hours?)
