An interesting mix between a video game and a real racing game. You have cars that race on the track that are controlled by your phone and like a video game you can attack other cars and gain points. As you gain points you can go to the garage on the phone and improve the capabilities of your cars. This shows up on the track by improved performance. You can race others or put cars on the track and race with them being controlled by the game. It has provided many hours of fun.  My 7 yr old can assemble and pick up the track with ease. Young to old entertaining and fun.
