Works very well, gets the grip back to what it was before. Works well with older gloves as well so there's pretty much no need to buy new gloves. The only thing is that you constantly need to apply it, but I've had it for over 5 month and I use it every sunday and still have over half the container left! Other than that, its a great investment and product to have for football
