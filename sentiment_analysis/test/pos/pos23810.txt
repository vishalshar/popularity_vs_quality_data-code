Great interactive toy! I purchased "Coco" as a birthday gift for my 5 and 6 year old grandchildren, who love hugging the soft and cuddly stuffed animal and playing Dance Game. They especially think its great fun to surprise unsuspecting people with Bark Attack and it can be played with INDOORS OR OUTSIDE.It's not often that a toy is created which can draw children away from their IPADS or TV. This one did!Fuzzy Flyers, Coco, Smart Electronic Plush for Active Play
