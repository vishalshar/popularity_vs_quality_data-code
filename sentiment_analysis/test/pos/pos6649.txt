I previously purchased a metal topped jar pump and well it lasted all of 6 months before it rusted out. This plastic version, while it doesn't have the rustic look, is a pleasure to use. It does a great job with our homemade dish soap at the kitchen sink. Highly recommend spending the extra dollars on this one over the metal lid pump.
