I really like the Vololight.  I added it to my 2015 BMW 1200RT, and people seem the be backing off when I decelerate without braking.  I had to drill a small hole to run the wires up to a power source.  The wire was just long enough; a couple more inches would have been nice.  The posi-tap connectors are very easy to use.  The install took a little longer than 5 minutes because of the need to drill a hole to make the install look professional. I highly recommend this product.
