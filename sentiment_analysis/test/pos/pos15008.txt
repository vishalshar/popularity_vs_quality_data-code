Makes a really annoying high pitched tone when charging or powering devices.  It's in the other room so thankfully we don't have to deal with it too much.  It does have huge capability for charging.  If you get a quiet one I think you would be pleased.8/18/16 Update.  The company reached out to me and said the unit had a 1 year warranty.  Sent out a new unit and took the old one back.  The new one is quiet and works as it should.  Very good service.
