IMO the biggest flaw of the dualshock 4 is the triggers and not the battery.I bought some trigger stops that require opening up the dualshock.  The L2 worked but R2 didn't and I really wanted to find functional ones.  All Sony had to do was extend the plastic on the inside so the R2/L2 buttons are hitting something sooner.  Trigger stops are easily my favorite improvement for the controller.These Trigger Devils don't require you to open up the controller.  That's a huge plus.The stops were too long at first and R2/L2 wouldn't register at all.  I had to sand down the trigger stops themselves (see what is labeled "trigger stops"  in the pics for the listing).  Regular sandpaper is fine but be careful to only do a little at a time to not overdue it, as it grinds down fairly quick and easy.  As a nice bonus these pop on and off very easy so you can test how they feel.I don't like how my fingers rest in the grooves.  I can overlook that because I much prefer the shorter distance until the triggers are fully pressed.It also elevates the charge cord so it isn't forced in at a funny angle.
