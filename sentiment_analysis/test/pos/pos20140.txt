This is the best!  After reading reviews for several Pet Tracker's, I realized that the big plus for this one is the long battery life.  I almost get a full week to two weeks out of one charge.  This is much longer than other trackers I have seen online.  Almost all the other trackers get less than one full day on a charge.  However, I usually charge our Whistle every week around the same time to ensure that it always has several days charge just in case our dog ever comes up missing.  The app is so user friendly and personalized for your dog. When you open the app it shows a picture and location of your dog from the photo you upload.  It gives you reports when the dog leaves your pre-determined "Whistle" zone.  It tracks your dog in real time.  It even gives you directions to your dogs location.  We are totally pleased with this product.
