I ordered this one during one of those "amazon+wine" sessions. It had been on my list for some time as I've had horrible posture most of my life, and I've been reluctant to spend this much on something that seemed a little gimick-ey.Well now that it's here, I'm very happy with my purchase! The first day I had it on, I noticed an immediate improvement in my posture all day long, even when I took it off in the afternoon. I even commented to a colleague, "it feels weird being this tall". That's how long it's been since I've consistently stood up straight!The two colors of magnets works well to disguise the tracker, I wore the silver on a black shirt my first day and I spent all day explaining my history of standing up straight lol.I like that you can change the intervals to adjust for what you're doing. When that little vibration goes off, you not only remember your goal, but you know someone might have heard it and that's even more motivation to stand up straight!I do not love the app for iPhone, it really needs improvement. I keep having to log in and I have to sync the tracker each new login, it doesn't take more than a minute but it's inconvenient. Also, I might not have discovered it yet, but I don't know about a way to turn it off. Sometimes I'm at work needing to bend over repeatedly and it causes my tracker to start going off every interval. I'd love to be able to just click it a few times and turn it off easily and back on again once I'm upright without having to go find my phone and sync up.Overall, I'd buy this again. It's a great idea, and works well with minimal interference. Really the only other option to help with posture on the market are those ridiculous looking straps. This keeps my posture top of mind without having to disrupt my life too much.
