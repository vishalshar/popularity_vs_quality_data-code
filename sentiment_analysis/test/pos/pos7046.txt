This is a fun little imaging device.Got one on a daily deal, and they are fun to use. You will want to watch some videos to see what they are about.Basically the best use for this camera is to set up multiple focusing planes so that there is something to work with. Macro, closeup, and scenic seems a good fit. In the online tutorial video they have a girl holding a flower with the golden gate bridge in the background. They place the flower at macro range.The desktop software has a bit of a learning curve, but there are a lot of cool features. You can adjust the focusing plane to set more or less in focus at a time.The resolution of the pictures is lower than you would want for a standard camera, so you will want this camera for its unique focusing properties.Overall this is a cool device, definitely would add one to your camera bag. I would not recommend it as a primary camera replacement though.
