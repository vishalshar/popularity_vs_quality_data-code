Bought this for my Pom, after purchasing the Little Dog In Ground Fence. Takes a little creative shaving to get the contacts to touch my Pom's skin, but well worth it.  My pom is 6 lbs, and my yorkie weighs 8 lbs, these are perfect.  Nice size, doesn't seem to bother them.  Jury is still out on the Battery life.  Time will tell.
