Got this little camera right on time to stream our holiday party with my family abroad using Facebook live.We used to use FaceTime to share this kind of moments, but here it allowed us to leave the camera in one corner of the room and let it do the job.Great design and pretty cool features like automatic people tracking in the room (a small led light on top tells you where the focus is) or live editing.Looking forward to test it outdoor!
