Tried mine on a pellet BBQ/smoker yesterday. Even though it never exceeded 500 degrees on the hot side it still produced a better finished product than using only a stone. The top of the crust browned well and there was some browning of the cheese. I'll let it warm up another ten minutes tonight and see what happens.
