The set came in a nice box that placed each item in its own compartment, and which arrived sooner than expected. The die were top quality, the graphics nicely evocative of the Steampunk genre. Most important, though, they roll well - something that matters a great deal to the gamer who needs good rolls to enable effective attacks and damage during gameplay. What's that? Ah. Yes. Yes, I'm a geek. And now I'm a geek with some awesome dice!I highly recommend the seller!'D
