I receive this product from a beauty sample bag I got. I had it sitting around and decide to used it because I was breaking out so badly on the right side of my cheek! First used and than drying my face, holy cow, It felt so cleaned! smooth and white complexion! I just LOVE  the clean feeling!!! I used this in the morning because I feel like it works well, giving you a bright face! I am so glad I got a sample of this, which is why I decided to buy the real deal! Completely worth the money. Plus: it smells amazing, such a relaxing smell.
