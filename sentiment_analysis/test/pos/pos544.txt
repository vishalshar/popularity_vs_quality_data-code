These bars do exactly what they claim on the package.  Any inante genius will be released --  hunger appeased --  I only wish they'd replace the cane sugar - organic or not --  with something like agave.  One bar noticeably raises my IQ  many degrees.  Taste is not bad -- rather grows on one.  Very good for late night snacks --  but only if you plan to be awake for several hours.
