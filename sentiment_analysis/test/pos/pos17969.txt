The webpage and data recorded is great, but it takes some time to get into a routine where you tag the clubs before each stroke.The stats available can give you useful information about your average length for each club.Only issue I have noticed is that after one round of golf (4 hours), the battery is down to Low, so I'm guessing I wouldn't be able to play the second round without running out of  power. Haven't tried yet.
