at least for regular size lids, one way to unscrew a stubborn lid is to first apply vertical pressure downward on the lid with the palm of your hand, might use both palms (like when giving cpr), or use any other suitable object. This seems to cause a displacing motion between the jar mouth and the gasket, somewhat loosening the seal. Then while pressure applied downward unscrew, or try unscrewing jat without the pressure.
