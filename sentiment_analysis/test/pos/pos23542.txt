I've had this product for about a month.  I like it,it serves the purpose BUT I get a LOT of alerts via email that says "Stick Missing" and "Stick Reconnected", not sure what causes it but I made a call to the supplier once and was told that it's server related.  One thing I can say is that it DEFINITELY WORK.  Whenever someone opens a door, the siren will alert you RIGHT AWAY via email.  I like that even thou the alarm is disarmed the doors still chimes when moved.  For the price and the benefit, I would recommend it...Just be sure to get enough TAGS.  I think I'm going to buy a few more for additional windows.
