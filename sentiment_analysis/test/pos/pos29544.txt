The Airjamz has been a hit with all ages that I have shown it to. As a person with little to no musical ability, the Airjamz allows everyone to let their inner Rockstar shine. I brought it to my office and watching the laughs it brings out of people is priceless! Even my younger cousins, who initially thought they were "too cool" to let loose and rock out, are now obsessed. With the holiday season right around the corner, the Airjamz is the perfect activity to bring lots of laughs to family gatherings!! I had my doubts, but this product has exceeded expectations.
