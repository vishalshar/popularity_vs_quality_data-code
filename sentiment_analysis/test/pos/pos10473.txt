Replaced my wife's Samsung S5 that she lost with this...She likes it so much that I ended up getting our daughter one this past Christmas...And she loves her phone too. Very snappy phone, bright screen, and they're spoiled by the dual front facing speakers now. Plus it's good to know that 7.0 will be coming soon.
