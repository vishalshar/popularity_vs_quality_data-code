A little tricky to get working at first, but once you figure out the range it performs exactly as advertised.  Very clean software and good interface.  Seems to suffer from interference from other devices at times and needs to be quite close to work well all the time (not in your pocket or jacket for instance), but your experience may be better depending on what is around your computer and work area.
