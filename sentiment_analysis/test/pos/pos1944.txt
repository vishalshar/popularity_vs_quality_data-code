Great product and it works exactly as advertised. It was super easy to set up and we have had 0 issues with it since we got it (about 3 weeks ago). I will definitely recommend the Feed and Go to friends and family needing an automatic feeding solution. The price is a bit higher than the competition, but for all that it can do and the simplicity of everything, it is WELL worth it.
