I have no issue with the knives or the seller.  They came on time and are really nice knives.  I was, however, somewhat disappointed.  What I really wanted was the same size and "heftiness" of similar knives as the knives one uses when eating at Longhorn Steakhouse.  The knives here look very similar to those at Longhorn but are actually somewhat smaller in handle size and tang.  Again, no issue with the seller or the knives.  Despite that I did not get what I really wanted, it certainly was not the sellers fault.  It was simply my perception that the knives were the same as I had used at Longhorn (because in the picture they look very nearly identical).  My recommendation is to stipulate that the knives being sold are not of the same size as used at Longhorn.  I will still use the knives I purchased and be happy with them but I wonÂ’t buy more.  However, if the same size of steak knife as is used at Longhorn were available I would buy several of them.
