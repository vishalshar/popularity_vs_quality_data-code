I purchased the Bellabeat Leaf this summer when my fitbit broke for the second time.  I love the versatility of it.  Being able to wear it in different ways makes me wear it more often.  Just make sure you change the placement setting in the app so you have greater accuracy.  I don't have any complaints about the product itself and I get lots of compliments on it when I wear it.  The only thing I dislike somewhat is the sleep tracker, but that is probably because I don't wear it to bed.  Every time I sync my leaf I have to manually input sleep, just an annoyance.  I wish I could just tell the app I have a newborn so I get no sleep!  :)
