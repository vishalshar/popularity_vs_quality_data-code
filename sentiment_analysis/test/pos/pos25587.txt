At first I was just looked for a SS mug and didn't realize the special base to prevent spills. It is a combo of rubber ring on top of plastic and gaps. It works quite well to prevent spills, you can bump it with your hand in any direction and it slightly wiggles but stays firm.My wife was trying to pick it up to move it and thought something was on the counter, like food or juice, and it was stuck. I showed her to lift it straight up, rather than at an angle.I don't think it insulates as well as some other SS tumblers, but it is still pretty good and the bump resistance can be handy. Cool idea, and it works.
