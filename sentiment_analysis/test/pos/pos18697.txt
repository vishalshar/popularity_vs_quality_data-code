Works great!  Recommended.  I do several tunings and it is quite handy to teach this gizmo a Robert plant or Framton tuning and quickly return my guitar to it without needing to dig thrue memory or references.  One issue I hit in creating a custom tuning was my mistakenly trying to get a high string to tune down an octave. The gizmo would simply not recognize that the string was being plucked, so appeared to be malfunctioning on custom tunings. It took me a while to debug my error, so watch out for that mistake.  The makers might error check that in future.  I did let them know my mistake and how I solved it.Surprisingly, I have never had to recharge the device, after a fair amount of use.  That's a nice discovery as well. Try it, you'll like it.
