Jamstik+ is popular with our 11-year old beginner, who uses it nearly every day. She will hardly put the Jamstick+ down and is flying through the lessons. Once she masters something on the Jamstick+, she rushes over to play it on her guitar. It holds her interest for a long time because not only is she doing the traditional instruction lessons, she is also playing the instructional games.She is gaining new skills rapidly and really having fun. To write an informed review, I also put the Jamstick+ in the hands of an expert guitar player. He picked it up and played it like a proand loved it! He kept asking, Where did you get this?The small size takes a little bit of getting used to but, once you get comfortable with how to hold it, the fingering and action is nearly identical to an acoustic guitar. Dont think of the Jamstick+ as a replacement for a guitar. Think of it as a great resource, especially for beginners who will appreciate its portability. The Jamstik+ is an innovative learning tool and a great source of fun.PROS  Fun  Great learning tool  Well-designed lessons  Easily connects easily to all Apple devices  iPad, iPhone, and iTouch  Lag free connection  Well made  Precise fingering  Intuitive with simple controls  Portable!
