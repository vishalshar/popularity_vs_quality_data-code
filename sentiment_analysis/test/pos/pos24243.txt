Initially, spending money to get water was bad enough, so paying for bottle to carry around water sound worse. So I use to wash bottles of water that I bought. Washed it thoroughly, with hot water, but my boyfriend actually got sick from it! Apparently, washing used water bottles does not get rid of all bacteria, so when I saw this bottle, I had to try it.  Best design ever! Easy to clean and hence, very sanitary, no BPA. I subsequently bought 10 of these to give to my friends/family.I strongly recommend this bottle if you reuse bottles.
