What else can you say except the Coravin works.  My wife opened a pricey bottle of wine using the Coravin with needle and backfilled the bottle with the Coravin argon injection.  The pour was easy and fast and sealing the bottle was a cinch (just remove the needle).  A few weeks later she took another pour from the same bottle and the flavor was perfect, as if it had never been opened.My father in law tells me he gets about two bottles out of each cartridge.  I haven't had mine long enough to see, but I trust him on this.My wife is thrilled that when she's in the mood, she can enjoy a really extravagant pour without opening a full bottle and wasting some of it. This made a great Christmas present and her face lit up when she saw it.
