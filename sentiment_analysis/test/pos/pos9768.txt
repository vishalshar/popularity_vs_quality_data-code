I purchased these for a recent ski trip and will start out by saying - if you're hesitating about purchasing these, go ahead and do it, you won't regret it!!I am an intermediate skiier and have only recently gotten to the point of being comfortable with music on the slopes - last time I brought earbuds but they were too uncomfortable under helmet pads. These integrated seamlessly into my helmet (Smith Holt), though I had to switch the right and left headphone due to the zipper orientation on the earpad pouch. Installation was easy and the earphones fit well into the ear pads without making them too tight against my ears. Since they're not earbuds, they don't block out the sound around you, so I was still able to easily carry on conversations and hear the snow. The sound quality was pretty nice, lacking a little bass but not nearly as tinny as I was expecting for headphones in this price range. The highest volume is plenty loud and leaks some sound (others sitting on the lift could hear music) but I wouldn't expect to have it that loud other than for testing the limits of the speakers.The button control interface is great - you just tap on the left ear once to play/pause, twice to fast forward, hold for voice, etc. Volume can only be controlled via the knob on the inline controller, but you shouldn't need to adjust that often and it's possible to do so with gloves still on. This made it easy and fun to interact with the music/voice even while traveling downhill at high speeds.The killer feature of these is the ability to initiate voice control when plugged into a phone - I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 and was able to control it using google voice, meaning I could request songs ('play some artistName"), text friends ("text person message") and check the time ("what time is it") all through the headphones. I could do all these things without ever having to take off gloves (a big deal!) or pull out my phone, which was super convenient.If you're debating between these and a bluetooth version, know that unlike the bluetooth ones, these do not require charging. The cord is coated in a braided coating and seems like it will be pretty resilient, plus it's smooth/wide enough not to easily get caught in a coat zipper. Also included are 2 stickers (red, square with a walking man logo) and a carrying bag. Very happy with this purchase.EDIT: after a winter of sporadic skiing, the chips had started to occasionally lose sound in one ear, a problem which worsened until sounds only ever came from one ear. I emailed support and they had a new cable immediately mailed to me, which has fixed the problem. Given the quality and speed of customer service, I'm keeping my review at 5 stars, and would urge anyone else with these issues to contact OR
