Beautiful little touch of color and "bling" for my fiancé tie on those occasions he's out on business and dressed to the nines. Powerful magnet ensures the tie stays attached to the shirt to prevent it from flapping in the wind or falling into anything while he's leaning forward or bending to pick anything up. Crafty design, the darker gold pattern has a brushed steel appearance, an alternative visual appeal from the brighter polished gold. This nifty little accessory arrived in a plastic mailer envelop whereby the metal dust from the UPS truck attached itself to the package. Packing for the item can sometimes come loose inside the nearly 1" x 1" clear acrylic box it ships with. However, don't fret, despite mine rubbing against the acrylic and scrubbing the case up, there was no damage or visual sign of chaffing to the tie mag itself. That warranted more appeal to me as my fiancé can sometimes be a bit careless with his attire or accessories.Would recommend this to anyone wanting a bit of change with their wardrobe and a "tie clip" that won't damage any fine ties. For more delicate ties, don't use the tie itself to pull the magnet away from the dress shirt. Wiggle finger beneath tie and between dress shirt while pressing another over the gold tie mag prior to remove to avoid any damage or dropping.
