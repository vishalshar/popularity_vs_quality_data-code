It's easy to use good scissors to trim the length of the straw to fit your beautiful old jars.  Mine show off my grandmother's old ball jars with the vertical grip lines, making them easier to handle in the kitchen and bathroom.  They're so pretty and easy to clean because these caps and pumps fit nice and tight.
