My husband is really into golf, and loves to play with his friends on his days off. So for his birthday, I wanted to order him something that he would benefit from. This towel looked perfect.Even though its geared towards football players, I thought that it would help him out while hes on the golf course. A lot of times he plays in places where there isnt a lot of shade and complains about the sweat dripping in his eyes.While he hasnt had a chance to play golf yet and try it out, hes really excited to take it to his first course this spring. He says its great quality and is super happy with it.
