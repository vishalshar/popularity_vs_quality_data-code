I have had this feeder for months now and I'm very pleased with it.  The lid is secure and requires human thumbs to open it. Having the pet feeder for my cat gives me peace of mind as I know that my pet will be okay if I'm delayed.  When I am away, I do not leave my pet alone and have a pet sitter, but having the pet feeder is useful to ensure that my cat eats meals (rather than free feeding) which keeps her at a healthy weight.The device is easy to clean and easy to monitor from my mobile device or my computer.  The initial set up was also easy despite the fact that the WPS instructions did not work for me.  I used the WiFi approach and was able to set this up just fine.I recommend this product.
