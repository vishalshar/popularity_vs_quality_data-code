Very good product.  It is the second time I buy this product for my six year old daughter and feel It was all worth it.  My daughter has had Ezcema since she was two years old.  Her flare ups occur mostly during Spring and Summer when she sweats a lot and when exposed to too much sun.  This Spring she got a bad flare-up and it did not want to go away.  I have spent lots of money in all sorts of lotions, creams and various OTC ezcema treatments, nothing seems to work.  I used this product last year and it healed her skin in a couple of weeks.  I used this product again this Summer and it worked again.  I used it on my daughter's ezcema two or three times a day and the pain, redness, itchy skin and dryness got under control.  Her skin got back to normal, it did work much better than any other thing I had tried.  As the skin started to heal, my daughter gradually stopped scratching because her skin was getting better each day.  Now, her skin looks back to normal, but we still continue to apply the cream daily once or twice. It keeps skin soft and the lotion does not have any odd smell or feels greasy. I usually do not write reviews but this product is very good.
