Vector Watch Luna Smartwatch-30 Day+ Autonomy, 5ATM, Notifications, Activity Tracking - Rose Gold/Rose Gold Bracelet-ElegantI've had my Vector watch for almost a month now, and I really value it. The fit and finish are superb, and the face's visibility is excellent, even in low light; and that's without even activating the brief led.  I'm getting all the battery life as advertised, even with all the usage of vibrations of alarms, notifications, night light, etc. I'm also getting compliments on the watch's appearance from friends and associates!  If you're worried about scratches, sure. Just be as carefull as you would with any fine watch. The "crystal" wipes clean easily, and my rose-gold bracelet shows no signs of wear. (But I don't recommend wearing it while rock-climbing).I've had the watch paired to an iPhone, and the app's many features are amazing to me...totally customizable to my preferences as to what notifications, activities I want to see or NOT see...I don't own any stocks, for instance. And I'm not on Facebook. But they're there if you want them, and even more streams. Even music controls are available straight from the watch; I don't have to fish my phone from my pocket to adjust volume or skip to the next track.  Just use the three sturdy buttons on the watch. I like that!I wanted to pair my watch to a Windows phone, but had a problem with the Windows phone app.  After contact with Vector's Support folks, my issue was completely resolved. Although the Windows app version is not up to all the capabilities of the iOS or Android versions, I have it on good authority that the WM10 app should be caught up with the others by the end of this year. I read on a Windows Central Review of the Vector Watch that the delay lies mostly with Microsoft releasing code. Vector will update the WM10 app very soon. Vector's Customer Service people were very courteous, competent and professional about my issue.Waterproof to 5 atmospheres deep. Customizable watch faces.  Discreet notifications (silent, light vibration). An expanding application package. This is a class-act TIMEPIECE, first and foremost, with very useful tech features!I own 11 other watches (really)...mostly Seikos. All mechanical, all beautiful each in their own way(s).  For a long time I had to ask myself..."Do I really need/want another watch?".  Once I researched the Vector watch, read most of the reviews, and watched (pun intended) videos, I decided I had to add ONE "tech" watch to my collection.  The Vector Smartwatch became a no-brainer when I looked at other brands for style, pricepoint, and growing number of features.Do your own research, and I think you might agree.
