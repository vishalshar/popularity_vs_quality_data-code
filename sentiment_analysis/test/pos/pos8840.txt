MFi (Made For iPhone) cables are expensive, and there's no real way of avoiding this. The NomadKey lightning cable is a bit pricy at $30, but the convenience of having this on my keychain certainly helps. I use this along with an Anker portable battery so I get an extra full charge out of my phone. The cable is quite flexible and I don't feel like it'll break and it takes up very little room on my keychain.Overall I like it. If you're a heavy iPhone user, this would make a great accessory.
