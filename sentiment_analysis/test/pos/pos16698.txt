This is a really intelligently designed battery case.  I love the ease with which you can use it.  Even better, I had an issue with the first one I received, and Prong replaced the product immediately.  Anyone can have a product that fails for some reason; what separates the good from the great is how the vendor responds.  Prong made it right, and did it right away. No rigamarole, no bs, just made it right!
