Size was as advertised, very light and soft, absorbant and easy to use: dries me, and it dries quickly. If you are used to heavy terry-cloth or plush towels, go to a hotel for those energy wasters. If you want to travel with less bulk, hike while carrying a minimal pack and enjoy yourself get these towels. They seem to be lighter, and maybe slighter cheaper than the Sea to Summit (all over-priced stuff) line.
