I received this as a Father's Day gift. It is so unique is this day and age to promise less and deliver more.  That's exactly what Yolk has done.  I live in Sothern California so there is no lack of sun.Always use the included silicon hinges they add no real weight and keep the panels together quite well.In good sun it charged my iPhone in less than 3 hours, it has a great auto restart feature that doesn't interrupt the charge.Extra panels are available to increase the voltage.This maybe the lightest most efficient panels I own.
