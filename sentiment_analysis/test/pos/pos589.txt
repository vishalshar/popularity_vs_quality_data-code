I work in healthcare and need dedicated footwear for work. I was constantly re-tying my athletic shoes.  These are the best thing to come along since Velcro.  I can slip on and off my shoes and not worry about laces.  I have had many compliments and questions about what they are and where can I get them.  The name Hickies is not easily forgotten. I only wish I thought of this first.
