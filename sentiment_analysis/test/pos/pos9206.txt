So far, my cat's immune system seems to be boosted from this supplement and he's definitely scratching at himself less frequently and I'm not finding his cotton ball fur tufts everywhere like before. This is all organic and human grade powdered mushrooms. This came in a plastic bag within a tiny cardboard canister and I transferred this to a small glass jar instead to keep as fresh as possible.
