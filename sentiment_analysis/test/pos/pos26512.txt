Great tasting! I use them in my cooked cereal along with walnuts and dried cranberries. The package has an airtight seal and appears to be pressurized.Sometimes the Amazon packers crush one of the packages so that they can fit two of them in a box that is too small; this results in loss of the pressure in that bag so I use that bag first and do not notice any loss of freshness. The last time I complained to Amazon about this, they refunded my money for the entire order.The product is great and the package can be resealed after opening. I have tried the cinnamon flavored chips as well and I prefer the plain ones.
