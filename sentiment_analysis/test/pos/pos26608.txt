The Libratone ZIPP Mini transformed our cell phones and tablet into portable sound systems in a matter of minutes. The sound quality of the speakers is excellent. Before I bought the Libratone we had tended to rely on the tinny internal speakers of an iPad to stream Pandora and internet radio because it was brainless--but the sound quality was similar to an old-fashioned transitor radio.Pairing the Libratone to the iPad and iPhones via Bluetooth was easy to do. It was playing music in a few minutes--music that we could take anywhere in the apartment. It is particularly useful for a small apartment because it provides good quality sound that you can take with you into the bathroom, kitchen or bedroom and it takes up little space. What is impressive is the high quality sound given the small size--it's about the same size as a 1.5 liter bottle of water.The documentation provided is minimal, but suffient to explain how to pair the Libratone to Bluetooth easily. Setting it up to stream using WiFi was a bit more challenging to me; I think it's because the Libratone wasn't able to accomodate a 5G signal. Once I fiddled with the modem's settings I got it to work, but the Bluetooth signal is the one we've been relying on. In spite of the WiFi wrinkle I highly recommend the Libratone ZIPP Mini and plan to by a second for creating even better surround sound.
