First I would like to say that I am a huge fan of music. The tv volume is blaring most of the time in my house and it can get unbearable at times. The noise cancelling on these headphones allows me to sit in the same room with the super loud tv and enjoy my music or videos in peace. I was impressed with every aspect of these headphones. The packaging is beautiful and luxurious and makes you feel like the company really cares about their products and how they are presented to their customer. The headphones come with a very nice carrying case that has two pockets to fit not only the cords, but other items you may want on the go with you. The fact that the headphones come with adapters for either Apple or Android was really nice. I also really like that you can choose which side you would like to plug your cord into, so you control where the cord will go. The feel of these headphones is so nice, they are not heavy, as you might expect, and they hug your head without being restrictive. After wearing these headphones during my workout, I did not want to rip them off my head the moment I was done as I have with earbuds in the past. These were comfortable and sounded so crisp. I am thoroughly impressed with these headphones and will recommend them time and again to friends and family. I love the volume toggle feature on the cord so you don't have to mess with whatever device you have the headphones connected to in order to adjust the sound.I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and welcome positive or negative feedback.
