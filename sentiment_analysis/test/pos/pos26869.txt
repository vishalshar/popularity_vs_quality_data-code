I was hesitant to purchase this because my dogs are on smaller side. I have an 8lb Chihuahua and a 20lb Terrier mutt and to my delight, they both could handle the weight and size of this coupler. In just one use it has improved our walks. They are both much more aware of their position and the Terrier, who has boundless energy, no longer tugs on the leash. I purchased this in conjunction with the small Sassy Dog Wear black nylon leash and they work great together. Very, very pleased with this purchase.
