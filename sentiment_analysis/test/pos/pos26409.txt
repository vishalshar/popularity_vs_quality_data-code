This set comes with great sounding oscillators and filters from korg, and littlebits' modular design - this is quite literally a korg modular synth for less than $200. The synth is more flexible than individual korg volcas (I.e. volca bass, volca keys) and it is in the same price range. I will be getting either the synth pro expansion kit, or just the cv module to control this with the SQ-1, but the korg/little bits synth comes with a simple sequencer that even complete beginners can figure out (manual included). The other modules include delay, envelope, filter - you want these. I would recommend getting the kit and maybe get a few more a la cart, if you choose.
