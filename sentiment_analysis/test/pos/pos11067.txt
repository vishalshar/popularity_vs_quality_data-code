Man, this thing is worth every penny! I feels great and really adds a whole new look to the phone video market. People are so impressed when I show up to a video shoot with the BGP set up with everything I need. You will not be disappointed with this rig.The only thing is that you should add alittle tight grip to the screw threads of the lens adjusters. They do not lock in well and you don't want to over-tighten them. But other than that, this thing rocks.
