I don't typically write reviews, but this thing is amazing.I've seen great reviews for this product for it's intended use, but I got it specifically for VR gaming and my goodness - it takes immersion to a new level. I've tried a quick test with a game that places you in a war zone, and when things explode, it feels like the world is shaking.For other experiences, having the additional feedback is simply more sensory information for your body to trick your brain into thinking you're in the VR world. For you VR early adopters out there - you won't be disappointed.
