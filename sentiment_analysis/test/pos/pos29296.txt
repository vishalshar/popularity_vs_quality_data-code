My son says, "It's a great robot because you don't need to have a remote for it. You can make it follow your hand.  It comes with a few modes like roam mode, dance mode and a few other modes.  I think it is also good because it can balance on its wheels.  I like the way it looks because it looks friendly and it looks unique."
