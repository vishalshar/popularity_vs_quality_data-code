Kids will enjoy it.  I had fun with it.  Took it for a long walk. People see this ball rolling in front of you on it's own down the street. Even up hill :-). Unfortunately, my cats, who I bought it as a toy for, were intimidated. They played a little but are easily frightened if it moves too quickly or bumps into them.
