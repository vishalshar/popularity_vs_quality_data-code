I have had my Spire for almost 2 years now andit has become like a friendly reminder of all my good intentions to become more mindful. I use it for the activity tracker but much more for the breath monitoring. The science behind this approach to breathing as well as the Plum Village contributions is very solid. My understanding is that it is based on Stephen Porges' Polyvagal theory, a very interesting approach to what Porges calls the social engagement system. Good breathing opens the door to a calmer, less emotionally reactive way of life. Has there ever been a time when we needed that more?
