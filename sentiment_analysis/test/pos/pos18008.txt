I bought the Osmo Creative Set for my 6 year old Grandson for Christmas 2016.However, I thought it was a "stand alone" piece of equipment but in reality it required a Start Kit - in all honesty I did not realise this and my son rectified the situation by ordering one and it arrived within a few days after Xmas Day.That aside, the Osmo Creative Set is a complete winner. My Grandson found it easy to adapt to the technology, and has had immense joy in creating his own art that was magically displayed as a story via a big hairy bear!There are multiple learning benefits too for any young learner, ranging from coordination to problem solving, and creative, fun way.As parents and a grandparent we were mesmerized and, of course, wanted to play too!Highly recommend this creative "toy"
