Excellent water-based lubricant for menopausal relief.  Just a small amount twice daily works for me.  Other products I've tried were oil based and a complete mess.  This product provides soothing and lasting relief.  The cap when snapping together doesn't work well, you will have to fiddle around to close.  Will be purchasing again, thanks.
