Got this for my 15 year old son, who has recently become obsessed with robotics. Within 5 minutes of opening the box, he had already made a light sensor for his room. It's literally foolproof, yet has the ability to be made into complex projects. You are only limited by your imagination. This is an expensive kit, but easily worth it when you think about what it can make. The pieces are delicate, as are all robotics. Don't let that detour you from this set. There isn't any soldering, cutting or coding required. The ends are even magnets, positive and negative, so you can't connect incorrectly. We couldn't be more pleased with this product.
