I've had the URB-E Black Label Electric Folding Scooter for less than 24 hours and just took a 10-mile ride, here are my initial impressions. Looks super cool as it's great-looking. Solidly built with high quality materials, definitely not a toy. Packaged well, minimal assembly was really easy and took less than 10 minutes (mount the front fork with 4 bolts and tighten them down). Folds and unfolds really easily. Kickstand keeps it standing up nicely whether open or folded up. When collapsed it wheels around really easily and you maneuver it like you would a wheelbarrow, and the wheels roll up and down stairs easily. This is important since picking it up and carrying it for long distances isn't practical due to the overall weight and lack of a great handhold or grab strap (to lift it when folded, your fingers (or 3 of them) fit in one of the holes under the seat). Seat is full-size and more comfortable than one might expect- although you do feel jolts from cracks due to small wheel size (mitigated by a shock under the seat which definitely softens things up). Acceleration is immediate and I reached a top speed close to 15mph (wearing a helmet is a must). Loses steam going up hills but made it. Feels like it might benefit from being rear wheel drive as that's where your body weight is compressing, so sometimes needed to shift my weight slightly forward to put pressure on the front fork in order to maximize traction (it's front wheel drive); but not an issue. Very tight turning radius possible due to small tires. Disc brake is responsive and does the job nicely. Battery indicator on handlebar is nice but only shows 3 settings (full, half and empty)- not a super reliable way to gauge how much power you have left. Missing / things that would improve the experience but aren't deal-breakers: plastic cap over battery only snaps into place and can be removed (stolen) easily. Can't operate the unit unless key is in ignition (would be nice to be able to remove it). Turn signals, horn and removable rear view mirrors that mount into the handlebar ends should come standard. Taillight is better than nothing but it's not adequate. Sleeve inserts don't sit flush inside the battery tube (taping them to the inside helps). Inability to register the unit with the MFR is a bummer. The biggest miss is the lack of an app (to see more accurate battery %age, speed, distance, etc). Overall I love it. I own other battery-powered personal transportation devices and although this is the largest, it's also the most comfortable for longer duration trips and the fact it can go 20 miles on a single charge (I haven't gone this far yet) is impressive. A lot of fun to ride, and definitely a conversation-starter- people stared at it, came up and asked me how it ran, what's it called, etc. Other than using it for fun, I can see several practical uses: trips to the grocery store when not picking up a lot of stuff, short trips getting around town, take on car trips / vacations, useful at sports tournaments, a fun way to explore the city in conjunction with METRO and/or bus, tooling around campus or a large workplace, etc. I'm stoked on my new URB-E and will be looking for any opportunity as an excuse to ride it!
