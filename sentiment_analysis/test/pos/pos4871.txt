Water definitely needs to boil before usage. Instructions are VERY clear, the seller has a video on YouTube that can be viewed instead of reading instructions. Fit is obviously perfect, cable is long enough to reach between my pocket and ears (I'm about 5'10"/178cm). Sound is great, supports bass well. Worthy of 5 stars. Very easy to remold if necessary.
