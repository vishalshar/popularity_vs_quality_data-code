This guard is the best for makeup brush. I clean my brushes often and after I clean them I would gently squeeze out the water, I then use the guard over the brush and leave about 1/4 inch past the tip of the brushes. And I just use a cup and put the bushes upside down in it to dry. The guard help hold the shape of the brush and it lets air through to help the brushes dry faster. Also it is perfect to protect the brush when traveling.
