Fun, Easy and just so dang cool!!!!  Within 3 or 4 days we had mushrooms growing, been fun for the whole family to watch them grow these last few days. They grew so fast, and literally were inches bigger from morning to night! Learning experience and we can't wait to harvest and eat!!!!  Reasonably priced too, so many Mushroom kits out there for twice the money!
