My rescue Australian Cattle puppy started getting itchy and developed spots where he began to lose his fur.  He is on a high quality grain-free diet, but it turned out he has summer allergies.  Instead of putting him on the harmful medications the vet recommended, I went on a search and found this. Using it in conjunction with their Immunity product and within 2 weeks I'm seeing fantastic results!  The areas where there was no fur at all, and turning red is starting to slowly grow hair.  He is also scratching less and is as happy as can be.  This product is truly a miracle and will be in my pups diet for the rest of his life (also, my pup loves the taste).  I would wholly recommend this to anyone who is desperately looking for a natural, wholesome solution!
