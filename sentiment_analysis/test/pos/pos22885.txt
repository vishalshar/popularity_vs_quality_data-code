I'm using mine with rubber stoppers and airlocks to make lacto-fermented recipes.  Currently, I have Italian Style Pepperonicini and Sauerkraut in my mason jars.  These are working well for my homemade fermenting jars.  My only comment is ... I was supposed to get "natural" lids, which looked like they are white-clear.  Instead, I got lids that were bubble gum pink.  They aren't even close to "natural," and I don't see that color offered, so I was surprised.  I would have preferred the natural version, but for my purpose, it makes no difference.  I bought Drilled Rubber Stoppers #6 (sets of 3) and the 3-piece airlocks (sold in sets of 6 for $8.50) to make my fermenting jars.  Super easy to assemble and keeps my fermentation sealed.
