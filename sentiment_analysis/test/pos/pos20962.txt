Fun toy,  found a few hot spots around the house,  can easily see how bad my windows leak heat.  Found a plugged heat vent.Now that I am convinced I need new windows, it's just a fun toy looking at heat signitures of coffee cups, water cups.Amazed how long body heat stays around on tables, chairs or even walls.Basically a fun toy with some practical uses.  The free software works on my andriod phone and tablets.
