4 stars = "I like it"That's about right. It doesn't stay connected to my phone (Samsung s5), while my other bluetooth devices do. So when it's connected it works like a charm. But since it loses connectivity probably daily and I don't check that every morning, it's likely this won't help find anything when I really need it...
