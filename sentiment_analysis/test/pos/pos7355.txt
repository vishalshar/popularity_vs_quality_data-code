Holding up very well.  I threw away my "one-size fits all" Old Navy no-shows, and my more expensive Pair of Thieves one-size; if you are a size 12 foot, THEY WILL NOT FIT ALL and will be extremely uncomfortable.  The Galiva socks fit perfectly, and the glue is holding up well after several washes.  Although, I highly suggest washing them on the delicate cycle and drying on a low setting for a short time (20-30 minutes) just to be safe.  Also, they do not show, as promised.Will buy again next time.
