After reading some reviews I was a little hesitant to purchase the product because people were complaining that their bottles were cracking during the swelling process.  I am happy to say my bottle did not crack during the process.  I did have very small leaks on the bottom of the bottle but the oak bottle wax stopped the leaks instantly.  It is currently drying out so that I can put my first bottle of whiskey to age.  I'll update the review after I have had my first sip of whiskey after it has been aged.Update 9/26/2016I put a bottle of Johnnie Walker double black in the oak bottle on Thursday night and on Saturday night I couldn't believe the difference. I had a new bottle of double black to do a side by side comparison and was amazed at how it improved the taste.I would definitely recommend you buying this. I was hesitant to buy because of some of the reviews that included the bottle cracking during the swelling process but I only had small leaks. I would hope that if yours cracks you can get your money back.
