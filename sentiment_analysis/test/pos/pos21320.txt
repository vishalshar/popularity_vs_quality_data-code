I've had my Rachio installed and running for just about a two months, and I could not be more satisfied or happier with its performance. The physical installation was very easy, replacing an existing controller, as I did. I opted for Flex scheduling, so setting up the parameters (plant, sprinkler types, slope, shade, etc.) on the individual zones does require an owner investment in time and diligence, in order to optimize the watering schedule, and may require some tweaking, but there is plenty of support and guidance material available, so it's a good learning process.Product support is outstanding on the Rachio, in fact, I've never experienced a support team and active community forum that approaches it, in terms of responsiveness or product expertise. The team is very active in making frequent improvements and enhancements to the firmware and UI, which bodes well for their ongoing success and for customer satisfaction.The Android app and web browser access are great, and it can be really helpful to be able to directly control the schedule and individual zone activation from anywhere.I live in the Southeast, where Summer storms are often highly localized, and I quickly found that reliance on the nearest NWS weather station for reporting, even though it is only 1.1 mi. from my home, was not giving me the level of accuracy for rainfall that I needed, so I added a Rain Bird WR2 Rain Sensor, and then a Netatmo Weather Station. Now that I can rely on rain information that is very accurate for my home, I am comfortable that the scheduler can do its job most effectively. In retrospect, I might have just added the Netatmo, but I have both the Rain Bird and the Netatmo operational, as kind of a belts and suspenders operation.
