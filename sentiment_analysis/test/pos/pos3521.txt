UPDATEAfter misting for 1 whole month, I thought I got a dud and was about to give up but then I tried one last thing. I decided to put it under my bed and and in two days..... baby mushrooms began to sprout. I got about 6 groups growing on one side. So for all you Mushrooms kit growers  out there, Place it under your beds for GOOD results. Happy Growing!!!!
