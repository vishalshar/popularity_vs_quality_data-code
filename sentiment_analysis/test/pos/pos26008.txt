This FUGOO Sport speaker is AWESOME!! It came 3/4 charged which made it easy to start using immediately. I just touched the pairing button, went into bluetooth settings on my iPhone and selected it and it immediately paired and sent my Spotify music over.Great bass and overall sound dispersion. The outside feels like fabric, and the corners and bottom feel very durable with rubber.It has a very hefty weight to it. I love it. I just start Spotify on my phone in my apt, walk to my patio, turn the unit on, and it plays my music immediately.Exceeded all of my expectations!!
