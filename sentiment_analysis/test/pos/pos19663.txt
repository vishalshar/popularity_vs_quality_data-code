We live in Ohio and purchased a Saltnets mat last year. We left it at our rear door where we exit most frequently in the morning. If it snows, we typically step right into it on the way out. Fortunately, with the Saltnets Mat in place, we didn't have to this year. The Saltnets mat melted all the snow time and time again. No shovelling needed! I left it out all winter and never once needed to shovel off the area the mat was in. The snow metls when it lands on it. I hope they come out with different sizes soon!
