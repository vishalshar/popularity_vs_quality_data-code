This is (so far) a great way to expand the hard drive space on my Macbook Pro Retina 13" laptop, which only has a 256GB drive and my massive media collection really strains it.  I've offloaded all of my media to this, and it's small enough to stick to the top of the laptop with some Velcro (bought here for a few bucks - see below).  The drive is affixed to the top right (with the lid/screen closed), so the short 6" USB3 cable reaches the USB port with room to allow the screen/lid to be fully opened and shut.  I can then just unplug the USB for transport and put it in the case/bag in any direction.I do lose a USB port (only one left) but it seems to be working well.  My previous solution of the past year was to use a 256GB SD card, which worked well as the files are "static" (ie I don't transfer much in and out) -- but I've run out of space on that.  There were a few initial glitches with copying quite a lot from this drive to the internal SSD -- it got quite hot and would disconnect near the end of a 100GB transfer from my local/internal SSD.  But it seems to be working well for USB3-to-USB3 transfers - so I guess this external drive may be too fast for it's own good?
