I thought this just a stupid gimmick that I got as a joke. Joke was on me. I am no longer asking or being asked the question... thereby returning a handfull of seconds back to our lives every day for the other important things like looking for misplaced keys or making the third trip back in the house to grab the wallet or phone.I found that the best way to use this was to mount it to the food bin and just slide the indicator before opening and grabbing the scoop. I call it the doggie lie detector, because you can see at a glance if their tale of woe is a farse or not.
