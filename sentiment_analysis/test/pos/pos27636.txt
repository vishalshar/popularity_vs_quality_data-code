On a Large Ranch, Being able to turn on and off Hot-Tape Fence Chargers, Flood Lights, Heaters, pumps, etc etc etc from anywhere, with our iPhones, is something we'd be hard pressed to do without now! I can be a mile from the House/Work-Shop, working on Repairing Hot-Tape connected to the Steel Field Fencing, and instantly turn on or off the Fence Charger to work on, and then test, the connections... There's just too many uses to name!  With WeMo Devices, and our Home Security System/DVR, we can be in the Caribbean, watch the House (Inside and out), check on the Horses, Turn on and off "Trough Filler" pumps, open and close Automatic gates in the Pastures, etc...
