I was skeptical after my first try with the mushroom kit, but the company was more than helpful and kind to send me another, even though my warranty had expired. And it worked! We had mushrooms growing in our box within 2 weeks. Growing mushrooms is made easy with this kit...I'm more than satisfied, thanks to their customer service.
