I bought this computer about 1 week ago.  I am dual booting it with the stock windows 10 home and xubuntu 16.04.  I am a software developer, so my review is biased more towards experimental home coding.  I don't do any any gaming and can't speak at all about that.Pros:Agreeable weight for its size.Fast (this is relative obviously, but for web surfing, ms word, and coding it is incredibly responsive).QuietCoolUbuntu works very well from a straight installExpandable DDR4 RAMCons:Screen feels a bit off (you kind of have to use it to understand)Scratches easilyStrange fan quirkPhysically, the laptop is very appealing.  It has a slim factor, it is light and it is smooth.  The backside of the monitor developed a nick in it that is sharp to the touch.  I am afraid to smooth it out for fear of further damage.  This is kind of annoying considering it has not been dropped or blatantly damaged in any way, and is always in a sleeve when not in use.  This to me is indicative of either poor finish or poor materials.The Windows usage is pretty typical.  If you like Windows 10, it's Windows 10.  Super snappy and responsive for general computer usage.  Wifi works very well.The Ubuntu usage was surprisingly good.  I read some negative reviews on Ubuntu installs with this laptop, but it works as well as any linux laptop setup I have ever had.  There was a glitch with the wifi driver that was very easy to fix.  The touchpad will freeze up after suspend, but that is fixable as well.  Other than that, everything seems to just work and it is a pleasure to write code with.  The Wifi reports poor range within ubuntu, but I believe that is either a bug or a misrepresentation because the wifi range is always fine even with just one bar - the same as when you reboot with windows with full bars.There is an additional DDR4 slot that you can add 16GB of ram with, which I did.  If you are a student  working with very large thesis documents or spreadsheets, you will find this useful, especially if you leave lots of browser windows open.  If you are a coder, the advantage of having an extra 16 GB is obvious, especially if you use any of the popular IDEs (I use eclipse).  This is the RAM I bought and I haven't had any BSODs or seg faults:Crucial 16GB Single DDR4 2133 MT/s (PC4-17000) SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT16G4SFD8213https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015YPB6HQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I knocked a star off this guy because in addition to the sharp scuff on the backside of the monitor, one time I turned on the laptop and before I could even choose an OS, the fans were on maximum jet overdrive.  They sounded like a leaf blower.  I booted into Windows and the fans never let up.  I shut down the laptop and restarted, and it hasn't happened again since.  I suspect this will happen again, although i've been beating on this thing and it has not.Another contributor is the display.  Something about it seems just not right.  There are a lot of people who knock the display because it is not the newer technology with the wider viewing angle.  I thought this was stupid and ignored it.  Who cares about viewing angle on a laptop?  But when you use the laptop (especially after comparing it to a comparable Lenovo like the Flex 4), the display is just not quite there.Overall I am pretty happy with this thing.  The extra 256GB SSD space is nice for dual boot, and adding 16GB for an extra 60 bucks or so is a no brainer.  If you are a developer like me, looking for a solid dual boot machine (for home use and some personal coding projects), this is a solid buy for under 950 (including the 16GB ram).  I also think this would be good for an advanced student or anyone doing a ton of multitasking work in the ms office suite.I also think for the extra 200 bucks or so the expandable RAM and larger SSD gives you a little bit longer life over comparable laptops.  200 bucks means different things to different people, for me it is worth it even if it means just getting another 6 months of practical life out of my laptop.  For others maybe not, that's ok too.
