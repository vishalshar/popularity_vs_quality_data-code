First played this game at a friend's house a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to learn. After a few turns, most players should at least have enough of a grasp of the rules to get how it works, but it takes a few games to really get a feel for the strategy. Gameplay is quick, and interesting thanks to the cards, and the dice make it random enough that veteran players won't necessarily stomp all over newbies.
