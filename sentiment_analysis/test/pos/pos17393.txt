I have been using this for 2 months now and I love it.  After the first month I noticed that my lashes had filled in a spot that had been bare for years.  I also find that my lashes look so much fuller and thicker when I use mascara than they did before.  The brush on applicator doesn't always work so well, but I contacted the seller through Amazon and got an immediate response.  They new and improved applicator is due out anyway.I received the new applicator a week ago and it is so easy to use.  No mess, no leaking, no having to prime it every day.  Easy to use Instructions are included.
