Apple should adopt earhoox in their earbuds package.It really works great and looks good too.I had Bose in ear MIE2i for 2 years until it stopped working.Earhoox is exactly same idea as Bose MIE2i.However I move my head, my earbuds are not fall off anymore.I thought large size fits perfectly but I found it little hurts my ear after 1 hour using.I switched to small size and it still fits my ear and very comfortable.I wish if there's medium size but it is still OK to me.Because of earhoox, I saved $100 not to buy Bose MIE2 again.Also their service is great.My first order arrived with teared one of large size.I emailed with picture and quickly they re-shipped another new package without returning first one.Thank you so much earhoox!!!!(12/16/2014) I am using it for 3 months now and I really like it. still satisfying.^^(12/3/2015) I am still using it and very satisfying.
