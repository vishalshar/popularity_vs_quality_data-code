So these work really well so far! I have one with rice and the other with granola. They seem to seal pretty tight so I feel comfortable turning them to the side and shaking ingredients into the lid for easy measurement and the plastic that is used is really thick/sturdy. You are able to control size of the opening that leads to the lid so that less/more falls into it. When you open the lid there is a plastic piece that covers the opening that leads to the main canister, so only the amount measured comes out (this works really well).My biggest complaint is that there is no really easy way to towel dry the measuring portion of the lid just because of the way it is designed. Air drying was a good way to go for now. My other canisters will be used for flour and protein powder now that I know it works well (and now that the lids have finally dried out).They are a bit expensive for what they are, but I really like the look and convenience of them.
