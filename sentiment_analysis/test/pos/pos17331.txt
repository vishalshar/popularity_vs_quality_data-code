I bought this as stocking stuffer for my dad and at first he laughed as it was slightly meant to be a joke but now he actually does use it and likes it. He said it can be a little bright at night but it does the job. I have tested it and I set it up on the side of the bowl and it has turned on with me being 8-10 feet away.One complaint i have is that the suction cup for the actual light does not stick no matter what i have tried but since it hangs over the edge it does really need it to work but it would have been nice.
