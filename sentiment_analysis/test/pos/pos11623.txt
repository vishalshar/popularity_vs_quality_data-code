great sound, from my 1pad 4 with128 gb, with with good spearkers.setup was quick and easy and works great with garage band. Haven't use it with my ipad Mini 4 and iphone 6s both have 128 gb of storage and don,t see any problems setting them up. I gave it 4 stars because i wish it was at lease 12 inch longer give more to hold , but with that said, it works great so far, maybe someone will make a type of cardle to set it into to make it longer ????? Now all is we need is  the porting the software to windows now, so i can use it on my desktop with a 7.1 speaker system
