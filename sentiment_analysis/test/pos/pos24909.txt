The expansion consists of two straight pieces of track.  It works best when combined with a curve expansion kit to allow for some more creative track designs.  If your looking to create a longer straightaway to boost all the way down just the speed kit will be sufficient.  I would suggest getting the rail kit as well if you do that so you can boost down the straightaway and through the curve since the car will slide along the rail.
