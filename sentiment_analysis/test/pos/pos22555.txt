It isn't very rigid or grippy - I use it when carrying the drone in the car or walking out to a take off spot.  I don't think I would use this particular gimbal if I were hiking with the drone in a backpack, or traveling by plane - I would be worried it would move too much.  I would likely use the stock gimbal lock in those situations.  I got this product because I use filters all the time and the stock gimbal doesn't for with those in place.
