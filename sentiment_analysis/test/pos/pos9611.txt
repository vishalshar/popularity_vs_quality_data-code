*UPDATE ~ photo added*  Just took a cross-country flight. The headphones really work well as an all around solution.  Great in the game. Great on the plane.I'm a pretty serious gamer. I just finished my new build.I first heard about these at the GameStop Expo in LA. I'm a pretty serious gamer. Enough that I have a sweet gaming rig and I go to Gaming Events. With my nerd/gaming enthusiast bonafide's established, let me explain what I was looking for: My kid kept stealing my good headsets. We started battling over them. I finally got tired of it and decided to buy another pair. I wanted something versatile.  Gaming headsets that double as excellent everyday headphones.Like I said I saw these at the GameStop Expo. I visited 4 different headset booths and these were by far superior at the price point of any I saw that day. I was excited when I finally pulled the trigger and ordered these sweet gaming headsets.PRO's:1. The cord doesn't twist up and annoy me. My last headset's braided cord wound up tighter and tighter then I would have to unspool it. You can see the cord from the old headset in the photo. I put it on the envelope to point it out. That was super annoying from my old headset. This cord, while not braided is good quality but it doesn't twist up. The LS20 has a great cord. I know it is funny to put that first but take a look at the white envelope on my first photo and you will see why I did.2. Styling: These babies are equally at home at a LAN party or Airport. Pop the mic off and they look like they were meant to be in business class.  I love the look and feel of these headsets. They look cool. I can't wait to show them off at the next LAN event I attend. I already showed them to a couple of my gaming buddies and they are envious. They have a certain cool factor that the big clunky headsets don't have.3. Sound: The amplified sound and bass boost are awesome. I was listening to music as I typed this review out and was amazed at the difference in sound from my old headsets. These just have a deeper better sound. It didn't feel like I was listening to music on a gamer's headset. They sound like an expensive audiophiles headset. Unplug the mic and you will look cool walking around with them on your ears.4. Microphone: I got into our TeamSpeak channel and tested out the sound of the Microphone. The conversation went like this: "Sounds like you got a new mic. It's not so tinny." And again the mic unplugs converting the headset to a sweet set of headphones.5. Comfort: I like how they fit. They are not as hot as my bigger pair of headsets. I didn't have that sweaty gamer's ear that the other pair gives almost immediately. I'm not saying they don't make your ears hot, but they are much better than my old pair.6. Quality: These have a solid feel to them that I love. While not heavy, they are solid. I paid a similar price for my other gaming headsets, but these just seem to a different caliber of quality.CON's:1. Short wire. The 3.5mm line is a little short. They are designed to plug into a gaming controller or a keyboard. You can also plug them into most monitors. That is the preferred set up for most PC Gamers.I had an extension handy and plugged them directly into my PC.SUMMARY:What set these headsets apart is they double as headphones. They have great sound at the $99 price point but they are not stuck to your Gaming Rig. You can be stylish and listen to your jams as you fly coast to coast.
