I have had my leaf for 1 day and I love the look of it. Such a beautiful and unique fitness tracker. The leaf and app are syncing well and I had no problems setting it up. I do hope the app will be updated. The Fitbit app is perfect, hopefully they will update it in a similar manner, but the Fitbit doesn't last and it's a pain to clip on, and falls off, and it's ugly to wear on your wrist especially with professional clothes. So I am giving the leaf a try. My only real gripe is the leather bracelet is horrible. I literally wore it to bed once and took it off to shower and put it back on. In that time frame the bracelet has already cracked and looks like I have been wearing it for weeks. Very disappointing because I want to wear it on my wrist. I don't like clipping it and can't always wear it as a necklace so I guess I will be purchasing a different bracelet. Not cool when you have already spent $138! Hopefully Bellabeat will produce a better quality strap bracelet soon. The current one is not quality so don't buy it thinking you will be wearing it on your wrist with their bracelet. Expect to spend another $25 or so for a better bracelet. Other than that I am happy with it. It's doing everything it should.
