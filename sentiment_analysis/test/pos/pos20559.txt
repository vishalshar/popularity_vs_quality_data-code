Terrific idea. Well packaged and fits perfectly on the visor. I thought it was such a unique idea and so handy that I bought 4 of them. One for my wife;s car, one for my truck and two for neighbors. We live in the north woods of Maine and need to be prepared sharing the road with logging trucks and icy roads. Great product.
