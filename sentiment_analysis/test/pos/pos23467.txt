Switched to these after taking Vitamin Code RAW prenatals...why you ask?Quite frankly the Vitamin Code prenatals are GREAT for you -- but you have to take 3 large pills throughout the day that taste something AWFUL.  Sick & nauseous from my vitamins, I quit taking them altogether.  Back on the search, I found these YUMMY gummies that have natural folate and everything I truly need!!  I additionally take extra D3 and magnesium, but these gummies will provide the most essential of prenatal vitamins.  Yes, there is NO iron & NO calcium, but pills are a supplement -- not a substitute for a healthy diet!  Iron & Calcium both should be a part of your healthy regimen everyday, and if you feel you are not getting enough, talk to your health provider.  Not going back!!  Worth taking 6 gummies everyday!
