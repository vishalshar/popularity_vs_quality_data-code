Replaced an older Withings device. The Go is more comfortable on the wrist and actually looks like a watch, which is what I wanted for everyday use. I've used fitbits before, and Withings is as good, plus the flexibility of wearing as a clip or in-pocket is great. I got it on Black Friday sale; it's a good deal at $70, but an absolute steal at $30,
