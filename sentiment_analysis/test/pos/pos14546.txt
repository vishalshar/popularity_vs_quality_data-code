My son enjoyed this toy. The set-up took a little bit and I didn't love that it had to be controlled solely by his device, but it provided hours of entertainment and he was really proud to "show-off" to his friends. I even told other neighborhood parents to look into purchasing one so the kids could play with them together. Even though there are some pre-set "games" for your child and the drone to play together, I think it would be more fun and interactive if other kids could play with at the same time. Either way, he seemed to enjoy it and thought it was really cool that he had his very own drone! Not sure if drones will be a fad that comes and goes, but for now, my kid is into it. I like that you can use it indoors and that it senses to not run into objects. This makes it a great indoor toy (aka distraction) when the weather is bad.
