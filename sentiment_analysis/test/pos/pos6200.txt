These lights were made for the Solo and were easy enough to install.  I found on this set that the rear light wires were just a tad short. I was able to press them into the landing gear legs, but the wires could have been a 1/4- 3/8 inch longer. It is a tight stretch.  The connector fit into the aux port OK.  Red LEDs in the rear and White LEDs in the front help with orientation while flying and the drone can be seen at a greater distance.
