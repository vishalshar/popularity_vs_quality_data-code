I love this water filter so so so much! I live in an older building and the pipes add a distinct and unwanted flavor to the water. This filters it right out. The pitcher is beautiful and the perfect size. I've used other brand in the past that take ages to filter leaving you standing at the sink monitoring it or keeping the faucet on a steady stream till the pitcher inevitably overflows. The Soma filters super fast and has an auto stopper that pops up when the reserve is full. I love it so much I bought another one for my mom for Christmas.
