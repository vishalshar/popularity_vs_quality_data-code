I love this moisturizer! The texture is perfect, not sticky at all but also not oily. Its so light and perfect for the summer for when I dont need a thick moisturizer. I think its so interesting that a chemist created the product because it just means that this cream will actually give you scientifically backed results. I also love all the natural ingredients in this product, as Im very hesitant about putting harmful chemicals on my face. I love this cream and the price is great as well, as I would gladly pay much more for it, seeing as its given me amazing results!
