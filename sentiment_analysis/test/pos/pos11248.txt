We bought a couple of these recently coming off of a mixed experience with the SIM based GPS units popular here on Amazon. After losing one of the units this fall in an area blanketed with leaves, we began to re-evaluate the value proposition of a budget solution vs something purpose built. The text and google maps link system only gets you so far, even with a GPS tracker. By the time you buy a prepaid SIM for a year plus the tracker you are into it for around $150. So we decided to try the whistle.It's been close to a week and and so far I believe the units do largely what they say they will do. I've been following the activity patterns of the dogs, testing the GPS tracking and looking at the battery life and they all seem to exceed the previous solution. The refresh time is a concern the same as any other GPS unit I've used - it varies based on location and if the units are in the open the refresh seems faster and more accurate.Battery life for me seems to be around 8-10 days which is a pleasant surprise. The whistle zone geofencing communication is cool and much easier to administer than my previous tracker. I can't comment on this vs the previous Tagg solutions but I do find myself using the app a lot to check on the dogs' activity. The app seems fairly well-designed an intuitive.The only place this fell down for me was the account provisioning. I did it through the IOS app and although I have two trackers it did not recognize this and I will need to follow up Whistle to ensure the discounted rate gets applied to the second unit. I hope this helps anyone who is coming to a decision point on whether this tracker deserves consideration on their short list.
