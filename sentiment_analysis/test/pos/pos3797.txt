I'm not sure the claims by the company that makes the OnCore MA 1.0 really helps the golfer. It seems to go down the fairway okay but don't expect extra distance or straighter shots. I didn't seem to get any benefit from the MA 1.0. It was like playing a real hard ball that's real loud when hit. It did stay under control so it does have spin. I was short on all my pitches and chips thinking it would roll out a lot more. I rated it 4 stars out of 5 and will update this review as I go through the dozen balls I bought. I only played 9 holes with it. When I'm playing better I'm sure the MA 1.0 will be better too. Take a chance and try it. Good Luck!
