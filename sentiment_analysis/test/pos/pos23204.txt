We finally decided to go RV'ing full time.  The mattress in our RV was decent, but after laying on the old one for about 20 minutes, it felt like I was laying on the floor.  After plenty of research, we came across the Casper mattress.  I was a bit skeptical not knowing how the mattress felt and how long it would last, but so far so good!  We have been sleeping on this mattress for 3 weeks now and cannot complain, the comfort level is great and getting this mattress in the RV was a breeze.  I would highly recommend it!
