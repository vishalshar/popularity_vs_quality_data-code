we love getting cheese from Whole Foods and I was getting tired of it not lasting well in the refrigerator.  There was a review about this (either on ATK or Food Network) and I waited until the price dropped on Amazon to give it a try.  Cheese does stay in good shape for so much longer.  Happy with the purchase!
