I first purchased this product three years ago when we adopted our stray cat (domestic short hair). She was clearly malnourished with her fur looking so brittle and unhealthy. With some better food and some of this powder mixed in daily, she looked so much better after a couple weeks. Her coat was very soft, shiny, and not coming out in clumps. I kept using the product until I used it all up and I enjoyed seeing the results for my cat.I decided to buy it again during this hot summer when her fur was shedding like crazy, and I think it's helped reduce the clumps coming out when I brush her and her coat feels much softer. She's barely shedding now and her coat is very, very soft and fluffy looking.
