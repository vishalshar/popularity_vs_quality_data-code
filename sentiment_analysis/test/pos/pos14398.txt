I've been using my Bluesmart for a couple of weekends now, and I must say I'm really impressed.It's not everyday that I shell this amount of money on a bag, so I wanted to give a review that might be helpful to everyone.The bag is really well constructed and the materials employed seem to be of great quality. Most importantly (to me) it handles really well in real-life usage.It's clear that a lot of thought went into designing this bag, and it's also clear this is just a first version.My preferred thing is definitely the laptop compartment. FINALLY someone who did it right!I've found that my biggest fears with the bag have not turned to reality, thankfully. The biggest one surely being TSA / airport security. Both times I used it, I didn't have to explain anything and I just zipped through.It also went as a carry on on Frontier, which seemed really stringent so I'm really relieved there.The battery has come in handy more than I'd like to admit, and I found it really convenient to have the USB ports just there and not having to go find a battery pack (which I still bring anyways).Other features:- Scale: kinda cool to know the weight, but not super interesting or useful for me. If you're curious tho, it's cool.- Security features: having the ability to lock it is really nice. It's not a safe, but it prevents people from stealing your laptop and such while passing by.There are a bunch of other improvements to be made, but nonetheless this is likely going to be my standard weekend carry-on from now on!
