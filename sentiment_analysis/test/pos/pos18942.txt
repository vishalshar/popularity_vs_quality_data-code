I previously owned the original NomadKey. The original lasted maybe a month before it gave out. I was hesitant on buying a another one so I waited some time, as well as reading other reviews. Upon arrival of the new one, I immediately noticed a difference. The key is thicker, the USB portion is now fully 'covered' and the key loop is thicker than the original. Although the key is slightly thicker and longer, this came as a relief because I felt as though it would stand up to the test of time. Since, I have rigorously tested the NomadKey with great success for the past month. I use the key daily and it stays attached to my keychain.Although the current NomadKey is exactly what I hoped for, it is unfortunate that it took them awhile, as well as a good chunk of my money, to get this right.EDIT 4/2016:  My new key lasted just about a year before the lightning cable part popped out of the keychain. Weary about ordering another and spending another $20+. I was hoping that the thicker construction would mean improved durability. Maybe having this on my keychain is too much...
