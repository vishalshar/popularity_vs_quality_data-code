My sole purpose of this purchase was to use this phone as a small form factor android media player that I can listen to Spotify music thru blue-tooth headphones while I am in the gym or running. With this setup I am completely satisfied with the size and operation of this device.Pros-1) Small Form factor2) Runs on Andriod3) Price4) Battery Life5) Prompt Tech-supportCons-1) I received a non-English version of the phone. The firmware had to be flashed with an English version. Tech-support sent out how-to instructions along with links for the firmware, drivers, and installation tool. It took several tries but I was finally able to flash the phone to English. Bear that in mind if you decide to get the phone and come up with my situation.2) Small Keyboard - I dread having to type anything on this phone.3) Special Micro USB charging cable - This cable has a longer male jack. Due to the way the phone jack is designed, a regular micro USB cable is too short to fully insert in so it will not charge. You will have to use the provided USB cable that came with it which is annoying because it is extra gear you need to take with you
