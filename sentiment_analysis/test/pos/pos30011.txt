I wish they could make one with a smaller receiver on it.  It is bulky on my little cat.  However, it works well.  On a rare occasion, she does get out of the yard then cannot get back in.  I guess she gets carried away chasing a squirrel and runs through the fence before realizing the correction.  But this rarely happens so she is much safer, now.
