Okay, rarely am I ever excited about much these days, but I have to say.. i freaking love my FitBark. I received it as a gift from a client and I've been obsessed with it. I love being able to see the numbers to know when I need to give my pup, Roo, an extra long walk or play time to reach our daily FitBark goals.  As a side effect, I'm more active!I love that the battery lasts a week without needing a recharge. It should last two weeks, but I check it 20-25 times a day so that definitely has something to do with it. (it only takes 90 mins to recharge so that's great)The best part is the customer service... every time I have an issue with the app or question regarding anything, they get back to me within 24 hours.. usually within a couple hours. They're fast response time, friendly attitude and helpful guidance is enough to make me a fan of the company.I highly recommend you get one for your pup.. the more we know about our pups, the more we can do to keep them alive and healthy!
