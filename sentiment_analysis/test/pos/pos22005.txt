I was originally going to back this on kickstarter but wanted to see reviews before purchasing.  Most low rated reviews for this product relate to missing features that they are introducing with the latest updates.This router is replacing a Dlink xtreme N router.  I currently subscribe to 100Mbps down/100Mbps up with Verizon fios.  A Ookla speedtest shows my Dlink router hitting speeds 41 down/50 up.  I then connected to the Portal Router and ran the speed test from the exact same location.  I was pleasantly surprised with the results of 94 down/94 up, I did not believe these results at first so I ran another test that resulted in 94 down/94 up again.In a range test I went to the corner of my basement (furthest away from the router on the main level).  Looking at the wifi connections I could not get the 5GHZ connection on my dlink but 2.4GHZ connection was available.  Both options were available on the Portal router.  Although it is not a direct comparison I connected to the 2.4GHZ connection on the Dlink and got 14 down/10 up.  I then connected to the Portal Router's HD connection and got 50 down/50 up.Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  If I was getting anywhere near my maximum bandwidth with my DLink I wouldn't have made the purchase even though I could have benefited from "Fast Lanes".  If you are looking for a router that gives you maximum performance, this is definitely one of them.
