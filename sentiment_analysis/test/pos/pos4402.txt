I am a lady who does not wear a lot of makeup.  I have been searching for a mascara that would give me a very, very natural look and feel.  I absolutely do not enjoy mascaras that look heavy and clumpy and obvious.  The Peter Lamas Lash Masque Natural Lash Builder is the product I have been searching for years and some.  First, it is formulated in a way that it does not ever make lashes look spidery and clumpy.  Instead, lashes look and feel soft, plush, and natural, even if more than one coat is applied.  Second, and of high importance to me is that there are no ingredients that irritate the eyes.  This lash builder does not give me red, itchy, irritated eyes that other traditional mascaras cause.  This mascara has made my eyelashes thicker even when I'm not wearing it.  It is very nourishing and conditioning.  Also of high importance  to me is that the products by Peter Lamas are cruelty-free.  I am really impressed with this lash masque and will always have it in my beauty box.
