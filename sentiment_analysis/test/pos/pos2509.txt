What a cute lunchbox! We haven't used it at school yet...but I know my son will love it. He will probably need help opening the container due to his low muscle tone..but this will be perfect for his nuggets, crackers, and fruit. I already tested the hot food container to see if it would leak and filled it up with hot water and put the lid on and turned it upside down. Not one drop came out! Extremely leak proof! I definitely plan to wash all the parts and the box by hand to keep it seal proof.  I love making my son organic from scratch lunches from home, so this will be perfect for us! I'm almost tempted to get a pink one for myself. Thank you for coming up with this great idea. Maybe in the future, you guys can come up with a way to attach a color matching drink container to the outside or silver wear that magnetically attaches to this inside. But this is a great find. Thanks.
