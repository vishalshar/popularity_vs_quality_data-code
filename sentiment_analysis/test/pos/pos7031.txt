Actually I was surprised how well this works. We have a Honda CRV, and there is just enough lower dashboard between the steering wheel and the recessed console that it fits and its an ideal location. No window or console obstruction and very close.One thing that is not obvious is the different ways to extend it for maximum reach should you need to mount it on the top dashboard or farther away.  The instructions are very vague about this. But if you loosen the knob on the arm it extends a 1-2 inches and thats it..  The trick to making it reach further is to loosen the knob near the base and rotate the arm 180 degrees. That gives you several more inches .. and then its quite long. But where we mounted it, there was no need for this extended reach.The other really nice thing that makes this all worth it, is that spot in the dash next to the steering wheel was almost not large enough, was bumpy, and had a seam in it.  But I was able to use the bottom plate, which adheres to the dashboard with a nice gel.  This is also great because it prevents the mount and suction cup from doing damage to you dash.  After this base sticks to this surface due to its flexible gel, now you have a flat perfect base to mount the suction cup to.  The result is a very sturdy mount even on a rough dashboard.  it has full 3D ball mount swivel to you can rotate it 360 degreesAlso not clear is how to use this.  You can squeeze two handles on the mount to open the mount, it then latches open either to prepare it to mount your phone or to remove the phone. then when you want to put your phone in, you just place it in and the pressure plate on the mount causes that latch to snap shut.In anycase, for a window mount probably many other mounts would work as with this one. But I think this one is great due to its ability to mount solid to any dashboard texture size, without needing a perfect large flat surface for the suction cup.This took a while to write, so please vote if it was helpful  thanks!
