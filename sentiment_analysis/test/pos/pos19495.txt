This is THE most "fun" purchase I've gotten all year! I can now check on and interact with my crazy dogs while away at work, give them a "treat" if I'm running late, and show my co-workers and friends just what goofballs they are! This camera has everything it needs: interaction via voice,viewing, and "throwing a treat" when they hear the camera "open." I had some difficulty linking my internet to the camera at the first attempts; however Simon and Lenny of Petzi customer service were RIGHT ON the situation, as soon as I wrote in telling them of the problem. They were almost willing to send me a new unit initially if they couldn't resolve the problem by the end of the day; however as it turned out, the "bug" was fixed on their end, and my camera works perfectly! Cannot say enough great things about Petzi's customer service, as well as their product! All I can say is, if you go ahead and purchase this camera, is to HAVE FUN! You and your critters will love it!
