Some of the reviews are old. The setup is very straightforward. I am using apple products so maybe that makes it easier. Overall Anki Drive is fantastic. Being a child of the 80's I grew up loving and playing with slot cars. This is slot cars on steroids! The game is way more fun than I expected. My 7 year old and I play before he goes to bed and as soon as we get up. The car upgrades are really cool. The whole system is very well designed. I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed in this product. The only thing I could see as a downside is the track is huge. 3.5' x 8.5' means you do need a big table or floor space to play.As a suggestion I think it would be awesome to have challenges or scenario mode. Because you can have AI drivers you could have a challenge like "How long does it take to take down a fully armored AI opponent?" Or the converse "How long can you survive against a fully upgraded AI?" As you upgrade your cars you best times should increase. You could also have a "Simon says" mode where commands are given like "reverse drive" or "drive on inside lane" and the drives who mess up lose a point.I look forward to future updates and new products. We are an Anki Drive family.
