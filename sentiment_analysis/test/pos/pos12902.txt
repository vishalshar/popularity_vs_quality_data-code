This is my first time buying a thermometer that works with a smart phone. I am a nurse and have been looking for a new thermometer to use on my kids. I saw this in CVS but the price was a lot cheaper on Amazon so I decided to give it a shot.Notes:#1. It is easy to install. Just follow the simple instructions and prompts from your smart phone.#2. It's fairly accurate. All thermometers have some variations but this seems to be in line with our other thermometers.#3. The app lets you track all your temperatures and symptoms.#4. No batteries (can I get an amen).
