Coravin's relatively new coravin one is at a much more accessible price point than their previous offerings. You can calculate cost per glass and estimate your wasted wine per bottle and decide if the device will pay for itself, but it's hard to put a price on the variety of wine you can have in one sitting, in one week, even over months. Highly recommend.
