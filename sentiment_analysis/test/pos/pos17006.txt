I don't often write lengthy reviews for things on Amazon, but the Harmony Elite is one of my favourite things I have EVER bought. I talked to a friend who had an earlier model (4-5 years old) before buying, and honestly he didn't leave a good feeling in my mind, but the current model absolutely destroys any issues he had. I'm going to cover some details quickly.SETUPThe setup of the Harmony KINDA SUCKS actually. The app isn't the most user friendly, and you keep having to go back and forth to change things. Adding devices is a pain because you have to find exact model numbers. There were a couple of things where it froze somewhat too, because I asked it to pair with my PS4 but I didn't want to stand up and actually turn on my PS4. However, fortunately, you rarely ever need to do the setup. Just once at the start, and whenever you get a new device. And despite this, I STILL give it 5 stars.USEIt is so slick to use. I kind of got it to make my entertainment unit "babysitter proof", when I got a new nanny for my daughter. I didn't expect her to remember what she needed each of the three remotes for, and the Harmony Elite has absolutely made it simple for her. In fact my 6-year old daughter can use it easily too, to start playing her Wii games.The key thing is that it is basically instantaneous. Pick the remote up, either off the included cradle or just off the coffee table, and it turns on instantly. A single press on the touch screen at the top and everything is turning on and setting itself to the right mode. If I'm using Apple TV then it can be used to browse around media, and when we're done there is a dedicated "Off" physical button at the top to turn all that stuff off.It even interacts with my Philips Hue lights, so I can control them from the remote (easier than digging out the Hue app on my phone), and I can have specific "Romantic Movie" settings on the remote to dim the lights, feed the dog and put the child to bed (well, almost...)
