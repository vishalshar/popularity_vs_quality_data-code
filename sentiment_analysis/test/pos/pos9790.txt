This is a fun device!  It delivers exactly what it purports to be - A thermal imaging camera.  The android app seems to struggle with the input of the camera - meaning it lags sometimes when moving the camera around.  I do not know if this is just a problem in the app or if it has to do with my phone/tablet.  I've used this on a Samsung S6 Edge Plus and a Galaxy Note 8.0 tablet so far and the app performance is pretty much the same between both devices.  Hopefully app performance will improve in a future update.It comes with a hard clear clam shell snap locking case that has a key ring eyelet on it.  This was not listed on the page in the description but was a welcome addition.  Makes carrying it around in your pocket a snap.  It has a focus ring on it though I do not see why really as it doesn't seem to affect the image very much at medium range.  The camera is a 20 degree FOV so you will need to be at least a few feet away from your subject matter to see it in your lens.
