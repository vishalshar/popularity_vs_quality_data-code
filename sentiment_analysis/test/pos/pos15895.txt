These chips are fabulous, but they are ultra-dangerous.  As they say about Lay's potato chips, I bet you can't eat just one.The combination of salt and caramel is quite interesting, but the caramel flavor is the one that prevails. My husband and the dog, of course, loves them too.  I buy these 3-4 cases at a time.Enjoy.
