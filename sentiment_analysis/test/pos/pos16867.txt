Terrific alternative to regular peanut butter.-Took this on a long camping trip and added water to it for "regular" peanut butter on bread, celery or crackers......or chocolate :)-Put it in oatmeal for added protein and great peanut butter flavorI eat a low-oil diet, so this is a terrific find. I can't say whether this one is better or worse than other brands, as I haven't really compared it to other kinds.
