I love this,just set it up today and my beagle is getting used to it,it holds a good amount of treats and I'll be excited to try it out when I'm out of the house and she is alone,she was a little scared of the sound it makes before popping out the treat but she is ok now.ive mounted it to the wall but there are other options.i was looking at this for a long time and I'm glad I go it since I do work long hours
