Never thought I'd be able to find something as simple and usable like NanoHold, seems like it's to good to be true first off but then it holds even my biggest phone the S6 Edge plus. When you first use it, it sticks like instant super glue, but after a day or so it needs to be cleaned.i find rubbing alcohol works charms.
