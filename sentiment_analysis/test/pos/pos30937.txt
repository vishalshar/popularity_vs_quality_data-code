We have one of these for our larger dog (great product) and made the mistake of purchasing another for a recently-adopted chihuahua. Customer service said that the collar was suitable for dogs 5+ lbs. Absolutely not the case. Our Chi weighs 7 lbs and the collar is way too heavy for his little neck. Unfortunately they do not make a rechargeable collar in his size. If I had known this I would have purchased the lighter collar that requires batteries.
