I purchased this for my wife who is always misplacing her keys.  She is not super technical, but within minutes of getting the pebblebee operational she was trying it out and changing the ringtones in the app.  Two days after starting use - the keys were gone.  She was sure they were left at the office.  Quick use of the app helped her locate the keys in an upstairs room.I would recommend this for everyone and plan to buy some more in the near future.
