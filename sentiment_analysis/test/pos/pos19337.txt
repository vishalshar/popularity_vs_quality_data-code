I was looking for a compliment and back up to the Ring Pro that I use as my primary door bell. I wanted a product that did not need household voltage to put on the other side of my double door front entry. RemoBell is exactly that. After reading their company story I decided to give it a try.Everything that you need to install the unit and make it functional comes inside the very nice packaging. The unit is very attractive and built completely encased to withstand the elements. It was easy to install and requires very small holes to mount should you need to move it to another location at some point.Connecting the unit to the house WiFi and mobile phone was straightforward. I was able to complete installation and setup without needing to contact their service or support.Now that I have been able to use it for a while I really appreciate the convenience of being able to answer the door remotely and to know what is going on at front door. The unitÂ’s motion detection and video quality are excellent. I really like having two units at my front door. No blind spots and one or other will detect motion. Plus, if one is disabled for some reason the other one will be functional. I am very pleased with my purchase of the RemoBell and highly recommend it.
