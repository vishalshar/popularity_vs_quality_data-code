I bought the streaming NFL Sunday Ticket and wanted to find an easy way to watch it on multiple devices (not at the same time - they prevent you from doing that).  My plan was to use this with the tv in the den and the tv in the living room.  I plugged my phone into one end of this device and my tv into the other and I was watching my phone on my tv right away.  The resolution was just ok so I ended up buying two Rokus instead.  The down side to that is you can only be logged in on one device, so if we are watching in the den and then go into the living room, we have to log out in the den and then log in in the living room.
