If you're a fan of deduction/traitor/bluffing games of any type (Resistance, Secret Hitler, Werewolf, Mafia; and even games that include these mechanics like BSG, Camelot and Sherrif of Nottingham), this game is a no-brainer must-buy. If you absolutely hate those types of games, then this might be the one to change your mind - it's that good!Every single person that I've played this game with (gamers and non-gamers alike) loved it. No "stressful traitor burn-out" at all with this game, even after several in-a-row play-throughs. Since we introduced Deception into our board gaming group, it's never been played *only* once during a play session.The price fluctuates a lot due to its popularity, but honestly after having played it, I'd pay double and still feel like I got my money's worth!
