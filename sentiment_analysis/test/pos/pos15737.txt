I love bombshell.  I have used a lot of powders over the years and this one is the best on the market.  I'll use it over most high end brands any day.  It hold my hair (which is thick and heavy) all day long and can easily wash out.  If I decide to change the style I can still manage to get a brush though it and not be sticky and difficult.
