Its great to spy on your fur baby when out of the house. When navigating the camera on the app, there are specific points that the camera will go, when the camera goes up/down and side/side which is hard to get an exact view because its out of the frame . The laser is fun but when navigating it freely (as stated previously) it stops at specific frames. I usually just use the figure eight and circle laser. Overall, it is a good affordable camera.
