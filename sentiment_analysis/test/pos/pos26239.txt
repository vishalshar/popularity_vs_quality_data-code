this is a great dog food.  i stopped using solid gold for a while due to supply problems locally, and my dog started having days wherehe didn't eat, and started coughing up bile sometimes in the mornings.  back to solid gold and no problemsat all.  eats every day again and no vomiting.  for previous dogs (westies) with skin problems, it cleared thesores right up when we started using it.
