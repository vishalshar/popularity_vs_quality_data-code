lets talk about the apple ear pods we all get with iPad or iPhone purchase by default. If youre like me and the earpods fall out of your ear easily, I have a good solution for that! The product is Earwoox and their purpose is to help you keep your earpods stay in your ears.These are 9.99 On Amazon (specifically their Launch Pad part of their site) have 2 different sizes large and small with 5 different colors you can choose from. These work as intended and for me it is totally worth it.  While the earpods dont have the best or the worst sound quality they come with your device and most people tend to carry them around because they work just fine.After using them for a little while I can say they work! Running, Jumping up and down the earpods stay in my ear comfortably. They are made of a soft silicone (kind of like rubber) and are sweat and water resistant. I used these in a work and I tend to work up a sweat and the earhoox kept my earpods in my ear.I do recommend these since you can transfer them from any pair of earpod you get and it is handy. Also, if you have they have earhoox for the older version of apple earbuds as well
