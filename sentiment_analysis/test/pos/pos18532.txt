I love this stuff. You can make anything with it.  I keep the spare packs in the refrigerator to extendextend the shelf life. My favorite build is molding it around my in ear headphones,  then shaping it to match the inner ear to lock out outside sounds.  Let set up for a couple of hours, remove it and allow to cure.  Your good earphones are now awesome earphones.
