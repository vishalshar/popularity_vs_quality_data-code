I bought one. I've used for about 3-4 charge sessions. It's fairly nifty.I use it to charge essentially my Surface Pro 3 when I went to the laundromat or I'm sitting away from an outlet and am being lazy.It works fairly well for this.My only two complaints about it are:1. When I bought it and continuing to now, there's something loose on the inside (I can hear movement, like something is rolling when I tilt it). I don't think it's causing any damage...but, I don't like that sound.2. Half the time I use it, it runs cool (which is great and is unlike my other battery charge (I think it's an Anker 10,000mAh)) but then half the time I have stuff plugged in (like today when I was at a doctor's office waiting, it was running extremely hot, like burning). I didn't smell anything funky from it.I think it's just my model is slightly abnormal. Anyways, I would buy it again if it stopped working or if I lost it.
