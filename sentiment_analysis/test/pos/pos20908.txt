I love this thing. It easily tracks my distances and stats, and most importantly, my score. I'm notorious for spacing out after a bad shot or after a few cans of swing lube, and forgetting to count a stroke or 3. Game Golf takes care of everything for you. The main gripe is that you have to tap the club before (or after) every swing, but its such a minor inconvenience that it has now become a part of my pre-shot routine. I don't even think about it anymore. And I love coming home, plugging the game golf in and seeing my distances and scores. You can edit anything that isn't right and the thing will even detect the shot for you if you DO forget to tap. There have been instances where I had to start of the 10th, or had to skip a hole and come back and I was worried that the unit would get confused, but it didn't miss a beat. Along with my distance watch, this is my "can't play without" load out. I left it home one round, and hated my round so much that I'll never forget it again!My only PERSONAL gripe is that the battery on my unit seems to drain pretty fast. I'll charge it up, play my round and it says "low" when I get home. Its not a BIG deal, since I charge it before every round, but I DO worry that one day the battery won't make it through a full round. Maybe I should contact Active Mind....
