Absolutely Amazing!  I purchased The Raticator S-Plus along with a couple other electric and non kill traps to catch a couple of squirrels that had been living under the shed and wood piles.  I got the Raticator Saturday afternoon and immediately put a few pieces of dry dog food in the trap and a few pieces leading up to it.  Within 20 minutes squirrel #1 dead.  The next day I place it near another opening.  6 hours later 2nd squirrel dead.  Turn it upside down over trash can and thats it.  Awesome product.  So far i haven't got any rats that plague our neighborhood but my squirrel problem is fixed.  Its been 3 days since i got it.  Stayed tuned for rat kill count now that i can target them.I am using lithium Energizers as they suggest and not having to plug it in is major bonus!  The 2 other traps I received 1 day before raticator have not caught anything yet.
