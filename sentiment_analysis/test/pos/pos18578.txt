I love this stylus its well made and has worked with any of the devices that I've used it on. I only have one problem though I hate how you have to have it turned on in order to use the product. Also hate how it turns off after only 30 minutes of use I get it when your not using it but it can be somewhat frustrating at times to turn it back on if you didn't know it turned itself off.
