They are a good snack to have on hand when you get that sudden craving to eat on finger foods.Like potato chips, but much healthier and low in fat.There are no added sugar, just the dried fuji apples.The apples are sweet, though it does vary with each apple.A little expensive, but I don't mind it.  A dozen lasts me for a little while :)Long shelf life.The only complaint I would have is that they only give half a bag of the apples, fill the rest with air.But then again, most chips bags are like that.
