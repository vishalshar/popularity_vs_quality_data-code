Tracker works well, the company is still working some bugs out of the system, but it is getting better.  Got accurate and reliable home zone notifications today on dear dog's trip to the vet.  Initially had a problem with the battery life, but tracked it down to a misconfiguration (base was not activated, so it was in GPS mode all the time).  Now it works fine.  Unlike the old Tagg system, you currently cannot disable activity monitoring, so battery life is not as good (2 weeks instead of 4) but there are so many requests in I am sure they will comply and give us that functionality.If you have a functioning Tagg, I would wait until you can't anymore and check the latest reviews for updates.  Do not renew if you think the Tagg will not make it.  I had several months left on my prepaid subscription for the Tagg and they kept it and made me get a new subscription for the Whistle with no credit.If you are in the same boat as me (tagg broke) then I would go for it.  Within a few months I think they will have the service up to the level that Tagg was before it was bought and reprogrammed by Whistle.
