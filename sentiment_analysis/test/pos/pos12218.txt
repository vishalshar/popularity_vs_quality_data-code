Very cool wireless controller at a good price.  Except for the ACPAD for acoustic guitars, there's nothing else really like this.  Only minor criticism is I wish the pressure sensitive pads were a little more responsive.  Overall everything works great, but makes playing dynamic drums a challenging.
