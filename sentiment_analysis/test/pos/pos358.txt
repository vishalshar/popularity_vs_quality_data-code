I previously had a queen size pillow top mattress, and had developed terrible back pain from years of sleeping on it. My SO did a little research and we decided on this one based off of the reviews we read. The delivery didn't go well, as the mattress was "lost in transit". Of course the day it was to arrive was my trash day, so I had already dragged my old mattress out to the curb. It took several conversations with a few different customer service folks and a couple nights of sleeping on the floor, but it did finally arrive. The box was heavy, but it was pretty simple to lay out onto the bed. The first two or three nights were rough, but by the fourth night it had expanded fully and I was used to how it felt. It's been about two months now and I have had no back pain whatsoever and my sleep quality has definitely improved. It's so comfortable we rarely sit on the couch anymore. The first thing we did after work for the first few weeks was throw on pajamas and lay in bed for an hour. It really is that comfy! It has a gentle firmness that is both supportive and comfortable.My dog, who has arthritis and three legs, is obsessed with this mattress. On my old mattress she would get uncomfortable and jump down after a while, but she practically lives on my bed now. I hope Leesa considers adding dog beds to their product line!
