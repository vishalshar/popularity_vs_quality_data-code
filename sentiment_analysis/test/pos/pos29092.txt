Got this to replace my One Touch 2 since that hits the volume down button on my Nexus 5x. Unfortunately, despite this being listed as compatible with the 5x, it still hits the volume down button.Update: After cutting away some of the rubber padding on the grip, it can now hold the 5x without touching the volume button. (To be fair, it only just barley touched the button, but it was enough that if I gripped the One Touch to turn the phone landscape to portrait that it would turn the volume down.In general this is a 5-star product for its versatility (i.e. not made for just one phone, accommodates a case) and 1 handed operation. But only 4 stars for not being really compatible with the 5x.Compared to the one touch 2, I prefer the bottom piece on the 2 as it was easier to adjust (it just slid back and forth, compared to the 2 prong on this version that you have to loosen the knob to move). I understand the design change to allow for adjusting the height, but the way in which the piece adjusts makes it a pain to center the thing
