Waited a month before reviewing because I had a cheaper version that was junk, but this thing is great! Use it 2-4 hours a day with no issues. Does reduce charging speed/doesn't charge at all/makes phone loose charge like others have mentioned. Makes my phone (LG G3) get quite hot but I figure that's the phones fault for not being able to process well enough at that level, hasn't really caused any issues though but I do keep an eye on it.In the end, spend the extra money and get this one, well worth it.
