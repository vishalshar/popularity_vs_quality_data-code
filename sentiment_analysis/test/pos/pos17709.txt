A must when installing your Rachio gen 2 outdoors. Can be hardwired and Rachio conveniently fits directly into this enclosure box.  You will love this enclosure!  Remember, you will not need the white cover to your Rachio (made to use without it) when installing outside in this box. Weatherproof and I love the look!
