The Piper is an excellent and fantastic kit and learning tool for getting kids excited and interested in making. Not only does it engage and instruct the child in how to wire up electronic circuits via breadboard, components, and the rasPi, but it even has them engage in constructing the actual Piper, itself.Ours arrived just in time for the holidays, and was a great surprise on the morning when my son had no idea what a Piper was or what it could be, but the minecraft inspired packaging had him instantly intrigued. From the moment we opened the box, there was a huge amount of excitement and anticipation. We opened the blueprint-like instructions and went to work with screwdriver in hand. Together we put all the pieces together and the finished result was his very own "laptop"-like Piper computer. He. was. thrilled.Booting up the Piper was easy. It is a customized raspberry pi, which I am personally familiar with, but fortunately didn't even need to be. (There were no issues with our rasPi or with any components, etc. and this was one of the first Pipers to ship out.)  It boots right into the Piper software and the adventure begins there.He went to work right away, wiring the buttons that control the character in the game. He eventually made it to the next to last level and got a little stuck there. After the updates, which I admit were a little tricky with some network connection issues, he completed that mission and the final, black button, mission.He's still very happy with his Piper and so are we. He plays through the levels over again and we are very excited to see more levels to come in future updates.All in all, I think it's an excellent product and a great team that is pushing it out. I fully support and recommend this product to any young person interested in learning about electronics, and especially if they have an affinity for minecraft!
