I love this game. I saw it at Barnes and Noble and wanted to buy it there, but checked Amazon first to see if it may be cheaper and it was. I have played this with friends several times now and we are always laughing and have the best time playing it. Definitely makes you realize how good your reaction speed is. I think this is a great game for young adults to play on a night in having a couple drinks and wanting to have a safe, yet hilariously fun time with their friends.
