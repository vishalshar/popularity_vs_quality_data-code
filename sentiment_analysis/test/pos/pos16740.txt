Great phone...packed with features and granted only have had a few weeks, but so far so much better maintaining of a signal, not dropping calls like my last generic branded phone did, when the prior was easily twice the price of this one.... Just hope it maintains for the long hall and Posh as a company continues to thrive and build great products like this one.. Also found a generic rubber hybrid double layer case that we made small modification to and my husband is carrying his in that case....FYI my hudband like the phone so much too that we bought him one a week later... shipping was also very fast..
