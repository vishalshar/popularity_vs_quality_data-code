My newly 2 year old loves this cup and has no problem drinking from it. Great design, easy to use. I would like to see more color options. Like that I can let her use it as a big person cup then easily slip on the lid when she is ready to leave the dinner table. Other glass sippy cup I used had suction issues and made it hard for my daughter to get her milk from and would cause it to become foamy.
