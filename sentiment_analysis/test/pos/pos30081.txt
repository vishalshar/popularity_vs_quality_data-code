After a long period of dating casually and partying, I decided to get an STD test. I could have done it at my doctor's office--or a clinic--but I wasn't thrilled with the idea of sitting around and waiting 2 weeks for the results. So I ordered myLAB Box, and I was able to drop off my sample at UPS the day I received the kit. Within a week I had my results online... and I was relieved.
