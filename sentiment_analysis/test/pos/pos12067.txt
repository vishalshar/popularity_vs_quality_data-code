These are fantastic for cleaning makeup brushes.  I put a little bit of (antibacterial) dish soap and a little bit of olive oil on a plate and put the brush in the soap and swirl it around on the plate to clean it, then put it in the oil so that the brush doesn't dry out.. then I rinse it with warm water and slip the brush guard on it and place it in a tall glass.  Works great every time!
