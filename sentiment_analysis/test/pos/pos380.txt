Nice because it connect directly to Wi-Fi. The size is not really noticeable in the normal landscape of a home when plugged into a ground level outlet. One of the two units that I purchased stopped working randomly once and had to be rebooted. To reboot you need to unplug the device for an extended period time or else it does not reset. Using this on my second home and it sends alerts to the iPhone the second somebody walks in.
