It was a tough choice between all the possible "mattresses in a box."  At some point you just decide and go with it and that's how the Leesa Mattress became my bed.  Setting it up was a breeze and it expanded quicker than what was expected based on what I had read. At first. just from sitting on it, it seemed a little too firm to me; especially since I had been sleeping on a futon -- a very soft futon.  The firmness, however, was an asset when it came to sleeping.  I have been sleeping on this mattress about a month now and must say it's very comfortable.  When sitting on the edge of the bed, the edges of the mattress are a little softer that what would be ideal, but that's kind of what I would expect with all mattresses in this category. They seemed to firm up a little over time, however -- either that or I just got used to it. In conclusion, I am very pleased with the Leesa mattress and doubt any of the other choices would have been better ones.  I also liked the "three stripe" design.  Don't ask why -- I know no one will ever seem them, but they are just a little touch of class.
