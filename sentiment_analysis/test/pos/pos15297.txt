This jacket worked great in the rain today. While I agree with other reviewers it is not super breathable, I am excited to use it in the NYC winter when that will be a feature and not a bug. The jacket is as advertised very reflective and hopefully cars will at least hit me with a little more guilt, like," hey, there's a person, oh, no, that's too bad" instead of just the "crunch ... ?????" . It is a bit baggy which is good because I wear a lot of sweaters. I am confident every sweater will fit under the jacket. The pocket on the butt is choice - my bike game is up 30%, please refer to pic for excitement level.
