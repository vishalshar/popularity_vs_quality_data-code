Product work as described, almost unlimited remotes. Bonus was it works with wifi attached devices.. Awesome !!!Must add the real plus for this product is the excellent support. Had a few question the first week I received the anymote device and received immediate responses. This shows the vendor cares about their product. Some of my questions were sent late evening and I was not expecting a response for least a day or saw, I was getting answers less than 30 min...Great product and great support...
