I've always used Otterbox cases, great protection but bulky and they are hard to get out of a pocket. The Rokform case is thin and offers great protection!! The fit is tight and the phone does not slid around in the case. Second day I had it, I slammed my trunk lid on my phone!! It dented the rubber but no other damage and the rubber bounced back after a few days. The rubber bumper does not snag pulling it out of a pocket. The magnet in back tops it off!! I have a metal console in my patrol vehicle, I set the phone on the console and it never moves. Even doing high speed turns!! The car mount magnet works great and holds the phone vertically without slipping. The only improvement I can see, they need to include a screen protector with the case.
