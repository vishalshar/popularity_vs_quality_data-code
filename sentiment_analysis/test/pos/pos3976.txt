I have 3 chihuahuas (2 boys and 1 girl) and I live in a condominium. Prior to the Pet Loo, they were trained to use potty pads while I'm out. This was fine when i had one chihuahua but as I added my other 2 kids, buying the pads became costly. Also, when they use the pads, they get their feet wet or the wee will flow out of the pad on to the bathroom floor. So my fiancee and I looked for an alternative and found this.I let the dogs inspect the product first then put them on the grass. Then, I took one of the soiled pee pads and rubbed it on the grass. I then removed all the pads and placed the Pet Loo where the pads where. I put the dogs on the grass again one by one making sure they smell the pee that I rubbed on it. By the end of the day, they were using the pad to pee. It took them a 3-4 days more to figure out it was safe to poop on it too. I was so proud and happy because they love it. oh and the boys will pee on it too even if they're used to lifting their leg, they do a combination of squatting and lifting their leg.PROS:1. Unlike the other products like the Pet Loo, the plastic foundation is very strong. we travel with it often. it's not flimsy at all and can support the weight of a large dog.2. It's easy to clean. other products don't have the drainage system that the pet loo has (the cabinet you can remove that contains the wee)3. It decreases the smell. when using puppy pads, pee is left out in the open and it smells really bad if you don't get to it right away.4. The dogs don't get their paws wet. since the wee is drained, their feet aren't soaked in it.5. My dogs found it a no-brainer. they understood what it was, they frequently go on grass so they got it right away. just train them and praise them. don't give up!6. It's an investment. I don't have to rely on buying pads!7. Lessens wastage. I don't have to throw away the pads (because I'm not using them) and it lessens garbage (as well as the smell of the garbage)CONS:1. You have to buy a separate synthetic grass pad. You must wash the grass and it's helpful to have an extra one to put there while you're drying out the other. BUT this isn't the only reason. the Grass that comes with this order is of poor quality. it just feels like plastic (from thin plastic bags). the separate grass i got from this how ever was nicer and stronger2. when you first buy it or clean it, the grass will shed quite frequently. I've had it for a while and there's no bald patches but for the first few times, you'll have strands of green plastic falling offOverall, we are very happy with this product and wish we had it a long time ago. :)
