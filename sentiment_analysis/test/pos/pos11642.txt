Love this stuff!  Had the arm of a desk chair pretty much disintegrate because it's constantly hitting the desk.... 4  packs of sugru, basically rebuilt the arm, and now it's soft to the arm, but all in one piece!  Can't even list the projects I've used this on, but if you have some silly little piece of something break, sugru will fix it!!!
