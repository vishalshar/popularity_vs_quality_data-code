My husband and I are trying to live healthier lifestyles and we wanted something that would help us track our progress. This scale was recommended to me by a friend, and I love it. It comes all ready to go when you open the box, and you just have to get your stats loaded using an app on your phone. My husband and I especially like it because neither of us is really trying to lose weight, and this scale gives us a bigger picture of our health beyond our weights. Plus the design is so cute; the scale itself is sleek and pretty, and the digital display is clear and easy to read. Plus it winks at you!
