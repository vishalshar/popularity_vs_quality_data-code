I've been looking for something to prevent my earbuds from being inadvertently ripped out of my earballs on the metro or by my clumsiness. I thought these looked interesting & decided to give it a shot. I'm really pleased! Just be sure to look at the illustrated instructions & FOLLOW THEM! I thought I was smart enough not to need it & managed to smack myself in the face on first use. (Told you I was clumsy....)
