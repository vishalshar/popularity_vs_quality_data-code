These things are amazing. My feet "untie" shoelaces constantly unless I double knot them. This makes my shoes uncomfortably tight. Well Hickies has solved my problem; no more laces to get untied, and they stretch so that as I flex my foot they give a little and keep my shoe comfortable, yet tight enough. They are not cheap, but if they hold up, they could be a long term solution.
