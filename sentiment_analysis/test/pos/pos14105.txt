Nothing to dislike here. I was concerned that the buds would glitch/skip, but they maintain perfect connection. Sounds is better than their competitors (Bragi, Samsung, have tried a few). Case is great, charges quickly. The comfort after three hours could be better, but that is not my use model. This is the future, snug fit blocks outside sounds. Very please, LOVE to see the price drop. Nice work, Skybuds.
