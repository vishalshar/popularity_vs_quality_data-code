Works great! Small and compact, cleans up well, and heats meals in minutes. I like it because of the low environmental impact and it is not necessary to pack fuel unless you decide to use esbit tablets. It produces enough heat to properly cook meals in a very short time. I've researched and used many camping stove and the Emberlit Fireant is by far my favorite. This little stove is definitely worth the investment.
