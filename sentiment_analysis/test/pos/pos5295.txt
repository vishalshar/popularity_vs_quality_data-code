I am in love with this thing. I got a kitten (Ping) and decided I wanted to feed her mostly wet cat food. The first couple weeks were the worst. I had to plan a lot of my day around feeding her or I had to annoy my dad and sister and give them very specific details about how much to feed her and blah blah blah, IF they were even going to be home when she needed to be fed. I knew right away that wasn't sustainable so I googled around and found a few timed pet feeders. Most of them were for dry food so that was out. Most of the ones that allowed for wet food had a mixture of good and horrible reviews. A lot of people complained about their cat getting into them, tipping them over, etc. so those were out. I found one or two that looked good quality but I couldn't find any reviews and I didn't want to buy and expensive feeder that wasn't good quality.  Most of them are pretty expensive too, so I'd rather pay a little bit more than waist $80+ on one that I wasn't happy with then have to spend even more money on something better quality. I'm so glad I chose the Feed and Go.So the two things I thought were going to be pretty pointless turned out to be my favorite features. Those are the voice recording and the webcam. We have 2 cats. My sisters cat (Missy) is free fed dry food and since I'm doing the absolute opposite (meal feeding wet food) I was worried that Missy would end up eating Ping's food. I also didn't realize until I got it that it might take a little time for Ping to know to go the feeder when the compartment opens; that's why the recording is awesome. At the beginning she didn't come over when she heard it which was pretty frustrating. I would press the button a bunch of times and on the webcam she would never show up. After awhile she figured it out and I'm able to see her come running into the room. If it didn't have the webcam, one, I wouldn't know if she actually ate, and two, I wouldn't know if Missy ate her food. With the voice recording I can make sure she comes to the feeder before I press the "Feed Now" button. It would be frustrating if it only had the feed now button because then there would be the possibility that Missy would come over and I would just have to watch her eat Ping's food on the webcam.Onto general stuff. Overall the feeder is very good quality. I don't see this breaking anytime soon. Ping can't get into it since it rotates underneath the cover and in order to open it you have to press two buttons at the same time.Also, just something to be aware of, when I first got it and set it up I would try to click the call my pet over or feed now button and it would say it wasn't connected to the Internet, even though I just set it up and according to the back of the feeder it was connected. It only happened a few times and now it never happens so don't worry about it if that happens to you because it will probably go away.And someone said something about wet food getting pushed into the corners. Ping has had a fine time getting all her food, but if this becomes a problem I would suggest getting some silicone cupcake holders and cutting them so they're shallow enough to fit inside the compartment and putting the food in there.Improvement:-one thing that really annoys me is that when you click "Call my pet over" a window pops up that says "do you want to call you pet over?" I click yes then another window pops up that says "do you want to open the webcam?" I click yes, even though the webcam was already open. I often times have to click the call my pet over button 5-10 times until Ping will come over, in the beginning it was waaay more. So it's really annoying to go through those windows so many times. I wish there was a feature that I could choose to call her over how many times and at what intervals. So I could choose to call her over say 10 times at 5 second intervals. It would make things so much easier. Sometimes I sit there for 5 minutes just pressing the call my pet over button over and over agin because she either doesn't hear it or maybe she's asleep. It's very frustrating.I will post any updates if anything changes.
