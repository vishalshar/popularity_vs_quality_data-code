First one received had a display problem but was exchanged promptly without any hassle or cost to me.  I LOVE this product!  Let's face it, taking your blood pressure is a pain!  And then to have to write it down and keep track of the times as well as make sense of it all is even worse.  So you do have to actually still take your blood pressure, but it is easy even one-handed with this cuff.  Once it beeps when you are done, you don't even have to look at the numbers if you don't want to.  They will be automatically uploaded to your free account at Blipcare.  From there, you can print out tabulated and graphical data to take to your physician.  SO much better than monitoring blood pressure with an occasional measurement in the doctor's office.For those who are less technically inclined, setting up the device to connect to your home wireless network can seem a little daunting.  But if you follow the simple instructions included in the box, you should be going in no time.  And if that doesn't work, others here have said they solved the problem using Blipcare's technical support.  If it seems like a hassle to get it connected to your network, you will find it IS worth it.
