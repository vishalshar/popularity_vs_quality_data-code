This works great and saves money.  My one complaint is that the magnetic door attachment often falls off allowing the stink to escape.My tray was bent & wonbled on the tille floor when the cat got inside. i just put it inside a disposable box lid & it's quiet now.This product would be great with stronger attachment method, some quiet rubber feet and a pour spout corner to empty the litter
