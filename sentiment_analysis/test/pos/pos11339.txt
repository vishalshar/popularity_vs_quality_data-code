UPDATE 3/11/2016: I have been using this watch for about a week now and I love it more each day.  I purchased the rose gold band and switched it out.  SUPER easy to do and it looks great.  The Pebble website has directions on how to switch the bands. The watch gently wakes me up with a vibration.  I use the Sketchy Weather watch face which gives me a two day weather outlook with a shake of my wrist (and then after a couple seconds it flips back to the clock).  I now have it set up to turn my lights on and off through the Maker app/channel, although there is at least a 2 minute delay between the command and the action for me, but it's still a neat feature.  But it's great for me to know that I can have my phone on silent for work and never miss a text or phone call - so long as I'm within Bluetooth range.Original review: Like nearly everyone else who has purchased this watch - I wanted something that wasn't a computer on my arm.  Based on other reviews, I was concerned that this would be perhaps more primitive than I was looking for, but I have been very pleasantly surprised!  First, the watch is even smaller than I thought, which is a big plus for me since I have small wrists (I got the 14mm).  The buttons are *extremely* intuitive and easy to use, and it takes perhaps 5 to 10 minutes to set everything up.There are tons of watch faces to choose from, which I didn't know when I bought the thing, which was also a nice surprise. Obviously, this was my first smart watch.  As everyone else has said, the battery lasts a bit more than a full day of use, but that will vary depending on how long you tell the backlight to stay on, the intensity of the light, etc.  I have mine on a higher setting and to have the back light to stay on a bit longer, so I may not get quite as much battery life as others.It's wonderful to have such a subtle way to wake up, using it as an alarm with the vibration on my wrist.  I tend to be a heavy sleeper, so until I'm utterly confident that I will wake up every single time, I'm setting a back up alarm, but it's strong enough that it wakes me up.  I like having analysis of my sleep as well.  It does these two things very well.No complaints from me!  I have no regrets at all... I love the round design and do not find myself wishing for the Apple Watch at all!
