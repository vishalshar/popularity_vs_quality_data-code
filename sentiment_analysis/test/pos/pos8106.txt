I thought WeMo was a great idea and jumped into it without researching first or reading what was said in the community. My mistake. I bought a set of light switches to replace electronic timers I had, an outlet switch to replace a mechanical timer, a motion to turn the garage lights on, and a maker to use as a sensor to tell me when the garage door was open.Setup was sometimes easy, sometimes long and painful. A wemo switch would hang discovering networks, while the other switch in the same box had no problem. Another switch said no wifi networks were found, while an ipad next to it should wifi strength of 5 bars. The app often loses the devices, the devices frequently lose wifi. They'll work for a while, then stop. I came home the other day and the switches wouldnt even respond to a manual press. I reset them all and they were good for a while, then went off line again.  Luckily they are easy to reset, but you shouldnt have to reset them regularly.I wish I had researched more in the wemo community before purchasing, and tried one for a long while before taking the plunge. At this point Im looking for something to replace them with.Edited Jan 2017The Wemo devices were incredibly unstable for a long time. They'd work for a while then stop, the switches not even responding to physical switching. Then, suddenly, they started working and have been fine ever since. Occasionally I have to do a reset, but it's very rare.  They now work exactly as I wanted. Im hoping it was just bad firmware and Belkin fixed it.I am changing my stars and title.
