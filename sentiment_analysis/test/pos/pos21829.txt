I had installed a Schlage Sense touchpad deadbolt since the August Generation 1 model was buggy and had all sorts of issues. Glad I waited since the Gen 2 Homekit compatible model is awesome and has no bugs and works great. I switched out the horrible Schlage sense and replaced it with 2 August and keypads and it works beautifully. I love all the features and the install was simple and easy and I am glad I waited!
