Everyone leaving reviews that first did not buy it and second says it's horrible because kids should be allowed to have candy or that you should parent better and give them a piece every night. Boo boo on you! This is great quality! I BOUGHT the item and my kids LOVE it! I have a kid who is allergic to most candy so this makes it great!! He can trick or treat freely without us turning people down and making them feel bad. My kids then leave out all candy and the switch with will take all the candy he is allergic to and leave a toy for each. I don't call this bad parenting, I call it genius so my kids can enjoy Halloween just like anyone else!
