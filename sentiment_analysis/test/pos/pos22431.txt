Bought these headphones as a replacement for my V-Moda Crossfades which was an awesome set in themselves. These are almost on par with those sound wise, just wish the pads were a little bigger but other than that small complaint a great product. Any one looking for great headphones on a modest budget you can't go wrong with these. Just a heads up they do need to be used for a couple of days before the great sound becomes apparent.... They can sound quite flat and lifeless right out of the box.
