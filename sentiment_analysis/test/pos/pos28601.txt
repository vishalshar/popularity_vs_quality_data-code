I bought these for the shoes I wear the most. They are easy to put in. I feel like they should have come with instructions in the package on how to put them on your shoes for tight, loose, or extra loose/tight fit. However, if you go to their website they have them on there. They seem pretty durable so far and came with a few extra if they do break.
