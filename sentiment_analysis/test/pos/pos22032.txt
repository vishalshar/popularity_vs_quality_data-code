Bought this robot to conduct some simple robotics activities with a class of kids, performing simple missions. The kids took some time playing with it, had difficulties controlling it initially, but ultimately got the hang of it. The controller (using my iPhones) works fine, but the motion sensing mode is cranky - does work all the time. Tried diff methods but still managed to get it to sense the motion only 50% of the time. But overall, a reasonably priced and good educational item purchased to kick start robotics learning. Kids love it, and had a great time with it.
