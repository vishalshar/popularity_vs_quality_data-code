I was skeptical upon purchase of this product, because it was so pricey.. but after trying everything under the sun to lose my excess baby weight, I decided to give this a go. My bad habits are overeating, mindlessly eating, and stress eating. I tried diets, Zumba, talk therapy and unhealthy things like starvation. Nothing was working and I maintained an unhealthy weight (for my height) of 163 lbs. I had not seen below 160 in almost three years after the birth of my second baby. I've been feeling miserable health wise as well. -- Everyone laughed at me for purchasing Pavlok, even my best friend, but after some research, I decided I had nothing to lose. I started the program on July 1. Since then I have almost completely curbed my overeating (I do allow for 1-2 cheat days a week), and I've completely rid myself of mindless/stress eating. I was able to recognize my bad habits and purge them from my life. I've lost a total of 10 lbs, and have finally seen what below 160 feels like. I've also completely cut out soda and artificial sugared drinks. I feel good again. I'm happier, and my husband and friends have commented how much of a difference they have seen in my figure. I can't recommend this product enough to people who have bad habits to break. My husband said I was crazy, initially, but since he's seen such a change with me, he wants to eventually get one too :D
