I have several Maine Coon Cats and man, that long hair gets the dreds bad. But - are you ready for this??? - after feeding them this for a few months, the dreds are gone! Their coats are shiny and silky. No more having to cut out the dreds and brush them all the time.But, like Solid Gold dog food, this stuff is expensive. Is it worth it? Not sure. My cats did fine on Organix and a few other brands, but this is the only one that cured the dreds. Guess I'll stick with it unless I decide to shave the cats (just kidding, that would be a lot like trying to herd them).
