I had been searching for this product for months and finally found it. I live alone and my dog - Dude- needs his pill every 12 hours.  Since my work schedule is all over the place this is a tough thing to do even w/ dog walkers.  Dude broke into the last feeder w/ very little effort.  So I was on the hunt. I emailed Alex about the feeder and asked how easy it would be to break into and could I rely on it to get Dude his meds on time.  He got back to me immediately. He told me it would be incredibly difficult to break into and he personally guaranteed it. I was still hesitant to spend the money but was stressed all the time and finally just did it.  So glad I did!I am horrible w/ electronics and I was dreading setting it up.  Done and Done! It was easy and I NEVER say that. Only had one hiccup- the scheduled timer wasn't going off.  Well I emailed Alex and almost immediately we had it figured out and fixed. No Joke.  It happened again a few weeks later, probably bc I pushed something and Alex was there about 2 minutes after I emailed him.  Even offered to call me and taught me step by step how to fix it.  Super Easy and the best customer service I've ever had.  So instead of spending an hour and getting really frustrated I fixed it in minutes.  Dude hasn't broken in and I love watching him eat  from the webcam while i'm at work.
