Fizzics does what it promises to do which is make the majority of Beers taste better. Imperial Stouts and Baltic Porters are the ideal choices as the Nitro like creamy head it creates adds amazing depth of flavor.I refuse to knock stars off for it's percieved shortcomings because it is what it is and not what some might want it to be. For some it might not  be for IPA's as it will enhanced that styles bitterness. It also took away from a Mole Baltic Porter, enhancing the peppers which ended up taking away from a well rounded treat, but conversely it noticeably improved the similier styled Xocoveza Mocha Stout. I used this at an annual Craft Beer gathering I host and those Craft Beer veterans, after assuming it was a gimmic, left sold that this machine is the real deal. It just cant change the entire Beer Universe for every palate or style but it's alot of fun figuring that out.
