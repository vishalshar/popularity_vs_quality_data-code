Lully really works for my daughter who is 4.5 yrs old. We struggled 2 years with her night terrors and visited many doctors and sleep studies to find some remedies, nothing helped. But Lully is doing a good job, it reduced her terrors with about 70%, which is great. She used to have them 5 nights outbof 7 in a week, now they are 1-2 per week, and they last much less.This is a great product, I highly recommend it to everyone facing this condition and good luck to outgrow it!
