I received my AquaSprouts Garden kit on Sept 27, 2016 and love it. It was easy to set up and get running. As of November 19, 2016 I have several cutting doing great (see pic). I love having fresh herbs that I can get right from my aquasprouts garden ...you cant get any fresher than that. I started chatting with Jack from aquasprouts about a small leak (splashing in between the tank and grow bed and he pointed out that I could drop some risers down to lessen the splash. I also happened to mention that I wish the tubing from the pump to the grow bed was clear instead of black and Jack has sent me some clear tubing and more risers (for the splashing). Great customer service. I really enjoyed chatting with him. I will definitely do business with this company again and would recommend them for your aquaponics needs!
