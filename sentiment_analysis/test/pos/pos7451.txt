Amazing product.  I cannot thank the designers enough.  Works like a charm -- manna from heaven.  I do not require an expensive 8-12 device highly "sophisticated" universal remote and my MS in Mathematics to use it.  All I need from a universal remote are five functions -- which I use 99 percent of the time -- from two devices.  Coupled via Sideclick to an Amazon Fire TV stick are these devices and functions: from Samsung HDTV are the functions on/off and sleep timer; and from ZVOX sound pedestal are the functions volume up, volume down and mute.  I only use five of the available eight Sideclick functions.  This is because I have eliminated cable TV and I have Amazon Fire TV stick with voice control.  The voice control allows me to dictate HBO Now, Sling and Amazon Prime; and whatever else I choose to add in the future. WOW
