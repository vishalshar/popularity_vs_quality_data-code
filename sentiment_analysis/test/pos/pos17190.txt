After 4 years of buying and trying literally everything I have found the BEST eczema cream ever. My daughter was born with eczema and we have spent soooo much money we have tried organic cold pressed shea butter, organic cold pressed avocado oil, organic CP cupusu, red raspberry seed oil, gold bond lotion, you name it and we've tried it with some problems. The store bought lotions would burn and break her out more the all natural stuff would be so greasy that it would stain her clothes and get in her hair. Finally I have found this cream thanks to all the wonderful reviews and have tried it. It is nothing I have ever felt its almost tacky like and a little goes a long way. It is not greasy but feels silky and thankfully it does not burn her skin and can be used on her face without burning. I am soooo happy with this purchase that I am going to buy the 32oz.pump b/c using it twice a day all over the body uses a lot of cream. For anyone interested in saving some $ on the 32oz pump go to metaderms website I got it with free shipping for $44.88 God bless and I hope this cream helps you like it has my 4 yr old :)
