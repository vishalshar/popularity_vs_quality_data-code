Only problem I have with this product is the poles on the mount are backwards.description of the case -- The case is very rigid (good thing) and it takes a while to get the phone in place. There is a little part that detaches from the rest of the case where the magnet resides.So when I take my phone out of the case I have the darnedest time getting the case back in place because the magnet sticks to the back of my phone and it's very difficult to slide it where it needs to sit while u jam the phone in this rigid case (less good thing)."Why not flip the magnet over so it doesn't stick to the phone?"Ah ha! This is where the complaint comes in. If I do that it doesn't stick to my car mount. And the mount is sticky on one side and flat and magnetic on the other....so close
