My boyfriend loves these socks.  Very soft and they stay up w/o being so tight that they leave marks on his legs.  He slept in them and said the next morning that he could hardly tell he had socks on; they are that comfortable.  Very happy and will purchase again.  *2nd purchase*-- I immediately bought 3 more pairs after he said, "These are the kind of socks you tell your friends about".
