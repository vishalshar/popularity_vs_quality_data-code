Ok guys , this system rocks !!! I only had one problem with it ... One of the rubber feet is missing ,but I'm in love with the sound the remote control and this stero brings me back decades to a stero we had in the house as kids . It's a small foot print with great sound . The recorder player allows you to turn the records into MP3 on your PC . I haven't had a chance to use the recorder player yet ,  but I will sometime this month and write an update review ..
