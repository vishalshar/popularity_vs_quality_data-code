Well designed and constructed. Customer Service was Excellent.The one caveat.. Only mounts to Ferrous Forks that have a bolt (provided) that goes straight through the top cap to the Tension nut.If you have a Carbon Steerer Tube, that requires a much longer bolt to mount and adjustment is a bit longer time wise due to the type of compression nut vs. a new fangled nut of ferrous forks. Customer Service did send a longer bolt, but it was too short.Overall - Excellent Product supported by Superb Customer Service.
