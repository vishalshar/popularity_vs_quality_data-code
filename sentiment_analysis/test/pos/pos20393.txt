First of all, i have been looking for a double dog leash for my two toy size dogs for a long time. The only one I found at PetsMart and PetCo is for "M-XL" size dogs. So i gave up and since some reviews say this one is good for small size dogs, I put my order here.The moment i received this product... it is really joke cuz it is exactly the same one I have seen at PetsMart and Petco, where it says M-XL. When I opened it it is actually the universal clip that applies to any harness and leash. So that's the one I could have got from local pet store yet I waited two weeks looking and had to pay for shipping. That is what confuses me and I hope the manufacturer could at least revise the description to save the confusion.
