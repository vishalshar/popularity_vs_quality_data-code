LOVE my Soma pitcher. Not only is it easy on the eyes, but the automatic delivery of the filters really helps! I also love how the filters come in their own little bag for soaking. With other pitchers the little top lid would always pop off, but the Soma has a great design that pushes down with the flow of the water.
