We have had one box for about 8 months and really like it. It is the only thing I could find that wouldn't leak between sections. I was tired of throwing away whole lunched because they leaked on each other. I love the section with the twist lid, we use it for soup or noodles regularly. I have not had any problems with mildew like some of the other reviews have mentioned, however, I throw the entire box into the dishwasher on high every day. Just received the second one, now we will have a clean one in case it gets left in the backpack. so convenient that my kid can toss it into a backpack and we have not had a spill yet.
