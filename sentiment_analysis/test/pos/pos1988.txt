Easily the best powerbank I have owned. The size is absolutely key as it allows me to store it with my travel documents in a passport holder. The 4,000 mAh capacity is plenty for my phone. I've had higher capacity powerbanks and never really required anything more than a single charge. The fact that the cables are included makes life alot easier and if you were wondering, yes, you can charge an android device and an apple device at the same time. Without a doubt the best travel accessory you can buy.
