1. I just got the tracker today and I really like the look and feel of the wearable.2. Clean packaging and super easy to unbox, setup and wear.3. Pairing the misfit-shine2 with phone application takes just a couple of minutes.4. Once things are setup you'll be able to view the steps, calorie count and sleep time.5. I linked my-fitness-pal to misfit app since the food logging is easier in the former.Will update the review as I use it more but the first few hours have been great.Update:Played ping-pong and it was able to track my activity well. It stood firm on my wrist without issues.
