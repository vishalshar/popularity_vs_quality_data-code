Replaced the hunter control that came with my irrigation center at the end of last season. Did the install myself with basic tools and it took about 90 minutes. After the installation the setup of my 11 zone system was super easy. I really like that it predicts uses local weather stations to predict when there will be rain and automatically skips watering. Much more effective than the previous system that would only skip watering if it was actually raining at that time. Also have seen it adjust watering times up and down. It even splits the watering into multiple events to avoid saturating any one zone. Really a clever device that has reduced my unnecessary water use while still keeping my lawn in perfect shape. The only missing component is a soil moisture sensor that would complete the whole package. Hopefully they are serious in their blog posts that indicate they're working on partnering with a sensor vendor.
