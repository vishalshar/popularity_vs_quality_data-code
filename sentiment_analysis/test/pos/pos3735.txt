I had the 3 regular iPhone chargers and my rabbit bit them all in seconds and we all know those chargers aren't cheap. Ever since I got this charger my rabbit hasn't tried to bit it off, so that good. Other than that the charger hold on its place and its insanely strong. I know you shouldn't work out with the charger but it advertise it's insanly tough so i tried it and when i was doing pull ups and it didn't brake so it's a mostly a buys on.
