Used these daily on 7 days trek up Mt. Kilimanjaro, where we had camped 7 nights without a shower.  I find it hard to sleep if my body is not clean such that there is a sticky sensation as my legs and arms rest on my body in the sleeping bag.  I am guessing this is natural body oils and leftover sweat residue, but it disturbs me.  I would wipe down my whole body nightly with these and no issues.  One towel is enough? for my entire body.  Start on top and work down.  A bit cold, but needed.  I will use again on other camping trips.
