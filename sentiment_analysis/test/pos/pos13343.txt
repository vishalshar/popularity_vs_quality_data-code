I have had the Raticator v2 for a month or 2 now and I must say that I am very happy with it!  You have to get used to the LED light not staying on.  It flashes green briefly when you first turn it on but then the light goes off.  I assume this is a battery saving feature but it did leave me wondering if it was actually on.  It didn't help that everywhere I placed it, zero kills!  Until I found the hot spot that is!  Now I am placing a serious dent in the flea infested vermin world!!  Once I located an active area, I had 5 activation's and 4 kills!  2 ground squirrels will no longer be digging in my planters and 2 rats have gone on to where ever dead rats go...  The first kill was 1 of the ground squirrels and this thing was huge!  I had a hard time getting it out of the Raticator it was so big.  Big or not, that squirrel was done for!  I will be adding more of these to my arsenal.  Especially since my neighbors new puppy likes to eat dead animals so I will try to reduce my bait stations.  Hopefully Raticator comes out with a weather proof model so I can place these along my exterior fence line.  I am deviously happy with this little varmint surprise!
