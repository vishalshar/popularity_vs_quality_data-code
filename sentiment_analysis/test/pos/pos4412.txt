I love this adaptor now that I've gotten it set up - I use it, and can see real-time movement from the vehicle when it is being driven and get alerts of when it's parked and when it's first started.  I assume the parking is going to help me out a lot when you can't quite remember where you walked in from but I have noticed the last park when you click on walking directions seems to be the trip before the current one you're on hopefully that's just a glitch that will get fixed. At first I had trouble installing this because I had the previous automatic adapter and it needs a different Android app automatic Pro to connect to this one but it did not tell me that it just kept telling me invalid security pin once I figured it out it was a breeze to install and I am truly enjoying it and considering getting one for each of our vehicles, a good thing to note is it automatically sent an error message via email to the customer service and they immediately email me back trying to help but by then I had already figured it out.
