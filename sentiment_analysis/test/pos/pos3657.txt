I would like to say from the begining that the Kuna Security light is addition and second two audio security camera to my existing home security and bought it for only $159.99..The Kuna Maximus is a well made device and a nice outside light decor ( you can barely tell it has a camera on it,its well hidden). Install was easy with clear instructions. I chose the Model Coach Black security light because it had the clear glass which works helps make full color night vision clearer & sharper..the daytime 720p HD is Great with minor video lag...( that is with 50mbps download & 25mbps upload on my 2.4ghz wireless speed )It does everything as advertised: video recording to the cloud,motion sensor,turn off/on light remotely with app or dusk to dawn setting option,two way audio( great speaker & mic ),720p HD live video feed,push notifcations,manual camera rotation & 3 pre recorded messages..you can also adjust motion sensor senstivity and turn on/off the Blue led light on device..The responds time to access live video feed is pretty instant and app refresh on video is also quick. The app is simple and easy to use..Here are some reasons why I did not give a 5 star rating:1.there is only 2hr cloud storage and 3 download per month on those recordings for standard users,this can be a DEAL BREAKER..I have other security cams that give you 7 days of free cloud storage and unlimited downloads for standard users..2.There is no option to record on demand when viewing live video feed..I did chat online with customer sevice about this and they said they may add this feature later..3. After viewing the live video for over 3mins you get alot of lag and delay to the point of where its not worth viewing anymore..4.Lastly you have to always have the light switch ON to give it power-I was able to have direct power so that is not an issue for me.The reason I did that is I had one off/on switch the controlled porch light and front garage door light..so I can turn porch light off and on without powering off Kuna light..????...there also is NO customer service/tech support number to call but you can chat online during there business hours which I have done and it was helpful...
