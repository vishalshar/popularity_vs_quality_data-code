I'm a 10x Ironman and do a ton of training listening to music, audio books and podcasts. The Dash is remarkable; connects first time every time, excellent sound quality without letting you damage your ears, transparency could be a life saver on the bike, the built in MP3 player makes for great swims, phone call quality is first class and while I use Garmin products to track my fitness, the Dash fitness app is a bonus. As to the negative reviews, I can only assume the earlier software and production units were buggy as mine have been flawless with great connectivity (I leave my phone in the locker and listen while in the shower which is 30+ feet away).  Spendy but very worth.  If you're on the fence, hop off; you will not be disappointed.
