This is a great product.  One of my biggest fears on the motorcycle is being rear-ended as I decelerate while downshifting.  My fears are lessened with Vololights.  In fact, I can see in my rear view mirror that vehicles behind me are now following at a greater distance than they would pre-Vololight installation.  The purchase was worth the expense to me.
