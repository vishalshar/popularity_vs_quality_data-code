I was a bit skeptical at first because I love my own oven-crisped kale, but there is no way to keep it crispy for snacks the next day and eating cold floppy kale is not that satisfying...enter, Rhythm Kale Chips.  They are crispy, they taste like kale, they are filling, they are easy to pack and go, and the flavors are fun (Mango Habenero was my favorite).  And as a teacher I love to model healthy eating and it was pretty fun to be eating kale chips and have all my young students talking about how much they love kale.  Anytime you can get someone excited to eat kale, it's a win!
