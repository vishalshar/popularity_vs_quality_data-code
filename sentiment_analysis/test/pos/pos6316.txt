I would give it five stars if it weren't for the hole in the center. Yes, it was obvious in the pictures, but it means that if you have your cards in a bag with a bunch of other stuff (in my case, they're in my billiards cue case and so there's chalk and pens and such rattling around), the cards on the top and bottom might get messed up. I put the jokers facing out but I wish the hole weren't there. It doesn't aid in opening the case, so what's the purpose?
