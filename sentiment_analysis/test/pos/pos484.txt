I have the ScoopFree Litter Box.  This is the only litter the manufacturer recommends.  Just beware that these do not include the disposable trays.  One thing I learned is that when dumping it has a horrendous order as opposed to traditional clumping litter.  Highly recommend you order the refill with trays unless you have a reusable tray.
