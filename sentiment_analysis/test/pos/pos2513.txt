I purchased this after doing much research on children's lunch boxes. My 6 year old daughter is a picky eater and needs a hot food (chicken nuggets, pasta, Mac and cheese...). This was perfect for us. I can give her the hot meal and also add in fruits, vegetables and a treat!It washed well (on the top rack) of the dishwasher.Don't let the price point scare you, this is a quality product.
