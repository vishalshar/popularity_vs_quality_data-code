I've stuck with using cloth mouse pads (mostly QcKs) almost forever. This is probably one of the only hard pads I've used that I actually like.It is somewhat flexible and the texture is smooth and more plastic than metallic, so there's no worries of it destroying your mouse's teflon feet. The tracking is excellent on my Logitech G303 and G400. The rubber base is insanely clingy and the mouse pad does not move *at all* once positioned. The little divot at the bottom of the pad is also a good for placing a wrist rest if desired. The dimensions of the pad are good even if you use very low mouse sensitivity.Something that I immediately noticed coming from a cloth pad is that it feels like there's almost no static friction. Even the slightest amount of force will cause your mouse to move. This makes it very easy to make small adjustments, but also means you can accidentally move the mouse cursor when you don't intend to just from the smallest of movements. Also, the pad is a lot wider than it is tall. Considering that most games have a lot more horizontal camera movement than vertical, this isn't much of an issue, but it could be, depending on the games you play.
