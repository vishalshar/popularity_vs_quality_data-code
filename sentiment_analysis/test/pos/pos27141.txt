The pebble 2 may not have all the bells and whistles compared to higher end smart watches, but what it does, it does well.ProsIt's waterproof and rugged.  I've accidentally hit the watch against door frames and the like and there isn't a scratch on it, I wear it in the shower all the time.The battery life is fantastic.  The manufacturers were not lying when they said it has a 7 day battery life.  And it charges back up pretty quickly tooThe e-ink display lets you read it even in direct sun, and it's always on displaying the time or whatever you have the watch face set asVoice dictation to reply to texts, emails, etcPriceConsBlack and white screenNot a touch screen, and some apps have clunky user interface since there are only 4 buttons to work withConclusion:  If you want a solid piece of hardware that doesn't break the bank- This is the one.  I personally love it.
