I eat all my meals at work during the week, and travel often and prefer to prepare my own meals whenever possible; I prefer to have my own utensils on hand.  I originally had a knife/fork/spoon set of normal silverware at work, but they kept getting temporarily stolen from the drying rack.  I got fed up and searched for a travel set that I could take anywhere and that would standout from the norm.  Success!  Gobites Trio has solved my problem.  The case fits perfectly into my lunchbox, suitcase, & purse.  The knife/fork/spoon are sturdy, although I haven't tried the toothpick or bottle-opener (they frown upon drinking from beer bottles at work).  The reason why I didn't award it the fifth star is because the fork sometimes won't pick up fine lettuce because the thongs are a little thick, but nothing a scooping action won't fix.  As another customer mentioned, I haven't tried taking it through TSA, but I'm not ready to risk losing it.  I bought all three colors--grey, blue, & red--in case I have visitors and we want to take a road trip; three of us would have our own set.  Maybe I'll risk the red set, since it's not as pretty as the other two colors.  humangear should consider making a hot-pink set. =)
