I completely advocate purchasing this controller, if yours is in need of replacement. The Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller has granted me a level of consistency, and control, over my property watering that I simply didn't have before. I live in Florida. I cannot count how many times my lawn was watered in the morning only to get hit by rain @ 4:00 PM EST that same day. Since installing the Rachio, my system has run TWICE. I installed on 9/25.In addition to the reduction in total runs due to its smart capabilities, It also reduced the amount of watering done considerably based on the variables you define per zone during setup. I'm talking an overall reduction of about 15 minutes in some zones and upwards of 20 minutes in others. We have a ~2500 sq ft of lawn to worry about, and only 4 zones so I'm definitely not a complex use case for the thing. That said, I have no doubt at all that I will have a full ROI by the end of next May, if not sooner, based on the reduction I'm seeing across the board.Oh, and my lawn looks healthier too on account of the fact it isn't being oversaturated anymore.We replaced an aging Rainbird controller with the Rachio. Installation was exceptionally easy.
