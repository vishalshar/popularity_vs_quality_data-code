The quality of this item is very high. The etching for the bricks is sharp and detailed. The front magnet is about 3mm thick, which is a good size to be noticed but not too bulky. The back magnet is about 6mm thick and coated in a black plastic to protect it and your shirts. The front magnet has a smooth back and polished corners to protect your ties. These magnets are STRONG. If you don't have a firm grip, they will snap to each other from 1-2 inches apart. It states in the packaging that the best way to separate them is to slide them apart, and I find this to be true. I have tried these on my thickest ties and this tie pin does not shift around.The only thing I would like to see is that more styles are evolved. Maybe a silver colored circle 12mm across with a 10mm blue gemstone in the middle of it? (Hint, hint) I am pleased with my purchase and I will be looking to purchase more in the future.
