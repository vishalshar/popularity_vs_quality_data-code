I bought the One Touch 2 for myself and loved it.  Of course, the wife always gets the upgrade.  Great for her because it's easy to use and drop your phone into.  Makes her driving with maps A LOT easier.  No longer has to keep picking up her phone to see what directions Siri might be telling.i highly recommend this for anyone who spends a lot of time in their car using their phone a lot.
