Overall pretty good in the back of my 2015 Nissan Xterra which then allows for our infant to sit in a convertible seat.  This would have been 5 stars if the design allowed for the base of the seats to attach somehow to the rear bench.  When my kids get in, they slide all over the place and I have to lean back there to help them buckle.
