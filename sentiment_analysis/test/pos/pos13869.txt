I bought two 8x11" sheets. One is on a wall at home and the other on my desktop. I love them and am now buying a bigger one to cover my entire desktop as well as ordering some for my employees.I am not using less sticky notes! One comment... While I understand the need to advertise the company, I wish the logo was a bit smaller. It's about 2"x1" in the bottom corner.
