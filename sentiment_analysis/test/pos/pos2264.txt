Really silly ad about how water is the common denominator in all people and it allows you o be true to yourself, almost made me not want to buy it, and I'm a storyteller-marketer. But the product: There are two things I REALLY like about it.1. It looks pretty. It's glass and I could serve people with this if I wanted to, the plastic jugs from competitors just look tacky.2. Perhaps the most important reason, and the reason I bought this thing after seeing it at my friend's house. The purifying dripper is easily removed, which means that you don't have to wait for the batch to seep through to pour. This is great for all those times when you fill up the purifying and then 2 seconds later realize that right, you needed to fill the coffee pot, or when you need a lot of water for cooking or something and you need the water peu en peu. the removable siv also means you can use it with a different container... like a coffee maker. just saying.Anyway, I love this product, I like it so much I excused it being half an inch too tall meaning I couldn't fit it under my tap, again removable siv helps with this. I've had a ton of these different ones, I can't stand the taste of US water and this is a great product.
