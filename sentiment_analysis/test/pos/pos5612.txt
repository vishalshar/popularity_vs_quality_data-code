It's pretty useful when you have Amazon Echo (Alexa)... Otherwise, it's only useful when you have several family members with it too. I have it next to my bed, so I can easily see the time, the weather, and ask many stuff to Alexa. It's cheaper than Echo tap, and you can listen to music and other stuff.
