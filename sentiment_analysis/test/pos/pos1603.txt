I installed this on a Fjr 1300 2008, it was a perfect fit, I wired to the license plate running light. I did have to file a 1/16 inch off the bottom of my license plate, that was easy to do since they are aluminum , you calibrated with the bike sitting level and off of the kickstand. Unit flashes whenever you downshift or apply your brakes, A little pricey, but well worth it .
