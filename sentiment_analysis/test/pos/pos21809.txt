Didn't know for sure how many stars to give this. Worked great BUT was Rose Gold not Gold. Said Gold but wasn't. I sent it back. Lynktec, get your colors right and I may buy again. If you had it in white I would have exchanged but didn't want another Rose Gold.UPDATE: This has been updated to 5 stars from 3. The manufacture ask me to contact them and they would make sure I received the color I ordered. I did and I now have the correct color, gold.Now saying that I also need to say how the stylus works. It works quite well. Better than most I have tried. The biggest issue is Apple. The iPad technology was made to use the iPad with the finger (Steve Job wanted it that way). The Lynktec Apex Fusion Fine Point Active Stylus works better than all the others I have tried. I am very pleased with the performance and recommend it. Not perfect but the BEST out there.
