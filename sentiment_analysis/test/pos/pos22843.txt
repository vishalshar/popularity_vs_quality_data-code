This phone is perfection for senior folks who get a bit confused by icons and lights in smart phones.  Keyboard is easy to use and the phone is simple to understand. Customer Service is as good as it gets.  Very friendly, knowledgable staff a phone call away.  Emergency button is the best on the market today.  If 10 stars were available I would give it a ten.
