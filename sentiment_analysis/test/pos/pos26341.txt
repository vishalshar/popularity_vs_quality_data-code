As a student, I was looking for something portable to easily carry around & with easy setup. This projector has both! For 50 lumens this projector is quite bright. Although in dim lighting it is weaker, it is still decently visible and you to watch something on it if you so desired. A couple of the reviews on here complained of scratch marks: these were probably caused by the plastic protective sheets covering the two black sides of the cube. I would not have noticed these sheets were it not for the instructions telling me to take them off. When rubbing them yes, they easily become scratched but once removed the black side of the cube is shiny and not easily scratched. The sound is quite low even on full volume, but I planned on using external speakers anyway-and they work just fine with it. I purchased the apple lightening to digital AV adaptor and the thunderbolt to hdmi adaptor so I could use the projector for my iPhone and Mac. Both work great. While the remote may be an inconvenience for those who lose things, I don't find it a negative part of the product. It is light and small, and I didn't find it as "cheaply made" as a couple reviews said. It is a small remote and it works well. I like that it is a remote because you can control things on the cube without worrying about knocking the projector over or moving it out of focus. The buttons on the projector itself are quite small and, in a darkly lit room during movies, are difficult to find without picking up the projector. The remote makes it easier to simply turn up the volume or brightness without disturbing your entertainment. Overall, the cube is light and compact, just like it is meant to be. Quality is great for the price. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a compact projector for entertaining.
