As a breastfeeding mom of a newborn, this product was essential.  It's an all-in-one package of a changing pad, scale, tracker, and app.The pad helped me track how much breastmilk my baby was getting, which was helpful especially during the first sleep-deprived weeks.  I loved how all data popped up on the app on my phone and I even got alerts on my phone each time I used the pad.  For example, if I used the pad to weigh my newborn before and after a feeding, a message would pop up on my phone letting me know how many ounces she drank.  I could then easily click on the app and check her daily feedings, and any trends over a number of weeks, etc.  For breastfeeding alone, I found it really helpful since I was never quite sure before how much milk my baby was getting.  Although I could use a normal scale, having a smart changing pad seamlessly send, track, and graph this data made it a lot more useful for me.The touchscreen on the pad is super easy and seamless to use, and I was able to routinely not only feeding data, but sleep, and changing patterns on the app.  Being able to seamlessly track sleeping patterns through the app helped me establish a more regular napping schedule for my baby.  In addition, it was helpful to be able to track how many diapers my baby went through-- saved me more than once during trips to the pediatrician when my sleep deprived brain could not for the life of me remember.The app alone is better than a lot of other tracking apps out there, and of course the obvious benefit is that it's actually linked to a smart changing pad.  The pad itself is beautiful and comfortable and I love that it's machine washable.  It is not very heavy but is very sturdy on top of a changing table, or even on a normal table if you don't have a changing table.  My newborn loved it (at least I think she did since she never cried on it),This is a perfect gift for a new mom, especially during the early weeks of a baby.  It is also a great gift for preemies in order to track their weight gain.  Although pricey, I could see a group of friends pooling money to get this at a baby shower.  At any rate, I think it's worth the price to help preserve a parent's sanity.
