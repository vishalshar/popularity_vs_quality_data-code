I've owned numerous laptops and desktops and this is by far the best computer I've ever bought in terms of specs vs price ratio.There are a lot of reviews for this laptop and literally the one and only downside that has been constantly resurfacing is the screen quality. IMO the screen is fine, it could be better as I've always used IPS displays up until now but I've been watching videos and gaming just fine with no noticeable annoyance. There is always an option of using an exterior monitor for display as well but I have not found the need to do so as I am content with how it is.
