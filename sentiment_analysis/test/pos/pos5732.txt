All I have to say: it is great!!But, unfortunately the auto function isn`t the way I have expected.You can not really personally it.Means:There are parameters you aren` t able to handle.For example the exact time by changing the frames by automode.By chance the frames changes ...But: It is a great camera with a great sharp solution, if the light is right.I would buy it again.(Please think about Europe, I miss a AC/DC for Germany ..., but the Iphone adapters works well
