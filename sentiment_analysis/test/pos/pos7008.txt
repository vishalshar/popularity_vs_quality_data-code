I am in the process of reordering this product.  I love a bit of vanilla flavor in my coffee and the idea of added vitamins is an added bonus. It gives my coffee a delightful flavor.  I do not had milk or cream to coffee btw so flavored creamer is not an option for me.  I can add extra sweetness if I want or just go with the vanilla flavor.  I have used it consistently since I bought it and have enjoyed my coffee so much more.  It was a winner for me from the added vitamins to the great vanilla flavor.
