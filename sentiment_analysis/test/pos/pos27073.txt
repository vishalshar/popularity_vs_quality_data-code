I like this lash tint because it makes my lashes that are blond on the tips look longer and darker without looking like I'm wearing mascara.  There's no clumping and it doesn't flake or smudge off (a problem I have with regular mascara, even the ones that say they don't flake or smudge.) The tint lasts a long time, I often find my lashes still look dark the next morning, but it washes off easily enough.  It also seems to make my lashes curl slightly. The only problem I have found, it takes a little longer to dry. One other note the mascara tube is not as pictured, but does seem to be the same product.
