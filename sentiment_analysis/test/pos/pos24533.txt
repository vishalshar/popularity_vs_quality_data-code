Up until now I had been an Apple user since 2007. I decided recently to switch back to PC, but before I built a desktop I wanted to get a laptop. The Asus K501 looked like a MacBook so I thought it might be a good way to transition. I loved the look and speed of the computer, but had issues with two separate units. The first had a blown speaker and the second had a pixel in the screen die within a week.I am sure that I was just unlucky, but the reality was concerning nonetheless. Amazon has been amazing with the issues that have taken place and I have since switched to a Lenovo Ideapad and love it. However, I would still recommend this laptop. Just be aware of its apparent fragility when it comes to its build. The computer itself runs really well.
