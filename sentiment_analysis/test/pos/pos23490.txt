The other reviews cover this pretty well already but this drive is indeed smoking fast, I've never seen an external drive read AND WRITE data so quickly, on any medium.  I'm using it with a new Macbook Air and new Macbook Pro after formatting the drive in Mac format journaled.  You can move massive 10GB files onto that thing in a matter of seconds instead of minutes.It's featherweight and really small, I can't ever imagine going back to USB sticks after using this thing, it's nothing to carry and gives you pretty good capacity with smoking fast speeds.  Love it.
