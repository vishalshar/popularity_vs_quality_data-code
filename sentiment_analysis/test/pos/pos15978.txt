Not as fancy as your standard cocktail shaker, But I was looking for something to use duringmy outdoor hang outs or picnics, this came through, Anything with mason jars, you can not go wrong with.I was very Pleased with all the tools that it came with, I had no problems mixing drinks inside the jar, Strainer worksVery well and it's just cool to have around overall. Makes a nice gift for anyone. Would Recommend.
