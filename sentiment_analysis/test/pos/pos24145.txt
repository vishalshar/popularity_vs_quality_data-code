Got this for my daughter in law for Christmas.  She loves it!  Had a bit of trouble getting it working... But now their new lab puppy watches the camera when they aren't home. She is waiting for them to talk to her and get her treat!  Makes it easier to leave her alone while they are at work.  I would definitely buy this again!
