A friend bought these for me initially but since then, I've bought another set for another pair of running shoes. I love these things as they offer a quick and easy way to slip your shoes off and on yet still offer me the support I need to keep my shoes tight while running. I am constantly asked about them at running events as well.When using these to replace your shoe laces, make sure you visit their website to look at the various lacing techniques. I actually have applied all 3 lacing methods in some form or fashion to my shoes so they are tighter toward the base of the shoe yet looser as you come to the top to allow for me to slip my shoes off and on.Overall, quite happy with these.
