I have the Soma pitcher and have now ordered the carafe. I have used Brita for years, Zero Water, and Pur. This by far gives the best taste, and I love that it is a natural filter. I also think these products are pretty enough for a dining room table or buffet table. I got one for my guest room and one for my bedroom. I have absolutely no complaints.
