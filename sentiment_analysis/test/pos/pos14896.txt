It is tough to find the right kitten/cat food that is healthy for your pet. Many foods have no nutritional value but your kitten/cat loves the flavor. Then there are those companies that go to extreme efforts to provide organic and/nutritional value for you kitten/cat, but your cat hates the flavor. Some of these latter form of kitten/cat foods may be organic and nutritional but isn't too your cat in the same way it is for humans, so it is a waste of money. Other just don't provide for you kitten/cats special needs. Well, this brand and flavor of food seems to please our two indoor kittens (16wks & 19 wks old) including our dogs ( 1yr & 13yr old). The key ingredient isn't the duck but the pumpkin. It helps with all our animals digestion and is pleasant to their palate. The price is hefty but if you mix it with the cheaper, less nutritional, and more flavorful bags of food, it really goes along way, while keeping my pets happy and in working order.
