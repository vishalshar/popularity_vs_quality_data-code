Works as advertised with iPhone SE and iOS 9.3.4. Setup and operation are straightforward and uncomplicated. The associated app is so far bug free, and is fairly flexible without being cumbersome. It weighs in at 65M. Note that the app requires that you register. Other than that, the only problem is that this product is a battery hog - make sure you are well charged prior to an expected long use.
