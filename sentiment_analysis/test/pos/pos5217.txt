I purchased this tiny phone to use for fitness apps (MapMyWalk & Fitbit), Kindle Reader app, Audible, & Overdrive, as well as using like an MP3 player.  I use this device offline & over Wi-Fi only & do not have it set up for wireless phone service.  Worked well with Dolphin browser for Vimeo videos also.  Bluetoothed with TomTom fitness watch & Omron blood pressure monitor, but could not get it to work with the Fitbit Zip (Fitbit app, but it will use the Fitbit app to log a workout without a device).I have taken a few pics with the device.  Picture quality is okay & does also record videos.  It has a slot for additional memory, but I have not installed any in mine.  If you plan on using for much storage, I recommend adding memory (think it's a microSD slot, but check the specs).Pros:  Love the size, pocket-size.  Works great with Audible audiobooks & Overdrive audiobooks (from public library).  Large speaker on backside great for audiobooks & music (must use with speaker face-up though).  It was very easy to USB device to PC & copy music over.  Has headphone jack.  Comes with earbuds, USB charger, & USB cable.Cons:  Need to use stylus for detailed clicking, not recommended for browsing.  Getting the tip of charge cable in the right position is sometimes quirky.
