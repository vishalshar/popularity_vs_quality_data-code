Bought the Cinnamon apple chips to try recently when they were $10 for 2 packs.  It's crunchy and sweet. It gets boring and started to taste way too sweet after a few pieces, so that makes me crave for some unhealthy Lays potato chips! There's skin and seeds as far as I can tell.  Overall, it's a healthy snack that can't possibly make you overeat.
