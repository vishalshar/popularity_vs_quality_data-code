I LOVE these. I have a hard time taking pills because of the binding agents used make them, I guess, so I usually take chewable tablets or gummies. I tried these, meanwhile cringing at the cost (sorry...tight budget). But I really enjoyed these and even, gasp, looked forward to taking them each day. Odd, I know. I love taking my Omega 3 gummies which are a different brand too. I do feel like I felt better when I was taking these. I have MCS and fibro, so that is helpful. I am really sensitive to supplements, so finding one I can take is a blessing.  Because of the cost I didn't buy them for the past two months, but I've decided to buy another bottle.
