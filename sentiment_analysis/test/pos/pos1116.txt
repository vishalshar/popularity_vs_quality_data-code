I wanted to try this product as the Absynnian oil mixed with bees wax sounded very interesting.  The product has no scent, which is nice.  It's also fairly solid which makes me think a small amount will go a long way.  When I applied it to my cutting board and followed the instruction, it did not leave any oily residue and left the wood looking beautiful.  I bought Gentle Bees to try it on a brand new, large teak cutting board that I purchased.  The cutting board came with a paper band/wrapper on it that had absorbed the natural oils and left a thick visible streak where the teak wood had dried out.  After the first application of Gentle Bees, the streak was nearly gone and the wood looks so much better.  I think the streak will entirely disappear after a second application.  I also like it that the oil and conditioner are mixed into a single jar, as other butcher block products require purchase of both an oil and a conditioner.  The product instructions say to use it weekly, but I will probably use it every other week on my better items.
