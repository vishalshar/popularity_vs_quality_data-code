I own two Omron devices that I have used for the last two years.  I would keep one in the car and one at home. They are quite efficient and well designed, but do not have the all important Blip Wi-Fi feature.  Previously, I would have to carry the devices to the doctor's office, or jot down readings to a blood pressure "diary" and remember to take it in or send it to the doctor's office by email.  The blip works on my IPad and IPhone and instantly transmits to Blip's site AND Health Vault, so my doctors at the VA and in San Francisco have access whenever they need it.  More importantly, if anything happens to me while traveling, doctors and hospitals all over the world have an online history.The software is well designed, well concieved and immediately useful.  The device itself is solid, efficient, and elegantly black.  The cuff works better than the two Omron's, and is the easiest to get on and off of any of the devices I've used.I did have trouble with directions connecting it to my Wi-Fi network. Customer support walked me through the setup.  The written directions are hard to follow, but once everything was connected, it is everything they advertised.This is the first day I got connected, so I will post a follow up after a few months.  I plan on taking it on international travel soon, so I'll get back to you on how well it works between borders.  The very helpful woman at customer support said I should have no problems except where hotel and hotspot regulations prevail, which seems fair enough.It seems as though this company has found the weakness of other devices, and created a useful solution.
