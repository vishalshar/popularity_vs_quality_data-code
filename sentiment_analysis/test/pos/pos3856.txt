This device is truly amazing. It is very easy to use with a good autonomy, just plug and start the app. Quality of the photos are very good and can be customized with the app BEFORE printing, so contrarily to the polaroid, you don't waste paper on failed photos. (Papers are cheaper than polaroid as well btw)Besides printing photos, the augmented reality feature is mind blowing, it's like Harry Potter in real. Basically, after taking the photo, the app takes a short video. This secret video can be unveiled by scanning the photo with the Prynt app, so at the end you have the photo and the context where the photo has been taken. But you can also print any other photos from your gallery and attach a totally different video to it, so one photo with a "surprise" embedded. The video can be public (visible with any Prynt App) or private (visible only to people you allow).I like to have photos on papers and stick them everywhere at home, now I still have photos everywhere but they all plays a video when scanning them, I have videos on my walls.Since I bought it, the app have been regularly updated with new functionalites making it very easy to share the "moments" online or on paper (or keep it private if you do not want to share).The app is user friendly, few tabs, Gallery, Printed photos, Printed photos your friends shared with you and Scan. It is very easy to get paper with the app as well.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase, since I got this, I now barely use my Polaroid Mini 7S. This device makes the perfect link between the physical photos and new technologies.
