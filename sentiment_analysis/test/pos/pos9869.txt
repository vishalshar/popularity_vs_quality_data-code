Bought this cause I was having bad back pains and my doctor told maybe I should try and change my mattress. So I read and watch several reviews on the different foam mattresses on the market and most of them said the same thing about everyone but one guy did recommend this brand over the others so I purchased it. So far I have been pain free since I started sleeping on it so I recommend trying it if you have morning back pains.
