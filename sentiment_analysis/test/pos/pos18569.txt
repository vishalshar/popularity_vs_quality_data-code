Works great at recording people coming to door.  Have had a few false alarms probably from car passing.  I do have to individually delete each recording.  It would be good if more than one recording could be deleted at a time.  It seems that it is a reasonably new product and I'm sure there will be updates.  There is a small blue light that I thought was a give away that there was a camera, so I put some black tape over it.
