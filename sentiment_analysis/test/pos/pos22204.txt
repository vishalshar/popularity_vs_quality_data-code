First off, I loved the fact that the device came within three days of my order being placed . . . well done Amazon!  I used the tape measure for the first time yesterday to obtain the dimensions for my office desk surface (I want to purchase a smoked glass top).  The tape measure was ready to go as soon as I pulled the battery tab out.  I found it very much an intuitive process gathering my desk measurements.  The measurements were precise and I could easily read the information without my glasses.  I can't wait to start using the tape measure on projects like the construction of my son's wood toy chest.  An unexpected side benefit of this purchase is that my wife has already mentioned that she may try using the tape measure because of the ease of reading the information.  By the way, I would love to see this device in a larger size for bigger projects (one set of measurements and done).  Thanks for the opportunity to chat up the product!
