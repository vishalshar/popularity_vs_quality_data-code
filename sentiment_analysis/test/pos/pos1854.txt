Bought this to use for Thanksgiving holiday for gaming and general internet usage. It's a very fast laptop, and the 512GB SSD (476 GB formatted) probably adds to that. Boots up around 5 seconds or so.Here are some quick FPS measurements I have made in various games at 1920x1080, with Vsync ON for the Blizzard titles:Overwatch - 50-60 FPS Ultra quality. This performance is surprising and impressive.WoW (Legion) - 35-45 FPS in Dalaran with lots of people around, 55-60 FPS in open/questing areas, high quality for most options, 7 on slider.Battlefield 1 - 25 FPS at high quality. I'm sure you could get more by lowering certain settings.Titanfall 2 - The FPS slides all over the place, but it seems like it would be an average of 45 FPS at high quality. No matter what it is showing, it seems to be very "smooth".Battery life is good - remember to turn  your screen brightness down! With the screen brightness at 25% or so, I get over 10 hours for light internet surfing (optical mice will reduce this by an hour or so), 5-6 hours of Netflix. Haven't bothered playing games on battery.For $869 I would say that the laptop is quite a deal. The only downside that I have seen (or heard rather), is that the fans will randomly spin up, even when not in a program the demands high performance. If you are in a program that has sound (like Netflix or any action game), the fans become less noticeable.I bought an extra 8 GB of RAM, which I haven't installed yet. Will post results sometime later after adding the RAM (which I don't expect to do for a week or so).
