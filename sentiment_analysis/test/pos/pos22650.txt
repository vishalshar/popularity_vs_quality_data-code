Received this yesterday. Was a little disappointed when the pictures show that there are 2 sides to hold cards and things, and I open it and it's only one side to hold your things and the other side is a mirror. It's also a bit slick to hold in my hands, no rubber or anything for grip, might have to add a little something since there's no screen protection so it doesn't slip out of my hand. Otherwise it's a pretty cool idea. Like the design. Just wish it has the 2 sides for holding and not the mirror
