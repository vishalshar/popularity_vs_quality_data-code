My Malamute had a really serious leg infection and almost died.  During recovery I enhanced his diet and added Superfood.  Not only did he improve, he needed all the help he could get, but his coat is shinny and his eyes are bright.  He did a great recovery, due to Superfood?  Who knows, but he is healthy and happy again and even the surgeon said he has never seen a dog recover faster than mine.  I'm sold.  I use it all the time now and I tell everyone.  I mix it with his fresh, organic chicken dinner with yams and peas and he eats everything.  His energy level is back and they didn't have to amputate....  HIGHLY RECCOMEND
