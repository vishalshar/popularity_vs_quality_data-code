The tape caused me to have a bad allergic reaction, the device worked great.  I will say while I was able to wear it, it really helped me keep track of my posture.  It notified me when I was slouching and I could keep track of how long I was maintains good posture.  Loved it just wished I could have been able to handle the adhesive.  I have since found out I have an actual adhesive allergy, so no matter what tape was in it I would not be able to use it.  Maybe I can figure out a way to make a bandage wrap with it...?
