This item is a rather ingenious little mushroom kit. It's definitely for beginners and thus allows for a lot of potential mismanagement. Also, on the off chance you get no mushrooms, the company has a guarantee that will get you a free replacement.Now I mention mismanagement because it can be extremely difficult to grow mushrooms. So many considerations to keep in mind when you grow almost any type! However, if you keep to the directions, then you'll be guaranteed to get a proper batch within 2 weeks. Just be aware that your batch may look different or get a smaller yield versus the picture on the box. No matter though; it's the experience that makes this item so worth it!Side note: I made a pretty good oyster mushroom risotto with my little 1 lbs batch.
