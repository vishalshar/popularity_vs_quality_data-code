I bought this for my 2008 MINI Cooper, and it's just simply the best solution I have found for mounting my phone somewhere useful inside the car.  There's not a lot of space to put a phone mount in that car that doesn't significantly reduce visibility (like a big suction cup on the windshield) or block something else useful like vents, speedo, etc.It fits tightly into the CD slot on the MINI, which made me a little nervous at first, but it locks in place very well and doesn't seem to cause any issues with the CD player.  Once in place and tightened, it is absolutely solid.  With my phone clamped in, it's slightly more difficult to reach the volume knob for the stereo but that's the only thing even slightly inconvenient about it.I've got a Samsung Captivate, and after removing the bottom part of the clamp it fits perfectly.  I have to clamp it in a little off-center to keep the volume and power buttons from being pressed by the clamp, but it's not a big deal.So I've got nothing bad to say about this product.  It's simply the best way to mount a device in your car without a permanent bracket getting screwed to your dash.
