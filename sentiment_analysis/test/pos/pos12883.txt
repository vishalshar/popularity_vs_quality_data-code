The Mountek CD Slot Mount MT5000-C seems unusual because it mounts in your CD changer slot.  I've been assured that this should cause no damage if installed and used properly.  I would caution people not to install it and remove it on a daily basis, though.The mount slides into the CD slot, you then use a thumb screw to expand the mount slightly inside the CD drive.  This is the only mechanism the holds the mount in place.  For a cell phone, smart phone, or GPS unit, this is ample support.The cradle that holds your electronics expands with a button, the wings of the cradle have a rubbery cushion that grips and protects your item in the holder.  The unit appears to be designed to hold your device with the power cable at the bottom.  The bottom of the cradle has a small slot that would allow a power cable to pass through and plug into your device.The cradle swivels and rotates, so you can have your device vertical or horizontal, pointed at the driver or the passenger.For Prius owners, this item works very well with the factory CD player, and keeps your device clear of all radio, AC, and other controls
