Overall really like this product so far.  It is small, compact, self folding and seems to be built well.  Have always bought the cables from Apple, but they all seem to fray eventually near the connector.  This one is metal and I hope lasts a lot longer (and also comes with a "lifetime" warranty.  It is a bit short, but I guess that is what makes it so compact.  (and would be a bit heavy if much longer). Overall very happy with this product.  (price would be better at $19 in my opinion, rather than the $29 that I spent.
