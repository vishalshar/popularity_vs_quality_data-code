I've had the OG Pebble, a Pebble Steel, and a Pebble Time. I've been waiting for the SE to release here on Amazon for awhile now, and in short I like it.Not love, but like. Lets cover the things I'm "meh" about first.The SE is light, light enough that you really don't feel it. This is a blessing and a curse, because the lack of heft makes the SE feel cheap (since we all seem hardwired to associate weight with value). Not cheap like the original Pebble, with it's thick and shiny plastic, but cheap as in lack of heft and substance. The wrist bands support this, they're lighter than even the Pebble Time's default straps this time around. Now most people will replace these quickly, but your out of the box experience is based on these bands so I would have appreciated if they would have stayed the same or kept even the feel of the old ones. The latches are also, you guessed it, lighter and plastic; no more metal like the days of old.The watch buttons are reduced in size by quite a bit, and the entire panel on the side is one piece of rubberized plastic with some indents to help you find the button nubs. They're still tactile, and you can still use them without looking, but there is hardly any button/key travel compared to old (which is both good and bad, the old buttons were easy to find but sometimes too squishy). They do have a really satisfying *click* to them when pressed/activated though, and that audible feedback is nice.The charging port isn't as recessed as before, and the cord doesn't snap to it as snuggly as older watch models, so beware if you have pets or charge in a place where the cord could get hit or pulled.The things I love though, are all things Pebble does well and hasn't really changed since the companies inception. The screen on the SE is the best Pebble screen I've seen/owned yet, and the sunlight readability is still top notch. The notifications and vibration patterns are still quirky and strong, and charge times are relatively short.For the price the SE is in a tough spot as the OG Pebble, the Pebble Steel, and the first gen Pebble Time are all around a similar pricepoint. If you're not in the market for a heart rate sensor on your wrist they all bring various features/levels of build quality to the table, and some will do things better than the SE depending on your needs.If you're on the fence for this one I'd say wait and feel it in stores if possible, or utilize the 30 day return policy here on Amazon. It's not a bad watch, and I like being within the Pebble ecosystem again, but this isn't a large step forward and I feel like the pricepoint supports this.
