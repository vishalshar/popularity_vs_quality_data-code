WOW ! this is the one that I have been waiting for, I have two adult kick scooter's that I use in my travel's to San Francisco and new York that Iride on those big side walk's. But this dolly model 200 is top of the line very thought out well crafted scooter, I can see myself ordering one moreFor my 16 year old Son. This Scooter is a great way to get around when traveling and site seeing along the way, good charging range good powereasy to set up and fold, and great that you can pull the handle out and pull it like a suitcase. all around fantastic travel scooter well worth the money !
