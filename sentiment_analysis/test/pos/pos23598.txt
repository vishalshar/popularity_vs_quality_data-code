Very happy with Oco wifi cloud camera, it is exactly what we needed. The camera is sleek and very well made. Setup was very easy and the quality is very good, great iOS app, push-notification on movement detection, super wide angle view, so each point is covered for monitoring.The overall performance is outstanding. 5+ stars! Highly recommended camera!"
