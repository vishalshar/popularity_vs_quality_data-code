I got five full batches of mushrooms from this kit with virtually no effort before it finally stopped producing. Given the amount of mushrooms produced, the price is very reasonable. My two year old really loved "helping" me out and checking on the progress every day - she even tried them (an incredible feat for a persnickety toddler)!
