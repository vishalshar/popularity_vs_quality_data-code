I originally bought this bulb to kind of act as a night light in my kid's room since it changes colors and stuff, but once I started playing with it I decided to swipe it for my man cave to enhance my movie/sports watching experience.  I will change colors to match whatever I'm watching. Burnt orange for Longhorn sports, green for the Masters, etc...  I watched Sin City again the other day and set the room to have a red glow and it was sweet. Easy to use with lots of features.  No problems so far, and it's way cooler than what I was expecting. I'm going to buy 2 more for my man cave and 1 for my kid's room.
