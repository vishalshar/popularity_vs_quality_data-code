This phone surpassed expectations.  One of the nicest android phones I have ever tested.  Software is well integrated and the phone starts up with beautiful, uncluttered home pages.  It wirked flawlessly in back to back set up with okd Nexus. The only improvement I would like to see is to the camera software.  It beeds to focus more rapidly.
