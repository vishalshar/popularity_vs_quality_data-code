This is the first day of using this bottle, so I'll come back later to give a long-term update.But come on, this idea is so simple yet so brilliant! It's one of those items that you think, "how is it possible this was never done before?" I unscrewed the top and bottom and gave both of them a good washing along with the inside of the bottle. It was all easy to do with just a regular kitchen sponge. I did not remove the silicone rings in the top and bottom pieces to do the washing. Screwed the bottom back on and dried off the outside of the bottle so I could watch for any signs of leaks or moisture accumulation. Filled up the bottle with cold water. Not a bit of a problem -- no appearance of leaks or moisture on the BPA-free bottle.One thing I don't like: the top. I'm currently using mine at the office, so a sports-bottle nipple top isn't all that practical. Sure, it works, but who wants to be sucking on that when you're in your work clothes around co-workers? I wish there was a version which had gulp opening instead of the nipple. This does not detract from the quality of the product, however, so I give it five stars without reserve. I only mention it in my review of the product because if you hadn't thought of that when shopping for a new water bottle, you can decide if that is important to you.
