Completely blown away by this little item. From its awesome price compared to other blue tooth speakers, to its sound quaility, to the fact that its water and sand resistant (no more worrying about rain or an occasional drink spilt on or around.Also this thing can bump. I put it into my cabinet in the kitchen and the passive bass sounds great. My friend has an old keg bucket and he places the same speaker into it, genius.Anyway, I would safetly reccomend this to anyone looking for an robust sounding speaker at a great price. It has all the features and none of the issues (so far). Get it, and get it right now.
