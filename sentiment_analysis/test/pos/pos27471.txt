I purchased this for my husband who is legally blind to help him tune his guitars.  It took some time messing with the controls and looking at the tutorial on the Roadie website to get it going.  Once we got going, I don't know which one of us was happier.  What an amazing little invention, where do I start to sing my Praises.1. You can add multiple guitars to the app.  Name each one and calibrate it.2.  Hold on to your Roadie, once he starts tuning, he twists and turns.3.  This is not a long process to calibrate it. Once it beeps, you are done and can move on to the next guitar.4.  The app lets you save info about the guitar, like when it was restrung last and keeps track of their condition.  (With 8 guitars in the house, its going to pay for itself in strings)We did have trouble with the cord to hook it into your phone for electric guitars.  I am not sure if we have a fluke, if it was the phone, or operator error.  However, it was very easy for him to just put the phone on his knee, pluck, and listen for the beep.  Just in case the Roadie people read this, the only thing I would change, is the ability to adjust the font on the app.  I am so pleased with how easy it is and my hubs is tickled pink, since he has so much trouble reading other tuners.
