Short version: this is great!The full story: I bought this (all 3) as a gift for a very special 6 year old.The company did not give me anything for free and I know no one in it.  This is a legit/true blue review.These are not inexpensive but that is because the quality is superb.  Solidly crafted pieces that work and looks like they will last a long long time.  Somewhere there is a review about bad magnets, but mine were great and the structures were very solid.  The little people are thick and wooden.  You are paying for a toy that could easily go through multiple users.The story boards/walls are fun and imaginative and truly draw you in - lots of fun details, including moving parts.  Someone put real thought into this. All this on top of how great it is for imagination and modeling useful life skills and basic physics and and and all the other good stuff the mommy blogs rave about - all that too. This is just a great toy.  The kind they used to sell in real toy stores - meant to be loved and to last.  Remember real Tonka trucks?  Like that.I am always on the look for the perfect gift for this kid and I am proud to give this one.
