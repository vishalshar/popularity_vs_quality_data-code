It's a great sampler the only thing i'd say though is if you're planning on doing flavored popcorn big you may just want to get the fullsize pack of assortedflavors as each mini jar is basically used up on a bag of popcorn. If you're using an air popcorn maker then you're going to need to spritz it with water or some sort of oil etc to make the powder stick to the kernals. So make sure you use a big paper safeway bag to mix it. The flavors that contain cayenne are a pain to deal with mainly because you cannot get the popcorn moist enough to attach all that powder so with each bite you want to sneeze. Some of the flavors are quite a bit better than others some are just fillers to give the impression of choice. The kettle corn tastes sweet and that's pretty much it. The garlic parmesian, bacon cheddar, and white cheddar. The white cheddar is basically storebought quality so definately worth it. The sweet flavors leave much to be desired.
