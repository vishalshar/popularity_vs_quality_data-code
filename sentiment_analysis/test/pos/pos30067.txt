My young Minecraft playing son and his buddy started bugging me to let them grow mushrooms.  (Must have something to do with Minecraft, but I'm too old to know for sure - LOL!)  Since: 1. Mom didn't want a compost heap in her kitchen and 2. Neither of us wanted them growing "mushrooms"  (or whatever) without knowing exactly WHAT what growing, I ordered a kit for each of them.I'd ordered one of these a couple of years ago for him and while that one worked OK, this time around it's been GREAT!  Our first big crop came in in about 6 days.  (His buddy is not faring as well.  She didn't soak the package enough initially, but we'll get her back on track.)  Just remember to soak thoroughly, mist early, mist often, and use the entire mister bottle each time and you'll turn out very tasty 'shrooms in just a couple of days.
