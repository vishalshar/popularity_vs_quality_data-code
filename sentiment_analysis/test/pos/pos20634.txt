Does exactly as advertised and more a very impressive piece of tech . It takes a little bit of work to get used to teaching it your own  exercises- typically I've found 3 teaching sessions with varied reps per exercise for it to recognise the movement accurately but now I don't train without it! Like how you can put your whole workout into it then record your weight and rep progressions and it's all saved in the app to be viewed afterwards and have found the heartrate sensor to be much more accurate for strength training than my fitbit surge which I now take off when I'm doing either weight training or bodyweight training and use atlas in its place.. Between the 2 devices I'm able to accurately monitor my calories burned to set my nutrition for either Bulking cutting and maintenance as required.  The best feature with Atlas which nothing else out there does is record your training sessions at the gym and excellent tool and The atlas team are very helpful with any questions or issues you have too always responding to my emails promptly . Highly recommend this product
