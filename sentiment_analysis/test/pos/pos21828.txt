Easy to install. Occasional issues if door isn't completely closed when lock tries to close (The deadbolt tries to throw, but is blocked. Gets into a weird partially closed state where you need to twist it manually). If door is left open, deadbolt will throw, which sometimes surprises next person trying to close door (i.e. deadbolt hits door frame if they don't notice). Unit looks a bit bulky on our door.For normal states (unlock, enter, close door, or reverse) works well. Nice to not need key.
