After a bit of constant use the adapter will get hot. Although the functionality of the device certainly makes up for that. It has a lot of useful ports and I see it as an extension to the computer itself. I have worries that if I'm not careful I will bend or break the socket but nothing has happened to cause these worries. All round great product and very happy I purchased it
