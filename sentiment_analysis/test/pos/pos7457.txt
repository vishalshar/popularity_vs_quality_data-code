(FYI, the micro SD flash memory card was originally called a TransFlash or TF card. Some device manufacturers still use this nomenclature.)  Then I inserted the 1450mAh battery and popped the back cover into place. Before using the phone, I charged the battery with the included 5V/0.75V AC adapter, then turned on the phone. Connecting to my home wi-fi was very quick. The phone came with about three dozen preinstalled apps, and I downloaded and installed about a dozen more apps.The phone came with Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) installed. One of the things I love about Android is that when I signed into my Google account, my phone contacts and Chrome bookmarks synced and were available immediately. The phone uses most of the Android conventions, such as the power/volume down buttons to take a screenshot.The screen display is 800x480 (240 dpi). That's much lower resolution than the top-of-the-line smartphones on the market today, but as a practical matter, I watched some sports and a few videos, and the images were pretty good, although the viewing angle is critical, as I demonstrated in the accompanying video.With a 1450mAh battery powering the dual core processor and the 4-inch (diagonal) display, I wondered about the battery life. I tested the battery by streaming full-screen video with sound on (low volume), and the battery lasted for 3:55. For typical mixed use of phone calls, web browsing, reading, music, and apps, I expect that the battery will last much longer than that. After draining the battery, I used the included AC charger to recharge the phone, which took about three hours.The audio from the single speaker on the front of the phone isn't high fidelity by any means, but it's not too bad either. With no background noise, the maximum volume is satisfactory, but as with some phones and small tablets that I've used, you may want to have an auxiliary speaker handy if the ambient noise is high. A set of earphones is included with the phone; the earphone cable has a microphone that can be used for hands-free phone calls.The phone has Bluetooth connectivity. The phone paired easily and worked well with a Bluetooth keyboard. For non-Bluetooth speakers and headphones, the phone has a 3.5mm audio jack.The phone has front and rear cameras. The rear camera is 4.9 MP (2560x1920), with the front camera having 1.2 MP (1280x960). The rear camera has an LED flash that can be turned on, turned off, or set to automatic. The cameras have a limited set of camera controls, including autofocus and a 4X manual zoom. The camera also shoots 640x480 video, and you can zoom in or out while shooting. Overall, he cameras are just so-so.As I mentioned, I put a micro-SIM into one of the two SIM slots. It was a prepaid SIM from a service that used T-Mobile in our area. I made and received a few phone calls. I also sent and received some text messages. The call quality was excellent. I did not purchase a data plan.After I inserted the 8 GB micro SD card in a slot inside the phone, I used the phone settings to make the SD card the default for writing. The phone has 4GB of internal storage memory, and after you account for the operating system and the preinstalled apps, you're not left with a lot of available memory - about 2.3 gigabytes - so don't count on installing hundreds of apps. The micro SD cards are so inexpensive now that it just makes good sense to use one if you want to store a lot of books, music, videos, and apps on the phone. (Note that not all apps can be stored on a memory card.)I connected the phone to my PC with the included USB charging cable, and it appeared in Windows Explorer as a USB mass storage device (as did the micro-SD card in the phone). That enables you to drag and drop files between the PC and the phone.I used the Antutu Benchmark app to see how the phone compared to other Android phones, and it scored 7345. That's pretty low compared to top-of-the-line phones of today (which score over 100,000), but it's in the range of what Antutu calls "cost effective." Frankly, I'm not geeky enough to discuss the merits of the phone's 32-bit dual core 1.0 GHz CPU, but subjectively, the phone appears in most respects to be fairly responsive.The phone comes as part of a complete package which includes an AC power adapter and charging cable, a set of earphones with built-in microphone, a screen protector, and a silicone case that gives a good gripping surface and provides a decent amount of protection for the phone.Who would buy the Kick Lite S410? It would make a nice second phone for a grown-up, or an inexpensive phone for a child. It does virtually everything a more expensive phone does, only a bit slower. With a 4-inch display and weighing only 4.3 ounces, the phone slips easily in a shirt pocket, and the small size is easy to get a good grip on.The phone was provided to me for evaluation. I did not promise to post a review, but I stated that if I did review the product, it would be an honest, unbiased review.
