The dice themselves are pretty good... if your eyesight is good and you're familiar with their quirks.  When I say "quirks", I mean that the '6' and the '9' can be difficult to tell apart on the 12 sided die.  On the 20 sided, it's not that tough since the sides are triangular and there's a dot under both the 6 and the 9.  On the 10-sided, again, the sides are not symmetrical so it's pretty easy to tell when it's a 6 and it's a 9.The 12-sided, however, has pentagonal sides and when I rolled them for the first time and got a 6, I actually had to pick the die up and see what was on the other side ('7') to be certain it was, in fact, a 6.  If you look closer, there are some obvious differences.  (One, the pattern around the numbers is not perfectly symmetrical and the 9 has a period behind it.)So once you're familar with these quirks, they're perfectly serviceable dice.
