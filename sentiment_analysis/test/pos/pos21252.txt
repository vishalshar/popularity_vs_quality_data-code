The Turtle Shell has met every expectation. I like its portability. The battery lasts a long time. It was easy to set up. I take it on my deck, hook up my iPod nano and listen while I'm reading. The sound is quite good coming from such a small package. High, mid and low ranges all come through acceptably, no complaints. Very pleased.
