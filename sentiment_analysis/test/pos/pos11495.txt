Fit way better than I thought. When my package is in the pouch you can't even tell. (In a good way) I was afraid you would be able to feel the fabric and it be annoying but you can't. I don't even notice them an rarely have to adjust. The legs do ride up a little but I've never found a pair that doesn't.
