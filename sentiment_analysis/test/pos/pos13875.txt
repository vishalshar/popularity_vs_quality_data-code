I bought the 54" X 30" for my boyfriend as a gift, since he's an entrepreneur. He's has been dying for something like this, always wants to write ideas everywhere when they pop into his head! He just installed it in his room and loves it! Right next to his desk and perfect for him. The only trouble was getting it on the wall, took a little more effort, since we placed it horizontally.Also there are little bumps in his since his wall is a little worn.... other than that, just have to make sure to clean the wall before you use it and it works like a charm!
