Purchased for seven year old daughters birthday and it was a huge hit and absolutely amazing. All you have to do is place gaming system on your iPad and download app and you are ready to go. The markers that come with the item does have to be pressed down in order for the color to release to the marker tips. The set has three different drawing activities to choose from. The monster activity is a huge hit for little kids and being able to see their very own drawings on the screen is mind-blowing for them. In the master piece activity which is our favorite is full of hundreds of pictures to create and you can even upload your very own. Your drawings are also being recorded and at the very end you can watch how you created the drawing in a fast forward style playback. Getting use to tracing a drawing is a bit tricky starting out but once you get started you don't want to stop.
