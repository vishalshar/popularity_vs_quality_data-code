I love this headset. I've had it for a little over a month now and it's got a great feel, it's sturdy, sounds amazing, and the charge lasts a really long time. One of my favorite things about it is the simple control scheme. Instead of those clumsy buttons on the ear cups or a little control box on a wire, you just simple tap the left or right ear cup to mute certain audio, and turn them to adjust volume for voice or game. It's super simple and easy to do while it's on your head. The only issue i have had is the microphone monitoring is spotty. If you speak loud enough it feels like the microphone relays the sound kind of jagged. Luckily it doesn't represent what it sounds like to whoever you're speaking to so it's not a huge issue. Aside from that, this is a great product. I'm keeping my eye on this brand because it's already put Turtle beach to shame in terms of build quality.Keep innovating LucidSound.
