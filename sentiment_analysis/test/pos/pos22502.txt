I bought this for my kids for Christmas. But being a man child I opened it as soon as they went to bed to 'test it out'.Now I find myself taking it to my friends place to show them over a few beers, and now they've bought there own cars!So in all likelihood I'll be buying another starter kit for myself.I've had minimal issues. At my friends place with his old router, syncing was a little glitchy, but at my place it was seamless.Cars will occasionally leave the track but half the time they'll find their way back on their own. Cars seemed go faster and leave the track a little more on a tile floor.It's the same with a collision sometimes.Your car will briefly head in the opposite direction.I'm pretty competitive, but even I know that's all part of it. Rubbings racing!The weapon upgrades in app are great, and make even the slowest car competitive if used well.The one thing to note is if you set up on carpet check the wheel axles after the race to make sure no hairs have wrapped around an axle.It happened to me but was easily remedied with tweezers and a pin.If you haven't bought this yet, what the hell are you waiting for! It's awesome! I can't wait to see my kids crap their collective pants when they unwrap it Christmas Day!
