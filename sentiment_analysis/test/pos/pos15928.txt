I really like the look that I get with my hair after using this blowout brush system. It's really nice to not have to put your hair dryer down turn it off roll up your curls and clip them and then go back to using a round brush Being able to unhook the rollers from the handle of the brush is very convenient. I did take away one start because finding the actual button on the hand brush is sometimes difficult depending on where my hands are and how I roll the brush up The only real way to feel it is find the indentations on the side of the button, but once you find it the brush does detach very easily from the handle. I also recommend anyone with hair longer than your shoulders to purchase the additional  barrels that you can buy. The images show that you use three on the top portion of your hair and then one on each side for the lower portion of your hair I have hair that's about the length of my shoulder blades and I definitely needed more than two barrels for the lower half of my hair. I did also choose the medium  even though I have longer hair because my hair tends to fall flat easier and I think that the smaller barrels give me more volume
