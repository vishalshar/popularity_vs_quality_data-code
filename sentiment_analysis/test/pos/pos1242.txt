I love this product, it has become a staple in my beauty routine that I will repurchase after I finish it.  It is definitely not a mascara (you won't see increased volume/length upon first use).  As a tint though, it provides great definition both in terms of color and in terms of lash separation.  I have fairly lengthy lashes to being with, but I can definitely notice less lash fallout when I remove my makeup at night and more consistency in my lash growth overall.I usually use this as a primer under my mascara (I do one eye at a time because I feel that this method of layering mascara on top of the tint/masque while it is still wet works best).  Additionally, on weekends or light-makeup days, I'll just curl my lashes and apply only this.Not that it should really persuade me about a product, but I also really love the quality metal packaging.Really like this product.
