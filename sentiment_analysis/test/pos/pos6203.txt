*****This fruit sample box is absolutely incredible. All of the snacks are 100% certified organic, baked with no added sugar, no preservatives or chemicals, no pesticides or herbicides, and are gluten free. Each one is a truly healthy and delicious snack. The assortment contains:(1) 3 large bags of crispy apple chips: the Fuji chips are sweet and crispy, the Granny Smith chips are tart and crispy, and the Apple Cinnamon are addictive and super-sweet.(2) 4 small bags of chewy snacks: cherries, D'Anjou pears (very fibrous but sweet--my favorite), mango (incredibly sweet and good), and apricot (very dry and almost impossibly hard to chew)Even though I wasn't crazy about the apricots, they still weren't terrible. All of the others were tasty as can be, and will last a lot longer for me than fresh fruit, since it seems to always go bad before I can get to it. The chewy snacks can contain the occasional pit, seed, core or stem, but in my opinion, there aren't too many--it's just important to be careful.All of these snacks are tasty and healthy and certified organic, so you can feel good about eating them.Highly recommended.*****
