This is not really a product, but an experience...From the initial presentation - the moment you open the beautifully designed packaging - you feel this is not your typical gadget. Everything is well thought out, conceived, proportioned, formally connected and well designed. The tracker itself is elegant and simple, a totally smooth ceramic disc. I gave this to my wife and she instantly loved its jewel-like simplicity and the fact that it didn't look like a 'tracker'. Yea, it looked great, but the real test was if it worked. The set up could not have been simpler, the instructions were minimal and easy to follow and she was up and running - literally in 5 mins. After her 'test drive' - or run - we checked the app and It worked flawlessly the app is super straightforward - also beautifully designed and intuitive. Could not recommend this enough. The design awards it received are legit, but even more so, it works great. Thank you!
