I'm having fun with this new phone from Great Call - after calling them up and swapping my number, information and plan settings it's all fun and games (no pun intended). If you buy one and are not an existing customer, activation should go easily and you'll get a new number. Just remember, ask how to turn off cellular data until you learn how the data part works or you'll built up one he*@# of a bill because their plans are for seniors and don't include a lot of data in any of their plans; you should be connected to Wi-Fi all the time or your data package will be eaten up.
