I bought this for the swim tracking.  It does that very well.  Sometimes, the lap counter can be off by 1, but it tracks the speed, turns, and strokes.  Strange thing, though, even though I'm swimming freestyle, it thinks I'm doing the backstroke. All, the time!Other than that, it's a really good fitness tracker.
