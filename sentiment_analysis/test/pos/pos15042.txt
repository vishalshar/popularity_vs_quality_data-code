I like the orbitkey- but I LOVE that I have a bottle opener that both works (on every bottle I've tried it!) and does not constantly stab me when I sit or bend to pick something up! Great idea - if you are going to carry the orbitkey it's a must have (they should bundle it, imho). :) You could use it without the orbitkey (just on a key-ring) but you would lose the doesn't stab you part- although it is still less cumbersome than many pocket bottle openers and it works.
