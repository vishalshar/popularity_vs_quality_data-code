Purchased for my daughter who I swear was a Viking in a past life.  She loved the horn, BUT stupid me, I though the silver rim around the top was actually a lid.  She really needs a lid when she is out exploring.... so we are hoping to find a cork of some sort at the hardware store. It obviously, also requires the stand to be upright.  Another obvious thing I missed when considering this for my daughter!
