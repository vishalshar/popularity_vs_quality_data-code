I first gave this phone a 2 star.  after taking it to Cricket and after 45 minutes getting the correct setting and putting everything together. I now could give it five star. biggest [problem still is the pallet must be rewritten so we buyers could read what to do and where everything is. I also might add they need to make the features and illustration more better and show all the features. I like to say that the tool that you get looks like a paperclip is for the whole on the left side. You put it into the little pin whole and then add your SIM card. It takes two SIM if you need it,You can also use the second slot for a SD card. I put a 32 gig in the second slot. the phone dumbs everything into the SD card. it is good gives you a lot of extra gigs. This phone is very fast the internet is great. it will switch to 4G + HP when on a call. it is still fast, can do many thing fast. This is a fast very responsible phone. I returned my first Posh L530. It erased my Contact list. This one does not do that so far.If you buy this POSH PHONE. TAKE IT TO YOUR CELL PROVIDER AND LET THEM SET YHE PHONE UP FOR YOU. TO DO IT YOURSELF IT WILL NOT WORK RIGHT.  Found that out
