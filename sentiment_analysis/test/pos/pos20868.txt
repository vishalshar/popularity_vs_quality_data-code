These were bought for my grandson with Aspergers. It took him a couple of months to worm up to the idea but after seeing his brother and sister wearing their colorful ones (mine were too small), he tried them. Now these are the only shoes he wants to wear! He said they are comfortable, they don't slip up and down, and he doesn't get told all day to lace his shoes. Now I need to find a pair big enough for his hiking boots and we're really rocking!
