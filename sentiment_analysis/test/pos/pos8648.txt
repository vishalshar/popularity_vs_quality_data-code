I LOVE having a charger on me at all times. With working full time and being a full time student having a reliable charger on me at all times can be a life saver. It is bigger than it looks in pictures but I really haven't had an issue at all with it's size, you have to think it does have a USB stick end on it so it is going to be larger than your everyday basic carabiner. The other reviews I saw mentioning the size had me very apprehensive about buying this product but as I stated it really is no issue at all. Keys go all the way around it because of the larger USB end but I kind of like that too. It is a fantastic product and I am very satisfied with my purchase.
