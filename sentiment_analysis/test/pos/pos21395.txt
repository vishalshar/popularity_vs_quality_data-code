I have not had this very long, but so far it is great. I travel with my dog in an RV, and with this on her collar I can set a geo-fence when I get to a location, and if she gets out of the coach and away from me, as soon as she gets more than about 100 feet from the RV she will break the geo-fense and the system will send me an alert on my phone. Very handy. It can also help me track her down if she got way by showing me where she is on a map. Well worth the cost in my book. The peace of mind and safety for my doggy while on the road is great.
