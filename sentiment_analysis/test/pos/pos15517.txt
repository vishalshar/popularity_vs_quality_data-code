Great USDA approved school snack! They sell very well at both my private and public school vending machines. Also, they're so affordable for the students and taste as good as the traditional brands that the are now the only pre-packaged mini cookies I vend. The graham and variety packs are great alternative offerings as well  (the shortbread and double chocolate deserve a 36-pack of their own, Skeeter :) ).Thanks for a great product!
