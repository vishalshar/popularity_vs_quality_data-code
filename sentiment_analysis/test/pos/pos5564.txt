I am not a professional, but I did buy this to try and did find that my cheese lasts longer when wrapped in the cheese paper. I did not know this product existed until I ordered specialty cheeses from a place in New York, and they recommended the use of the Formaticum Cheese Paper to help the cheese last longer. I would recommend the product.
