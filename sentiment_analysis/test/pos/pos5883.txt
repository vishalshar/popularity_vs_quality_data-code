I have been using the lavender paste for two weeks and I love it. Before using I read on their site that there will be an adjustment/detox period when switching from regular aluminum deodorant. I highly recommend reading up on this before using to avoid getting a rash like some of these reviewers. Personally, I just used coconut oil on my pits for a few days then applied the paste every other day to get used to it. I still apply coconut oil after shaving before applying paste because it does give me a burning sensation for a minute. I feel like this paste works better than the clinical strength Secret I was using before. At the end of the day it still smells nice.
