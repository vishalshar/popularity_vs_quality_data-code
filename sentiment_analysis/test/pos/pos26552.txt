I've had this power strip for about 3 weeks now and so far so good. I use it to control the power on my TV and a space heater. I have it connected using Wink and I also control it with my Echo, through IFTTT. Quirky has gone bankrupt and is no longer supporting the power strip so you have to use IFTTT to use your power strip through the Echo.A couple notes about connecting your power strip to Wink:1) Make sure you use an iPhone or iPad to connect. An android device, that I could find, would not work. Must have something to do with white balance or something.2) Hold the iPad or iPhone directly to the house icon when pairing. Not above it. Directly on it like you're trying to make a seal. Even give it a little pressure.3) VERY IMPORTANT: Turn off Auto Brightness and turn the brightness of your screen up all the way.Follow those instructions and you should be good!
