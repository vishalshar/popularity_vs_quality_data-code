Paired with a hat that also has horns, you'll be the life of all the Nordic parties!Similarly to other drinking vessels I have reviewed, this has an open top which accepts liquids and a closed bottom to help prevent said liquid from escaping.  The system breaks down when inverted, unless your face is beneath to accept the lost liquid.Highly recommended!
