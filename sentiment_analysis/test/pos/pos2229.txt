Succinctly, the product, once you get through the unnecessarily arduous hoop of setting it up, works as promised. If they could actually send a single sheet of paper telling the consumer what the actual internet/LAN connectivity instructions are, this product would be super simple to set up but their instructions sent me into a ditch quickly and when I called support they said that, yes, their instructions are wrong. Is it worth the additional headache to call to have them walk you through the set up? Yes. Step 1: If you get one, go ahead and just find the contact number for support and call them because the instructions are flat-out wrong, at least in the box I received, and I was quickly able to talk to a real person, and he was very helpful. The printed instructions say to use the bridge in step 2. You donÂ’t need this if you have wireless access in your home, which most of us do, and only if you are needing Homeplug or Ethernet connectivity. It is much easier to go through pairing the blossom controller next to your wireless access point, in my case a provider wireless/gateway combo, and then you are off to the races. So, call them. The guy on the phone said he wishes everyone would just call first. Replacing your old equipment is easy. I replaced an almost 20 year-old system with it without any problems. The web interface is easy to understand and my lawn already is looking better.
