It's pretty good!  It took me awhile to get the relay worked out so I can keep an eye on the temperature when I'm away from my house.  And I have to restart the app each time I want to check the temperature from my phone when I'm outside the bluetooth range.  Customer service was also pretty slow to respond to my questions.  But for $30, that's OK. I imagine the technology will get better over time, which it should.
