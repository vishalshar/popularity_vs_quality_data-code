I bought cozmo for my 8 year old. Cozmo is very fun to play with. Like other reviews, it can get boring after a little bit. If the developers stay up on him and keep the updates coming and if they follow through on having multiple cosmos being able to communicate with each other and interact, than the sky is the limit for this. I know some complain about cozmo using wifi instead of Bluetooth but I personally believe Bluetooth would severely limit the developers ability to grow cozmo. I also think the distance limitations of Bluetooth would hold cozmo back. I would recommend buying him and keep in mind that this company will continue to grow cozmo.
