1. We live near Los Angeles and we have high water and electrical rates.  We were able to save about $20/month on the electrical bill by finding hot spots.  A computer terminal was set for high performance and not efficient operation.  It glowed bright red on the viewer.  This was easily fixed.  I also found a hot spot under the TV where CDs had been piled on top of the cable box, blocking the air flow and causing it to operate at 120 degrees F.  I also found a cell phone charger that was hot even when not is use and unplugged it.2. We are on water rationing with stiff penalties for over use.  I found two water leaks where the grass was too cold.3. When cooking a number of steaks on a propane grill, I noticed that one steak, which had been put on last, was the hottest.  It was done.  The thermal camera saved it from over-cooking.
