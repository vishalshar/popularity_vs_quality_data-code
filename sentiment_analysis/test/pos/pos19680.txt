I picked up the Bluesmart before heading on a business trip stretching over a long weekend. I got sick of having to lug around a portable battery pack with me, so having the ability to charge from the suitcase itself was a nice plus. And the other features come in handy, too.Size-wise, I found that I could pack comfortably for a few days. And I pack light, so I probably could use this for a four or five day trip, but any longer than that, and you'd probably need to bring a larger suitcase along with it. The suitcase feels sturdy. That's a bit of peace of mind, as I'm usually packing a camera and it's nice to know the bag could take a knock or two.The security features - being able to lock from your phone and locate via GPS - are handy, too. I'm always pissed off whenever my bag gets gate checked at the last minute, especially with expensive stuff locked inside. Having the ability to locate the bag if something goes wrong actually does a lot to remove the stress out of these situations. And flying United, your bag is going to be bag checked eventually.The corresponding app on the iPhone is super easy to use. My parents could immediately figure it out, too, which is a good sign.If you're a business traveler or someone who occasionally has to transport pricier electronics or stuff, I highly recommend the Bluesmart bag. It's a good combination of features and price, and it's worth it to remove some of the stress of traveling.
