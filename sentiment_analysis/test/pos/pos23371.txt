Great body wipes. On days I meet with clients, I spend the whole day going location to location away from the comfort of an air conditioned office. I sweat a lot and like to freshen up before a meeting. These wipes have a pleasant scent that isn't overwhelming and is much more effective in addressing any mild body funk than spraying cologne on midday. One wipe is large enough and wet enough to thoroughly take care of my entire upper body and recommend continuously folding the cloth to use a clean side to get best results. Unlike other wipes I've tried, these do not leave a sticky feeling after and my skin actually feels refreshed. These wipes are individually wrapped and so convenient to take with me. I keep a couple in my work bag and a few in the car which work perfectly after an afternoon at the beach to get the beach smell off before going to eat somewhere. I even put a few in with my camping gear. I completely recommend these. I have a long (90 min) bike commute to an office with no shower. By the time I get to work I'm usually pretty grimy in addition to sweaty. One towel takes care of my 6'2" /175# frame from head to toe with a bit to spare. The smell (on me right now) is very neutral "clean" rather than perfumed.
