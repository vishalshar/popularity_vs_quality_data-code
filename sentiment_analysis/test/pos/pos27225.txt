Great. I bought it for my 18 year old daughter who has an iPhone 6. She had it working in about 5 minutes. You have to download the app to your phone, then just plug and play. The app lets you change the sound (guitar, ukulele, etc.) Came with picks and a strap.The strings and frets feel pretty real. However, your picking hand will be a lot closer to your left hand than for a real guitar. If you break a string I think you have to order a replacement from the company.
