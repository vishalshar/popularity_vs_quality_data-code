This is an incredibley entertaining product, but there's a lot of room for improvement. It is hard to get used to, or to make something that actually looks like what you are going for. The plastic hardens very quickly which is great, because it lets you draw upwards. The flow rate of the plastic needs some minor tweaking though. Sometimes it comes out swirling, so you have to press down harder on your surface to make it stop. After some practice and different techniques with varying pressure, I started to make things other than swirly blobs of plastic! I wrote my name, and built a little house! I found it very challenging to make clean lines with the 3Doodler, so my masterpieces weren't very "appealing to the eyes". While it is very fun and entertaining, I don't think I would consider this a toy for kids. At least not younger kids. It is basically a hot glue gun but with plastic instead of glue. The tip of it gets very hot as well as the plastic that comes out. It comes with 50 plastic sticks which was a lot more than I expected! The sticks are different colors and there are 5 sticks of each color. The 3Doodler feels good in my hand, not too bulky or heavy. There is a fast button and a slow button so you can control the flow rate a little better. Press once to turn it on press it again to stop your flow, you have to do this a lot while making something. It contains a layout/blueprint  of a "desktop catapult" that you can trace over then fill in to actually make it. There is only one design layout though, I was really disappointed that there weren't more things to trace, because that helped me a lot. Overall I think the 3Doodler is a really wonderful idea, but still has a few things to improve on. It's got a lot of potential and if you practice with it a lot im sure you can make some really awesome things!
