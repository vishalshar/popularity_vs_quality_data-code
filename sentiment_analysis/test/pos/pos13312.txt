It's a really stylish watch, plastic straps doesn't bother me since I don't like wearing leather.I have heard only compliments about it, but technical features are supposed to work better in my opinion. You don't get the quality feeling if you focus on only the technical aspects of the device. The three tap feature has embarrassed me more than it should.
