* Update I got in touch with a lucidsound rep and I found the reason why my headphones had no bass. I initially thought that the chat audio option didn't work but it turned out I didn't have the game volume up enough to hear it. Since we fixed this the sound is unbelievable!I'm giving these a 3 because there is no bass! I've read the instructions to the letter and the sound is just not that impressive to me. Personally I think the LS20s are much better.
