I'm not that great at writing detailed tech reviews but wanted to throw in my 2 cents about the Mionix Castor.  I've been buying gaming mice for years and have owned Black Adders, a Mamba, and most recently a Logitech G502 (just to name a few).I bought the Castor because it looked liked a darn comfortable mouse.  I will tell you flat out - this is the most comfortable mouse I have ever laid my paws on.  The contours fit my medium sized hand so well that after 5 minutes, going back and gripping my G502 (which has been my primary for the past year) felt COMPLETELY foreign and awkward.Everything is perfect here in my opinion:1. Premium build quality - (all of the materials feel great especially the thumb rest)2. Superior ergonomics3. Ideal weight3. Light and unobtrusive config application (compared to the bloat Razer and Logitech force upon us)4. Tons of customization options.I've already ordered a 2nd Castor for my office.
