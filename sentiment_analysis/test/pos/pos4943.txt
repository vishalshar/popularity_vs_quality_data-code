I gave this 4 stars because the designers must not ride bikes with aero bars. Had they tested it out they would have found that the blue push tab was too wide. As seen in my photo it fits...but only because I used a band saw to trim off a 1/4". Also worth noting is that if you have aero bars, the extension mount will be required. The standard stem mount is not tall enough to allow the 45 deg phone rotation required for mounting and unmounting. In both cases of mounts...the stem and the bar extension...quad lock folks need to permit a tall or short mount hub...tall ...which allows the phone to mount about 1/2" higher than the standard mount. I will be painting the tab black which will make the entire system almost unnoticable. Otherwise it's an extremely solid mount, clean/slim/lightweight.  The other option is to redesign the quadlock system so you don't have to rotate the phone, a simple lip with tab up front would suffice...still keeping the quad feature.Better than other mounts I've seen though. I'll also add that the stem mount system is designed for curved surfaces...if you have a flat stem you're going to need the extension mount. This could have been fixed by quadlock as well by offering two mounting systems, one flat or one curved, or offered a spacer to fill the gap of the cuved mount when applied to a flat stem.5 stars for normal bars, 3 for aero bar application...avg is 4
