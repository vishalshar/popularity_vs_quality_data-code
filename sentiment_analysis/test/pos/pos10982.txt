My vet asked for a urine sample from our cat and sent us away with a small container of white, plastic 'litter' to help us get it.  Our cat was smarter than that.  I tried it with the litter, without the litter, with a plastic bag and the litter and just with the plastic bags.  He was determined not to cooperate.  I called the vet to ask advice and was told to just keep trying.  It was almost two weeks now and I was keen to have him diagnosed, so, as a last resort, I purchased Kit4Cat. I took one of our smaller litter boxes and filled it with the sand.  I know some reviewers have criticized the small size of the bag, but it was more than sufficient for us and we had a nice layer of sand.  I checked the next morning and yes, we had our sample!  I used the pipette to get the urine in the container.  The sample was more than enough for our vet to test and make a diagnosis.As many reviewers have mentioned, the bag comes with a pipette and a vial for the sample.  I didn't use the vial (it was quite small), but I used the pipette.  I would appreciate a larger pipette, as it took a while to get urine into the container we had.The sand is quite costly and I would use it again as a last resort.  It is a shame that you cannot reuse it.  I have seen several other reviewers mention that you can, but I'm unsure how this would be done.Overall, the sand is expensive and you don't get a lot, but it worked for our cat, so I recommend it.
