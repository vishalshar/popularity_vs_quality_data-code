I've had this case for 9 months and it still looks brand new. I originally ordered the grey/orange striped case but there was some pilling on the pocket when it arrived so I sent it back. I only wear jeans and this stays in my back pocket when I'm out and about. I decided not to keep cards in it but did put a folded piece of paper inside the pocket with my contact info (and my spouse's info!) in case it gets lost. It would hold several cards but I don't carry a purse so the number of cards I need to have on me goes beyond what this can handle. There has been no pilling of the pocket and the access points all line up well. The "buttons" are perfect and feel very natural to the phone. It seemed a bit pricey at the time, but I've been really pleased with this purchase and I will get another jimmyCASE when it's time to upgrade my phone.
