Our family is ADDICTED!!! I swear we have to order this 3-pack at least once a month. We love the mission of Good Spread and that their ingredients are responsible and sustainable. I even took the singles as part of my fuel for on an 8-stage mountain bike race in Africa.  We are so glad we found this peanut butter. It is a bit more expensive but much higher quality, more natural, and we feel it is 100% worth it! We will be customers for life.
