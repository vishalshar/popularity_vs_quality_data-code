This is an acquired taste moment... I didn't need to go that route.  My husband cannot stand it. My son cannot stand it.  LoL I don't care! As I find it oddly yummers!  It doesn't taste like mushrooms - hard to describe really.  I drink it mixed with hot water as a "tea" and have at times added a bit of cream to it - Amazing flavor!  I have mixed it into coffee...can't even really tell it's there.  I have blended it into a chocy yogurt shake and, I cannot tell it is in there.  When I just do it with water and no add-in's it will actually give me a sense of calm.  Not that putting it in anything else jacks me up...but I feel a nice calm time settle in from just straight up.  It's just an interesting and glorious product.
