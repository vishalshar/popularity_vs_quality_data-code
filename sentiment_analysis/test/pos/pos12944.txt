This little speaker is very, very impressive. I've waited to write this review for almost a month since I purchased this to put it through its paces and see how it performed. I'll break it into a couple different categories.1.) Durability: This thing is a tank. It's very heavy duty with pretty rugged materials. I have had it dropped, dusty, covered in sand, waves coming over it in the ocean, and a full day of in and out of the river. Not one hiccup in performance or quality.  Pretty impressive and by far the best aspect of this speaker.2.) Battery life: Truth be told, that's what brought me to this speaker and it stays true. I can go a couple weeks of pretty frequent use and not have to charge it.  It does drop when running on full volume and I will cover why that could be a negative in the next section.3.) Sound: The sound quality of this speaker is pretty impressive for all of the other aspects it offers. I will say that it took several hours for the speakers to break in and the sound quality is still improving so don't rush your judgment on initial quali
