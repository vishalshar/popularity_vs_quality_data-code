I don't know if my product was old or just garbage. My sons UA football gloves would be tacky only immediately after applying gripboost. After the gloves dried, they were actually slippery.... Unusable. I tried to clean and dry them first. But got the same results. Returned.Update- Grip Boost contacted me after my negative review. I received a new bottle that seems to work much better. I guess I did get a bad one. They really stand by their product. Thanks Grip Boost
