I've tried all the dried fruit brands and this is by far my favorite.The apples are thinly sliced and crispy.  There is no fake flavoring or junk added to these apple chips.  The coloring is natural and not processed, meaning that some of the chips are darker than others and flawed, yet they all taste consistent.  They actually taste like real apples.It says on the bag that there are five apples inside, which I believe.  If I eat half a bag, I feel fine, but if I eat the entire thing I get a stomach ache from too much.  I know - only eat half a bag!Stays fresh after opening for a few days without any issues.  LOVE these!
