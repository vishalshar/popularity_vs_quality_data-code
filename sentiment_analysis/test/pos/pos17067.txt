Bought this as a Christmas present for my 8yo son. He really loves robots, and so far this toy has him in heaven. The few things you can do with the robot alone isn't all that much. To really have fun with it you need the MiP app. The app requires a smart device with BLE Bluetooth. My phone is the only capable device we own that supports that variety of Bluetooth. I'm impressed with the range of it's Bluetooth transceiver. I can get close to 30' away and still control the robot from my phone.It takes 4 AAA batteries. The battery life is pretty good as long as you keep the robot on a hard flat surface, like the kitchen or dinning room floor. The robot will travel over carpet but it really drains the batteries.
