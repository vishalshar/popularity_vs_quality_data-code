I bought 2 of these for my ceiling fan in my room. Once I got both of them connected, I was definitely pleased. Very bright and nice deep red, blue, and green.Now, the setup was a bit painful. The setup seems to be straight forward and easy to understand. Just launch the app, find the bulb, enter wifi password, and connect. True for the 1st bulb. Went to configure the second bulb, got up until the point when the app connected my phone back to my wifi and waiting for the bulb to be detected. It failed. Then I could try the setup again. Found out I had to "hard reset" the thing by turning it off and on 5 times. Once I did that, I tried again and still no luck. Did that about 5 times and after 5 failed attempts I reset both bulbs and started with the problematic bulb first. Viola! Connected fine. Went to connect the 1st bulb, and got the same error as the 2nd device did earlier. :(I finally found an answer and was able to connect both devices. If you find yourself in the same boat as me, verify the following WiFi settings on your router. Here are the settings.2.4Ghz band, channels 1-11 only (doesn't support 12-14 or 5Ghz band)Increase your DHCP Lease Time
