Although I was skeptical at first about whether I would use it much, I have used it much more than expected. I now have over 23,000 Narrative shots (albeit I need to trash a few). I have used it in the US, South America, and Central America. The candid nature is spectacular. Very few if any ask what it is. None have objected so far. Some think it is a medical device.Unfortunately, I have stored most photos locally and not used the service. That is because I am usually in a high cost Internet environment or none at all. I wish I could load them locally and then upload the batch when I got home.Reviewing the sequence of shots makes your brain recall things it otherwise couldn't or wouldn't.Thanks for a nifty device. Now to Clip 2
