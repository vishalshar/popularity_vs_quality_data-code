It works as advertised and is very handy for those few times you would need. I only use when I want a quick 10 minute charge, and I believe that is the intended design philosophy, if you are going to attach it to your regular key chain. I would not use it for an extended period since it can be somewhat awkward with a full keychain- it's only an inch long flex after all. Wonderful for what it is.
