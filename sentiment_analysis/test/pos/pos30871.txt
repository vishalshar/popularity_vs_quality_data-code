First, I have a *little* experience with aquariums, definitely not a lot. I do understand a thing or two about growing herbs.  I consider myself a rank amateur.  That said, I love, love, love this thing.  We tried turning an old 10-gallon tank into an aquaponics system and failed miserably.  I had decided to scale back when I saw this.  We did buy a little (very little) heater and an in-tank thermometer, because it gets cold here in the winter.  We have had it for a little more than a month now, and I haven't had to clean the tank.  In fact, I've been keeping a very close eye on that. I'm not seeing any evidence that makes me feel the need to get in there and clean.  We only have a single betta in the tank.  It's a great little science project, a low maintenance pet, and fresh herbs win-win-win. It's extremely quiet, too, and very easy to add water when you need to. Also, I love the fish food that came with the set.  That's all I'll get from now on, I think.I will say, our little betta didn't like the Zym-bac.  He became listless and wasn't eating.  I replaced half the water in the tank with aquarium salt water for freshwater fish (the instructions are on the aquarium salt box) and that perked him right up.  Google is your friend.
