Great product that does what it says it does!  Best used with Infinity's Hair Spray that seals the deal so to speak.  Makes it possible to conceal thinning areas and even slight bald patches which for a woman is especially critical.  I used this over the weekend as I was attending a very important family function.  After shampooing, conditioning and blow drying my hair I applied the fibers & spray on Friday afternoon before leaving. Several people remarked on Friday evening how great my hair looked.  Best part was my hair remained looking full and fabulous all weekend long.
