As an Arizona resident, I have been wearing this hat outside during hot summer days reaching actual temps of 110 FÂ° and hotter. I feel the burning heat of the sun on my arms and legs, but this reflective hat keeps my scalp and neck from feeling the burn. When the forecast high temps are going to be in the 110's, I limit outdoor exposure to avoid heat stroke, however I stay cool headed a little longer with my Alchemi Labs River Hat. I have ordered another one in a different color.
