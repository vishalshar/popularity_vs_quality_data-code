Pre-ordered Luma after first reading about the product. Was originally very easy to install my 3-pack Lumas, but was lacking advanced networking and other config settings. Latest update added all the stuff I was looking for.  Shows they are committed to continuing to make Luma better and better. Overall, wifi is perfect and fast throughout the house. Love it.
