I love the Wi-Fi Smart plugs!  I have purchased a few of them and use them to control the lighting in my house.  They work flawlessly.  You can set the time on & off by day or by week.  You can schedule different times on different days.  The D-Link app for the smart phone is easy to install and use and you have control of your lighting at your finger tips.  It is nice to be able to turn my light off once I am in bed.  I am very please with these smart plugs!
