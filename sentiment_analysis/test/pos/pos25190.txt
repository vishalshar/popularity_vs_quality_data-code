This cutter, and the included sheath, are of high quality. The tool is held in the sheath snugly, and you don't even really need to use the velcro retainer strap to keep it held in. The elastic velcro mounting strap fits snugly, and holds the sheath firmly to the visor. This is very good value for the price.
