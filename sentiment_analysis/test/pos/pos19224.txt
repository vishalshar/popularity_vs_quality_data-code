I did not think that I needed an activity tractor.  I would describe myself as "pretty active!"  Now that I am tracking my activity, I would describe myself as "extremely sedentary."  Since wearing the Withings Activite Steel, I have started doing a three-mile walk each morning because I rather quickly realized that if I didn't get a head start on 5,000 to 6,000 steps in the morning, I would never meet my activity goal.  The real reason I love my Steel, however, is the beauty of it.  Often people comment that they love my "watch."  And when I share that it is an activity tractor -- they unanimously agree that they would use an activity tractor if it was that pretty!  I have not yet tried swimming with my Steel.  I am almost afraid to do so because it just seems counter-intuitive to put my beautiful new piece of "jewelry" under water.  If it were to be damaged in any way, I would miss it!  Hopefully, I will soon get over this fear and begin tracking my swimming -- because if it is as much fun as tracking my activity and sleep, I am going to love using it in that way.  Thanks, Withings!  You created the product we all wanted!!
