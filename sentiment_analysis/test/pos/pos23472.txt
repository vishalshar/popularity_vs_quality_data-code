I'm probably rating this one star more than it deserves , I love the idea of it , but charging suitcase is inconsistentand as far as claim to what you can charge and how many times is way off , will only charge myphone to about 85% then it starts taking power back ?? ...but I love the lights and the smartphone app , lock , weighing feature,  etc..etc..I received such good deal on bluesmart  I shouldn'tbe complaining, but I have my doubts as to how long the battery will continue to charge..we'll see.
