I too was skeptical of the size of this bag. I mean, geez...it's pretty small. Then again, I only needed a few mL's of urine to take to the vet. Could you use 2 bags? Sure, but it's not necessary. I sprinkled this into a new cat box approximately 12" x 9" and it created a very thin layer on the bottom. I evened it out as best I could and waited for  the magic to happen. The next morning when I checked the box, there was a nice collection of urine at the edge of cat box where the sand had repelled it all. I could have used the collection tube and siphon provided in the bag but already had one from the vet. I tilted the cat box slightly on edge and easily collected my sample. I used a paper towel to soak the remainder before tossing it in a garbage bag.
