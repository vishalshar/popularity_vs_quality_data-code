As it says "verified purchase" means that I did indeed purchase these from Amazon and yes, I have them in my possession.Hands down better then generation one!  I didn't know they played a sound when you hit the "find" button in the app.  I guess this for people that have better than perfect hearing; which eliminated me as I am slightly hard of hearing.  The generation two tiles are much easier to hear as I can hear them if I'm within a few feet.  Not sure about the claim that you can hear them from two rooms away; again, if you have super-human hearing.  Not me.They will also ring your phone, something I have thought they should have done from day one!I still think the size could be smaller but I am starting to learn how to live this  the size...I would recommend generation two to anyone that needs help find commonly lost items, like I do. ;)
