I bought this to bullet journal in and I love it! I can easily write a do-to list on the rules paper but still have things drawn on the dot grid side. The only thing that has bled through the paper is my sharpies but those bleed through everything. Ghosting is at a minimum and notebook had no pages fall out while I was using it. Highly reccomend!
