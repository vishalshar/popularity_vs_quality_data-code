I replaced the bulbs in the ceiling of my wife's office with these and she is thrilled with them.  The can configuration is perfect in her office because the cans are equally spaced in the ceiling above her desk about six feet away.  She is driving them with her MacBook Air instead of using an iPhone.  The  only downside to using them this way is that one cannot dim or turn off the lights when driving the speaker lights with a computer.  In order to independently operate the lights and speakers, one must use the iPhone app.  For this reason, I would recommend driving the speaker lights with a phone or iPad using the Lumisound App.I've attached two screenshots to illustrate how to easily and independently control the light and sound with the Lumisound App.  Download this App before you install the lights to ensure the optimal user experience.The sounds is unexpectedly good for tiny speakers embedded in a can light.  The stereo separation is good.  The treble and midrange are good.  The bass response if adequate.  The bluetooth drop outs are only occasional.I would recommend these for casual background music in a bedroom, office, or anywhere space is limited.  I do wish Lumisound would release an App or Widget for the iMac and Windows computers to better facilitate using the speakers with a desktop or laptop computer.
