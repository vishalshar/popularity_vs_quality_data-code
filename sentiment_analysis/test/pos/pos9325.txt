Since I can't eat grains and pasta is my favorite food (next to cheese of course) this is a pretty good substitute.  I've seen those "blends" in the supermarkets where they try to trick you....... Quinoa pasta, but when you look at the ingredients, the first ingredient is corn flour or some other grain.  This product is actually chickpea flour and a great substitute.  I would highly recommend it if you are on a restricted diet.
