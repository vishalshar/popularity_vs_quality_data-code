Now I see what the fuss is all about and why it's worth the price. Perfect attachment. Perfect accessory. Perfect protection for your phone. It's actually now more enjoyable to ride my bike without worrying where should I hide the phone plus now I have bunch of great cycling apps. The only thing I'd still work on are the ponchos. Maybe make them thinner or more elastic, so they can be attached andremoved faster? Every time I get a phone call it's a minor struggle :)PS. Customer service at Annex is very responsive and a pleasure to deal with! Thanks Joel!
