I own soo many headphones that I really don't need anymore (kind of getting sick of them); that being said, however, all the hype on these headphones really got me curious to see for myself. It's no surprise everyone is giving this a 5 stars and would even sell out of stock.These headphones really aren't just made for gaming, but worthy for all-purpose media. Before "gaming headphones" were only optimized for gaming and it sounded horrible when it came to music. You actually get some great soundstage with these headphones for music; yes, you can hear the distinct separation.I connected the USB dongle to my laptop and listened to some music, and I was pretty impressed.It comes with an attachable mic, which will give you a much more better isolated sound, but it also has a built-in mic even if you don't have it attached.What I love the most is how the whole earcups for both sides are large volume dials; I think this is really cool and much easier to adjust than headphones that place a bunch of tiny buttons on the side trying to figure out where it is.The right headphone earcup dial controls the GAME SOUND volume (rotating clockwise increases volume).The left headphone earcup dial controls the MIC  SOUND volume.Pressing the center of the earcup for the right mutes the MIC SOUND (when the mic is muted, the microphone LED turns blue)Pressing the center of the earcup for the left mutes the GAME SOUNDI don't know why they reversed it. Personally, I think right side knob dial controls the in-game sounds, so pressing the button on that side also should mute those sounds.The manual suggests to connect to the console using optical cable (included); however, since I'm already using the optical out on my PS4/PS3 for my main speakers (don't want to go through the hassle of unplugging/replugging), the sound still works and sounds great just sticking the USB in (For PS4, hold the PS button until you get the 'Quick Menu' and go to 'Adjust Sound and Devices' and set "Output to Headphones" to "All Audio")There is a EQ button on the right side of the headphone, which has 3 different settings. 1 beep is the default, 2 beeps seems to give more bass, and 3rd beep mode seems to eliminate all the low frequency, which actually gives a raw feeling to me.Headphones are a very secure fit; it might feel a little tight, but you definitely get the sound more directly towards your ear/large earcups giving a nice secluded feeling.I really really wish these headphones could just connect to mobile devices via bluetooth and stay wireless, but they require the use the AUX 3.5mm cable, which is a shame. If that was possible, this would have been the ultimate wireless headphones to own for PC, console, and mobile use.Pros:- Very clean Stylish; Classy; does not look like a silly "gaming" headphone- Wireless (via USB dongle)- Great volume/sound stage/secluded/immersive feeling- Love the large volume dials on the earcups; I'm a big fan of this unique brilliant design. Why nobody else makes it like this?- Built-in EQ (3 settings to choose from; if you like bass then set it to mode 2. If you like a raw feeling, especially shooters, I like the 3rd mode)Cons:- Wish it had Bluetooth/wireless for mobile phones too (then this headphone would have been 6 stars and just be the ultimate all purpose headphones)- Wish the power on/off was a switch instead of holding button; I really hate holding on to the button because it takes too long and I just find switches to be more convenient; or at least turn on with one press of a button.It's definitely easily a highly recommendable headphone. Quite possibly the best wireless gaming/all-purpose headphones out there. For this headphone to still give excitement to people who own lots of headphones already is definitely saying something. This has become my favorite wireless headphones (I really wish I could use this wirelessly with my phone!).
