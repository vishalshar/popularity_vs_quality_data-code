We do like this Mip and it has a very cute personality, and has been fun so far.  Be advised that your hand motions will not really work to command the robot but the ap on the ipad works very well.  We wanted to report that this particular Mip is about 7.5 inches high and apparently there is another Mip that is around 10.5 inches high.  It's very unclear why there are two different sizes, and it's also not clear when you order it on Amazon so be sure to check the details and stats before you place your order.  This Mip is just surprisingly smaller than imagined.  It also came in a plain brown cardboard box (sort of sketchy packaging) marked Wowee but said "from China" and it initially made me nervous that this was a scam and it was not a true Mip.  Do not expect this robot to come in the proper packaging you would see in a store, but it did have a manual inside and was well packaged inside. If you end up having questions or problems, it seems unclear who to contact since the Wowee website is not "user friendly" and does not seem to provide direct customer service.  Overall, we paid $60 for this Mip and are happy with it.
