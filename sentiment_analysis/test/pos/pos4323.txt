The phone feels very nice in hand. It looks flawless and beautiful. I like how it's a MIXTURE of the iPhone (when apps are automatically downloaded onto the homescreen and no app drawer) and android because of the Play store.The phone was a little hard to use since SOME FEATURES WERE MISSING and I had to find substitutes. There was no Memo, Music Player (unless you count Play Music), contacts couldn't be synced from Microsoft unless you download the Outlook app, and no stock calendar app.FEATURES that were NOT available was the sound button on the notification bar. So to turn off sound, you'd have to use the volume buttons. Battery percentage was not on the home screen. You'd have to drag the notification bar down twice to see it or while it's charging on the lock screen. There was no option to turn on battery percentage.LOCK SCREEN can be at a disadvantage when I simply want to look at the time but I accidentally unlock it. (The fingerprint lock is really responsive and works very well!) Also, it's like apple where you can either use fingerprint or the PIN.You can only set ONE WALLPAPER! You cannot set the home screen as one picture and the lock screen as another. This wasn't a big deal for me but it could be a downside for others.The CHARGING CABLE works well; however, when trying to sync my music onto the phone, it proved to be difficult. Multiple times, the phone would disconnect itself and reconnect continuously. So it was a bit of a hassle.CAMERA is a bit slow and the selfie camera would not compare to the S6 (my previous) but it was useful nonetheless.CLOUD STORAGE isn't a major thing for me so I can't really go into review on it.*UPDATE:Music has crackling noises and other video formats.Phone is stuck on 82%.Phone charges "slowly" although I'm using a quick charger.**Update:The charger they provided seemed to be the issue with charging. I bought myself a different cord (not theirs) and it works fine now.***Update:-Cannot crop photos on the stock app. Need a third party one to simply crop.-The back is easily scratched. I already have skinny scratches after a week's usage.UPDATE****the phone doesn't feel completely flat on tabletop for some reason.UPDATE*****After software update, the speakers sounds much better since it isnt so loud. But phone speaker is still quiet at max. WARNING the update will heat the phone by a lot. When updating, make sure its full battery (to be safe) and then update. Dont plug it into the charger or it wont work. I tried that.
