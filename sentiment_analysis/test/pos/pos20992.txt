Works perfectly! I love the Wink system and team.  If you use IFTTT, you can even set up shortcuts to turn on/off the outlets based on circumstances. I have an Amazon Echo, and I can say "Alexa, trigger Christmas Tree on" to turn on outlet #1 where my tree is. Setup was quick and easy. Will likely purchase more in the future!
