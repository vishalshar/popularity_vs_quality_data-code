How many tuners and gadgets find their way into our gig bags, never to be heard from again?  Well I have to say, this isn't one of them!  This is definitely one that will be used daily.  Initially, I was a bit skeptical.  What with having to use an IOS device to tune with this tuner.  I've downloaded a bunch of tuner apps, but once I started to use the tuner, I knew I was hooked.Upon unpacking the Roadie Tuner, I noticed that the tuner itself was very lightweight.  It seemed almost flimsy at first blush. More about that later.  Included with the tuner is a small cable to connect the tuner to a USB port, and another cable to connect the guitar itself to my iPhone (standard 6.35mm to Åº inch guitar lead jack).  In the user's manual, there's a QR code for the IOS or Android app.  You can also look it up manually, if so inclined.  The tuner itself connects to the app via Bluetooth, so make sure it's enabled on your phone.  After entering the basic parameters for the guitar (i.e. 6 string, 7 string, etc.) you can name the guitar profile.  Now, the magic begins.To start using the tuner, you need to calibrate the tuner with the guitar.  When I saw the word "calibrate," I began to get a bit nervous. Calibration can sometimes be complicated and tedious.  Not with the Roadie Tuner.  You just tap calibrate on the app, put the tuner on the peg, pluck it again and again, and the Roadie tuner emits a tone when it's finished.  That's all there is to it.  No fuss at all.  Initially, I used the iPhone 6's mic, and it seemed to take forever to calibrate.  At that point I switched to the guitar adapter, and with just 3 or 4 plucks of the string, and it's done.  Calibration and tuning the guitar took a total of approximately 3-4 minutes from low E to high E.Since my Fender Strat is my "go to" axe, it really wasn't badly out of tune.  I then tried out the Roadie Tuner on my Hot Rodded Traveler Guitar.  To me this was going to make or break this tuner.  Why?  Well, first because I haven't used it since the early fall, and has sat in its case in a winter's worth of temperature and humidity changes, and also because the tuning pegs for this guitar are situated in the body, in a very tight space.  Again, it only took less than 5 minutes to tune a badly out-of-tune guitar, and it fit well into a limited space!  It was so easy, it's unbelievable!  I'm looking forward to trying it on my Ric 360/12 with the tuning pegs at right angles to each other.  Heck, I may just de-tune that guitar so I can have the fun of tuning it!...LOL.Regarding the fact that it is so lightweight: At first it was difficult to determine how firmly to grip the Roadie Tuner as it calibrated and tuned my guitar.  After the first automated spin of the peg holder though, I was able to match my grip to the force of the rotation of the peg holder.  I honestly thought if I held it too tightly, I would break it, but not the case.  It does seem to be sturdy enough to do its intended job.While I haven't gone through all of the portions of the app, I've noticed that it can accomplish various tunings.  Also, it can custom tune for times, when you just want to drop a string down a half step, and keep the rest of the strings in regular tuning.  Heck, it even tells you when to change the strings!I know that the Roadie Tuner is more expensive than most tuners.  I have a whole bunch of 10-12 dollar ones that I bought in the past, since each one was never quite accurate enough,  Then I went for the well known and expensive strobe tuners.  They're great and very accurate, but it entails me moving the tuning peg back and forth for what seemed like forever.  Now, with the Roadie Tuner, I can get the accuracy I want, at a speed that doesn't make people think I'm playing the "Tuning Song."The Roadie Tuner is not cheap, but every time you use it, you'll appreciate the investment.
