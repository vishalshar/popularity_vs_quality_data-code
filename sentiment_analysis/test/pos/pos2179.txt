From using friends mice such as the Razer Deathadder and the Steelseries Rival I can say this gamble was well worth it! Think of the best things about both of those mice and mash them together. The buttons feel solid (everyone who has said otherwise either got a dud or just don't know any better) , you get a free 1 year warranty, and the mouse itself is the most comfortable I have used. The software is good, too. It's easy to use and I did all I needed in less than 5 minutes with it. Only downside is no LED for the DPI button, not that I care since all you have to do is move it a bit. You can also have all 3 of the DPI options be the same, so if you accidentally click is somehow there won't be any problems. If you aren't afraid to spend $70 on a mouse this is worth every penny.
