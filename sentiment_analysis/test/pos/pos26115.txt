exceeded expectation. bought this to keep an eye on my father's caregiver. its been doing its job.minus 1 star however because every now an then the camera will disconnect and takes about 20minutes to connect again. this has happened 3x in few months.also cannot zoom in.but vid and voice quality is good.
