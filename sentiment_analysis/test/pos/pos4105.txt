This is an interesting oil.  It is deep green in color.  The flavor reminds me of Extra Virgin Olive Oil but not as heavy.  Apparently it is excellent for saut√©ing vegetables and grilling  due to its high smoke point.  According to Amazon this is the only oil made in the USA.  Amazon states that it is made using no chemicals or additives.
