This opens up a whole new world for beverages and food that I'm keen on seeing what gets done made. However, the evaporation amount (angels share) is very significant, I'm not sure the exact %, but if you are buying this to save money perhaps reconsider if you live in a hot environment. This is a great product for the creative mixologist.
