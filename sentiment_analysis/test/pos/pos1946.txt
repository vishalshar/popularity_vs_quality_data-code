This is worth every single dime.  Not only is the feeder a great item for my cats and my sleep, but the company behind it has customer service that is nothing short of stellar.I bought this in January, and I've been happily using it for the past four months.  It's great getting texts and being able to see my cats eat, even when I'm out of town.  My elderly cat learned VERY quickly what the sound of my voice and the sound of the tray moving meant, and he will wake up and dash when he hears it (my other cat is deaf, and so cannot hear that it's food time, but he's learned the schedule a bit and will follow when he sees the other jump up, or will already be sitting next to it when it moves).Late last week, though, the motor stopped working properly.  It wouldn't turn, or it'd turn a half meal, or two and a portion meals, so my cats couldn't get their faces in to eat.  The food would go bad having not been eaten, and it smelled.I emailed the company late on a Saturday night, not expecting a response until Monday, but Sunday morning I woke up to an email with troubleshooting ideas.  Great!!  I tried them out, but nothing worked.  We emailed back and forth and by that evening I was told a new motor would be on its way, with stamps enough to return the defective motor to them for testing.  The new motor arrived on Tuesday, and when it also didn't work, arrangements were made to immediately get the old feeder back to them for testing, and I would get a replacement.  By Wednesday everything was taken care of, and the new unit works perfectly.Things happen, I get it, and I applaud the company completely for standing behind their product so much and making it absolutely perfect for me.  Rather than be upset that my unit broke, I'm SO happy with how it was handled.  I can't imagine not having a Feed and Go for as long as I have cats.  They've got a customer for life.
