This is the lightest solid burning stove I have ever seen and it WORKS! No warpage no matter how hot a fuel used. Fits a snow peak 700 pot perfectly and strangely, it cleans up nicely when you are all done. NOTE: Titanium discolor into a rainbow of hues upon the first use. Doesn't affect its function at all.
