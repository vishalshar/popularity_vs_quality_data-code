Very good phone at an even better price.Checkout the Nexus 6p in comparison to this phone, it's half the price with almost the same exact hardware.Fingerprint sensor works great for me and I love the location in the button.My pictures come out crisp and clear.Free 100 gig cloud storage is great but I'd still like to see an sd slot
