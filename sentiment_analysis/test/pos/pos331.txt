I bought two batteries to use with my existing smoke detectors.Â Kidde PI9010 Dual Sensor Battery Operated Smoke Alarm.First battery set up was easy; it took me two setup attempts to get the first battery registered on my account from my phone.  Once registered, the battery showed 8.1 volts on my voltmeter. I installed it in the detector - that battery is about 1mm deeper than a standard 9v battery so getting the battery cover back on tightly was a little work, but it did fit.  Tested and worked fine.Second battery didn't work at first. After registering it from my phone, the battery showed 0.0 volts on my voltmeter. It wouldn't power the detector. I reached out to Roost technical support and they answered quickly. The battery won't send voltage if there has been a registration failure of some kind. The solution: Delete the battery from your Roost account, set it up again, and if the registration succeeds it will work.  I did so, and this time it worked fine and tested out in the detector.So far I'm happy with the batteries. I mainly bought them for the hush feature - my detectors are difficult to get to, and when someone burns the toast, it'll be really convenient to press a button and silence the alarms.I'll update this review once I've had the product for a while longer.
