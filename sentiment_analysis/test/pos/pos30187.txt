Keep the NomadKey with me daily! Keeps me out of a pinch when I've been using my phone a lot and need a quick charge. You can find a USB port almost ANYWHERE, right? Well this will keep your phone juiced.Nomad also has great customer service. I had the initial iteration of the NomadKey and it had some quality issues. They had NO problem sending me a new one to replace the damaged one!Hello Nomad!!
