I used to be able to buy this paper in my local grocery store but they stopped carrying it. I was very happy to find it through Amazon. The paper is great for preserving expensive, fancy, and any cheeses you buy. I am extremely pleased with how fresh my cheeses stay when wrapped in it. The product performs as described. I am very happy with it and will buy again when I run out.
