I really like these papers, have been using them for a couple of years now.  Someone in another review said you could use wax paper - maybe, but for one thing, the "waxy" part of these is much thinner than wax paper I have used, and coupled with the paper backing on these, really helps them wrap tightly around your cheese. Actually I think the "waxy" part of these is porous so that the cheese can "breathe", I don't know that wax paper would provide the same benefit.
