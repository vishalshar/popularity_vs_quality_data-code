The great improvement in lowering my tense/stress levels through the breathing exercises or its' reminding to take a break & relax is awesome.  The most amazing thing about it is that I never realized how often I was  stressed.  My Spire tense levels are reducing day to day & the calm & focused levels have & are increasing.  If it were possible, I'd give a 10 star rating.  What a joy!
