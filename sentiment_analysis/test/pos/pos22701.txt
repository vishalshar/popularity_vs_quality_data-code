After using it for 1.5 month I have found out that is  great device to workout. I bought it because of the water resistance capabilities (track swimming) but I have used it for running, cycling and swimming. I have compared the results of Running and Cycling with another tracker and both provide very similar results. About swimming, well the first 2 or 3 swims I did count strokes, and laps. So I am happy with the accuracy and with the easiness of use. What I like the most is the "not need to charge it everyday" thing. I think that it one of the features I like the most. The app is nice, allows you to compare and shows if your are improving or not (distance, cadence, time, laps). Also I do like the fact that, while running, it measures the impact, nice feature for new runners. The Training Coach is OK, I can't provide a proper feedback as I do not use the coached programs that much.Today (02/14/16) I did found out, while running with a Bluetooth headset , that inference might affect the connectivity of the Moov (and of course the headset) reducing the accuracy of the Moov and breaking the sound of the Headset. i have requested to both Moov and the Headset provider for possible solution. If the connectivity issues do not resolve I will keep my Moov and old-fashioned headphones and dump the BT Headset. (I do really like my Moov)
