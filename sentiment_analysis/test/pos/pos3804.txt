I was nervous about ordering this product because of some of the reviews.  I have hunting dogs and I live near a highway.  It is critical that no matter what is driving them to run (a rabbit), that they stop at the fence line.  I placed white flags about every 5-8 feet apart to make it clear where the boundaries are.  I live on hilly area, so some of my property goes up, and some goes down.  If you live in a place that is hilly (15-30ft rises and drops) you will notice it is not an even circle around your home. Does this matter?  Not to me.  I placed the unit where I wanted the most radius (furthest from the highway) and it works great.  My dogs can get all the way around my home, but cannot reach the road, and can't get into the pasture with the horses (one of them decided his favorite game was chasing horses - not good if he wanted to live long.)  I have not had any issues with it, I plugged it in and followed the set up instructions.  Easy to set up and the collars work well.  I purchased an extra collar and it automatically connected.  The instructions stated it would take about two hours to set up, and that seemed daunting.  In reality, it was 30-45 minutes, including walking the property and placing the flags.  I held the collar on a the alarm setting, and it identified each time I was reaching the end of the zone and inserted a flag.
