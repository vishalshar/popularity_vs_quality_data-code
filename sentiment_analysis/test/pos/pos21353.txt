This printer is fantastic, for the price it has amazing build volume and great quality.  It's not the fastest printer and it's somewhat noisy, but I would highly recommend it.  There is awesome community support for this printer as well.  I've been running it for about 48 hours straight since I got it and have not had any failed prints other than when I wasn't watching it and ran out of filament.  I've used both ABS and PLA, both have worked well.I would highly recommend getting Buildtak for the bed (although when the bed auto levels it will burn through since the print head is heated up before it auto levels.)  This allows you to not have to worry about putting anything on the bed for making your build stick.  Once I figure out how to make it auto level before the nozzle heats up I'll be 100% happy.Get it! (This is my first personal 3d printer, although I've used them before.  Also, I'm a mechanical engineer)Edit 10/19:  I tried upgrading to the E3D V6 and I have not been able to get the thing running ever since updating the firmware.  It turns out that this is so different from all the other robo r1's that there really isn't much community support.  So if you do get this, do not update the firmware (as the robo 3d website says) and leave it stock unless you're wanting to be one of the first to do it with little to no support.
