My dogs love it!  I have two small dogs and when it is too cold or wet outside and they can't get out, this is how we play.  I aim the launcher toward the hallway and they chase after it and bring ball back to me every time.  I use two balls and as one is brought to me, I launch the next.  Keeps them busy and tires them out so I get a little peace and quiet on cold or rainy days.  Still working on getting dogs to drop ball into machine but it works out great.  I purchased KONG Air Balls in extra small size as replacements when other balls are chewed or lost.  They are cheaper to replace and work well with the machine and are a bit sturdier.
