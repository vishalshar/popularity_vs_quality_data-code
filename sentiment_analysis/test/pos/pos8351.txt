Overall, I am pleased with this product--even though the belt clip broke after just a few weeks.So, why, then, do I rate it 5 stars?Because of the exceptional customer service, that's why.  Well, that, and the great ecosystem Withings has built. As the owner of a Smart Body Analyzer scale and a blood pressure cuff, I am invested in this ecosystem. And, while my Fitbit is my primary exercise tracker because so many of my friends are in the Fitbit ecosystem, the Go integrates with the Withings app and gives me great health data.But I'm writing my review today because when I contacted Withings about my broken clip, they emailed back in under 20 minutes, and within 3 hours a company based in France had ordered me a replacement clip from a U.S. supplier. Plus, they were courteous the entire time. I'd recommend them for that alone.The only negative I see is that it seems a bit stingy on the step count vs. the Fitbit.
