These filters work very well, slip on with just enough snug and just need to be tweaked off,  The snug fit has been engineered perfect. there is also an excellent video on Polar Pro's website that demonstrates installation.  They come in a protective case that is appropriate for storage and protects the filters.  Given the gimbal design of the Mavic,  I have no issues with these filters and they produce excellent video.  Thank you.
