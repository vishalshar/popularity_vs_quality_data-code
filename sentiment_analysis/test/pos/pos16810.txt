I've owned a number of Razer mice as well as a Mad Catz R.A.T. 7 prior to this and the Naos 8200 definitely takes the cake. X/Y tracking is smooth, Z-tracking is hardly noticeable unlike some other brands (I'm looking at you, Razer/Mad Catz), and the triggers used for the buttons all have a very solid feel. Software is perfectly fine, and firmware updates are easy as well. To top it off, it's easily the most comfortable mouse I've ever used (for right handed individuals, of course). The only real issue I have is that it's a bit hard to use this mouse with a claw grip since nothing on the right side of the mouse has a lip to grasp. Don't get me wrong, it's far from impossible to do, but the mouse clearly wasn't designed with claw users as the target audience. If their future stuff is like this, Mionix may have just found a new lifetime customer.
