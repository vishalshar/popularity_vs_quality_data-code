I inherited a box of old vinyls and wanted to put them to good use. Loved the look of this device and decided to give it a try. More than pleased with the sound quality. Surpassed my expectations. Easy to set up and operate. Overall I am very pleased. Now, time to kick back, relax and listen to some great tunes.
