Riva Turbo X Bluetooth speakerThe truth is that if you appreciate music there is a fundamental choice to make. Convenience vs High Fidelity. No small Bluetooth speaker is going to approach the sound of two quality tower speakers. That is simply physics,But I choose not to make a choice. I have quality towers but like to take music with me, sometimes. I have a tablet and a phone and they are both populated with playlists. And I decided that I wanted a Bluetooth speaker for all of that music because I am so often on the road and not opposite my tower speakers. A wireless speaker made sense. But which one?I did the research, as is my nature and the Riva Audio Turbo X seemed like the horse to bet on and if the horse turned into a nag, I could return  the speaker and start again (Thanks Riva).I will not get into the spec's because they don't mean much. Your ear is more informative than anything else. I listen to all that is between Bruce and Bach. and the Riva Turbo X delivers a clean sound across the board from bass to high-end and it will fill a room. The Riva Turbo X is a huge upgrade over cheaper Bluetooth speakers. This is a thoughtfully designed speaker that allows for satisfying sound on the go.Could you save $100 by buying something else? Certainly. But if you want a Bluetooth speaker than will make you happy over the long haul, this is the choice to make. I have truly enjoyed taking my playlists into different rooms, just carrying the speaker. The build quality is excellent, heavy and substantial.
