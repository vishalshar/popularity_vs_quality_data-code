A wearable device to promote mindfulness - how cool is that!  As a clinical psychologist, I am often encouraging my clients to practice mindfulness, so I was intrigued by the fact that Spire purports to help people do that.  I was skeptical of it at first, but I have come to appreciate the signal that I seem to be tense, as Im generally not conscious of this, and I always take a deep breath in response.  I have not used the "boosts" yet.  I really like that it enables me to visualize the sine wave of my breath in real time through my iPhone.  I have showed this to a few clients in demonstrating deep breathing and have even considered getting another Spire for exclusive use with clients as a basic neurofeedback device (I have an old iPhone I could use for this purpose).  I havent done that yet though.  So far I have been wearing the Spire daily for almost a month.Note that the Spire does not really track mindfulness per se.  It attempts to track your breathing style, giving you feedback on how often your breathing reflects tension, focus, or calm.  When it senses tension, it vibrates and pings your iPhone and/or Apple Watch to note "You seem tense. Time to clear you mind?"  So in that way it promotes mindfulness, but it does not actually track mindfulness.  For example, it only tracks breathing when you are stationary, so it cannot discern walking meditation from plain old walking.  I will say I've become more mindful of my waist band and whether it's rolled down or not (see below).One major downside I have found is that it tends to lose contact with my skin when I am sitting as my waist band rolls down.  Nor does it make good contact with my skin on my bra, unless it's in a place that is visible through my clothing.  At times it pops off, and I have almost lost it.  Perhaps I need a belt.  In any event, because of this, I can't be certain that the stats it gives me are correct.  For example, today it told me that yesterday, Spire sensed 5 minutes of focus, 3.3 hours of calm, and 9,168 steps.  Yesterday, it told me that the day before it sensed 1.1 hours of focus, 4.1 hours of calm, and 2,879 steps.  The steps may be right (I spent a lot of time sitting that day), but the focus can't be right, and if the focus isn't right, the calm is probably not right either.  The very first day I had the Spire it reportedly sensed 538 minutes of focus!Nonetheless, I do find the Spire helpful to ping me when I'm tense.  Thus, it reminds me to take a deep breath, reflect on where my mind was in that moment, and scan my body for tension if I feel so inclined.  I also like that it will not break if it's accidentally put through the laundry.  For those things alone, it gets 4 stars, and I would recommend it to others, with the above caveats.
