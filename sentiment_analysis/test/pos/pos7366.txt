I have three of these. The first was directly purchased from Kickstarter. Then two from Amazon. And the latest model (my fourth unit, in total) will be coming from the next Kickstarter campaign.My use is a bit out of the ordinary. My two CCTV DVRs, as are most, are susceptible to hacking and malware. So are many IP cameras. For a price that is less than most IP cameras, I was able to use these Android devices in conjunction with outdoor USB cameras to replace my previous system. I install IP Webcam Pro on each, and use tinyCam Pro to monitor the system via my mobile devices.
