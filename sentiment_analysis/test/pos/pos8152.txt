The wife is thrilled with this Christmas gift. The basil is growing and growing. She planted it I think two days after Christmas, and now it's less than a month later and it's almost ready to harvest.The concept behind the herb garden seems pretty simple and fail-safe. The grow lights are on a timer and seem highly effective.I wish the little domes that cover the seedlings were attached by a hinge rather than capable of being lifted off completely and getting lost. That's my only gripe.
