4 stars because they are so expensive. Otherwise I love it and have been slowly switching out most of my switches to the Lutron Caseta switches. I control it with my Echo and it responds very quickly. Setup was easy. The app works anywhere in the world unlike the Philips Hue app where you have to be on the same network. Each switch is $55 to $65 so it adds up really quick. Way cheaper though than replacing all the individual bulbs like Philips Hue or something similar.Other drawback and I hope this is temporary. The Amazon Echo currently does not allow you to control the Pico remotes themselves. For most this would not be an issue but for me it is as I have a few 0-10 volt Lutron controllers that use a Pico remote to control them. So for now I cannot control my kitchen lights via the Echo. Also Echo cannot control scenes that you create in the Lutron app. Mostly this would be for grouping devices and you can create groups inside the Alexa app itself.
