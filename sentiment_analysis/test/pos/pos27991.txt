I use this as a detangler after towel-drying my hair and my normally difficult to get through hair is combed through quite easily.  I sometimes also spray it on my dry hair (even though it doesn't specify to do this in the instructions) for a little extra moisture, but I'm not sure that it works that well when I do.  I guess my only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I wish it was specifically made not only for detangling/conditioning wet hair but also as a moisture aid to refresh dry hair, like a wet or dry hair leave in conditioner product.
