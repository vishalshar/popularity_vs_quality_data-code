This has been super helpful for our just turned 3 year old daughter. A friend of mine suggested it, and at that moment, I was so desperate for something to help us that I bought it on the spot.  She had extreme night terrors frequently, and on nights without night terrors, she was a poor sleeper who woke frequently.  Since we purchased the Lully, approx. 6 weeks ago, we have had greatly improved sleep patterns and NO extreme terrors. As others mentioned, set up is very easy. The vibrations on our machine are turned all the way up, and sometimes she does not stir within the 3 minutes.  This can usually be helped along with a little touch, but we do need to be in the room and fairly close to ensure that she does move/rouse.  I should also note that our child is on a pretty consistent sleep schedule, and so I can't say much as to it's capability to predict without a scheduled bedtime.I have also never gotten the alerts correctly set, so I just set an alarm at the time Lully suggests to make sure we don't miss the window. This may very well be due to the settings on my phone, not the actual Ap.  All in all, it is a very simple device that seems to be effective and has allowed all of us to get much better sleep! We will definitely continue to use it daily!
