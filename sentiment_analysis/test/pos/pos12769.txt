There are some issues, but I really do like this case. I've had it for over a month now.I love the size and feel of the case. It's not bulky or slippery; it's slim and matte (at least the black is). I don't mind that the charge port is at the top. I do love that it uses the same charging cable as my iPhone instead of a mini USB or something else.I'd say the case charges the phone 90% if you're not using it at all while it's charging, and a whole lot less (even 60%) if you're using it. To get the most juice, I put my phone on airplane mode if I can afford to.The top comes off way too easily. I already lost my original, but lucky for me ChargeTech already supplied me with a free top. I really have to be careful now, though! I'm starting to have trouble with the charging port in the case. The inside layer of the case is slightly peeling off and I've noticed it's sometimes hard to connect it.If anything did happen to my case, I would most likely (90%) buy another one. But directly from ChargeTech instead of Amazon because they have good deals sometimes. For example, I bought my case for $60 but my friend (who decided to get it after he saw mine) got it from ChargeTech for $45 when they had a sale. Slightly bummed about that--do I get a finders fee? Lol.ChargeTech has great customer service!
