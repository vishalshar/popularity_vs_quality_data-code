Hello!I bought this when it was on the "Today's Deals" thing and I never heard of this before. When I first saw it on there it immediately caught my attention. I did some quick research about the company and how the aqua farm would work and decided to buy it. At first I wasn't sure how would the seeds would start growing without the traditional soil but then few days after I put everything together it quickly sprouted! After about a week the wheat grass (Included) is now about 8 inches tall. Honestly I just used the grass as a test to see if it works or not. I will probably start growing basil, mint, and parsley in it.I didn't want a beta fish so I decided to go with a Black Moor Goldfish. I know its a small tank for that fish but he is still alive and healthy. I named him Taco by the way.Pros:Easy installationLittle to no cleaningNice designIncludes everything you will need to get startedIt works!Cons:Dosent have extra openings for heaterWater dosent go back into the tank from both sides (Im not sure if its just mines or everyones)No lights!Loud filter!Suggestions:Tank Should be bigger ( For more fish variety)Added lightsHeater slotNicer gravel ( For inside the tank)Have the tube (Center of the tank) detachable!Thanks! :)Update: 8/4/13So my pump isnt pushing out air like it use to.There isnt enough water being pushed up fast enough to filter the dirty water. Which means the dirty water will stay in the tank and the plants cant filter the dirty water. So I just went out and bought a Tetra Whisper 10 air pump. It works so much better then the one provided. Its more powerful and its on the outside of the tank so the vibration dosent disturb the fish. Another up with the new pump is that is extremely quiet (better then stock pump).I did have to buy a longer air tube as well but it will fit through the old power cord slot of the old pump. fits perfectly!Hope this helps!Hope this helps anyone that dosent want the loud pump that is provided or is dead like mine.
