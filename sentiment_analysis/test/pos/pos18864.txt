First let me start by saying.  I love these earbuds!After lots of research, of watching youtube reviews and reading customer reviews of the Bragi - The Dash earbuds I decided to just take a leap of faith and purchase my own pair.  I purchased these buds when the Firmware was 1.3.1 and all the reviews said they were nice but had minor to major flaws.  There were talks of the 2.0 firmware coming out that will improve the quality of these wireless earbuds.  My leap of faith paid off because once I received my Dash's I followed the instructions right out of the excellent packaging and updated to the 2.0 firmware.  Once updated I put my new true wireless earbuds to the test of all the negative reviews and I must say not one negative thing happened.  I use an Iphone 6+ to connect to the Dash and with the phone in my left or right pocket I never experienced a drop in bluetooth connectivity or any problems while on a phone call.  The sound quality of music whether streamed from my phone or stored on the 4gb internal memory was good for the worlds first truly wireless earbuds.  If you are looking for Beats by Dre bass you not gonna get them with these earbuds though, but the music sounds great none the less.  All the negative reviews you are seeing are more than likely first users of this product who weren't running 2.0 firmware.  I recommend this and think you won't regret this purchase if you can afford it.
