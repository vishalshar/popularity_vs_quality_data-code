Been using these for the past few weeks for a game I am running and they have been interesting to use. They can help take NPCs into directions that, at least I, hadn't thought of. I've built/ fleshed out a few NPCs now using these and really like the randomness of the cards (as well as the artwork on them). Usable with just about any RPG and very happy I took the chance and got them.
