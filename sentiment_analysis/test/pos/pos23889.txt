I hate, absolutely hate carrying a key.  I did a bit of research and thought this is the better option from everything else I saw.  To be fair, I did a bit of mechanical work on my door deadbolt lock engagement before I installed the unit, the only fault I had read about was the unit coming out of calibration for a difficult lock engagement...solved before it was a problem.It has worked flawlessly for the first week.  The set up, mechanically was very simple.  The instructions are good and very graphic.  The effect to the outside of the door is nonexistent.  The app set up was just as easy, and adding the family was just as easy.  The unit works as advertised.I will be adding a connect unit very soon to expand capability.  Allt tech should work this well out of the box.
