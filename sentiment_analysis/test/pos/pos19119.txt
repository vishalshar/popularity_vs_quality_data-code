Works perfectly as a thermos. However, GI Joe has nothing on the Mighty Mug's grip. I haven't been able to spill it. Just the other day I had an important paper due, didn't have time to finish it, so I went to spill my mug on my laptop. I. Could. Not. Do. It. This $30 (at the time) mug saved me over $800 in laptop costs. Well worth the price.
