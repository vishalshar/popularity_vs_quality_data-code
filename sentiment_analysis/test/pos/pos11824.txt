I got this off the APEX camping shelter Kickstarter and it is by far the most comfortable hammock I have ever used. The mosquito-net keeps out all bugs and gnats, which is well worth the slight addition in weight.I brought the wrong straps on my first trip out, and had to sleep in a lean-to, but on the next one I got it up, on my first try, with a minimum of fuss, and slept so well, way better than I do in tents.I suggest getting a camping mat or something else underneath you, as it might get cold as you have nothing but air under you.The inside pockets are also very handy. I love it.If you want to see a bit more about this I made a clip on Youtube. Just search for "Testing my camping Hammock - part 1". The first trip is bunk, but the second one is a lot better.Picture is of the view without the APEX shelter, looking up at the morning sky through the netting.Enjoy yours!
