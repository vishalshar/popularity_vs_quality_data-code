I make a living with my ears. I'm currently the Creative Services Director for a national radio network. In previous years, I've served as Chief Engineer for a pro recording studio that I designed and built.Point is - sound matters to me.The 1MORE In-Ear headphones are FANTASTIC for the value. For daily wearing (non-studio reference situations) you just can't get much better. They aren't studio cans, they won't replace monitors, but for plugging into your iPhone/iPod, you're gonna love 'em.The overall tone is cool, not bright. That means the midrange sounds accurate and non-harsh, but not terribly warm. That's okay, I'll take cool over harsh any day.When you first purchase them, I'd suggest letting them play for a few hours (or overnight) plugged into a sound source, so they break in a bit. I did notice an improvement afterward.Seriously, for $100, these are great!
