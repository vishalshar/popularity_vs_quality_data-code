I upgraded to this after my iottie 2.0 broke. My original 2.0 lats almost a year before the tightening ring snapped. Still, I was satisfied enough to go online and buy another one. However, since I saw they had a new version out, I decided to try it. This one is wider than the 2.0, and is easier to operate. It's not really longer, in my opinion, but it gets the job done.For perspective, I have a Galaxy Note 4 with an extended battery. This phone is an inch deep and weighs almost a pound. NOT your typical cell phone. The iOttie  One Touch 3 handles it impressively. It has never fallen out, it stays relatively steady, and I can still operate it with one hand despite the weight and size of the phone. It's also very easy to adjust.
