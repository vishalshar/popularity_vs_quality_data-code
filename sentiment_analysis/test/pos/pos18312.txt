I'm not a big game guy, whether on console, PC, phone...or even cards or board games for that matter.  My wife, on the other hand, IS. Last year we got four couples together for a dinner party; a couple of cocktails, some killer pasta, some more cocktails, and then my bride breaks out Cards Against Humanity.  Simple enough game, right?  Apples to Apples (to go with other fermented fruit).  Have to tell you, the game quickly brought out the best in what i had previously thought were some flat, boring people.  Fast forward - a few more dinner parties, and always the CAH after the meal for dessert.  Still fun, but losing its punch (at least with this crowd).  Then last month's get together,  After a few hands one of hoary band pulls out a new card game:"it's a little like CAH, mashed up with Urban Dictionary."Ok, simalarities w CAH end here.  That game made me laugh.  This game induced gut-wrenching spasms of wave after wave of laughter.  Shocking, simply shocking ideas, language and imagery coming out of the mouths of heretofore perceived virgins of Order of Diana or Junior League.  We've played the game twice since - and the results are not flagging.I told my nephew, a college Freshman, about the game.  He buys it.  Plays it once.  Goes out and buys a dozen more and gives it out to his Fraternity brothers.  Of course they've turned it into a drinking game.The cool thing is, the game changes with the audience - it can be as tame or crazy as the crowd playing it.  And the word combinations are endless.  So, if you are looking for a cool/fun stocking stuffer for this Holiday, this is the ticket.Hope the creators of this game have more "Mobscene" things to come.
