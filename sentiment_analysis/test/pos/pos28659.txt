Happy with purchase after having used the phone for a week. Fully functional and decent speed on AT&T network. Amazing what Posh was able to do with such a small form factor. Very light too.Works well for calls, with good quality sound. Of course typing is a challenge on such a small screen, but that's to be expected. Sending short texts and e-mails is the name of the game. Only complaints are that removing the back cover is a real pain and, as others have noted, the charging cable micro USB has a long tip. You can find a few to buy on Amazon, but these tend to be pricey. Overall, quite pleased with the phone and its value.
