This review will be based on how the device performs, compared against the reasons why I bought it.Recently the watch band on a digital watch I had, snapped.  I looked into purchasing a new watch, rather then getting a new band.  I thought hey why not get a smart watch?  This following, is what I was looking for in a device:- affordable, less than $200-tells the time-text message readout, and the ability to reply to them.- heart rate function  A coworker had a chinese knock off, of the samsung variety and liked it.  He bought it for 3 dollars on wish.  I decided not to go that route, to avoid the possibility of lead poisoning and crap device.  There are a lot of android, and apple watch knock offs out there that may have fit the bill, but I could not justify paying $50 and taking that gamble on an unrefined product.  I also considered the fit bit blaze, but it cost $250 and you cannot respond to texts.  Another coworker had a few watches, pebble time, apple watch and another one which I cant remember the brand.  He said he liked the pebble time the most, so I figured I research the device.  The device features included the ones I wanted.  For a moment, I considered waiting for the release of pebble time 2, because of its color display.  I decided I was venturing too far off, on what I needed out of the device so settled with the pebble 2.The following is what I found, based on 1.5 weeks worth of use:Pros:-The band material is flexible, a soft silicone like material.-buttons respond nicely, btw the device does not have a touch screen.-text messaging software responds well.  Texts can be read, and responded to by voice.  The software sometimes does not pick up words correctly, but that is based upon how much noise is in the area, and if the words you use are real.  There are options for canned messages, and emojis.  As an alternative to the vanilla software, you can download user made pebble software through the pebble app.-battery life is good.  I charged the watch after 5 days, at 20%.  It probably would have lasted longer, if I hadnt been testing out the watch's functions and apps.Opinion on the HR function:I really need to test this function against the polar loop device that I own.  I have the polar loop, along with then blue tooth heart rate strap.  This  device has proven to me, to be accurate.  At high peaks of strenuous exercise, I've seen the pebble 2 jump to what I would say accurate readouts.  On HR's after completing a working set, for example after doing bicep curls, my HR should have atleast been between 70-90.  The read out would remain in the 50's, after a set.  I think results vary, based upon wrist placement, I don't believe it is the devices issue.  Their areinstructions on pebble's website, on how to get the best results.  I know the chest strap, and pebble's technology are different, but the pebble should fair within a margin of error.**********Notes on delivery service*************Be wary of  the  company lasership.  I selected free 1 day shipping, I am not sure if this is an option only to prime members.  Lasership tracking through amazon stated my item was out for delivery at 7pm, and delivered by 8pm.  I checked with my neighbors, and no one had my item.  I've noticed through a google search, that people will having the same issues.  In the future, I will be selecting 2 day prime shipping.  I have the Ring doorbell device, with the motion sensors setting on.  There was no delivery service, in proximity of my house.  Luckily amazon's customer service resolved my issue, and sent out a replacement.  I received the product within prime delivery time.  The funny part about my experience with amazon customer service, is that even after voicing my opinion about lasership, they still sent my item with... lasership!  Good thing I have a good sense of humor, and work in customer service myself, as I understand these mistakes happen.Conclusion:I am happy with my purchase, the devices functions in the way that I expected it to do.  For a price point of $130, I believe the device was well worth it.  If I want to get the HR function to work properly, some extra time will be needed to adjust the device.  I recommend that you purchase this device, if you are looking for the same functionality that I was.  If you don't care for the HR function, there is also the Pebble 2 SE which skips out on the HR and cost $99.  Additional features that I liked, are sleep monitoring.  Messages are displayed telling you, how much sleep you had, and how much more sleep you had, compared to previous days.  Vibrating alarm feature, can be useful when you do not want to wake up your spouse.  There are quite a few pebble applications that are useful, and I am looking forward to more user created content.Thanks for reading my review!
