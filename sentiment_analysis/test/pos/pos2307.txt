Just used it once for about 20 minutes for the first time and I immediately felt relief and my posture improved. I will use this everyday. Also it should be known I rarely write reviews for anything. This is my first time writing a review on Amazon and the only reason I did it is because this product is awesome! Definitely recommend it. Only downside I could see it taking some time to get use to it. Little difficult in a cheap computer chair but if you sit on the ground with your legs crossed and use the product it is much easier.
