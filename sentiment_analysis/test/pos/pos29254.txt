Firstly, I think it important to know that before I owned this mouse, I was using the Mionix Naos 3200 which I was in love with.  After very extended use of that mouse, I had begun to have some issues with sticking of the rear thumb mouse button.  I figured it was time to get a new one and based off of the comfort of that mouse, thought that I'd give the improved version a try.TL;DR~~PROS~~-unbelievably comfortable-light effects are pleasant and not too bright-buttons are responsive (don't require any breaking in)-buttons feel nigh indestructible (improvement over Naos 3200)-grip is VERY grippy-lights do not heat the mouse up as other models tend to~~CONS~~-no weights (very very minor complaint)So first things first.  The packaging is excellent.  Feels very sturdy and is not likely at all to get damaged.  It is easy to open and also return to packaging if need be.  There is nothing else in the box aside from the mouse (not a problem) and the mouse had standard functionality right out of the box.There is no installation disc included with the mouse so the software will have to be downloaded through their website (not a problem in my opinion).  Their website is very navigable and I found the software very quickly.  As far as the program itself goes, I have no complaints.  There are five custom profiles available with a swathe of customization features.  You could spend a while trying to get the exact right color for your mouse's lights.  Personally I opted for mouse to cycle through a large number of colors and I love the look.  You are also able to change which lights light up on the mouse.Macro customization is simple and effective.  The actual GUI for the software is very manageable.  Mionix also included a calibration tool with the software to properly calibrate your mouse for the surface on which you're gaming/using.As I said above I only have one VERY minor complaint and that is that the mouse did not come with extra weights.  I've always been a fan of heavier mice so that was slightly disappointing.  That being said, the mouse's weight is nearly perfect as far as I'm concerned.  Also, the shape is fantastically ergonomic and works especially well for me as I have rather large hands.IN SUMMARY:Definitely a mouse I would buy again.  It's comfortable, accurate, grippy, aesthetically pleasing, and the software is fantastic.  Would definitely recommend to others.
