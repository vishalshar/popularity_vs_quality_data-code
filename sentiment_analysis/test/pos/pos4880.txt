If you have to collect cat urine for testing, this is the easiest way. The urine globs up and then you stick a syringe in and extract the urine. Pricey, and our fussy cat did not like the sand, but she eventually had to go, and she used it. One disadvantage is you may have to use the whole bag for one test if you've got a fussy cat like ours.
