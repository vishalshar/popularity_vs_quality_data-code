I really like this little machine. I ordered the blackhead tip and use that tip exclusively.  It really works and has good suction.  I still get clogs in my pores, but this pulls them out and now I don't have the redness and other undesirable effects of squeezing my skin to remove them. My skin has cleared up and looks so much better--nothing to pick at anymore.  Also, after reading other reviews about the diamond tip scratching skin and leaving marks, I just use the blackhead tip as it is smooth plastic and does not do that.
