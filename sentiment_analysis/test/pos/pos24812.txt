There is not a single once fitness tracker on the market that is perfect and will do everything you want it to do. Don't bother looking.Pros- Perfect if looking to track Sleep + Steps only- Technically more accurate than any other device because you can actually keep it on 24/7/365- Waterproof (never have to remove it)- No charging (runs on watch battery, they mail you the replacements for free when needed)- Easy to setup, sync, use- Integration with MyFitnessPal, Apple HealthKit- Can take off wristband and put in pocket or clip somewhere discrete if desired.- Notifications are nice to have, vibration stronger than phone- Includes clock/timeCons- Bigger/bulkier than Shine 1- Sleep seems less accurate than Shine 1- Looks weird if you wear a watch on other wrist (The new RAY will solve this design flaw)- Does not track stairs- Social aspect of app very limited, unsophisticated- Web account of data very limited, unsophisticated- Poor cross platform integration with other fitness/health apps (MapMyFitness/UA Record/Polar Beat/Withings etc.)- Alarm not strong enough to wake me up- No free app to locate missing device- No way to download/export dataI purchased a Shine (version 1) in Feb 2015, it literally did not leave my wrist until mid-October 2015 when it popped out of the wristband and was lost. I promptly signed up for Pre-order of the Shine 2 and received it November 9th. I could literally NOT keep it in the band, not to sleep, not to walk, not to exercise, not to sit on my butt and watch TV. Nothing seemed to work to keep it from NOT popping out. Sure enough, I only had it a few weeks before it was a goner.I emailed Misfit to complain, they responded right away and immedietly sent me a free replacement unit. I have had the new one a week, has not popped out once.Perhaps they solved the issue, the Ray seems to address all of the physical issues. Either way, Misfits customer service is doing their best with an obvious design flaw, in my book that is enough to keep me around for while they work out the kinks in a brand new, highly segmented market. Though I would like to see more investment into their UI/API for better cross platform integration in the very near future.
