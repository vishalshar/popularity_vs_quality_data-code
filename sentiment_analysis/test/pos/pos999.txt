Purchased the Moff Band after a friend recommended it for my son...HE LOVES IT!! This is a great way for kids to let their imaginations roll while incorporating technology that doesn't interfere with their creativity. So cool and simple to use! We'll definitely be recommending Moff for all the neighborhood kids so all can play together.
