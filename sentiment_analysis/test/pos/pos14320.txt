Great Mount.  I have an iPhone 6S the mount grabs hold of the iPhone and doesn't let go.  Right now, the iOttie mount is mounted to the dash of my 2007 Toyota Camry.  I just completed the installation last night so I don't have any idea how long the sticky pad will stick to the dash.  Prior to putting the iOttie mount into the Camry, I had the mount, mounted on the dash of my 1996 Corolla for a few weeks no problems with the mount during that time period.  Although I have an iPhone, I prefer to use my Garmin GPS.  The iOttie mount steps right up and holds the GPS secure even though the GPS is larger and bulkier than the 6S.  I recommend this product.
