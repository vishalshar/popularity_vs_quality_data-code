Love this device, I have it connected with some home automation systems, so I have it preform things like telling me someone is at the front door before they even knock or ring my "RING Video Doorbell".  Also have it set to remind me of specific time events, the LED color combos/light flashes are so easily programmed, and the uses are almost limitless.
