Excellent phone if you want a budget phone in 2016!!! Yep its older than the Oneplus 3 and Oneplus 3T but I wanted a cheaper phone that is also good. Besides I like that the headphone jack is on the top of the phone instead of the bottom. I wanted a Google Pixel but I passed it up for this phone. This Oneplus 2 phone offers a similar experience to the Google Pixel due to its stock android OS it has equpped. Even though its slighly skinned with the Oxygen OS that has a few modifications ,it still feels like the stock version of android. Overall awesome phone. Fast, smooth, no lagging at all. The main flaw of this phone is that its camera is mediocre at best
