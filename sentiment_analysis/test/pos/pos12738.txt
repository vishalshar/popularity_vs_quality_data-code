This stylus by Pencil is by far the best stylus I have tried (with bluetooth connectivity with the ipad air). At first I thought it would be uncomfortable writing with it but it is not an unpleasant writing experience. I use onenote, noteshelf and goodnotes with this stylus and they seem to have worked great.My problem with this stylus is that the rubber tip you write with wears out fairly quickly that I had to use my spare tip (it came with) shortly after I have purchased it. However, since I said this is one of the most decent stylus Ive used for my ipad air, I am not as bothered by it. I do write all my notes on my ipad so perhaps after buying multiple tips for it, it might get expensive. Hopefully this is something the company is working on.In terms of customer support, they quickly respond and answer to any concerns or questions you have about their product. I would have to say, they are efficient. Different reps responds at different times about a concern you have but the information are passed on well from one rep to another. I think this has made my experience with the company positive that the stylus tip doesnt bother me as much. I am looking forward to hopefully their improved stylus they will come out with next.
