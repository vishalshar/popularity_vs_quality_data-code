After my precious Dublin somehow escaped our fence and went missing for the worst 5 hours of my life... I bought the Whistle tracker. Since then, she has been wearing it daily. She hasn't escaped since I bought it, and I am hoping she never will again, but whenever we leave her zone to go on a walk or to the park or anything, it sends me a text when she leaves and lets me know when she has re-arrives in her zone.The only issue I have ever had was when we flew with her tracker. Apparently the tracker was constantly trying to find a signal while we were on our flight and the battery died. I thought I had killed it, but it just needed to be recharged. And customer service was super helpful and nice on the phone while they helped me troubleshoot the tracker.The device also keeps track of her activity throughout the day, which is nice. She wore it for 21 days straight after the initial charge (and it was only at half-battery) when I took it off to recharge it. As long as the tracker is within reasonable distance of the base station most of the time, the battery lasts forever.Overall, GREAT BUY. I love this little device. I am buying one for my sister for Christmas since her dog is a "runner" like mine.Oh, and for a size reference, Dublin is 13lbs.
