Setup was a bit long, but eventually I got all my devices hooked up. the finger gestures are very simple and nothing like the Kinect big hand motions. there is a small screen on the device and you can see on it all the functions you can control with your hand. there is also a very cool muting gesture (putting a finger on the lips like shushing someone). I wish it could show me the functions on the TV
