Excellent.  I am thrilled with it.  I bought it for a trip to Europe. It worked very smoothly.  It does not chew up a lot of data as long as you stick to text, emails or phone calls.  Its very compact.  It holds an immense charge for a long time. I am not a very technical person and needed some advice. Their customer service is phenomenal.  They reply to emails within minutes. They answer the phone right away.  I would highly recommend this.
