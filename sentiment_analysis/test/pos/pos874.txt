my Jack Russell loves it. we use the iFetch sometimes to shoot the ball over the couch. extra bonus game.I've had to put it up on a block. if l leave it on the floor.there is a chance of the ball hitting him in the face. this has happened before.the different speeds are also a joy to play with.ONLY thing I don't like is the price of the iFetch Balls
