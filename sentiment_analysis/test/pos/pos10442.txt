This is wonderful. I purchased it for a jar of honey, but used it on a pint size mason jar filled with tea to take to work. I am ordering more so I have some for taking liquids to work, for honey, to pour out of the sun tea quart mason jar, etc. I even told the honey guy at our farmers market about these because honey is hard to pour straight from the jar.
