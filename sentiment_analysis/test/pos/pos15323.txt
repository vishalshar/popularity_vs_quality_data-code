I have replaced several screens on iphones from many different sellers. I have not received even one defective screen from iCracked. They have great quality tools and instructions. This particular item even has a pre-installed screen protector that has no bubbles whatsoever. They're a little pricier than some of the alternatives, but the quality is worth it
