I love this light switch.  I made a deposit on this a couple years ago when it was still a kick-starter idea.  I really liked the idea and was disappointed that no one had come out with a reliable Wi-Fi switch.  After finally receiving my lightpad, I have to say it was well worth the wait as it has exceeded all of my expectations.  It is an solid, elegant, and smart design; like the Nest of light switches.  So far, my experience with this product has been more than satisfactory.I wanted to set my front porch light on a daily cycle to turn on in the evening and shut itself down in the morning.  Coupled with an LED outdoor bulb, it is working like a charm. I don't even worry about our entry way being dark when we come home at night because I would forget to turn on the light before leaving.  How is this different than a dusk to dawn sensor?  Well for a couple of things, there is no worry about a photo sensor failing or getting blocked or even coming on when it is cloudy and your lamp is in a shadowy spot.  Plus, you can customize the settings remotely from your phone even when you are away from your house.I had no problem installing this on my own.  Plum's installation instructions are very clear and they even give you a current tester bulb with your kit.  As you can see from my picture, it does take up quite a bit of space in the junction box, but there is plenty of room left for  the necessary wiring behind it.  In order to program it on a schedule, I did need a bit of help from tech support.  They promptly sent me a pdf file and a youtube video link showing me exactly how to do this.I have had this for three months now and it has been extremely reliable.  In fact, I never even think about it anymore; I just accept that it will always work.  I will definitely be purchasing a couple more!
