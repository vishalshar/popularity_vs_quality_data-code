15 years ago, I had a big grey cat named 'Murphy' who was diagnosed with bone cancer.  The vet said she had 1 month to live.  I began supplementing her food with IMMUNITY -- just one of the large end of the included scoop in every meal.  She lived another 9 months with decent quality of life.  It did not cure her cancer but it sure slowed it down.  Now I have a sweet Tabby cat named 'Jasper' who is 15 years old.  He has been diagnosed with a fast moving cancer in his mouth.  I have been giving him IMMUNITY -- same dose as above -- and it is now 9 weeks after the vet said he had 2 weeks to live.  He doesn't have long left but once again, the IMMUNITY has slowed his cancer down.  My vet still doesn't believe it but I have no doubt.  Been through it twice now.  I am now feeding it to my other 15 year old cat, 'Mr. Slick', as a preventative.  I hope he never has to face cancer like my 'Murphy' and my 'Jasper'.
