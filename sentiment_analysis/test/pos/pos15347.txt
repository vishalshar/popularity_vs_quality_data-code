The Rachio Gen2 fit perfectly in the enclosure. It can be wired to an electrical outlet due to an outlet being built-in the box. You can just plug your big black power adapter for the Rachio controller right inside the box.The Rachio connected to my wireless network without any problems and I set it up in ten minutes all from my Android phone. I love being able to get alerts about water usage and zone activation as well as start/stop watering remotely. If you want complete control of your sprinkler system, no matter where you are, Rachio of the best money can buy.
