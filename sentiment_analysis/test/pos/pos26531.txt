I'm a keyboard player in a band, and when I purchased a new keyboard stand, I realized that the stand I purchased is limited in accessories - like a laptop stand. When I saw the Mobotron computer stand, I knew it would be the perfect solution! My next problem was trying to find a way to mount it onto the actual stand. I then saw the Adjustable Mounting Clamps. I actually ordered 2 sets, just in case, but this product is SOLID! I was concerned about the stability until I mounted it, and WOW(!)... Totally stable. Great product!
