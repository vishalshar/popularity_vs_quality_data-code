I ordered this because I want to take care of my skin before I start to age to much. When this came in the mail I didn't use it till that night before bed, the fist thing I noticed other then the nice clean label was the smell of the lotion. It smells SO GOOD! Like cucumbers or something, it's a very nice and refreshing smell. The bottle was actually bigger then I had expected also. When I used it a little went a long way, it smoothed on well and didn't leave a sticky or greasy feeling and didn't leave my skin oily. My skin was just really nice and soft, the lotion is not heavy like others I've tried. I also put this around my ears because I see some people with wrinkles there that I want to tackle before I get to that point. I don't have loos or wrinkled skin that bad yet but I have noticed my skin does look healthier after using this. I would change anything about this product and I highly recommend it.I received this product for free for my honest and unbiased opinion.
