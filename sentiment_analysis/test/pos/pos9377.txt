These work great.  When cycling I don't worry about laces or ever having them come loose.  At first they were tight but I realized quickly my socks were think so switched to a thinner sock.  My sneaker also didn't have the holes for laces, it has loops that are inside but the elastic ties fit into them perfectly fine.Pro- Never having to worry about laces coming loose.  Never laces to tie, they stretch a bit to allow your foot to go into the shoe.Con - I don't particularly like all the different colored ties but I put it on a all black sneaker so they don't clash with a color scheme :-)
