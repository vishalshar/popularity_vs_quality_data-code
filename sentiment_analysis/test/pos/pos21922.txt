THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW TO WHAT I WROTE ON SEPT 30, 2014.After being unable to contact Supermechanical/Range about problems with their product and not being able to return my broken Range thermometer to Amazon as it was just days outside the 30 day return window, I did the only thing I could think of: post an honest review here to make sure other people knew that the thin silicone covering could melt on the Ember model, if used on an outdoor bbq grill - the way they show it in the marketing photos. I figured that would be the end of it, I was out the money, and needed to buy a more traditional fiberglass wrapped bbq thermometer without iPad/iPhone capabilities.A few days later I received an email from John at Supermechanical, who had been trolling reviews of their products online. He apologized for the problems I was having with my product and being unable to contact them and sent me some instructions on how to contact them from within the app directly from the iPhone and/or iPad.Also, he pointed out that there is a new thermometer available from Supermechanical that is bigger and beefier and made for higher temps and open flames: The Coal.Now I don't recall seeing this model when I was first shopping for my Range thermometer, so I have included a link to the model within the Amazon site here for you to check out:Supermechanical Coal Range Smart Thermometer with Fiberglass Cablehttp://www.amazon.com/Supermechanical-Range-Smart-Thermometer-Fiberglass/dp/B00O1A5ZGO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1414421926&sr=8-1&keywords=supermechanical+coalIf the link doesn't work: just type Supermechanical Range Coal into the search box up top.John also helped me to acquire one of the Coal models without any additional shipping or charges as a replacement to my defective Ember model.The new Coal model performed well, and is much beefier than the Range model - especially the delicate wire. It is now wrapped in a fiberglass braided protective cord that is more protected than any of the other more traditional thermometers I was considering. I wish I had been able to find this product when making my initial purchasing decision!If you are considering a thermometer for use on stove top or inside your kitchen oven with iPad or iPhone capability, the the Supermechanical Ember will be perfect for your cooking and geeky data collection needs. But don't use it on your open flame charcoal or gas bbq! It won't stand up to the torture!Instead, if you are serious about outdoor, high heat meat preparation, then get the new Supermechanical Coal!I am upgrading my review from extremely dissatisfied to Extremely pleased, because of their awesome customer service and willingness to work with clients experiencing issues with their Range products.  Thank you John and the rest of the team at Supermechanical.In closing I am upgrading stars here from 1 to 4 based on the bend over backwards customer service I received. I can't give it 5 because I don't think the Ember product here performed as indicated for open flame grills.But I will also be rating the Coal model with 5 stars!-C @Cavemanbistro on 10/27/14Previous Review written 9/30/14:THE PROTECTIVE COVERING FOR THE WIRE NEEDS TO BE FIRE PROTECTED METAL/FIBRE WRAPPED LIKE MOST BBQ THERMOMETERS.THIS ITEM BROKE ON 3RD USE - JUST DAYS PAST MY RETURN WINDOW WITH AMAZON AND NO CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT POSSIBLE FROM THE SUPERMECHANICAL/RANGE COMPANY.ARE THEY EVEN IN BUSINESS ANYMORE?I loved the idea of transmitting data and alerts directly to my iPhone or iPad for my larger cooking projects like whole roasted pigs and full beef briskets. Having two of these, is a great idea too, one for the oven temp and one for the temp of the meat inside the oven.It worked flawlessly while I roasted a whole pig in a La Caja China Pig Roast Box, and when I did a full brisket inside a Weber Dome BBQ.But the first time I used it on a thick Top Sirloin Roast on my bbq grill, the silicone wire barely brushed the grill surface, melted completely and the item has not worked since.I went to Amazon to see about returning it, and it was just outside the 30 day return window. So I went directly to the Supermechanical site where I cannot locate any contact info or warranty info (none was included with the device when I received it.) They do have a contact form available unrelated to returns or warranty issues, but even this form won't submit on different computers using different browsers and settings. I think they may be out of business.Purchased July 2014. Used 2X in July 2014 and 1 Time in August 2014 when it broke.Worst purchase ever!
