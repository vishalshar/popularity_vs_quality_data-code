I got a new one and have no issues with it. As always Amazon is great at returning items.Even though this is a one star I do really like the in ground fence. The issue is that I got another dog and had to add another collar hence this purchase. However, this worked maybe 40% of the time. My puppy was able to walk right past the line, Luckily I was keeping an eye on her.  Hopefully this was one off bad product. I'll update it if I get another one.
