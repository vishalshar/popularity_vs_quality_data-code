Great product! It definitely worked for us. Night terrors decreased after the first few uses and then completely disappeared. The alternative to this product would be to go in the room and move your child until he/she stirs or has some kind of response. In our case, that's too risky because if our child wakes up and sees us it'd be a full project to put her back to bed. Lully enables us to activate the vibration from our own bedroom and we just see her on the video monitor that was already installed in her room. If you already have a video monitor, it will make all the difference because you won't have to walk over to the child's room. Once our toddler stirs, we simply turn it off (all from our smart phone) and go about our business. It has been one of the best investments we've made because as you may already know, night terrors are not fun at all. I highly recommend it.
