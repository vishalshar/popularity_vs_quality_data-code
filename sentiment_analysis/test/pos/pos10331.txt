I purchased my YoCam to document my semester abroad in Europe and I absolutely love it! I wanted a very small and lightweight camera, to fit in my carry-on luggage, and that's exactly what I got. It's so unbelievably compact that I can just keep it in my pocket while traveling around during the day. I've brought my YoCam to multiple music festivals since I've been in Europe and have been able to capture great footage!
