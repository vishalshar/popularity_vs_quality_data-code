Got this for my 10 year old Grandson for Christmas. He says it was his best present and played with it the whole day. The robot has tons of functions. It walks, grunts, picks up things, and its arms and hands are very articulate, rotating and bending at every joint. The remote has a ton of buttons on it for each movement, so I'm not sure how much younger you could buy this for and have them be able to control it. But then again., I can't rock and roll on an Xbox or PlayStation like the youngsters of today, so who knows. Very nice robot for the money though. I highly recommend it.
