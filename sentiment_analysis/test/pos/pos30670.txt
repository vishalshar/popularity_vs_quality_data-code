I have owned a Fitbit before, in fact I've owned 2 and I really like the ease of use of the Pivotal Living Band. I know that most ladies like the fact that you can interchange the bands, but I like that you can charge it will still in the band. I also like to see the display, which you would have to pay for a more expensive Fitbit model. If it breaks or you lose it, it's only $15 so you can go out and get another. I'm planning on getting one for my son too.
