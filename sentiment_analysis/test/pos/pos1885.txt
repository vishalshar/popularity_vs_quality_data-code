The main reason I bought this device was to basically see if this actually worked or didn't. Keep in mind I have only owned this device for 3 days now and only used the energy strips in the last 3 days. I've watched a lot of youtube videos and read a lot of reviews on the product from credible and un credible sources. This product might not work for everyone because most people are going to have certain expectations on how the product will work for them. This product is telling your brain what to do its not a brain monitor nor is it anything related to do with health.The strips are designed to only be used once. I've been able to use them up to 3 times if you keep your skin free from oil or swet. The hydro gel that is on each strip will start to lose its ability to stick after each use. Thats why up to 3 times is ideal. The instructions on where to exactly place the device is little vague because you might have to adjust it once you place the product on you head if you need to adjust it it loses its stickiness. I've used it over 15 times and It only gave me one head ache. The headache happened because It was not placed in the "sweet spot".Out of the 15 times I've used the product and surprisingly it does work. This morning I was super dead did not want to get out of bed. I used the energy strip first thing while I was tossing and turning in bed and set the device to the highest setting and at times it will feel uncomfortable from the tingling but it did wake me up. I've used this device on my lunch break at work and it did give me a kick for the rest of work day.I've used party drugs in my youth and I've used cocaine and adderall a lot when I was younger. For me someone with a high tolerance to brain altering substances I was impressed. It won't help with ADHD or any cognitive brain functions but it will give you energy and good energy that your body doesn't have to ingest and you can use this device as much as you want and I felt it lasted a while without any crash. I'm going to continue using this device. The only downside is buying the strips which at $20 thats why keeping your skin dry and clean is important in reusing them.I'm giving the product 5 stars because it did work for me. It might work for you. It might not. Welcome to the future! Give it try!
