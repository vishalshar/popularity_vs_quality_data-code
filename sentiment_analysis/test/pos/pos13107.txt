A friend recommended this after supporting the Kickstarter and gave it raving reviews, which is why I was surprised to see so many bad reviews here. The two main issues people seem to be having I'm fairly sure are operator error.The focus issue, for example. I haven't had any issues with this, so I wouldn't be surprised if people just weren't getting close enough. You have to be about a centimeter away to get a good focus. That's why they recommend using the little case as a rest for your phone, since it's just under a cm wide.The issue about the lense falling off I only kind of understand. They do say to make sure that both the lense and camera are clean before applying it. If you've done that and you're still having issues, my guess is you're pressing to hard. I barely press it on, and when I press to hard, it pops right off. The first time I used it I forgot it was on there and didn't notice till the next morning, when it was still on. So either you got a bad lense or you're doing it wrong.This little guy is super convenient, fits in my purse or pocket, and makes a great conversation piece. I'm also now the favorite aunt as my 5 year old nephew now greets me with "Can I play with your microphone?" And spends most of my visits staring at the wall or the carpet or the couch cushions. Which all look pretty cool magnified 15 times. I imagine teachers could do a lot woth these in a classroom.Overall I think this thing is well worth the money and would give the same rave reviews that I heard when I learned about it.
