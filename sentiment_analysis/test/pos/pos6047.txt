I was very skeptical about these when I first saw them, but I was in need of something like these for a long time, so I couldn't help it, and ordered the black ones. I went to their website to look at their videos, they have a video for every fit you would need. I chose "regular" the first tie was hard to put in, but after that, it was smooth sailing. I tried them on, and was really impressed. so today I took them outside for a few hours, and they held up. I'm very happy with these. once they are on, if you order the black ones, they blend into black shoes really well. you can hardly even see them
