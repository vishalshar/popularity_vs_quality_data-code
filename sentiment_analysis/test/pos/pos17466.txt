It does the job, however it make me a little nervous because all of the USB connector and USB-C power is plugged into the adapter and the adapter is plugged into the computer, so the possible torque on the adapter might damage the USB-C port on the computer.  Just have to be careful.  If I had to suggest a design change, I would have a wire coming from the adapter and then have a USB-C plug on the end of it to mitigate this concern.
