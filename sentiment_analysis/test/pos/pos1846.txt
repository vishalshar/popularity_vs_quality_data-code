The ASUS K501UW-AB78 is the second laptop I have owned. I have never been a PC gamer, but was always intrigued by the prospects of being one. This device is a good mid-high range mobile gaming and everyday use platform. I have had the AB78 for 3 and a half months now and feel that I can fairly and sincerely review its capabilities, limits, and overall performance.EXTERNALSFirst a look at the screen, keyboard, speakers, and ports. This machine has a 15.6" Full HD display with a 60Mhz refresh rate..  A matte finish gives the display a bit of a paper-white quality with indoor lighting and significantly reduces screen glare. The screen has a ~1" bezel to compliment this quality. The hinge attaching the monitor to the keyboard is sturdy and offers a wide range or motion, accommodating the rather limited viewing angle of the display.Surprisingly, the AB78 boasts a full keyboard with numpad and function keys. Keyboard backlighting is present and, along with the display, has brightness controls to fit your needs. The laptop is crafted from durable machined aluminum. This gives off a premium appearance and allows a low weight of 4.4 pounds to be achieved. Fingerprints show relatively easily on the lid, but are not glaringly obvious - cleaning this device is a breeze.For the audio playback, ASUS has done something rather interesting with their SonicMaster technology. Initial appearances shows no sign of it, but the speakers are actually located on the underside of the body. This produces a nice acoustic quality on flat surfaces and open areas but is more muffled when placed on top of bedding and clothing.The touchpad is actually pretty good. The pad allows for smart gestures like program-juggling, scrolling, etc. The right/left clicks can take some time getting used to since there is only a visual indicator for the separate clicks. Navigating is made easy and unencumbered.As far as ports go, this laptop comes equipped with an array of them. On the right side at the rear is an opening for an antitheft device so you can anchor the laptop to a table, workspace, etc. A 3.5mm-out jack for headphones is first up. Next are two USB 3.0 ports that are capable of fast data transfer rates and utilize the ASUS Charge Plus feature for faster charging of connected mobile devices. The ports can be set to function even when the computer is off by tweaking the BIOS. Last on the right side is an SD card slot for expanded storage.On the left side starting from the rear is the AC port and beside that an RJ45 Ethernet jack. The jack is different from any other I've seen and is designed in a way that allows the port to compress when not in use. Regardless, it still use gigabit technology and functions like any other standard Ethernet port. Next is an HDMI-out port for external display and audio playback support. Finishing the left side are a pair of USB 2.0 ports for peripherals and such. Lastly, a power brick is included for charging the device.INTERNALSThe AB78 has a 6th generation Intel dual-core i7 6500u processor clocking at 2.5 GHz, up to 3.1 GHz overclocked. While the 6500u only has two cores, it also utilizes Intel Hyper-Threading technology to improve application workload. This is great for word-processing, computations, and web-browsing, but the additional virtual cores don't kick in when running games since most developers don't program the CPU to utilize them.As far as physical memory goes, the laptop comes with a base 8GB of SODIMM DDR4 RAM operating at a frequency of 2133 MHz. There is a slot for an additional 8GB stick of memory. I am not sure if 8GB is the highest amount that can be installed, but that is what I did with a stick of Kingston HyperX RAM. Although you might be hard-pressed using all of the physical memory available with this machine, it certainly can't hurt to have more memory especially as cheap as upgrades are right now.The laptop has an Intel 520 integrated GPU with 2GB of DDR5 VRAM and an NVIDIA GTX 960M dedicated GPU with 2GB of DDR5 VRAM. The Intel 520 is great for displaying web pages and work environments.  The GTX 960m is still a relevant graphics card for running years' past titles at high settings and more recent games at medium-high settings. Most graphically intense titles' framerates can be capped to a lower fps by using some NVIDIA software. This allows you to improve graphic fidelity while maintaining an acceptable framerate. Some games I have run at medium settings and 60 fps include Overwatch, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, and Elite: Dangerous. Fallout 4 can maintain high settings at 30 frames while Alan Wake and BioShock Infinite can be pushed to Ultra settings at 30 fps, too.For storage the laptop comes equipped with a Hynix M.2 PCIe SSD with 512GB. A bay for an additional 2.5" internal drive is also present. You can install a high capacity HDD or faster and smaller SSD. I went with a Samsung 850 EVO with 500GB of space.Apart from the workhorse machinery, the AB78 also has convenient heat dispersal technology and fans for both the CPU and GPU near the rear of the keyboard. Directing this heat to the back keeps your hands cool while you work or game. Though this may keeps one's hands cooler, be aware that the diverted heat still needs somewhere to go, so placing this on your laptop while throttling the hardware can be uncomfortable.The battery is a 3-cell lithium ion unit that holds a decent charge. Gaming unplugged will run you maybe an hour whereas everyday web-browsing and video playback place the battery life at around 7 or 8 hours. Charging from 10% to full capacity takes a solid hour and a half.The Broadcom Wi-Fi card allows for 2.4GHz and 5Ghz connectivity with great signal reception.SOFTWAREThe ASUS K501UW-AB78 comes loaded with Windows 10 Home for the operating system. There is very little bloatware present and lots of room for storage after the system reserve space is taken into consideration. If Windows is not your preference, any other OS can replace it. You can partition the M.2 SSD to dual boot systems at startup - using virtual machines is always a good option, too.Bluetooth 4.0 support is utilized meaning you can connect your favorite devices like mice, keyboards and even game controllers.What I like: Outward appearance is a pretty big deal for me -for a gaming laptop, the AB78 is about as discrete as it gets(no flashy lights or shapes here). the CPU and GPU provide a well-rounded experience for everyday use while providing both casual and competitive gaming experiences. the M.2 PCIe SSD is blazing fast. The OS boots to start in a mere 13 seconds as a result. Games installed here load exceptionally quickly as well. I just can't help but love the SSD! The display renders at 1920x1080 allowing for HD video playback. Colors are a bit washed out, but this doesn't take away from the picture quality. At 4.4 pounds, this computer isn't Ultrabook-light, but it is low enough to make taking this anywhere easy and hassle-free. Wi-Fi performance is consistent and having the option to wire into networks makes this machine all the more versatile.What I Don't Like: The monitor has severely limited viewing angles - anything aside from head-on and 90 degrees results in a less-than stellar picture. The speakers have a great range of volume, but bass is absolutely lacking here. The battery leaves a bit to be desired, but trading weight for battery capacity can be reckoned with if you have a source of power nearby.CONCLUSIONThis thing is great for its price range. Powerful hardware, a light build, and discrete appearance means that you can carry on with work or play with no interruptions. Upgrades for physical memory and storage are cheap and just add to the capabilities of the machine. Students like myself will love this - entry-level gamers who want to start PC gaming or game casually will be attracted to this too.
