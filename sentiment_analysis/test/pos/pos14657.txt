Yes, it's thin. Yes, the frame and optics are good quality, esp the frame, which is super nice.It does hug the nose very comfortably.BUT, here's the issue with the optics: no anti reflective coatings, and the glare from any backlighting makes the glasses hard to look through in those situations.Update: minus one star again. These plastic lens scratch if you even breathe on them. Dust collects in that thin case, and then what happens is when you put in and take out the glasses, they scratch very easily. Mine are now scratched pretty well after just 3 days of having them.Update: ThinOptics decided to take care of my scratched lens. The other thing is it's $19. What do you expect. However, I am upgrading to 4 stars, because even though they are scratched, they are still so damn convenient, that I am using multiple times a day. For reading glasses, the scratches, such as they are, don't really impair the reading use case. But still guys, add some coating, I'll pay another $10-20 if you can coat them for anti-glare and scratch resistance.
