All three of my cats coming running when I yell "Turkey Treats!" and one, in particular will stand by the cupboard where it's kept and meow for more throughout the course of the day. It's most unusual for all three of them to like the same food. This is such a wholesome cat and dog treat. I appreciate Whole Life for offering this top-quality product. Pricey, but you get what you pay for, as they say, particularly with pet good. So much of it is garbage, unfortunately.
