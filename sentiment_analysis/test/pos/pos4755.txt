First couple flights my landings were less than stellar and one of the props suffered. I bought these expecting multiple prop annihilation, but I've improved my landings and haven't needed them.  I did land in some dead weeds and they did an excellent job of weed wacking with no injury to the blades. I'd have to say they're just fine and I'll buy them again when the need arises.
