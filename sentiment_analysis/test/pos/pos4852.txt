This "Type A" businessman decided it was time to learn "mindfulness". My wife has always told people that I have two speeds: On and sleep. After reaching middle age, I was concerned that my tendency to drive myself at the limit every moment of the day had negatively impacted my health. A friend recommended that I practice mindfulness, which sounded like a fantasy to me. I could not imagine slowing down enough to even recognize that I was stressed.I noticed a technology review for a device called Spire. It promised to provide a gentle "nudge" whenever my breathing pattern indicated that I was tense. At that time, Spire was available for pre-order, so I laid my money down and waited. When it arrived, I soon recognized that Spire was my key to being mindful.Combine Spire with an Apple Watch and the nudge (a vibration on my waistband) becomes a specific alert that tells me that I'm tense, and recommends that I take a breath. With Spire and the Apple Watch, my iPhone now tracks both my heart rate (from the watch) and respiratory history (Spire) in the health app. I have been surprised how often I refer back to this data. The patterns are interesting.As one of the original Spire owners, I can vouch that the device is incredibly accurate and perceptive, and the device's performance and usefulness has only improved as the app has been enhanced.Unfortunately, I lost my first Spire. I have no idea how/when it slipped off my waistband. The order from Amazon was the replacement device. I am not sure why, but I perceive that the battery performance has improved from the first to the second device.One final thought, for those of you who use an activity tracker - Spire does an excellent job tracking steps. The analytics are excellent as well.
