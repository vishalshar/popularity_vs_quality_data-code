I saw this product amazon sells, Sporn Double Dog Leash - Two Dog Leash Med- XL, black and since that had a full description of it being a M-XL, and it costed a few extra dollars, I assumed that this product, Sporn Double Dog Coupler was the XS-M version.  It's not; they are the SAME exact item, except this was a few dollars cheaper.What I received was indeed the M-XL one like others claimed.  It is well made, easy to adjust, and easy to use.However, I have two Westies, both about 20 lbs each and it's just ALMOST too heavy for them, but definitely too long and they keep managing to get their legs tangled in there.  (The younger one, because he is a wild man.)  It's a shame because it really is a good product, and I wished Amazon described this better and carried the XS-M one.
