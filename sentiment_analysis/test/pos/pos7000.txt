I purchased this for our 12 year old Dalmatian who has a heart condition and also has a bone spur on his knee that we have been treating. For a few months he stopped coming upstairs where he liked to stay. He almost seemed depressed and I wasn't sure what exactly was causing his change in behavior. His daily walks became more occasional. He would also get ear infections on occasions and sometimes bladder problems. Our vet said that because of his heart condition perhaps his immune system was low. I decided to try this to boost his immune system. Within a week or so he suddenly started coming up the steps instead of staying downstairs laying in his crate for most of the day. Now he can lay on his favorite futon bed again. He also is more interested in what's going on around him and has more energy. He's walking daily 2 miles a day. This supplement was the only change in his diet. I am very happy to see him doing much better.  Another one of our dogs is a 12 year old Dalmatian/Lab mix. She is being treated for IBS and is almost finished with her treatment on Prednisone. Once she is off of the Prednisone I will definitely have her on the Bixbi Immunity supplement. She will need her immune system to become stronger.
