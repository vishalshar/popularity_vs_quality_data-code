My son loved the band.  We have an external bluetooth speaks and he loves putting on air guitar concerts for us.  His younger brother loves the tennis sounds, although I don't think he is destined for the US Open play based on his swing.  We can't wait to download the new sounds.  This band is fun for the whole family and I recommend using it with an external blue speaker or your ipad turned to max volume so you can hear the moff over the laughing.
