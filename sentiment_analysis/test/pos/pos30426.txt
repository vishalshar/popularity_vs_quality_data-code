I have started my small yorkie on this and the immunity supplement for her skin allergies. I gave her a full 1/4 tsp of each yesterday when I received the items. Yesterday she had a rash that was very red and flaky on her back leg and tummy. She has seen a vet numerous times for her skin issues and its always been chalked up to allergies. She is always prescribed prednisone, a steroid that I am not comfortable giving her due to the side effects, and benadryl. I give benadryl on exceptionally bad days but it never fully stops the itching, and I'd like to find a natural way to stop the itching. She gets grizzly salmon oil as well as two brands of premium grain free kibble that I rotate. If you haven't heard of the benefits of rotating the protein source I highly recommend you look onto a rotational diet. Anyways, that's another subject. Well today I examined her rash to see if it has improved, and to my surprise it looks as if it is almost healed. Now I know these supplements are supposed to take time to work, and I'm not saying it absolutely was the supps that cleared up her rash, but it did make me wonder! I will definitely edit this review in the future after I have had more time to observe and see if there is a real change. Until then I give it 5 stars, and would recommend anyone to at least try it and see if it helps with your dogs skin issues.
