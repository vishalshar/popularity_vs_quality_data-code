This works pretty well.  Nice being able to control my devices with one remote.  Even the air conditioner and you don't have to be in the same room to turn it on.  Works really well with general commands but specialized commands that are on the original remote my not work at all or may require additional commands to be added somehow, haven't really gotten to deep into this yet as I'm happy just turning stuff off and on, setting volume, changing channels,  and other general commands.  Will explore more someday.
