We purchased this for my 10 year old son as a Christmas gift and couldn't be happier.  He is an artist at heart and the application to draw something with a picture you take with your iPad is phenomenal.  He literally has a drawing of each member of our house as well as many friends who have come over.  I am highly impressed with this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a gift that is a bit out of the box.  The only drawback is that you have to completely remove the iPad from the protective case to use it.  This is a little scary for us to allow our son to use it without its protective case.  We haven't had an issue with him dropping it yet, but we monitor him pretty closely when he is using it.
