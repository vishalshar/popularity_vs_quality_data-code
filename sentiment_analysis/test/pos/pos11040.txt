My first device was defective however, Misfit's customer service was very helpful and sent a new Ray. So far so good. I'm used to a screen so adjusting to the LED indicator will take some getting used to but I love the form factor and that I can wear it next to my watch, as it just looks like a bracelet. I also like not having to charge the Ray.  Just one less thing to worry about plugging in. I will say that, like some other reviews state, the color is not black. It is really a graphite grayish color. I look forward to the paracord band that is advertised if and when it is released.Overall, this is a sharp looking tracker that gives basic data to help motivate.
