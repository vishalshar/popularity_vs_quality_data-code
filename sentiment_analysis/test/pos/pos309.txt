I bought this product for my sister for Christmas. It literally stole the show. I was so happy to give her a gift that she truly loved. It felt so good to give something that she will literally use everyday. I'm so very happy with my purchase. The unit works great. At first we tried it with a synthetic cork bottle and as the description says, it didn't reseal completely. This was a problem because when we retapped the synthetic cork the gas escaped from the first needle hole so it didn't work. The next day we tried a regular corked bottle and when we removed the needle we held the bottle upside down and it was completely resealed. I'm so happy that I bought this for my sister. I know she will get lots of use from it and it has made us both very happy. We call it Christmas sorcery because its just unbelievable how awesome this product really functions. I highly recommend it. Give it as a gift to your wine loving friends and you will not regret it. It's such a very cool product I can't sing its praises enough.
