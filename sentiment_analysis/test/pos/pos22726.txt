If you own the Posh s700, this is like the delux model of that.......this has 4g LTE, a better screen and a little better battery. My first test to decide if I would keep this is actually the speaker volume......I enjoy speaking calls while driving.......this passed easily....you get sound from both the front and rear speaker, depending on what your listening too. The calls are crisp and loud.....the screen is beautiful with no wash out and is nice from all angles. Netflix is smooth and volume is very nice.....you can go into sound setting to tweet audio also.....which greatly improved audio volume. The camera is nice for what it is and for what I do......this phone passed all my picky tests so I a keeping it as my primary and selling my old blu phone which is also 7 inches.....if Posh wants to really hit a home run, they need about a 3500mah battery in this, not a tiny 2800mah battery. It will, last you on heavy use about 1 full day or two day with medium use. There are so many solid things about this phone, that I will be ok with battery. Nobody gave me a phone for review, I paid full price on Amazon and thought this might help you decide. Thank you.
