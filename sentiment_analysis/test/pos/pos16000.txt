After fiddling around with poster board, white sheets, paper, and various methods of lamps & lighting, I still wasn't getting great shots of my collections. Not to mention it was frustrating & time-consuming. I wanted something that was self-contained with lights & backgrounds, easy to use & store, and took great photos. Shotbox fills the bill! The major problem with my DIY setups was glare & shadows. Shotbox totally eliminated that. My order arrived in a few days & everything was packed well, marked clearly, and a breeze to assemble. My first shots were with a Panasonic Lumix 16 megapixel compact camera set to Intelligent Auto. Plenty of holes in the top of the Shotbox, as well as additional positions & lighting with the Sideshot. The LED lights were very bright and the 4 included backdrops unrolled without any wrinkles. Everything is intelligently designed & it folds down easily for flat storage. I like that the lighting gets plugged into an outlet, rather than having to be re-charged via a USB cable to a computer. And the extra USB outlet on the Shotbox is handy to keep your camera or smartphone charged.My only negatives are very slight ones. It's fairly expensive at $150 for the amateur photographer. And I wish the sides were smooth, not corrugated, though that may have been necessary for lighting purposes. And I wish it came in a larger size, maybe 24" to accomodate bigger items. Lastly, the included storage bag is rather cheap-looking, made of that material that resembles half-cotton, half-paper.I did find it necessary to use a basic photo-editing program to brighten up my pictures a bit. That said, I almost always use software (as most pro photogs do) for all my pictures. It's not a necessity, but I felt it produced a better shot.Be sure to check out Shotbox's website for a lot of info & videos. I ordered the remote shutter release from Shotbox & their customer service was very good.
