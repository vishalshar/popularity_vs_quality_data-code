This is my third 3D printer, and after a few days with it I wish it was my first. The other two models were both Prusa i3 kits from another seller here on Amazon. While self-assembly isn't a horrible idea, it comes with a lot of work and a good deal of risk. With other models, I've easily spent ~$200 just in replacement parts/upgrades as I figured things out. With the ROBO 3D R1 Plus, I was up and running within minutes (which is a MAJOR departure from other models, which required days of calibration to get running). To date, I've printed in PLA, ABS and PETG without a single problem.I've been able to print on the bed with the included glue stick, and haven't had any bed adhesion issues past the first two days of work with it. Having come from a reprep model, I know generally how this machine works and that experience helps, but ROBO 3D's support forums have plenty of answers you might be searching for.About the only test this machine has yet to pass is the test of time, but I have absolutely no complaints with it yet. I don't think I will, going forward.
