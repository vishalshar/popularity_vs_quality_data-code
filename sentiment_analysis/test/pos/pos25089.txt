Works very well at providing fill-in lighting for video chats. Small, battery powered (rechargeable), fits over a laptop screen, and puts out a lot of light. If you need a fill-in light for doing video chats, video conference calls, etc. from rooms where you can't arrange to have a room/table light in front of your face, this is the best option I've found.Downsides (and the reasons for four stars instead of a full five):- The clip that holds the light in place runs the full width of the light and is very secure. The downside is that when the hole for the camera is lined up over the camera, the clip blocks my laptop's built in microphone. Measure the distance between camera and mic on your device first.- Putting the fill-in light right on the same plane as the screen works OK for short chats, but staring into the bright light, which is mounted right over the camera, is too much during longer video calls (unless you're a TV news anchor and used to staring into studio lights). So I use this for short video calls, but for longer calls I rearrange the room so that there's a desk lamp illuminating my face.Bottom line: Great product for shorter chats, and priced cheaply enough to be worth buying even if you don't use it all the time. Too bright and glaring and close to the screen for longer video calls.
