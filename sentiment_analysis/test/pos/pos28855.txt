We made 4 pancakes for the first time last night and they tasted amazing! we had wished we had made more. We are planning on having them for dinner again tonight they are so good! No need for butter on the pancakes just maple syrup and you are good to go. Cannot wait to try the other products such a great company.Thank You!!
