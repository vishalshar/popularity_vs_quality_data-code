This android based phone has so many new features compared to my previous phone that I may be a bit over-enthused. I can check my email easily and pretty much use all of my favourite apps - big plus.One of the first things that you will need to do is pop in a 16 or 32gb microSD card. The back of the phone does not snap off very easily so be careful or you will bruise your fingers like I did. The instructions are in tiny font and not in proper English but readable. There is a screen protector and simple earphones along with the expected adapter and battery in the box.I could only fit one regular sim card; the other needs to be microsim. The keyboard may take some getting used to, but that is what autocomplete is for.And you are not buying this phone for it's camera. Enjoy.
