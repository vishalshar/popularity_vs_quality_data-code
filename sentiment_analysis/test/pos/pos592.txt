Saw it on DIY's "I Want That" show and found the best pricing on Amazon.  We used the product on a pair of running shoes where the laces were too long and always had to double tie to keep them from coming untied.  Now, no more problems!  The shoes stay equally as snug due to the elasticity of the product and now it's slip on, slip off.  Will be ordering more and replacing all our laces.
