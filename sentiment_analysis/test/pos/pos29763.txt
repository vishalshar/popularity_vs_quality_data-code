Pro: Product as described. Arrived in padded envelope with instruction paper & packets in resealable plastic bag.Con: No tracking information given. Took 1 week from order date to arrive but couldn't ascertain shipping status since there was no tracking information.Recommend Product: Yes, Good in emergency; saves having to hunt for scarce bottled water.Answer to question: You do not need survival bag. Each packet is designed for any container/bucket with 1 gallon/2.5 litre capacity. If you use more than 1 packet, just multiply the container's/bucket's capacity. The container/bucket interior needs to be clean/non-rusted before filling with water. Hope this helps. V G
