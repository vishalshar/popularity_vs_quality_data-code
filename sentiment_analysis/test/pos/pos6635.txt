I have used up one bottle and ordered my 2nd.  We mostly use it when we grill fish or vegetables, or stir-fry - it doesn't smoke or burn.  I even tried it in a cookie recipe and it was great. My understanding is that it is a very healthful oil. This oil has little or no taste - if you want the avocado taste for salads or adding to a cooked dish, use the extra virgin oil by the same company. The packaging is as pictured and it is bottled in California.
