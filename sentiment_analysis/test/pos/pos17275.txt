I have owned a Honey and now the Finder. What a leap forward. I never had a problem with the Honey, had it on my key ring for over a year, saved me several times.The Finder takes that performance and increases the range and the "Find me tune" is much louder.For those of you that have never had one of these, read up and understand the products limitations. To the guys in Washington State that are designing these, Thanks for listening and not standing still. We told you we wanted something more durable and you listened.Hat's off to the team!
