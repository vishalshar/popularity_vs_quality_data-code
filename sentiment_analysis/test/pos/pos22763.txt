I used to work as a laser nurse and the wavelengths for this product checks out.  It's very easy and simple to use, I am a busy mom and even I can fit this into my daily routine (only 5 minutes a day and you just have to lay or sit in front of it).  I've been using this for about 2 weeks now and my skin looks more luminous, I can't wait to get even more results!!
