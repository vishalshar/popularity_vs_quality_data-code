I use this with iPhone 6 Case, FlexionÂ™ [Euphoria Series] and it works great. I have a VW Jetta and it fits and stays on the vents. The phone has never fallen off and I've been driving all over in the last 2 weeks with some hard stops. The phone does sometimes very slightly move to one direction because of the car vibration, but it's just the phone moving, so just adjust it. It comes with 2 metal plates. One small one for outside the case and a large one for inside the case. I stuck the bigger plate on my phone like the instructions said. To prevent scratching there is a clear sticker that goes on first. It's a little hard to get the case off, but it's fine since I don't plan on changing it too often.I do have a little sticky-wallet on the back of my case for my credit cards. I usually take it off when driving because I'm not sure if the magnet will de-magnetize them and I don't feel like trying.
