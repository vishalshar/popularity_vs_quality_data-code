Hello Mike!This review is unbiased as any could get, and I give you permission to quote me.  I love Posh phones.  I will buy no other.  I had the Posh Memo 580 and loved it.  Served me well.Now I have the Posh L700 Pro Lte, and I even love this one better.  The Bluetooth is very fast.  My car picks it up right away.  The other phone I had, I had to keep turning off and on to connect the Bluetooth.  From a 1-10. I gave it a 9.5?  The price is good. They dropped the price, a week after I bought mine.  Amazon told me to return it, but I did not want to take the chance not getting it again.  The reason I gave it a 9.5 is that the camera is not that sharp.  The pictures can be seen, but not as sharp as the Memo 580.  I don't know if it is something I am doing wrong, because I a not that tech. Savvy.  I do not think any other phones will be able to tempt me to leave MY Posh phones.  I am totally sold out to Posh.  Anyone that does not have one is losing out big time.Thanks  for making me happy, and keep up the good work.  God bless!Sincerely,Fredricka
