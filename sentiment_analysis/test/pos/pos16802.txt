I wasn't sure what to expect but I was very pleased with the results.  I coach a 9/10 year old football team and we had a terrible case of the drops. After an 11 drop game I needed to try something new.  We used Grip boost this past Sunday and we put up 28 points without a single drop .  There was a noticeable tackiness back on the gloves as if they were fresh out of the package.  I would strongly recommend this product to any youth coach or parent looking to get extra miles out of their kids gloves and to give them a huge confidence boost
