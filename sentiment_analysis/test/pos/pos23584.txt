Proto pasta's stainless steel filament is one of the more interesting filaments that I use for my prints. I have not encountered any problems with printing this filament. But be ware the filament is very abrasive and can and will eat thought the top of your extruder if it is left grinding on the top without tubing. Also you will need to buy high lubricity nozzles for this since it will eventually make your nozzle hole bigger. I have not noticed any damage on my nozzles at the moment but i'm sure that it is happening. Prints come out really nice with little to no imperfects. and the neat part is that this filament is polishable. I still haven't perfected polishing any of my prints but I have gotten some results. Overall this is a very enjoyable material to print with, I would recommend 3d printer owners to try it.
