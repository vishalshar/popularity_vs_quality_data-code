I like to keep a bag of these in the car for the whole family to snack on when hunger strikes.  These are also great to put out at parties for a refreshing alternative to the norm.  Be sure to leave the bag next to the bowl so no one thinks it's potpourri.  While, yes, we do like regular chips better.  These are a healthy snack alternative to have on hand.  They are nice and crisp with a slightly sweet cinnamon taste.
