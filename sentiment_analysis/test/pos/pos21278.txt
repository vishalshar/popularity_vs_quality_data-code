I have been suffering from psoriasis on my knees for years. My husband, having watched me increase my steroids without success, researched and bought this detox bath as a Christmas gift. I thought he was sweet but there was no way sitting in a bath with seaweed would help. I was so wrong! I have been shocked at the improvement in my skin and my comfort level. I am now a loyal customer looking forward to short season for the first time in 3 years.
