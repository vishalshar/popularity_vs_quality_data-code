Tried numerous smart plugs that also track energy usage.  This is the best, works locally and remotely and is compatible with virtually all systems.  I can control it with my Wink app, the included remote control, or with Amazon Alexa.  Graphs and charts energy usage.  Gives real time usage, and daily, weekly, monthly and cumulative usage.  Very happy with this,  The second best unit I've found is the Elegato Eve, but it is bluetooth, so only works locally.
