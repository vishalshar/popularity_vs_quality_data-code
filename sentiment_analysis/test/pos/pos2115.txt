Easy to open, stays closed. Smooth outside feels comfortable to hold for long periods of time. Looks nice and does not wear with time.  Holds my drivers license and five other cards, some business cards and some cash (I did take a power tool to the plastic between the cards and iPhone to open up more space). I tried four different cases in an effort to replace my wallet, and this one fits the bill. Stop reading this review and buy this case. Cheers.
