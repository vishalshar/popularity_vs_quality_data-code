I bought this as a gift but I was able to try it out myself. It may take some time getting used to and is definitely not a gift for a non-arts and crafts kid, but great for teenagers (even adults). I suggest printing out some templates to try out first like your name or the eiffel tower. I might even grab one for myself just to fix or touch up some of my 3D prints at work
