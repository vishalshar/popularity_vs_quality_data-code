Awesome "keychain" and very handy.  Several friends have purchased one after seeing/using it.Tough as nails.  Unfortunately I left my keys on a family member's car hauler.  Keys went with the hauler down the road and fell off in the middle of the street.  45 minutes later I when I found the keys, they had likely been run over 5-10 times by car haulers and tow trucks.  A couple keys were bent, the key "ring" was mangled, and the USB portion of the cable had the *slightest bend which was easily bent back.  Otherwise, the cable still looks new and works perfectly.  Any other cable would have been destroyed.
