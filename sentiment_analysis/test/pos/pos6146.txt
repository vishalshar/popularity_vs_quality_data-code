Awesome idea - works pretty well.  The web / mobile needs a lot more features to help manage large photo sets this includes:1.  Ability to filter photos by (Double tap, User selected Favrouites, and Auto Favourites).2.  Ability to easily and quickly delete photos with a swipe like tinder type system.3.  Easy functionality to share photos, sets of photos to an external photo storage solution such as dropbox, amazon drive, google photos, flickr etc.
