This is a really cool product with a great design, it's fun and easy to wear and comes in attractive colors. It's a very practical fitness tracking band that you can easily wear on your wrist or even your ankle. I found it to be affordable, and it's nice because you don't even need to charge it, however, once it does die, you will need to buy a replacement battery. I did end up returning this, because it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I got this for my boyfriend's birthday since he's a weight lifter and hasn't been seeing any progress, I thought the Personal Coach with this would really help him, he also does other types of workouts like kickboxing and obviously cardio, but this just wasn't what we were looking for. Despite our returning the product, I still thought it was great. It works well and it's easy to use. I would recommend this to most people, just be sure that this is the type of fitness tracker that YOU are looking for, don't just buy it for the looks, versatility, or price.
