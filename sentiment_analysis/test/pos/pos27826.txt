Got my kit, followed the directions, but forgot to mist on day 6 . I awoke in the middle of the night and figured I'd give it a spray, I was actually startled when I saw mushrooms sticking out 3 inches !! When I misted on day 5 there was nothing. When I read you'd have mushrooms in 10 days I was very skeptical. Now I am pleasantly surprised, I'm going to cook them tomorrow , hope they taste as good as they look.
