Recently used on a weeklong business trip and absolutely a fantastic suitcase to travel with. I was very concerned about the wheels when I saw another post about the suitcases wheels wanting to drift. I was definitely surprised at how easily this rolls on the wheels with a noticeable blue elegant and sturdy wheels .. I would say I had a hard time at first getting my phone to scan for the suite case but after a few tries.. it find it all the time . The interior perfect of weeklong needs having packed two pairs of shoes, a weeks worth of business attire as well as causal clothes, I didn't even need to take extra carry on . The most important about this suite case is the security.  Controlled lock , knowing where the suite case is at all time knowing the weight of the suite case all these feature through WIFI app was a genius ideasI had a few episode where my phone run out of battery I couldnt reach someone to pick me up or in general  making those important calls at the airport . With this suite case .I have peace of mind I can charge my phone at all time and wont miss or make those important callsNo regrets at all with this suitcase
