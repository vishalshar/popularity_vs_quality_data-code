Got off to a rough start as the first set I put on the my motorcycle would not see my phone.Return of first set was not a problem at all.  Credited my account the day UPS said it was picked up.The second one arrived for my other motorcycle.  I put it on my touring motorcycle and followed the instructions again.  It paired up immediately.  I ran the bike from Colorado to Yellowstone National Park.  Flawless performance from the product.Excellent product, great customer service with the return and very nice design.
