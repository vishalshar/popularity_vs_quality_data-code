So I decided to set up a "connected" home that could be controlled through Alexa. I knew I wanted to start with a color bulb then move to a couple more bulbs and finally to plugs, cameras, etc. As far as the color bulb, I had to choose between the LIFX and the Hue. From all of my research, the LIFX had much better color than the Hue. The Hue also needed a dedicated hub. Since my long term plan was to control more than lights so I knew I would need a central hub. After doing some research, I settled on the Smartthings hub. I could get the hub for about $100, 2 regular LEDs for about $15 each, and the LIFX for about $60. The LIFX's cloud account could communicate with the Smartthings hub bet was not dependent on the hub. That means I could start off with the LIFX and move on from there. For about $190, I would have lighting for the first room with a hub ready for upgrades to non-light controlled things.If I went the Hue route, I'd be in $200 for 3 color bulbs or $140 for 1 color and 2 white bulb. The latter would cheaper for the lights than the LIFX/Smartthings route but I would still need to add the $100 hub later. So that brings me to where I am now.My LIFX bulb came in today so I started to install it. After about an hour, I was still troubleshooting it. During the setup, the app suggested I "claim" the bulb so it could be controlled from the internet. I'd choose "ok" and the app would tell me there was an issue and ask me if I wanted to retry. I'd click retry and the app would tell me there was an issue and ask if I wanted to retry. I'd click retry and the app asked me...well...I'm sure you can guess what the app asked me. Eventually I clicked cancel. I went to the bulb settings screen (when the bulb was showing as online) and I was unable to get to the bulb's settings screen. The Edit button was replaced by an Update button. That took more than a few tries to get it to actually update the bulb's firmware.After a little more than an hour, it appeared the LIFX was set up, working, and finally connected to Alexa. The color is great. There are a few shades of white. And Alexa could be told to turn on and off the bulb or to change the brightness. I could never get Alexa to "Tell LIFX to change the color to red". Apparently it does not understand LIFX. But the simple on/off and dim seemed to work.Unless it didn't. The bulb would frequently show up in the app as offline despite nothing having had changed. More often than not, Alexa would tell me that it was unable to communicate with the device and suggested I check the device's internet connection. Of course, the app also showed the bulb as offline. Sometimes the bulb would come back online. Sometimes I would kill the iOS app and the light would show connected when I started the app again, but this wouldn't necessarily mean Alexa could see it. Other times I would have to turn off the light switch and turn it back on, essentially restarting the bulb and allowing it to connect to the network again.After looking at the FAQ on the website, I read that it helps to have the router set for specific channels rather than auto. I set it to 11 about 20 minutes prior to this review. After restarting the bulb, it was able to be seen. I have not decided if I am keeping this thing. It hardly seems like a commercial product. It seems to be closer to a beta test item in its latter stages of testing. I will give it a day or so to see if it continues to lose its connection. Unless the connection reliability greatly improves from setting the specific channel, I will be spending the extra money to got the Hue route.Update: I would recommend this light to anyone who absolutely needs (or really really wants) color. If white is the only thing needed, my suggestion would be to go with a hub and a connected bulb, especially if there's any chance they would be expanding their system. Please read my below reply to the manufacturer for the rest of my review.
