A must have for hikers, urban explorers, or anyone who can't avoid getting sweaty to or from work (those of you lucky enough to ride a bike to the office, for example).The shower pill is pretty expensive at $1 per use, but when you stink from a long day out and about and can't get to a shower before needing to get cleaned up, these are absolutely invaluable. I've used about 5-6 so far and every time I'm surprised by how one sheet (and they're not very big at all) can absorb/eliminate dirt from pretty much your whole body.I don't know what kind of black magic they use to make these things, but I fully support it.
