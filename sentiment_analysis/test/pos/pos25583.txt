This thing is all kinds of rad. They're not kidding when they say you can't knock it over, and whereas it only took me a few minutes to figure out how they were doing this, I'm still impressed with the "magic trick" they're employing with this mug. I LOVE gadgets, and like to give really clever ones as presents to my parents on various occasions, so I chose this for Mother's Day. It was a hit, and my Mom loved it. So, kudos Mighty Mug, you made my Mom happy, as well as me :)
