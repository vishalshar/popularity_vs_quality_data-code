I started out printing with ABS and have never used anything but,  I will soon have a second printer running and plan to use PLA in it since it is not enclosed which is sometimes needed with ABS. Just got a spool of AIO PLA today and have run a few small prints and am very impressed with it. no warping and layer adhesion was very good! Will defiantly be buying more!
