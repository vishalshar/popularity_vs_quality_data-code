I have front hairline loss and thinning from medications that are vital to my life. I've tried several top brands of hair fibers and powders. This product is noticeably superior, finer particles that stay in place, and the fibers seem to add body, too, though I don't use more than needed to conceal scalp.I spritz hair spray (volume type) after sprinkling it in place. Lasts til next shampoo!
