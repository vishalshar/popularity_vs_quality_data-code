I first saw the dot grid notepad at moleskine but I wanted to try out a different brand. I like the clean design of the product. What made me really buy this notepad was the dotted grid on left and lines on right side of the page. I can easily sketch on the left side without any distraction of the lines and take notes or list items on the right. Love the notepad so far.
