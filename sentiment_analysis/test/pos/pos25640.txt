Life saver! Our two year old was having several night terrors a week each lasting over an hour. Lully worked the very first night. She has had a few night terrors since we started using Lully but the majority of nights she sleeps all night.  We could not be happier with our Lully! Thank you Lully for helping our family sleep.
