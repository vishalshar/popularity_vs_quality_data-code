I've always like sleeping with a fan but after a year in the Philippines I became accustomed to the constant noise of a fan all day long. When winter came and the circulation of air in my bedroom was too cold I became desperate for a noise blocker to drown out the TV or to just keep me company. I've been told "There's an app for that!" but every app is still a digital sound coming from an iPhone speaker. It just doesn't work. I was short on money and nervous to buy this one which has a more limited sound selection, but decided to give it a try. It is TINY! So much smaller than I realized but that's not a bad thing! I love that it has a rechargeable battery and I can toss it in a suitcase for an overnight. The limited sound options aren't a problem at all. I've found two fan noises I really like. I think I'm becoming addicted to it...
