I have a Macbook Pro and since they changed the input ports, I decided to try this attachment. For the record I do not like Apple's decision to change the ports as they did.This attachment works quite well and fits flately on the side of my 15" laptop. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that you have to be careful when removing things that you've added for use such as USB plugs etc. The unit plugs into the computer at one end so if you just try to pull the USB out you may end up with problems. It's best to pull the whole unit from the computer or make sure you firmly hold it before pulling the USB etc from it.Even with that it's a great unit that adds more versatility to a single port that I wish hadn't been changed.
