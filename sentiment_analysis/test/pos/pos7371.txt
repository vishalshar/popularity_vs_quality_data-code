The dogs loved these and entertained them for quite awhile!  100% natural and edible..not like the white "rawhide" chews.  Be forewarned!  When you open the bag the smell is intense..it disperses, dogs are kept busy and this is a treat for them!  I bought these and will order again;  I like this company and the stuff is natural no artificial added stuff to make dogs want the treats.
