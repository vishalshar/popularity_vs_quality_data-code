UPDATE: I must give credit when credit is due. My D-link received a firmware update and it now indicates whether it is on or off. The app is greatly enhanced as well. This bodes well!Original review:Do you remember the mechanical timers we used to get for our Christmas lights, or for watering the garden? It seems like it was just yesterday, when we could wire together clunky appliances for our home automation projects. Now we have these newfangled smartphones and Wi-Fi routers. What to do?The D-Link Wi-FI Smart Plug gives you a whiff of 1985, in a seemingly modern package! It's the best of both worlds. You can go around entering passkeys and downloading apps, just like the kids do with their Instragrams. But when it's all set up, you can only configure your Smart Plug in the exact same way you would back in the days! Just set the start and stop times (you don't need plastic pegs, though, but you have to tap the screen), sit back, watch Ghostbusters and listen to some Michael Jackson.The nice thing about the Dlink app, is that there is none of this fancy technology, like geofencing. I mean, who needs to be able to have their fire-hazard-appliance turned off when they leave the house? Well, in 1985, we'd just let the house burn down. Also, with all this talk of "Internet of Things" and "App integration", do we really need anyone else connecting to the Smart Plug? No! The Dlink app is all we will ever need, together with its Dlink appliances. Just like we will never need a refrigerator that is not a Frigidaire, and a car that is not an Oldsmobile.The Dlink app won't tell you if someone turned the Smart Plug on or off by pressing the button. That would be too high-tech, too... 2015? Besides, what's wrong with walking to the Smart Plug to see if it's on? It's got a light on it! Sure, it is technically possible to leave the plug on and not find out about it until we get home to a charred house. But that is just the way things were in 1985, and we did just fine.
