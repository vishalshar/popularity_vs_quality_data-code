I bought this to use with our Amazon echo. It works well and responds directly to commands. Nothing else is needed.Setup was fairly easy. I downloaded the Wink app, read through the tutorial. One note - there is absolutely no documentation in the box. It simply refers you to the app. Once you get the app, the tutorial is fairly good. I initially had a problem with my pivot not turning orange as the instructions said it should. The app guided me through a reset process, and that worked fine.Following others tips, I turned my screen up to full brightness when configuring the pivot. It configured quickly. I named the outlets, connected my Wink account to Echo, and we were off to the races.I did have to do a bit of searching to learn how to group the outlets. It's done in the Alexa app, not the Wink app, so far as I could find (I wanted to turn both off with one command).  The grouping command doesn't always work - but it does most of the time. Commands to turn each outlet on and off do work fine.I plan to use this primarily with Echo and I'm pleased after testing it.
