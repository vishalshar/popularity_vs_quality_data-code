I bought this lamp for my husband but do look at it more than he does since we sit across from each other.  I think it's unobtrusive, which is an improvement on the lamp it replaced, and seems to give off good light (not sure how the no bulb part works but I guess we will find out at some point). He doesn't seem quite as delighted with it as I am and I do offer to switch back to the old one and take this one to work but so far he hasn't taken me up on the offer.  It's a little expensive for not delighted.
