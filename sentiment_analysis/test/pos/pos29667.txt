This is a great gaming laptop for those who want to stick on a budget.Pros:-Fast specs, including the Nvidia graphics card-Fairly light compared to other laptop competitors-Ethernet jack-Can upgrade to 16 GB of RAM-Speakers (sound) are great-Zero bloatware and random 3rd party apps (this is a huge plus)-Backlit keyboardCons:-Screen could be brighter-Battery life is average-Keys are a bit small-The casing around the screen/lid is a bit flimsy (not as solid as a Macbook, but not a deal breaker either).-Some text on software applications is blurry (as one reviewer wrote, this can be fixed by going to Properties -> Compatibility -> checkmark Disable display scaling on high DPI settings).Gaming experience:-World of Warcraft (WoW) in Ultra settings worked fine.-League of Legends (LoL) in Medium settings was just "ok." The max FPS I could get was about 32 during heavy battle fights.-Cities Skylines in highest video settings started off great, but the more mods you collected throughout the game began to eat the RAM (up to 7GB). Either turn off the mods you don't want/use or upgrade to 16 GB of RAM.-Civilization 4 (yes, it's old) works fine in the default screen resolution but crashes when you try to go up to 1920*1080.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to a friend. I really like this laptop and use it for music, too.(FYI - the battery will not charge until it falls under 95%).
