It is wonderful.  I just measure up my coffee and my water, put the unit in the fridge over night and have smooth great tasting coffee in the morning. When I finish it in the morning I just repeat the process for the afternoon.People have writteen the process is confusing and messy to clean up, I haven't seen that issue at all.  It's simple, 25g of coffee, I roast my own - even better, and 300ml of water and your done easy peasy.  Clean-up the whole thing comes apart which makes cleaning a snap.
