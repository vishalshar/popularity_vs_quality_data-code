We love this device. My husband and me monitor our blood pressures regularly. And on days when one of us forgets (more like when too long has gone by without checking bp) the instrument beeps to remind us.I took away one star (I would take away just half a star if i could)for initial setup difficulty. But ever since we set it up we have never had any issues.Great helpful customer service!
