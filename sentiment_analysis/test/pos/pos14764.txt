TL:DR: For the price of $600~ it is worth it. But I would not recommend to people who have issues with reflexes/movement and bumps.Locations used as scooter: Streets and sidewalks city and neighborhoodLocations used folded: entering gates, stairs, escalators, crowded train (used standing up)Pros: size, weight and practicalCons:-FOLDING DESIGN is a pull-pin that you have to use more effort than expected.ex. To Unfold: you get down, pull pin out, apply/maintain pressure on scooter in unfolded position and then push pin back in to lock in unfolded position.ex. To Fold: put kickstand up, do handlebars, pull pin out, fold, push pin inA simple step release/lever would've been more efficient especially in crowded areas. I can still do the motion in a couple of seconds, but I do worry someone may walk into me during busy commutes.-WHEELS are slick on painted and rainy surfaces.. be careful..-HANDLEBAR wiggles. Whole piece is solid and feels sturdy, but the handlebar will wiggle-HANDLEBAR STEM: Make sure this is tightened. Mine became loose over time and my handlebar height went down during motion-SUSPENSION: there is none. Haha so watch out for those potholes. You'll feel it.-MAX SPEED: 15 mph it's a good speed, but when battery goes lower you will slow down. I would charge between trips
