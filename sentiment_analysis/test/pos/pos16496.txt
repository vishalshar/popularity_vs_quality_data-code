If you have the kind of kid who describes reptiles as "adorable," then this may be for you.  It's fun to play withm but it takes a while to learn the controls-- my son got this for his 5th birthday and can't read yet.  Therefore, I had to read the directions.  Is he going to remember to push this button/that button/this button to put it into hunter mode or guard mode?  Nope.  Maybe he is too young for its complexity.  But he loves just turning it on and watching it and making it walk back and forth.One caveat-- this thing is crazy hard to de-package.  They actually screwed its feet into the bottom, so you'll need a long-handled Phillips screwdriver that's thin enough to fit into the little opening. I had to get my husband's huge screwdriver kit out and try several before finding one that fit.  It took an hour to get it out, put the batteries in, and set it up.  Was that just operator error?  Perhaps.  But add that to the hundreds of ties and tape they put all over it, and I wanted to throw it out the window. So, be sure you either have someone who can do that stuff or that you're sufficiently caffeinated and calm.
