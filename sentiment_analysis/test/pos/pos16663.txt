I bought the yoghurt maker to make QUARK, which is a product that is used in lots of German baking Recipes and is hard to find in US. Made it last night and it turned out beautiful.  Put 4 cups of cold Buttermilk in Container, set timer on 12 hrs. Put in strainer and other container and drain for 6 hrs. in Frig.  Can't wait to make German Cheesecake with it.  This afternoon I will make Greek Yoghurt.  A wonderful product.  Highly recommend
