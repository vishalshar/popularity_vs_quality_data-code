These are great. This would be a five-star rating if they worked perfectly in sneakers that have an up and down shoelace hole instead of just a hole (See Photo)Either way, i was looking for a shoelace-less experience and that is exactly what i got with the Hickies. After trying out all of the suggested lacing options, i finally found one that worked and I haven't looked back since.Getting ready for the gym is as easy as just slipping my sneakers on, and they keep them snug and stylish.
