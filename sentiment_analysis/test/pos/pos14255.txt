I've had this for over a year and I can honestly say it's the only wet-food feeder my cat can't break into. I've tried them all. Every other feeder I've tried my cat simply laughed at before proceeding to nimbly deconstruct.Pros:Easy to useImpossible to hack (for the cat, at least)Easy to cleanCons:Low camera resolution (but why the hell do I want to watch my cat eat, anyway? I'm busy. Got other things to do.)One other "con" heavily outweighed by a "pro": I've had some technical issues with my feeder relating both to the motor and main circuit board. I will say that both Alex and Marissa have provided exceptional customer service and each time resolved the problem with professionalism and empathy. You can tell they are very proud of their company and work hard to make it thrive.I am very happy with this product. It ain't cheap, but it will work better than anything else out there on the market.
