We plugged in our first Withings wireless scale (a Withings WS-50 Smart Body Analyzer, Black) on 19 March 2014 and at least one member of our family has used it almost every day since then. We added an updated model of the scale along the way too, so we're very familiar with Withings products..I was excited to get a chance to try this new scale. The ability to track cardio health was fascinating to me since I took up running a year and a half ago and am a frequent half-marathon runner, currently training for my first full marathon in a month. I really hoped that I would see a lot of metrics and data, and to a degree I have not been disappointed, but for some reason I was expecting more. Especially from the app.The setup was pretty straight forward and faster than installing previous scales. The Withings App recognized the new scale and added it. Getting my data to sync properly required a few tries though. I was on and off the scale several times getting the new scale to recognize me. My wife had to do the same, so its not the most seamless transition ever, but it works.If youre upgrading, or just eager to see what your cardio health looks like, you have to wait for five weigh-ins (realistically 5 days if you weigh in every day at the same time as recommended) before it will even give you a baseline for your cardio health. Thats not a show stopper, but its like waiting for batteries for that new toy you got a Christmas before you can use it. Once you do get your five weigh-ins, it starts at that point, so you need to weigh in for another week before you get any decent pattern.Once those first five days passed, there was a new widget on my app that says Pulse Wave Velocity and shows my speed as 6.8 m/s. Clicking on that measurement, it pulls up a chart (that will of course be populated over time) with a single dot in the normal range. Of course this is all an initial assessment, and over time, Ill have charts of data like I currently do for weight, fat mass and lean mass, but for the first week of use, it is a bit underwhelming. I think Im most disappointed in the fact that I believe Im in excellent physical shape and after a steady week of taking measurements, I'm squarely in the normal range, and not really close to the Optimal zone. I finish half-marathons in the top 5% of finishers, so I'd like to think that I'm closer to optimal. But then maybe I need to get that checked.My biggest complaint about this scale is really the (IOS) app. Its basically the same app as always  which means its a bit clunky and sterile. After a couple of tries, I finally found where it keeps the new measurements like body water percent, muscle mass percent and bone mass percent, but since I only have a few measurements, this actually looks pretty suspect. Over the last several days my bone mass has stayed steady, but muscle mass and water percentage seems to have dropped > 3% quickly. Im going to assume that like the previous body fat percentages from the older scale, these measurements are gross approximations that should be viewed as trends instead of hard-and-fast measurements.The body fat percentage is something that over time has confused me. I lost a significant amount of weight last year and a half and my body fat percentage from the old scale showed me falling from a measurement of about 31% in early 2015 to a very consistent 19-20 percent for the last twelve months.  While setting up the new scale I found a setting for athletic body type for measuring body composition and since then, my measurements come in at a consistent 11% body fat. <<Follow-up:>> After investing in a pair of calipers that are supposed to be accurate, it appears that my body type is "normal" and not athletic according to the scale. The calipers and the non-athlete mode measurements are very close, so after some trial and error - I have determined that I definitely do not have an athletic body.This scale works well with MyFitnessPal, and that is a big plus. After you weigh in, the data is transferred wirelessly to the app, and then that feeds right into MyFitnessPal. That works great. A new feature that has popped up in the Withings App is a widget that shows my calorie budget, how much I have consumed and the remaining calories for the day. This is all pulled from MyFitnessPal  but the only inconsistency that I see is that the goals in Withings are different than the goals in My Fitness Pal. I assume that requires separate tuning, but its only a minor distraction.So aside from replacing the steps walked widget with the Pulse Wave Velocity chart, the app, on the surface has not changed much. I was hoping for more colorful graphs as seen on the website, but not this go around. Ive attached a few screen shots, three from the website (two colorful ones and a chart that shows the additional measurements that this offers over earlier versions of the scale) and three screen shots from the app.In the end I really need more time (like months) to see what the long-term measurements are and the patterns they show. Thats how Im looking at most of the measurements (besides the weight)  Just patterns. The old scale, and this one have in common that they both do not seem to measure my heart rate accurately. I am told this is possibly because I have significant bradycardia, and my normal pulse rate hovering about 39 bpm does not work well with many HR devices. This Withings scale seems no exception, however, it does show my HR to be a consistent 20 BPM below the last scale. So that shows some sort of improvement to me. Ironically, my wife says that her HR is consistently around 89 BPM on the scale where she's usually 69 BPM in real life (confirmed the Dr's office). Neither one of us trust the heart rate feature of this scale. I believe that the heart rate is measured via an algorithm and not actually counting heart beats. I can't prove it, but that seems to account for the wildly different readings in my house.Bottom Line: I think that people who are just starting off with a Smart Scale or looking for a better smart scale than what they have will be pleased with this product. I like the consistency and the weight measurements have always been right in-line with the Doctors scale and the calibrated gym scale. So I trust the weight measurements. Im still figuring out the Pulse Wave Velocity  and I am initially suspicious of the new water%, bone% and muscle%, but over time, I think they will help paint a good picture of my overall health, and that is the ultimate goal.
