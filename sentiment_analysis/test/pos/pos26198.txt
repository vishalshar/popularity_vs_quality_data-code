The TarDisk ordered from amazon did not have pear, which took me a lot of time to figure out. The customer service Marina has been very helpful in guiding me format the tardisk and install required programs. It is running well. If TarDisk can post the protocol on their website, it will be very helpful for others who may have similar experience.
