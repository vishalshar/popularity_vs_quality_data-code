This is little but mighty with over 10 different sounds from the ocean to several different fans. The top curve rotates so you can move the sound to where you want it.  I would advise that you will need a SBU cord to recharge it.  I use the one from my I-phone. The speaker is very strong and clear and serves the purpose better than expected.
