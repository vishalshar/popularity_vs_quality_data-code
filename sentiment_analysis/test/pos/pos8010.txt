I am a verified purchaser and am going to give an honest review.  Many of the other reviewers are not verified purchaser's  so its hard to believe a 5 star rating when your not a verified purchaser.  I was ecstatic to set this up the day i received it.  Its safe to say this is still nee and developing technology, so be understanding when its not 100% yet.  They developers and the principles of this company truely want to make you happy and will go to great lengths to get you up and running.  There is a learning curve and its not perfect yet.  I am an early adopter of products and i have been through many upgrades and enhancements on the Echo and i have two of them because i love it.  The app was easy to setup and did work to control my Vizio TV volume and my Motorola Cable box did setup and work pretty well once I got the hang of it.  I am getting a replacent for mine as it goes to sleep too quickly and I cant get it to wake up very easily.  But, the developers were quick to offer assistance and were willing to call me directly to push an update, but i am soo busy with work and baseball, i wanted them to send me one with the latest firmware.  I will post later how it performs
