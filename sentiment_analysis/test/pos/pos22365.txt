I had no idea just how much I was getting when I ordered this toy for my nieces.  Seeing the words "3 foot dragonfly" is one thing but actually seeing and feeling the assembled version of this toy is truly something special.  My nieces are 5 and 7 and both love this toy. The 7 year old definitely had an easier time following the instructions but the 5 year old liked that the instruction page doubled as a coloring sheet.  Unlike some other "Eco" toys I've seen in stores this one feels like it will be able to stand up to a lot of play.
