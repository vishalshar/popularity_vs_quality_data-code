Overall, I'm happy with the functionality and the usability of this device.  It has a great form-factor, the cover allows me to tilt it so that I can get it into position, I can get several charges out of it and it has 2 USB ports like I required.  Opportunities to improve include user feedback on best charging position (I can't see that light thing to save my life), faster charging and lighten the weight as that becomes possible.  Thanks!  I'll likely buy another future version of this.
