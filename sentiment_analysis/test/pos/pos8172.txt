I've used other TPMS systems for several years, and am a huge proponent of them for motorcycles. They work well and I credit them with having saved me from serious unpleasantness by giving me advance warning of loss of pressure at speed, allowing me to get the bike to a stop safely before the tire was completely flat.Like other TPMS systems, the app can be programmed to alert you when the pressure or temperature falls outside of specified ranges. Besides alerting you to catastrophic events, the other major benefit to TPMS systems is keeping your tires at the proper pressure to prevent excessive tire wear. How many riders actually check the tire pressure before every ride as recommended? With this system, all it takes is a quick glance at your phone as you're rolling the bike out to verify your tires are where they should be.Unlike other systems that have a separate key fob, the FOBO uses the bluetooth in your smartphone. This gives it a greater range, and it also allows you to move between multiple bikes with ease, without having to have a separate receiver for each. You can even share access to the FOBO sensor if other riders in your household ride the bike.Battery life in the sensors seems to be comparable to other systems. I've been running the system for two months and the battery level hasn't dropped from full. The sensors also "wake up" much quicker than other systems I've used.If you ride, you really should have some sort of TPMS, and this is far and away the cream of the crop.
