So we have had out Lytro for just over 24 hours.I figured that a trip to Voodoo Music Festival in New Orleans would give us a chance to capture memories in a new way.It does take some time to get used to framing shots that make the most out of pulling focus at a later time, and works best when there is more light than not. (Remember there is no flash, and it gets really grainy without enough light.)Although you don't need to focus you need to think about the shot in whole. The Lytro I believe, forces you to take more interesting shots, so in a way you may get better both while using the Lytro and with your other cameras (like the one on your phone)Pros:There is a cool factor in having an emerging tech before the masses.The shots are really fun to play with and have almost a tactile nature to them because you can change the focus.The pictures are really crisp with great lighting.The Lytro contains the needed software and auto plays the first time you plug it in to your computer, and has updates to improve the camera functionality.(I imagine a lot can be done through the updates without buying the next version.)The Lytro is fairly easy to use one handed once you learn the simple interface.Well thought out shots pay off and really impress. (again there is a cool factor)Cons:You need enough light to get a shot, but this is with anything so plan ahead.Moving objects are hard to capture.There is a VERY long load and processing time once pictures are transferred to your computer, so expect that. ( but then again try to wrap your head around huge amount of data is being processed)The LCD display is lacking in resolution & brightness, but it gets the job done. You are not going to blow someone's mind with the "Living Picture" aspect using the LCD display.In all I would say that not only are we keeping the Lytro; we will be using it a lot more that we use our cyber shot. Just being able to have an instant on camera that you can focus later is a huge advantage.I used a iPad charger to charge the unit and it charges extremely quickly. We took close to 250 shots in a night and the battery life held up.
