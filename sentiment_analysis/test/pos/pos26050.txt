Worked great out of the box. Set up was easy and very few steps but the manual could be more clear. Include all necessary tools for assembly, maintenance, and oil was included. So far it rides great and appears to be well designed. The brakes work well and the acceleration is quite respectable carrying a 170 pound man, although I am still breaking the engine in. Noise levels are quiet at idle, but it does make a decent racket at fullbore... But nothing intolerable. Starts easily, usually the first or second pull, and runs well and clean on cheap and convenient propane. Chain is a bit noisy but will hopefully quiet down as it breaks in. Overall the scooter is well-built, maneuverable, efficient, and a blast to ride. Definitely worth the money.
