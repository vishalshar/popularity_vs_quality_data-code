This thing is.. AMAZING. I wanted a smart-watch to replace my cell phone. Tried a few china ones but they just wouldn't "hold" signal with my USA provider, so that idea was out. I looked for a small phone instead: something that could fit inside my beeper pocket in my jeans.This thing does, and does so _sideways_.Impossibly small, amazingly cute, totally functional. Cell signal is stronger than with my Samsung Note 3. Battery life is all day assuming you kill running apps, otherwise mine ran "warm" and the battery drained fairly quickly. I rooted it with kingroot (had to sideload via SD) and now have a perfectly functioning micro cell phone without any bloatware. I also installed setCPU and clocked it down to 800MHz to improve battery life.. OH, and install "display brightness" (looks like a light bulb) and turn on negative brightness to extend battery time even more. The thing is _amazingly_ bright.With these tweaks, the phone has remained at the same percentage for the last 2 hours. (most bloat can be killed with kingroot or frozen with titanium backup)I also installed APEX launcher, much slicker interface than stock.As noted, KEEP the charge cable handy, it's non-standard and the plug-in part is "longer" than most cables you're sure to have. I'm sure spares can be ordered on amazon.Bluetooth paired and worked perfectly as I listened to music for hours on a bike ride: sounded great.FULL 4G (well, technically 3.5G) speeds and wifi-hotspot capable (I used foxfi) . . . no complaints whatsoever on call quality / data speeds.The speaker is stunningly good for such a little critter.Netflix streams like butter and looks so impossibly cute.The screen is not high-rez, but does the job perfectly because of the tiny screen size.I am absolutely stunned that these are not more popular. Everyone I showed mine to wanted one. I can throw it in the back of my jersey and hit the road, or slip it in my beeper pocket and forget it. And if I need amazon prices while standing in walmart or a quick glance at the radar? Yep, perfect, fast. LOVE ITEDIT: after a normal day of calendar additions / phone calls /etc.. I went the full day and still had 82% battery.That number is slightly mis-leading as once you hit 14% you can watch it drain to zero and power off, Seriously, you can count the percentages down like they are seconds.Also, the rom has one problem on it, if you use a program to try and automatically change the ringtone (any program: like phone schedule or anything) it will crash whatever program was attempting to do it. You can change the ringtone manually without a problem, but auto is a
