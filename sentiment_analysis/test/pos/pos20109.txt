The phone is awesome and the design is a breath of fresh air.  When I received the unit it did not come with a sim extraction tool.  I did have them around, but I wanted the original.  I contacted nextbit and they quickly responded.  They have I formed me that my sim extraction tool is on its way.Not only is the phone nice, but customer service is spot on!The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was that .y widgets were not on my home screen per say.  I had pinch the screen to see widgets.  It's not a deal breaker but takes a while to get used too.  I also like app drawer which this lacks.  But it is android and can be customized with launchers etc.
