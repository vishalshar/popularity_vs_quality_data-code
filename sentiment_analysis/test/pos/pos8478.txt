Absolutely love it! Made me a Line6 fan! Tones are great, very flexible and convincing. I have given up on being a rockstar, i got areal job and had a baby, so i am just looking to make convincing tones and have fun. I have tried the app on android and iphone. Honestly the Android app is HORRIBLE compared to the iOS app. I can understand why they released it on iOS only first. When i bought it, there was a promo that gave me a copy of cubase 8 LE for free.  It is very nice, very complicated and took a long time to learn, but very nice. after installing and reinstalling the drivers again, it sounded fantastic, and was way easier to record USB-direct than  with a microphone.  The bluetooth connectivity is what sets this amp apart. The guitar tone is obviously created by the mobile device, but the streaming ability should not be overlooked! The ability to allow anybody to stream fantastic sounding music is very fun, easy, and a real kick-starter for a fun and creative night. the 30 watt is louder than i will ever need. sounds great for guitar and music. I am thankful everyday that i finally own this amp!
