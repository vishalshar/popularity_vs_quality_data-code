Great concept, but PV panel output wattage is a little low for the battery size, so it takes a long time to fully charge the internal 13,000 mAh battery.Otherwise, it charges my devices nicely and makes a great power backup with huge battery capacity.It can almost charge 2 iPad's or several iPhones before the battery is depleted.Fit and finish is OK, but could be slightly more refined. The solar panel appears to be glued to the case, so no idea how long it will last.All said and done - I really like this product. Recommended.
