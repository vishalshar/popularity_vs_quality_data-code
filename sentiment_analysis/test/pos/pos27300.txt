Awesome product.  I've been an avid homebrewer for years and got away from the hobby after having children.  With 3 kids there just isn't much time for brewing.  I bought a 10 gallon All-Grain RIMS system from another vendor and, while it makes outstanding beer, I just can't spare the 7+ hours it takes to make it and then another 3-4 to clean it all adequately.  On top of that, I like the variety of having 2.5 gallon batches versus having 10 gallons to drink through.  The Zymatic has allowed me to experiment more, drink a better variety and spend less time cleaning.I'll still use my 10 gallon for certain batches (i.e. parties, weddings, etc) where I need larger volumes, but for most of my brewing the Pico is it!
