I got this as a Christmas gift for my husband and my two and a half year old son has become obsessed with checking on the mushrooms. We're going to eat the first batch tonight. This is a cool project. Not surpsisly, it's a little gross looking while they're starting to grow; that only seems to add to th appeal for the boys in this household.
