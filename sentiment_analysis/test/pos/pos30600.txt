I've been using my Spire for several months and love it. I've learned some of my stress triggers, I get positive feedback that my meditation is working (now I know I'm achieving a measure of calm...not just hoping I am). In addition, the user experience overall is great. I love the app (simple but really effective...love the alerting options), and the wireless charging makes it super-easy --> much better than any of the fitbit options (and I tried a couple).
