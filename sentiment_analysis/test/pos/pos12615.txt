It does work and can't be easier to install: Loosen 2 screws, add the device's wires on top of those going to the wall switch, install the free app on your phone and link phone to device. Then you can add other phones just scanning a QR code on yours. I ran into issues and addressed the technical support via email, reply came faster than I was able to read it, although I knew and explicitly stated to them the device was fine (tested with a friend's phone). I got helped anyway, their first suggestion was to update my phone's operating system (I was running old Android 4.4.2 and the working phone was on Android 4.4.4). That was all it took. If you are a bit paranoid this is more secure than non-encrypted radio codes sent by remotes (encryption and bidirectional authentication). It also works way better than remotes: beyond not being surprised by dead batteries or having to look for remote all over your car's floor mats Glink works from across the street! I just opened my door while waiting for oncoming traffic in order to make a left into my driveway. Pleasantly surpised when driver with the right of way let me go realizing my garage door was opening. He/She was very polite but would never happen with manufacturer's remote which I always had to press several times from the driveway, roll down the window and stick my hand out,  and then wait for the door. No cloud services, no account needed, and not even internet or local wireless network required. Simple, secure and effective bluetooth interface. Very happy with it! Please, if yours doesn't work give tech support a try before returning.
