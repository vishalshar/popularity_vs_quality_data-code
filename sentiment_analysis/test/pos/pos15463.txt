I owned a Skylink SC-001 for a long time. It served as my home security and other than 2 false alarms in several years, it always worked well. I purchased the new Skylink SK-200 and have been using it for a few weeks. I have to say the SK-200 is a very nice upgrade. It's so much easier to install. So much easier to expand. I can alarm/dis-alarm from anywhere and monitor the status of my home. The system uses easy-to-find AA and AAA batteries. The door sensors and motion sensors are smaller and lighter. And they work like a charm.Just some suggestions here: The main console has to be hooked up to the internet via Ethernet cable so it has to be placed near your router. It'll be nice if it supports wifi. I then will be able to hide it in a better place.
