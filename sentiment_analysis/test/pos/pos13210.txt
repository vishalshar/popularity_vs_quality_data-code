Like many others born and raised in Northern Minnesota, I was weaned on beer.  My beer of choice is Porter.Over 7 1/2 decades, I have never had a better beer than that produced by my Fizzics Waytap Beer Dispenser.Assembly (screw on tap handle, place container on base, insert four AA batteries, and replace top) using no tools takes less than a minute.Running a 12-oz glass of warm water through the dispenser to clean the hose takes another minute.  After two minutes you are prepared to enjoy the finest beer you have ever tasted.After using both cans and bottles of Porter in my Fizzics Waytap, I can attest to ease of operation and production of abeer that surpasses most anything you have previously tasted.If my house was on fire, I would save my wife, my dog, and my Fizzics Waytap...not necessarily in that order.  Painfully old joke, but representative of my regard for my Fizzics Waytap.My sole concern relative to this ingenious product is what use will do to my waistline.If you are unable to buy stock in this product, buy beer stocks.
