I didn't realize there was a quality difference with the sticky feel suction cups. Whereas a previous mount falls off my dash every three or four days, this has stayed firmly in place since I installed it. I love the one touch feature. You just press your phone into the mount and it grabs your phone securely. Easy release too. I thought the arm would bounce or vibrate, but it doesn't move at all. I also thought the weight with the phone in the base would pull the sink suction cup off after a couple days, but it doesn't budge. It takes a significant amount of force to remove.
