I'm a band director, and I was fascinated by this "brass" alternative to the recorder. I've been exploring the idea of starting my beginning students on recorders before giving them their instruments, but I was worried my brass players would be left out. It's a lot of fun to play this, and the pitches are accurate. My only issue is that it doesn't contain D or E pitches. It has F, G, A, Bb, B, and C. It's great for 5-note songs in the key of F, but I would love it that much more if it could handle more pitches. However, that didn't stop me from purchasing a second one for my 3-year-old nephew for Christmas!
