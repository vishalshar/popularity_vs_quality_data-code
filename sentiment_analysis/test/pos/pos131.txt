I absolutely love my Rachio!  I am big time into home automation since I purchased my new place last year.  When I got to the irrigation system I researched many of the options out there and I am very happy I chose Rachio.  You can read all about it so you know what it can do but I can tell you that setup was very easy and operation is precise and actually fun!
