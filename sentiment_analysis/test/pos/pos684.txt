I mean, who really gives that much thought to their cooking oil? After trying this I promise you will think otherwise. This stuff is like some kind of exotic transitional material: oil but not oil - that is, not oily. The neutral taste really makes dressing flavors shine through. Amazing smoke point and durability at high temps but also wonderful in smoothies if you want to get your keto on.
