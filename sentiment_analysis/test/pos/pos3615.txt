My 9 year old is having a blast with this product. Read through the start up booklet first to make sure you are on the correct settings for the plastics you have. Apparently there are 3 plastic types... Ours came with ABS (Matte) plastic so the temp should be on "Hi". There are templates available online that helped my daughter get the hang of it. Don't leave the plastic in the pen when you are done-either reverse it (if it's long enough) or use it up. Before buying refills, make sure you are purchasing 3mm plastics (many online are 1.75). Great product for a creative person!
