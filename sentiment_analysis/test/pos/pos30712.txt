Disclaimer: Anecdotal experience review, I know little science behind the product.Not even kidding, I had a friend a few days ago comment as he got in my vehicle: "Wow your car smells really fresh."The previous two smells were spilt hummus chicken (don't ever do that to yourself) and a lemon scent car freshener I've previously put in. I'm no Sherlock, but I've deduced that it's probably the ergo-looking PURGGO on the back of my headrest.I'm also heavily biased to the cute, plump design of the product. I'll update the review if I ever try using it as a pillow.
