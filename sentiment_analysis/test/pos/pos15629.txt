There's a lot of mixed reviews in here and I've got to agree with the group of people that thought "I like this, but it needs work." The functionality of the drink is wonderful. The added l-theanine makes the caffeine kick tame and focused which is perfect for my morning meal replacement. Where soylent should really put some efforts into improving this drink is the flavor and texture. The flavor is doable for me but isn't the most pleasant. The chocolatey coffee notes are just too subtle for an already very neutral tasting drink. And then my only real complaint is that as others have stated the chalky or powdery type texture is very noticeable for me and without it I would really drink a lot more Coffiest.
