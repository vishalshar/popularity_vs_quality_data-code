I am very pleased upon initial install and use of this product (Snap+). I got the heavy duty version so I can also use it with my tablet and it does not disappoint. It comes with 4 magnets installed and has room for 2 more, but they aren't necessary. It would take a car accident to dislodge my Nexus 5, and the hold is even strong on my brother-in-law's Note 3 with a thick case. It was easy to install in my 2011 Ford Mustang and fits snug. Even on the rough roads i experienced no movement from the phone, or the mount itself. My only issue is that the magnet is strong enough to engage the magnetic sleep function built into almost all of today's phones/tablets. I was unable to use my phone while it was connected to the stand as it triggered the magnetic slide lock and would keep my phone in sleep mode. I was able to download an app that prevented this but it's noteworthy enough to remove a star. Other than that the product exceeded expectations. It is of very high quality and extremely durable. Mountek should write their own app to disable the magnetic sleep function in Android and IOS phones as it prevents use of the phone while using this mount. Highly recommended if you can find an app like i did.
