I was skeptical as I have been debating on buying this for months. I wish I would have bought it sooner. I took this to Hawaii this past month and I was amazed at the quality of the pictures. Yes you will get some shots you don't want but who cares. You will get some great pictures that you will have missed. I am truly glad that I took the chance on this device.
