Loads of fun for twelve year old. He watched the online videos and was immediately up to speed. He runs it with my LG phone and puts it easily through its paces. He plays with it a lot and has gone through two sets of batteries every four days. Important to make sure batteries are brand new and not past expire date. This is a very creative toy for a low price.
