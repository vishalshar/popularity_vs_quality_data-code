Coming from the Moto G3 8Gb version, the Robin was an overall upgrade for me. To make a long story short, I love this phone. All the extra memory, the smooth day-to-day performance, the latest OS and whatnot makes for an enjoyable experience. Plus I still get asked what kind of phone this is, more than a month after owning it. It looks good.That being said, I have only two real criticisms. The phone runs noticeably warm when charging and running thing like GPS/Pokemon Go, or while it downloads updates and you're still surfing or using Facebook. I've also noticed by the volume rocker a crease in the body-- a very small one-- which can only mean that the phone is starting to succumb to bending. I take care of my phone and I don't wear tight pants or anything, so it's just a heads up to future buyers.I do still recommend the Robin for anyone looking for a new phone or just something different. A very solid 8/10 for me.
