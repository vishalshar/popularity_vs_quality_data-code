Just wanted to say that i am extremely please with this product. I use my apple watch to keep track of all my activity, and once summer time came around I was always bummed that I could use my apple watch to keep track of my swimming. So when they released the second gen apple watch I almost bought it because it was water proof, but then I stumbled on to this item. Instead of buying a whole new watch all I needed to do was buy a case and I had a fully water proof watch. I have been using it for 5 months now and I go swimming in the gym with it at least once a week and it works great. I have also tried it in the ocean and it held up beautifully. If you think you like the look of this case and you just need your watch to be waterproof I couldn't recommend this case more you will love it!
