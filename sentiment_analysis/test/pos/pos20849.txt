I live alone and need to leave my corgi alone all day while I make the trek into the city. He tolerates it well enough, but I am concerned that he doesn't have enough stimulation during the day. Now that I have a Petcube, it does wonders to ease my mind. It was dead simple to setup and now I can check in on him at any time. I have it setup in my bedroom, since he seems to think my bed is his bed while I'm away. Now I can holler at him and get him active with the laser at a moments notice. I love that the app is easy to use!
