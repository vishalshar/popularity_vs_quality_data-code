Bought this as a gift so my sister (who lives in another state) can check up on her 2 favorite dogs. It was easy to set up and has worked very reliably! The camera quality is surprisingly good. My dogs get so excited when they hear it come online. It has jammed a couple of times with the Milkbone treats, so we ordered some rounder ones from Amazon and those have worked a lot better. Only problem is that my dogs now spend time trying to figure out how to dismantle the darn thing so they can get ALL the cookies! Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
