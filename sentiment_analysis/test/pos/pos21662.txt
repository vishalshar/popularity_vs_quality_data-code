I've only been using this alarm clock for a couple days, but so far I love it. The last one I bought only had one alarm setting and it was an extremely annoying, high-pitched beep that could be heard downstairs on the other side of the house! This one, however, has a setting named Relax that plays yoga-type meditation music when you wake up. I woke up feeling much more relaxed today than I ever did with my old alarm clock(s).The app is pretty straightforward and easy to use (and free, of course). I didn't see this part before I ordered it (it's there, I just didn't see it), but it does require a Spotify premium account to sync. I don't want to pay for that, so I'll find other ways to wake up to music if I want to, but for now the Relax setting is perfect.
