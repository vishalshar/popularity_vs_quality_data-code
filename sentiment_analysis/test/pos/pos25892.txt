I wanted a practice amp, and I wanted a bluetooth speaker for my laptop.  This fulfilled both.  I had recently received an ipad mini for Christmas, so that took care of the controller part.  I've had several Line6 products; my main rig is a JTV-69 Variax and a PODHD500X, so I like their stuiff.The guitar sounds are good (they are based on the POD X3, which I have also owned in the past before I upgrade to HD500X), and the bluetooth speaker is room filling.My only complaint is the lack of instruction for some of the functionality on the ipad.  For example, I wanted to overwrite the four patches you can access without the ipad on the Amplifi front panel.  I found a 3rd party video on YouTube, but the screens didn't match what I see on my iPad mini - specifically, the "Save to Hardware" button.
