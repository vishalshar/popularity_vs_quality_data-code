These are great. Large thick towels soaked in cleaning liquid to clean you're entire body. I am 6 foot 4 and 250lbs and I needed a large wipe to clean me up for a camping trip. These stood up to the challenge making me feel clean and refreshed after a long dirty sweaty day. There was even some left to spare. It leaves no residue and no overpowering smell. Make sure you follow the directions on the back. Start with you're face and go down. The towel comes folded up, it needs to stay that way for every part of you're body(fold over again for a clean side for every section needed to be cleaned). I am extremely satisfied with this great product, I am telling all of my camping buddies and will recomend to anyone who needs a quick cleanup after a workout session or what ever makes you sweat.
