Just got my second peanut plug,adding it to my Almond 2015 was a was really easy i figured the harder part was adding a second one to my Kindle  7 hdx securifi screen but surprisingly enough it was already added automaticcly as smartswitch no# 2,that was a surprise,i guess all this things are hooked up by wifi and know their thing better than i do.This peanut plugs together with the Almond wifi extender work flawlessly and if you do encounter a glitch just call Securifi customer support they are really good and patient to guide you,fantastic products,i plan on adding quite a few more Peanut plugs throughout the house,thanks Ray.
