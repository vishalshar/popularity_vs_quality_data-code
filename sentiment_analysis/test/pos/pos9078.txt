Packaging and Assembly: Easy to assemble, easy to take out. It came with instructions but wasn't needed.Rubber additional casing: It poured one day and I luckily had the rubber casing with me. Worked great, no leaking. Wouldn't trust it if I dropped it in water, but sure did what it said it would do.Recommendation: Use zip ties that come with it. I personally used both the rubber bands and zip ties but you honestly just need the zip ties. Won't move around at all, even after abusePros: Exactly what I needed it for... I wanted something that was easy to use and wouldn't take much time to hook my phone up to my bike each time. (Example are those rubber band mounts...) This is easy to put on and take off and looks pretty cool too!Cons: I dropped my phone and it landed on its back and cracked the front corner. It doesn't provide as much protection as I would like, but there's always a trade off with cases for bulkiness with protection or slim and style with less protection.
