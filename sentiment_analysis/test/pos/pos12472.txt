This is a top notch extreamly well made cooler.  It has all the bells and whistles that you never knew you needed.  The blender works great and the battery holds a charge for a long time.  The LED light is extreamly helpful and the seperater/cutting board allows for multiple items to be used inside at different temperatures.  The plates/frisbees and the knife are a great addition as well.  The ability to charge USB devices is a huge plus and the portable speaker is probalbly the best and loudest there is on the market.  The ability to pair the speaker with other speakers is also a huge bonus.  This is by far the best cooler there is, and the price is there to verify that as it is not inexpensive.
