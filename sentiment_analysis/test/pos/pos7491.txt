These are so delicious!  I love that they're organic, but they are very costly which is why I only gave 4 stars.  This is one snack that I can eat and also share with my dog.  Unfortunately because of the price I cannot afford to indulge as often as I'd like, but it's so nice to have an option for an unprocessed, delicious & nutritious snack that I can feel good about.
