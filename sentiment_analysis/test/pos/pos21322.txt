I have had this for less than a week, so if things change I will update this review at that time.The physical installation wasn't bad, as I already had a sprinkler system; so it was just a case of changing out the controller. I have 5 stations, so not overly complicated. This really needs to be in a weather proof area (inside my garage was perfect), so if installing outside plan on getting a box for it. I have a severe allergy to anything that resembles electric wiring. Despite this, I was done in less than an hour (from open box to put tools away). The key was (I think) taking a good look (picture and color listing of which wire went where) before taking it apart from the old box. From there, it was relatively simple to follow the (very limited) guidance to install it. I chose to connect the wires first, then mount to the wall (this seemed easier than mounting and trying to run the wires through the little holes).Connection to my wi-fi was a challenge. It uses "Blink" which essentially has your phone flash a light quickly to "program" the device so it taps into your home Wi-Fi--this is NOT recommended for people with epileptic issues. My android cell phone just flat didn't work. The directions recommend using apple products, of which I had none. I then downloaded the app into my Kindle fire (more out of desperation than anything else) and placed my fire about 1.5" above the little light sensor (bottom left) and it took the first time. Go figure. BTW, the darker the environment, the better it works. The directions say you can take the main part of the controller box off (not mounted to the wall) and inside the house to a dark room if you need to.Once "installed" I then used the app to identify and program my various sprinklers. There were several options--type of sprinkler ("shooter" or "sprayer"); type of dirt/clay; type of vegetation (grass, bushes, etc.), type of slope. You can name the zones something like "front left" instead of "Zone 1", which is helpful. I found the default times double that of what I am currently using, so I cut them back to what I am currently using. The device claims to compensate for these variables (I have clay soil), so for example it will adjust the watering cycle for more efficient watering of the clay--a burst, then rest, then a burst, etc. Time will tell if these are the correct settings, but so far my yard is looking pretty good!The fact that it knows where I live (by zip code) and I picked up the external water sensor means no more watering in the rain! I was able to use the website easier to plan out what days to water (we have restrictions in the summer), so now it's basically watch it and see how it does.A previous reviewer mentioned that when it looses power the wi-fi needs to be re-connected (if it looses the signal, it then goes back to being a "dumb" sprinkler controller, like the one I removed). So I picked up a cheaper UPS to use with it as we routinely loose power for a few seconds every now and then. Also, as it contains computer equipment, this is (in general) a good idea--to "smooth" your electric power and prolong the life..
