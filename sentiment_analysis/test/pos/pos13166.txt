I think the cost of the cool gizmo is a small price to pay for so much fun--hardly more than one day at DisneyLand--and less than most vet bills I've had! Today I took a little 5 minute break between meetings at work to petzi my Golden Retriever Daizi (not her real name--OK, it's Daisy but I couldn't resist) at home, and afterwards I was good to go for another few hours. It's actually hard to stop the Petzi sessions, at least with her, because after a couple of treat "launches" she sits there patiently, looking expectantly into the camera, hoping for another. And another. Poor puppy! Both the camera and the microphone are excellent, and the treat reservoir is pretty spacious. I love this thing so much that I sent one to my sister and my daughter.
