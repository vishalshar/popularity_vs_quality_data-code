I was able to install the box with no issues. Didn't even bother with the power Ethernet connection, and went straight to wi-fi.  Replaced the rainbird box in less than 30 min.  The MV wire goes to the far right of the blossom terminal box.  COM is the same and zones lined up one for one. The two rain sensor wires from the old unit are not used / needed. I am under watering restrictions, so I can only water two days a week.  I want to water morning and night on my two days, so I still need to figure that out.
