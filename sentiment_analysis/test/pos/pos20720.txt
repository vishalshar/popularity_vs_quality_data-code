Absolutely beautiful design plus I wasn't expecting it to come so fast. I've worn it pretty much nonstop since I got it.The detail is awesome! It has a nice solid feel but isn't heavy.It was super easy to connect it with my iPhone 6. My lifestyle is really busy and fast so I am glad I will now be able to monitor and improve my habits. I love the breathing exercises. They are really relaxing. Also, I love that it helps me keep track of my menstrual cycle. I used another app for this previously and it's nice to have everything in one place. I just wish it could track nutrition as well. That is really important to me. Right now it only lets me see my calories burned but that's not sufficient. I'd like to be able to log what I eat and drink. Also, I wish it came in more different colors.
