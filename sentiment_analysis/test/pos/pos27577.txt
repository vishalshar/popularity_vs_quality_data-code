My dog loves all bixbi treats, there more expensive than other brand treats but you know what your feeding your pup. My german shepherd lives for the salmon and the liver treats. Beware these kinda smell strong and my friend will hide the bag when he visits but he doesn't eat anything fish. My dad when he visits calls my dog a "lil sardine" but i do put salmon oil on her food so its probably that. Overall would highly recommend any Bixbi treats as i have not had any issues with any of there treats and think there high quality. I cook for my dog...
