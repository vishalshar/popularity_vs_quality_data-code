I have been using the red light for a little over 3 weeks and have seen some gradual improvements.  I had a few small dark spots on the side of my face that have faded and my typically reddish complexion is not as noticeable.  In fact, my husband stopped me on my way out the door this morning and said "your skin looks different - smoother, healthier".  So, it must be working.  I spend 15 minutes a day under the light.  Five minutes on each side of my face at night after cleansing and 5 minutes each morning full face after my shower.  I am pleased with the results and hope to see some additional reduction in small wrinkles around my eyes.  My local salon charges $19 per session and recommends 5 times a week and that really adds up.  So this is definitely a less expensive alternative and can be done in the comfort of your own home.
