This is an IP Siren that you can trigger remotely from your phone via the Dlink Home app or it can be setup to be triggered by a leak or motion detector or from a Dlink IP camera. It has four tones. Ding, Chime, Ambulance, and emergency. The latter tones can be used to scare off a bugler.  The setup is easy if your router has WPS (Wifi Protected Setup). If it doesn't or if WPS is turned off, you have to set it up manually. To set it up, you download the Dlink App and set your phone Wifi to the default network the Siren broadcast. Then from the App you can scan the QC bar code which tells the app what the device is and gets you to the setup wizard. You follow the wizard and then press the WPS button on your router and the Siren. This should get the siren on the your wifi network and you are all set. However, I didn't have WPS turned so I had to go into my router and turn it on. I'm not sure there is a way to set up the device manually. I couldn't find it and there was no other instructions. Once I turned on WPS on my router, I had no Issues.From the App I can choose the tone and how long for it to go (3S, 103 30S, 1 Min) as many times as I want. You just plug in the siren in where you want it. What I like about it is from I read most Burglars don't worry too much about a short alarm going off as neighbors might hear it go off once and not think too much. But if the alarm keeps stopping and starting that draws attention that burglars won't want to stick around for.I have received no inducement and am not affiliated with Dlink or any supplier. I am just a customer trying to help my fellow customers make the best choice.,I haven't tried to pair it with one of my cameras because I would rather verify myself and set it off.
