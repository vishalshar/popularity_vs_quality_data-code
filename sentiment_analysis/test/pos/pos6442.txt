This works very well to keep my 8 month old, 55 pound golden retriever puppy from pulling too much on the leash while walking. It does not eliminate pulling but makes her much more manageable. The design and color (blue) are all very nice. My dog and I both like this much better than the head harness made by the same company. Nothing replaces proper leash training, but this will do the trick to make a large, impulsive, enthusiastic puppy very manageable on a walk. We can both enjoy the walk with this harness. The thing that makes this work is the martingale type fastener that attaches to the front (chest) of the harness. It makes the leash get in the way a bit by fastening on the chest instead of the back, but that is what makes it uncomfortable for the dog to pull, so it is a trade off I am willing to make until the puppy enthusiasm wears down a bit. I would highly recommend this product if you have a large dog that pulls and is hard to manage on a leash.
