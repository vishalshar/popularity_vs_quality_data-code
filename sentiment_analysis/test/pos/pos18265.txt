Things works great! Pay the $5 per month for the minimum recording service. I found that my WiFi upload speed was too slow for the camera. Most WiFi are slow on the upload. Upgraded my modem through AT&T, purchased and installed an extender that for some curious reason has better upload speed then my regular connection? I am at about 5 mps. Crystal clear recordings down my 90+ foot driveway. Night vision is excellent. Motion sensor a bit sensitive, snow will set it to recording. Getting a lot for my money.
