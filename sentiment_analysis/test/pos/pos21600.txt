This was very helpful. My cat was a complete lunatic about obtaining a sample any other way and regarded the black litter from the vet with paranoid suspicion, so I had to replace the litter in his boxes with this. We have large boxes though so I needed 2 bags per box, and he held out for a couple days, but eventually used it just fine. It is not reusable though--don't even try.
