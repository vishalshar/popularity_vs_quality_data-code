I absolutely love this product - it actually does work!  I purchased one for my vehicle and one for my husband's vehicle. I no longer have to deal with the lingering food smells from fast food or the stinky sweat smell from the kids tennis shoes and/or sports equipment bags. It simply hangs on the back of the head rest and there is no over powering perfume scent like the other car fresheners, as I think it absorbs and/or neutralizes odors. I am amazed at how well it works. I will be purchasing additional PURGGO Car Air Fresheners as gifts for friends and family.
