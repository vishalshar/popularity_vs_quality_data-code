I have had psoriasis for 40 years. I have tried pretty much every type of treatment there is. I finally decided I was done with expensive treatments that have bad side affects and usually only help for a short time. Before I got this product my arms were completely broken out, red, painful and flaking. After 2 weeks of use my psoriasis is not gone, however it is no longer red and hurting. This cream is unscented and immediately disappears into my skin giving me relief without the greasiness the coal tar compound, ointments and creams i have been prescribed left.  I cannot wait to see how longer use of this product helps
