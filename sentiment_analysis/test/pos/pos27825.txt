This was a really cool kit, something that if your kids didn't like mushrooms I'm sure they would after growing their own. We found that the mushrooms grew very well on the first side. But on the second side it didn't grow as well. This might of been due to the lack of moisture as the block started drying out. Even though your misting every day I don't know if and a hot environment the mushrooms are going to grow as easily.
