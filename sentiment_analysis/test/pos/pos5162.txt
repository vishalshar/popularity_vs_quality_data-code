I was turned onto these by a fellow climber who said she was pretty sure they were the only reason she climbed El Cap. I had to try them. I wasn't sure how they would be different from other caffeinated supplements but I was willing to give it a try. I was more than pleasantly surprised. The taste is actually pretty good, they are simple to deal with and their effect far exceeds that of any other gu, block or gel. To put it simply, Voke tablets increase my work capacity without feeling jittery or edgy. I highly recommend these.
