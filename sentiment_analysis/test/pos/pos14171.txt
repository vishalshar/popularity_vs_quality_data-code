Works just the way it's supposed to.  The method of clamping on to the camera body is new to me and it works very well.  Care must be excercised to not use too long a thumb screw.  If your thumb screws are too long, shim them with washer(s). You only want  about three and a half threads to engage the clamping mechanism nut.
