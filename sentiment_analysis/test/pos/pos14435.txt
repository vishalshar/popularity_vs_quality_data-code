These are great because they have ONE ingredient; beef liver. That's it. Also, they are made in the US so I feel comfortable knowing that they are safe to give my dogs. And my dogs love them! One downside is that since they are freeze-dried, there are powdery crumbs that kind of coat all of the treats. If you've ever had that freeze-dried astronaut ice cream, you know what I'm talking about. Having beef liver "powder" on my fingers is a little unpleasant so I removed a star. Otherwise, I'm happy with these and so are my dogs.Oh, and they give you a lot in the bag. Bag is resealable.
