I got one to try for myself. I lose 2 things, my keys and my phone, never both at the same time. I played with it to get familiar with its use, then I really lost my keys. I could hear the lapa beeping but with all the noise outside( a mower and street traffic) I did take a few minutes to find them. Found out my 2 year old grandson had moved them to the neighbors yard about 50 feet away. Very happy with it so far. Bought my wife one but it wouldn't beep right, it was replaced and the new one works great. The only things I wish was it was a little louder and maybe a lower pitch to make it easier to hear.
