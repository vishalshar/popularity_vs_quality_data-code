More of a 3.5 stars. The narrative clip is fun to use. It's a kind of found art endeavor. Download the photos to your computer and the browse and see what you got. You'll get a lot of blurry photos. You'll get a lot of grainy photos. But you'll get a lot of shots you would never be able to get as you walk around your city. The clip on the back is pretty robust but a couple times I've had it pop off my backpack where it was clipped. I've since attached a lanyard to the clip and then use the lanyard to help secure the narrative clip.Not many people really know what this device is and most people assume it's a fitbit device. Certainly there are many ethical issues involved. Don't be a jerk and ruin the "life logging" fun for the rest of us.
