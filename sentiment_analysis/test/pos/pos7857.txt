Used for an 8 year old child.  Worked great to cover a bandage over some sutures.  Even in warm weather it didn't get uncomfortable to wear.  Most importantly it allowed free range of movement without risk of peeling off the bandages or getting them dirty.  Not quite the intended purpose for this but perfect otherwise!
