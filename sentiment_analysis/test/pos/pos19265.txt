These are a great alternative. I use them for carrying raw cut up fruit & veggies to work. I can see how some reviewers say they're hard for little kids to open. They have a good seal. But my 4 year old recently took a bag of blueberries out of the fridge & ate them so he must not have had a hard time opening it. I initially bought 4 snack size & 4 sandwich size. I just bought 4 more sandwich size & 4 gallon size.
