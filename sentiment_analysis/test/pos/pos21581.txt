I just got my Portal today.  What a nice surprise, I wasn't expecting it so soon as Amazon was saying 1-2 months.  Maybe it's cause I live in Seattle, we get special privileges :-)  I heard a lot of good things about it on Kickstarter, but I was too late to get it during the campaign, so I was super excited to find it on Amazon.The packaging was solid and minimalistic, reminded me of Apple and Nest which I love.  The Portal device itself was very sleek and elegant, no ugly antennas sticking up like my old Linksys router.  The setup was super easy using the iphone app; it didn't ask me for email or Facebook account or any personal information; I really like that.  The lone round green LED (the only light on the device) has a soft comforting glow to it, rather mesmerizing.I installed it on the ground floor in a closet, next to my old Linksys WRT1900ac which I've been having trouble with coverage; it doesn't reach to my home office in the corner of my basement; I'm forced to use an old Netgear N600 and 50' of ugly ethernet cable as a range extender, but it doesn't work too well either.  I wanted to do a side-by-side before replacing the Linksys.  All I can say is, wow!My house is 2 levels and about 3000 sq-feet, and there are alot of walls all around.  Where my LInksys was struggling, I'm getting really fast speed now with Portal.  Even in my basement, I'm getting nice speed in my corner office, and without the old Netgear and the ugly ethernet cables which was a big time tripping hazard.  I did some Ookla speedtest with my iPhone, and the numbers speak for themselves.  The 16Mbps is from my old Linksys to the corner on the same floor.  The 47Mbps is from Portal at the same spot.  The 24Mbps is from Portal to my basement corner office.All in all, I'm really happy I found Portal on Amazon.
