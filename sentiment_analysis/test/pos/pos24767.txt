We have really enjoyed using our Starling for several weeks now. The product design is great--looks good in the nursery or even on a coffee table in the living room. Having it around is a great reminder to talk aloud to our baby. It doesn't have to be anything meaningful, even just describing your actions. Checking in on our word count throughout the day is a fun challenge for us. It really inspires you to always be communicating. The app interface is clean and works great. It was an easy setup and sync. The Starling app also sends you daily notifications with helpful developmental tips. One minor drawback is that you have to remember to have the Starling near you and the baby, which isn't always easy. Hopefully they will be adding some product features in the future, like also being able to use your phone when the Starling isn't handy. But thus far we have been beyond pleased with the purchase and it is a great reminder to always be communicating with your baby. Happy we can support a young company and hope to see more products in the future.
