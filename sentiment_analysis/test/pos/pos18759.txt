I have a pair of Huskies that must run at least every other day. To placate them I bought a device for my bike call the walkie dog. It allows the dogs to run with or pull the bike. It is not uncommon for us to be gone for hours and cover 20 miles. They love it. But when the back gate got left open and they went without me and we found them 12 miles away. Across the lake, across three major roads, on the other side of the town, out in the country. And when they were finally found three hours later they were still heading away from the house. That's when we bought the GPS tracker. Similar events since then take five maybe 10 minutes. The dogs leaves the zone, you receive a text on your phone, one person gets in the car, the other person sits down next to the computer [don't have a smart phone] and talks them into where the dogs are at. Works beautifully.
