I have only played about 6 rounds, all on the same course, using Golf Tags and they are working as advertised.  They appear to be pretty rugged, none of them are falling apart and are very secure on my clubs.  Setup was very quick and easy and was completed it in just over a half hour.  It really is as simple as screwing them on to the end of my clubs and tagging them using the free Golf Pad app on my phone.  The biggest problem is remembering to tag my clubs before each shot and learning to use the app.  The nice thing is you can tag your clubs after the shot and I have even gone back to the where the ball was to tag the club.  I bought Golf Tags mainly to keep track of how far I hit each of my clubs and the yardages reported for each club seem to be very good.  The scorecard capability is a pleasant surprise and much nicer then the one I was using on my GPS.  My only complaint is that the yardages provided to the front, middle, and back of the green are different then those provided by my golf GPS and not by just a yard or two, which is surprising since the shot distances seem to be pretty good.  My course has only been open for a year and a couple of months and is a renovated previous course, which may explain the yardage differences.  However, I am very happy with Golf Tags and will continue to use the system.
