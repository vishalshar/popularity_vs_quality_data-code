This is a hard review to write because I purchased this case to hide the camera in addition to being a case. The camera protector is perfect. It is very easy to slide back and forth. If I was reviewing that portion of it alone, I'd rate it 5 stars. However, this is also a phone case so with regards to the case itself, I'd give it 1 star. I would never use this case if it didn't have the camera protector. It's a soft case, flimsy and not high quality. It attracts dirt on my phone and because of the unnecessary hole in the back to display the apple logo, is getting scratched in that area. I'm not confident it will actually protect my phone from the next drop.Long story short, if I saw it in a store, I would have bought something else strictly on the quality of the case. Overall, I should rate it 2 stars, but I'm overrating it because the camera piece does what it is advertised to do. The case itself needs a lot of work.
