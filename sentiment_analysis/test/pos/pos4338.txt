If the collar was waterproof I would like it more. When it gets wet, it stinks. I also wish it was less complicated to switch between dog 1 and dog 2. It is the smallest training collar I was able to find. It is for small dogs, but I am thinking its probably best for a 15-40 lb dog, it can work on smaller dogs but looks bulky... Distance and strength are appropriate. Everything it rechargeable and it does seem to hold its charge for awhile. The remote requires way less charging than the collar, but even the collar easily goes for a few days without a charge.
