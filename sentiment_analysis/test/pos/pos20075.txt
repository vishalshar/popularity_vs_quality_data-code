From box to flight in minutes. Instructions so easy a kid can do it. A few helpful hints to make your "nano" drone experience better:1. To use all the features of this drone, you must download and install the APP on your phone (I suggest doing that before you begin using the drone). Go into your Wi-Fi settings and "pair" the APP with your phone (just like you would "pair" a new Wi-Fi connection to your phone). If you don't plan on using the drones camera while connected to a "smartphone", get the $40 JetJat Drone without a camera. In fact, get two!2. You need to supply two AAA batteries for the included transmitter/controller, batteries are not included, you can then use the APP and "video drone with your phone".3. The drone plugs into a USB port to recharge, not wall sockets. Keep that in mind when you go to a park or somewhere away from home (bring your laptop or other device with USB plug).4. The propellers spin at superman fast RPM's. They are not indestructible but fairly sturdy. You will crash the drone. The blades will get beat up when you crash, even with the blade guard on. Remember, you will crash it a lot. You might want to fly it over a soft surface like grass till you become proficient at flying it. If your drone starts to wobble, drift or is not very responsive check the propellers first. It comes with 4 extra blades. You will probably want to order more. If the drone does not hover well, the flight controls can be calibrated and "tuned" up in the APP.5. Read the instructions prior to using your drone. Download, install and become familiar with the APP prior to using your drone (don't forget to "pair" the drone to your phone in Wi-Fi settings). Some of these bad reviews seem like user error induced frustration. This is one of the easiest "entry level" drones in the world to fly; very forgiving, very fun and well engineered... but not indestructible... 5 out of 5 stars- and not because its the cheapest, fastest, sturdiest, best drone on the market for $100. It is none of those... 5 stars because the $100 bucks was worth watching the video as my kid chased the dog around the house with a nano drone.UPDATE... The Dog killed the drone... New Rule... No more chasing the dog with a drone...
