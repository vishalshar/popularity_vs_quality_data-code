I purchased this to replace a Logitech Harmony 1100 that we dropped and no longer works.I read a lot of the reviews and saw a bunch about the difficult setup.  I thought the set up was pretty easy.  You plug in the charging stand for the remote, plug in the hub and download the app on your mobile.  I have an android phone.  The set up consists of entering each inidividual device (Brand & Model) number.  Finding the model numbers on each device (TV, DVR, Amp, DVD) was a little bit of a pain since my system is already set up.  Other than that, it walks you through everything.Once you pick each device you set up "Watch TV", "Watch Movie" etc.  It pulls up the devices it thinks you need and make any necessary changes.I have not tried to set up any home automation yet.  I do have some lights (Wemo) that I will try to set up soon.What I like so far:It pulls in all of the cable channels (including logos) from your cable provider so no need to set all of them up yourself.  You can set up your favorite channels and even pick a station to always start with.Mobile app does everything the remote does.Works with my RokuSet up was easy for me.Touch screen works well.The things that could improve:I wish they would have combined the charging stand and the hub.  It's just one more thing that has to be plugged in and one more thing next to my TV.This product is great and you get what you pay for, but it still seems high compared to other options.  I'm sure they are trying to compete in the middle of market.  Not the pro installed option and not the cheap universal remote.When you get past the price, I would recommend this product.  I have owned a Harmony remote for years previous to this purchase and have always been happy with it.
