I am a iOS guy and I love my ANYMOTE.  They have great support and in some future hardware update there may be an ANYMOTE for HOMEKIT.  Anyway I bought a ECHO and downloaded the ANYMOTE App.  Created Remotes (they have thousands and thousands of different equipment) and I defined my dumb LG 60'TV, my YAMAHA Sound Bar YSP-4000 and Samsung Cable Box DVR. Funny how all of a sudden IR devices are getting a little dated. Since there isn't a lot of documentation I contacted ANYMOTE and they have great support and helped me all along the way.  I can now say  ALEXA TELL ANYMOTE TURN ON TV and 3 different hardware devices do their thing and turn on.  Now I am into programming macros for CNBC,MSNBC,CNN,FOX,CBS, and HALLMARK so I can say, once all the equipment associated with the TV is on you can then say ALEXA TELL ANYMOTE FOX or ALEXA TELL ANYMOTE TO TURN TO FOX and you have your channel.  I also defined 2 other macros for MUTE and UNMUTE (they do the same thing but it is more understandable to have 2 separate commands.  To ease my memory I though of several ways I might command ANYMOTE and put an extra macro in.  For example  TURN ON TV,  TURN TV ON,  or  MUTE , UNMUTE.  When you are addressing Macros you can also say ALEXA TELL ANYMOTE to EXECUTE TURN ON TV.  That is a longer way of doing it but does the same thing.  I am going to be moving on see if ANYMOTE can MUTE my tv when the Phone rings, won't that be nice.  Ultimately I would be most happy if I could use SIRI also to talk to ANYMOTE. For the most part I am concentrating on buying devices that talk to both platforms, however, controlling my tv with 4 remotes was such a pain I spent the 150 for an ECHO to get the function now.
