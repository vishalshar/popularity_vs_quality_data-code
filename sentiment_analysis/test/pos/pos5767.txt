I've been on the hunt for my ideal iPhone charger for a couple of months now, and I think I've found it in Lithiumcard.Here is what I wanted:1. Small size. I wanted to be able to put the battery on my keychain or put it in a small wristlet/wallet.2. Built-in cables. I wanted both a built-in lightning connection and built-in USB connection for charging the battery itself. There are small chargers with built-in lightnings, but I rarely found one with a built-in USB.3. Passthrough charging. I wanted to be able to charge my iPhone and the battery at the same time.I found options that met one or two of my requirements, but this was the only one that met all three.It is slightly thicker than I had anticipated, but still fits easily into a pocket or small wristlet.The cable on the lightning connection feels a little thin, so I hope it will hold up.The USB connection, at least on mine, protrudes a tiny bit from the corner of the card, while the lightning is completely flush. This is not a problem, but just makes the device feel a little uneven.I debated for a while whether to go with the Lithiumcard Pro or the original. The Pro is twice as thick, offers a larger battery,  has two ports, and stronger cables, from what I read. Ultimately, I decided that I didn't need a complete charge on my iPhone. I mainly plan on using this on my way home from work, or when I'm low on power. In general, I am not without access to an outlet or USB port for more than a few hours, so the thinner version was what I went with.So far, this is great. The included sticky pad is a nice touch, though I find it difficult to stick the card on the back of the phone while charging.It brought my iPhone 6 from 20% to 54% really quickly; I did not time it. I feel that it charged one percent a minute, though.I'm glad I made this purchase.
