I bought this pillow for my husband because he suffers with neck pain.  When I opened it I decided to try it, just to see if I might want to buy one for myself.  I had a bamboo pillow that I loved and couldn't imagine that the GhostPillow could be better.  I threw it on the bed and put my head on it and--sigh--felt all of the tension drain out of my body.  Wow, I wondered if it could be the pillow or maybe I just needed a nap.  Nope, it was the pillow!!  I ordered another one for my husband and kept the first one for myself.  Yes, I know that was selfish but I just couldn't let it go!  I read in other reviews about "getting used to it" and I have to say it was wonderful from the first try.  It is without doubt the best pillow I have ever had.  I am actually concerned that for some/any reason I might be without it.  How would I sleep?  Seriously readers...  IT IS THE BEST.
