You have a  USB 3.0 with a hidden micro USB connector as well on one end, Lightning on the other.  This allows you to connect to any device you want PC/MAC, Android and iOS!  That in itself is just awesome.You can connect to a PC/MAC and load files via USB 3.0 and then take it and connect to your iPhone/iPad and watch movies, listen to music or view photos and documents, and then even flip out the Micro USB to attach it to your Android phone or tablet through OTG.When you first plug the device into your device, it will ask you to go to the App Store and download the i-flashdrive one app, and it is so worth it!The application is robust in every way I could think off, you can browse different media, connect to YouTube, backup the i-Device, link to many many social media for backing up photos and videos (check my video I list all of them). Also you can lock the app with Touch ID/pin code, you can interact with Zip files.The Gigastone Photofast Evo Plus 64GB iFlash Drive gives you expandable storage on ALL your devices and again with the app (which I felt to be robust as mentioned before and well written) you can do so many things with this it is over all a solid 5 Stars!This is a great piece of hardware to have if you have mix of devices (like me), an Android phone, a PC and an iPad Air 2.. it will unlock the memory limitations of your Apple device and so much more.I did receive this product at a reduced rate for my honest review/opinion, I was not compensated to give a positive review in anyway.Luke @ Galaxy Tech Review
