My kindergarten daughter would give this 5 stars - she loves it!!  My husband and I have been helping her with the main structure.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the pieces are a little difficult to snap together and keep together, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.  But we have not had any problems with the townhouse falling apart and we have even moved it a few times.  My daughter and 3 year old son played with the roominate set for over an hour tonight - they enjoyed making furniture and playing with the characters.  My daughter also enjoys decorating with the stickers.  The biggest problem we have had is keeping the ceiling fan from falling out so my daughter decided to put it on top of the house!  I think that even though there are some flaws with this product, it is a great concept and a fantastic learning experience for kids.  I also think the company is trying hard to improve their products.  I contacted them about another set and the response was immediate and they mentioned that they are working to improve the set.
