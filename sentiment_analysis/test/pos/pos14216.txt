As other reviewers have pointed out, this is the best bike mount there is.  I can confirm that.  What is not obvious from other reviews and from the product description is that this kit includes the RokForm RokShield v3 case for the iPhone 5/5s!  I made the mistake that I bet many others have - I ordered the bike mount AND the RokShield case and ended up with TWO cases.  I had to send back the stand-alone case I had ordered.The case that comes with the bike mount is identical to the black RokShield case for iPhone 5/5s except for a minor but significant difference: the stand alone v3 case includes the little "Remote Mounting System" which is the small disc with the RokForm flange and double-stick foam tape so you can stick a mounting point just about anywhere.  The case in the bike mount kit does not have the "Remote Mounting System", instead it has the magnetic mounting kit.  This is a strong rare-earth magnet and a special triangular pad for the back of the case that has a round opening for the magnet.  This magnet lines up with a corresponding magnet that is permanently built-in to the bike mount (poles reversed). So when you click the phone onto the RokForm flange on the bike mount, the magnet in the bike mount STRONGLY grabs onto the magnet in the case.  The resulting physical connection between the phone and the bike is impressive, rock-steady, and very reassuring.  You get a double-attachment: the flange locked onto the phone case AND two strong magnets locked together.  The magnet in the case allows you to stick your phone onto anything made of ferrous metal - the fridge, car body, whatever.  Very handy way of securing your phone spontaneously to a handy metal surface.  It's not as secure as a mount that features the RokForm flange that actually mates with the phone case, but pretty slick nonetheless.This kit is a no-brainer.  You get a phenomenal case and the best bike mount there is in one package.Why only four stars? With both the polycarbonate shell and the bumper on the phone, the mute switch is quite hard to operate.  I used to be able to mute and unmute my phone without even looking at it while it was in my pocket - even through the fabric of my pants.  The switch is so deep inside the case now that it takes focus to reach and move the slider.  If you're a guy with average sized or larger hands, you will not be able to operate the switch with your thumb or middle finger - they won't fit inside the opening.  And if you keep your nails very short, you honestly may only be able to operate the switch with your pinky finger. RokForm should add a slider to the polycarbonate shell that operates the mute switch so that it can be easily used with the bumper in place.
