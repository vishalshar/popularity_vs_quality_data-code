They are easy to clean and easy for my kids to close. These aren't leak proof (the outer sections, not the thermos section) and when I put salsa in there for my kids to dip their taquitos, salsa went EVERYWHERE in their backpacks. Also, I haven't been able to find a small, leakproof container for ranch or ketchup that will fit inside the lunchbox. The way their schools store and pass out their lunches, it would be impossible to have a separate container that doesn't fit inside. Major bummer. Love the box, would love it more if it really didn't leak and they had an optional dipping sauce container. The hummus, ranch and ketchup I make/have at home is so much healthier than processed, prepackaged sauces I now have to send with them.
