i got this for my post rotator cuff surgery knowing I was going to have to sleep on my back...which I don't do.  This wedge was great, though I wish it would have been a little bit taller, but still, it's a good height.  My only complaint, as I read in someone else's review, was the smell of the wedge.  I let it air out and washed the cover and that helped.  The covering is very soft.  I would recommend this product.
