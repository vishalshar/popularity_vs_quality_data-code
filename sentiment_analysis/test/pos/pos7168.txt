PLEASE SEE MOST RECENT UPDATE AT BOTTOM:I feel bad giving this product a mediocre review because it has a lot of good things going for it. The design is awesome and it's a little powerhouse.For the most part, it does exactly what it claims to. I did the research before buying it, so I knew that I would need the Apple adapter (blame Apple, not RIF6 for not including a cable), I knew about the crappy internal speaker (small speakers generally don't sound good unless they're earbuds) and I also knew that is only operational with the included remote. I knew these things but decided it was worth the risk.And....it sort of IS worth the risk, depending on what you're trying to do.I wanted to use this with my ps4. I had visions of projecting my video games on the garage door in my yard and playing at more or less life-size. This dream has come true -- I can do that -- and with the help of some desktop speakers the whole neighborhood can listen to exploding helicopters, machine gun fire and the screams of civilians as i drive on the sidewalks in GTA5.This worked SO WELL in fact -- that I thought I should use the Cube indoors too! And here is where I encountered a problem. Unlike outside, where I can have the Cube sitting on top of my ps4 -- Inside my ps4 is in a cabinet, so the projector needs to be behind me, and that is a no-can-do. At least not yet.The issue is the mini hdmi to hdmi cable. The included cable is maybe a foot in length, and I need one that's at least 12 feet. I bought two cables off amazon -- neither worked. Neither did a hdmi extension cable. I wrote to RIF6 via amazon and they said they'd talk to their engineering team. That was two days ago. Today I contacted RIF6 through their website, I'll update when I hear back.I also looked into updating the software -- but there doesn't appear to be any links or downloads on the RIF6 website.As a final attempt to get this to work -- I purchased a mini hdmi to hdmi adapter today. I'll update if THAT works.If none of these things work out -- then I will just have to love the Cube as it is. One other reviewer says he feels like this is a prototype, or unfinished product. I get where he's coming from. I don't completely agree, I think this is a marvelous little pico projector, it's just a little limited in it's capabilities. So just keep in mind that unless you are good having your phone/tablet/whatever tethered to your Cube by a short cable -- you may have issues.UPDATE #1 -- I heard back from tech support the day after I posted this review. I asked about the cables being proprietary, or if they could recommend a cable brand that would work & this is the response I received:"As for nowthey are not proprietary but they have specific specs that makes it almost impossible to tell which 3rd party cables would work and which wont.therefore its just better we send you one that will work 100%.we are always working on improving our product and will take that kind of feedback into consideration for future versions of the cube."The support person also said RIF6 is in the process of manufacturing their own 12 foot cable for use with the Cube.UPDATE #2 -- The hdmi to mini hdmi adapter I ordered arrived and -- it hasn't worked with any of the hdmi cables I've tried.UPDATE 3# -- If you read through the comments on this review, you'll see someone recommended a hdmi cable that solved some issues they were having with their tv. I bought that cable and like all the others -- it didn't work. But what was interesting is that the manufacturer of that cable sent me a follow-up email, in which they mention to contact them regarding any troubleshooting issues BECAUSE in the case of some of their longer cables -- hdmi will sometimes require a "signal booster".  Well, that got me to thinking.So I bought this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005E2XY3E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1And, sure enough, IT WORKS. I've used three different hdmi cables plugged in to this "booster" and then from the booster i connected the RIF6 Cube using their (included) hdmi to mini hdmi cable and it worked every time.I've adjusted my review from three to four stars -- this really is a neat little projector, it's just plain cool. But it really sucks that you can't use whatever hdmi cables you have lying around your house. That's a huge detriment. But -- problem solved. If you want to use this with a longer cable -- until they come out with their own -- you need a signal booster.
