After using clips to make it lie flat, put the WakaWaka Base 10 in the sun under a clear sky at latitude 37 (Mountain View,CA, Chesapeake, Wichita) at  8 AM. The depleted battery pack was fully charged by 3 in the afternoon- 7 hours. Then the battery pack charged up my iPad Air from a starting 10% in 6 hours 1.2 times.Heavy. OK for car camping, not backpacking.You will see below that the BAD points outnumber the GOOD points by far, so why 4 stars? Because the GOODs are so good, and except for the awkward and proprietary cable and the heavy battery/transformer, are minor by comparison to how well put-together and powerful this small unit is... and it must be said that many reviewers fault other panels for poor interface with battery packs. That isn't a problem here; this is a unified system that just works.GOOD:-Very efficient solar cells.-Rugged, quality construction. Big positive points here.-3 USB charging ports, one supposedly optimized for Apple devices.-Very good waterproofing.-Includes 2 Flashlights, one of which has its own battery.-Includes 2 USB/micro USB cables 2 meters long, and power cable is 3 meters.BAD:-Panels wont lie flat unless you clamp them or weigh them down.-Proprietary power cable so you cant skip the heavy battery pack/transformer. If they separated the transformer/control module from the battery, as so many other solar chargers do, you could charge your devices directly, saving a lot of weight.-The button in the middle of the display circle is concealed, waiting to be discovered with no help from the instructions.-The instructions? Ah, they are terrible: pictographs and as bad as Dyson Vacuums, with actual helpful wording in short supply; forget about arrows. I could go on about how bad the instructions are in a whole rant, but suffice it to say if you like hieroglyphics and puzzles, you will be pleased.-The display is unnecessarily complex and obscure.-The power cable sticks straight out of the back of the panels and is just waiting to break off.-The solar panels are VERY sensitive to angle.-The sturdy carrying bag is the wrong shape and design- very odd.-Full charge indicator displays only if you press the secret button.My final test was to set the WakaWaka on fire and drop it from the roof, but then I read this caution in the manual: (see photo)
