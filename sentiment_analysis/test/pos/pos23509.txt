Best blanket ever! its versatile, packs down and seems pretty strong. The color is great and it does a fantastic job of staying relatively cool and comfortable whilst keeping you warm. It can be a bit noisy like a sleeping bag if you move and shift a lot at night but nothing to write home about. All-in-all i will be back to buy more Rumpl's to add to my camping and home collections. The big one is also very BIG and is larger than i expected...but for the price i was a welcomed surprise!
