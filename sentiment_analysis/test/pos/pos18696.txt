I find this useful and helpful.  I like to experiment with open tunings and the Roadie is a lot of fun to work with.  I see a few comments from others suggesting you should just use your ears, I agree but I also like to be accurate and I guess my ears aren't trained sufficiently. So the Roadie for me is worth the money.
