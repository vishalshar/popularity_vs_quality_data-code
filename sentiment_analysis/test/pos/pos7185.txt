Let's just start by saying Apple didn't come through with any watch band that holds up to the daily activitys of a truly active person. I.e. Construction worker, mechanic, etc. Let alone a band that creates a bold statement of a solid watch. With the addition of this LUNATIK watch band/case my Apple Watch(A/W) now looks like I always imagined it should, big, bold, and solid. It some what resembles a g-shock that's for sure but it demands its own place in the watch game due to the fact it surrounds an A/W. Big watches are in right now and this band fits the bill. I constantly get asked "what kind of watch is that" With that said there are a few draw backs. doing, say push-ups or something of that nature , the Digital Crown does get pushed in and Siri will ask you what's up, not a super big deal for me but could be annoying for some. ( I just tell her to shut up) also the band is mounted around the watch with two hex screws of which you are asked to not over tighten, but if not tightened enough they will eventually back out and fall out. I lost one already but they do provide two extras with the proper tools to do the tightening with. Periodic tightening and checking would probably remedy this but once again that's just and added inconvenience. But not a deal breaker for me. All in all a nice up grade to your Apple Watch!
