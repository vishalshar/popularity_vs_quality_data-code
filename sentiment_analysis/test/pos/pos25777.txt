I have had these for about two months.  I LOVE these headphones.  Not only is the music clear, but the ability to pass though sound from the outside (or turn it off) is awesome.  The software is updated often and is always adding new features.  If you are on the fence, get off and hopefully you will enjoy them as much as I have.
