As a new college grad working in software engineering, I never anticipated how much sitting I would be doing. Between sitting through meetings and working at a desk, it seems that over 80% of my time at work is in a chair. It wasn't long before my default posture was completely hunched over.I started looking for solutions to solve this problem and that is when I came upon the Upright device. It's fairly straight forward and easy to set up, with immediate feedback. After training with it for a few days, I began to feel the differences and understand what correct posture felt like.One of the biggest advantages to me was the fact that this wasn't something I had to wear and use all day to see benefits. Unlike most fitness trackers, the Upright device is something that I only need to train with for a few minutes a day. This is very nice and convenient because I don't have to carry it around with me everywhere I go.If you're stuck in a chair for most of the day and looking to improve your posture, the Upright device will definitely help you.
