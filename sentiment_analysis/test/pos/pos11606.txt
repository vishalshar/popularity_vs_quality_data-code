I'm torn - it does work nicely as a range extender - however it was a *royal* PITA for this IT guy to set up. I can only imagine how confusing it would be for someone from the tech-challenged end of the spectrum.  * * Do yourself a favor - install the kisslink app on your smartphone or tablet before you even unbox the little rascal. It'll save you some headaches.I took a quick inventory of what's included in the box: the kisslink appliance, a wall-wart adapter, a USB to micro USB cable, and an Ethernet cable. A brief scan of the "getting started guide" and I plugged 'er in. Kind of an orangey-amber light as it booted up, then it went to its normal blue. "Kissed" my smartphone to it until they happily recognized one another. I then joined the open kisslink network, the setup page opened, and I selected my network's SSID from the drop down list, I then entered my network key and kisslink joined my network. So far, so good.I now had my smartphone connected to the "open" network - when I tried to connect to the WPA2 encrypted network, that was a big "no go" - it would not accept my pre-shared key (password). Hmmmm, this won't do - enter the smartphone app.Once I got the app connected to the kisslink via the app, I was able to get access to quite a few more settings. I was able to go to Router/WiFi settings and change the SSID on both the guest and encrypted instances. The guest instance authenticates via a "kiss" or the zen button (for stationary hardware). I also changed the encryption key and saved my settings - I attempted to connect to the encrypted SSID - no joy. I went back in to the WiFi settings to verify my pre-shared key, and lo and behold  - bless its little heart - the kisslink had changed my royally obnoxious password to an even more obnoxious one of its own devising. Isn't that just precious? I re-entered my key, saved it and checked again - same results. "I can't do that, Dave..." (I'm Scott, but this seemed like a good time for that quote.)Fine, then.I painstakingly keyed my little nemesis' self-generated password in, saved it and it FINALLY connected to the encrypted SSID. So - it works, but not without a headache or three.  PROS:  * It's cute.  * "Kissing" is great for when guests need internet access  * It does extend your network's range  CONS:  * It's a pain in the arse to set up for anything involving encryption.  * The app is kludgy, but it still should be mentioned *first* in the getting started documentation.  * A browser-based app would be more effective.  * Why doesn't kisslink just clone the encryption key you enter when you join your existing network? This would be SO much easier if it did.Note:On the home page of the app, I found a link for a firmware update - dare I? I dood it! Except it did not work the first five times I tried it - guess what? Your smartphone needs to be directly connected to the kisslink for firmware updates to work. That is a useful bit of info! ;)I received this product at a discount for providing my honest, unbiased review.tl:drIt works well, but has a few rough spots needing to be ironed out...
