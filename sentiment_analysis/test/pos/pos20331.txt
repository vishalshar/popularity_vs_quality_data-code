Wow, what a phone. I keep buying phones every few months and have the Alcatel Pixi 4 (6) which is a 6" but was not happy with the battery. I searched online for a big phone with good specs but the ones I found would not work in the USA on 4g lte and almost gave up until I came across this beast. Ordered phone on Wednesday and paid shipping for 2 days BUT there was a mechanical issue with delivery so I contacted Amazon on Friday morning about 7am and was issued a refund about 9am. Phone came saturday and it worked straight out the box. I am still going through it's features but so far this beast is awesome. Good battery and fast charging. nice screen and super fast. sound sounded low but I do have the gel cover on so maybe that is an issue but will be testing again. Pity there is no place for memory card. Worried about how my sim would work in tray as it seemed the tray is upside down and I have a nano sim in an adaptor so worried it will fall out when inserting it but that worked out ok. Is it because of the 5.1 it's running that all apps appear on all pages?
