I love my ilumi bulb! My roommate and I have 3 bulbs (bedrooms/ living room) and we have so much fun setting up our apartment in different moods and colors. It's really amazing how much color can effect the feel of a room. We've set up the color changing music for gatherings. I cheat and use morning white light when I am staying up late working to keep me alert. It's also nice to wake up to different colors too. It definitely adds another level to the home to make it feel more personalized and customized. Set up was pretty easy too.
