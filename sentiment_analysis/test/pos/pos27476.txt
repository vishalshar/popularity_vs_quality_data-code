Here's what I love most about the Roadie, as I rely on it for on-the-money tuning in my church music job.....custom tunings.  Now, I don't mean established alternate tunings like Drop D or DADGAD, though it'll do that, and it's sure useful.  But I mean custom specification for each string pitch, down to the CENT.A while back, I saw a wonderful tutorial by James Taylor, explaining how he handled his tuning through frequent capo changes during his shows.  You can search Youtube for "Bonus Lesson: Tuning", and his lesson will be the top result.  In short, he detunes each of his guitar strings by a few specific cents as a way of achieving a sort of equal temperament compromise.  He came to this realization over the years, during his long career.The problem, when I saw this, is that I wanted to do that for my own tuning....but I couldn't find a pedal tuner that was precise to the cent.  There's a "10 cents" indicator on most tuners, but that's not close enough; I found an Android app called UltraTuner that did individual cents, but it was so jumpy as to be unusable with the precision I needed.  Short of yet another standalone tuner purchase, of the kind Taylor was using for his demonstration, I couldn't find a solution.Until Roadie.  In fact, Roadie is a better solution for the custom tuning than even the tuner James Taylor used for his demonstration!  With Roadie, I programmed in James Taylor's advice for the perfect compromise tuning:  E -3, B -6, G -4, D -8, A -10, and E -12.  The app lets me dial that in exactly beforehand, save the profile, and then assign it as the default tuning for as many guitars as I want.Then it just does it for me, without me having to think about which number I'm aiming for on which string, and trying to guess "close enough".  If Roadie hiccups occasionally on a harmonic and doesn't get a string right on, I just tune the string again briefly, and it always cleans it up.  A slow strum after each Roadie tune will confirm if it's spot-on, or if an anomaly made it so you have to quickly redo a string to get it perfectly exact.Roadie is user friendly, it's full-featured, it's exact, and it's better than any non-custom tuning with a manual device.....I'll no longer leave home without it!
