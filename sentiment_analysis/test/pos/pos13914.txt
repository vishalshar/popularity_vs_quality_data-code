It was getting harder and harder to find Dream Waters in stores and if I did, they were very expensive. The powder is at least half the cost and now is something that I can order from Amazon at a good price.  It is just as effective as its liquid counterpart and takes up a lot less space for travel.  The taste isn't bad as I just pour the powder in my mouth and wash it down with a little water.  I'd still like to see the price come down some, but hopefully if it continues to catch on, the price will come down more.  Well done!
