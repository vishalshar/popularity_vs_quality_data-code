I got my Filament Lighting Kit this last week and finally had a chance to set them up over the weekend. As a frequent Yelper (elite status 2 years running now), I thought I would start sharing more experiences on Amazon. I couldnt resist the chance to be the first to review.. Ive been wanting to try smart lighting for a while, and I figured if these didnt work out, I could easily return them with Amazon. Plus I had a dinner party this weekend, where I wanted to use for the first time.I was a little apprehensive about the setup of the lights, after reading the reviews of other smart lights, but decided to give Filament a try after reading about how the company was created to make it easier for things like smart lights and switches to connect.The setup ended up being pretty easy, all in all, it took me about 20 minutes. The longest wait, was for the Relay box to connected to the Internet. It took a few long minutes to connect to the Internet, and for the light to turn blue, which means it is ready.  The light was a little too bright for my taste at first, but it adjusted after a few minutes. Once the light finally turned Blue, I was able to connect my relay and move forward with the setup. Adding bulbs was the most fun, I just used the mobile app to scan a little bar code on each bulb. The mobile app, was a little confusing to me at first, but I am getting used to it, and really like controlling my lights from my iPhone. I think they have an Android app too?I used my new lights for the first time to set the mood for a dinner party I had on Saturday night. I changed the bulbs to a warm orange and loved the effect that it gave the room. And the guests loved it! I hope to do the same for my living room and bedroom. My favorite thing at this point, is that I can control the lights from my phone.So far, the lights have been easy to use and control, and I like the color and dimming options it gives me.
