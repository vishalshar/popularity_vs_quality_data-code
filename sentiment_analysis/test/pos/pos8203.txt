OK, so you probably don't NEED to be able to start your morning coffee from the other side of the planet, or to control the brew temperature of your coffee to within 1 degree Fahrenheit, but with the Behmor Connected Coffee Maker, you CAN.The unit gets 4 stars rather than 5 because the control app (which runs on your smartphone) could use a little work.  It gets the job done once you learn to navigate the menus, but isn't the most user-friendly app.  It defaults to the unit's setup and calibration procedure, rather than day-to-day brewing routines.In future iterations, it would amazing to be able to control more aspects of the brewing process.  For example, the unit works on a single water temperature and a single pre-soak time.  Those are the two variables the user can set.  Now, that's certainly more control than most machines provide, but it would be great if a user could experiment with, say, a pre-soak at one temperature and a brew at a second temp.What about three or more temperatures?  What about, say, a short pause in the middle of brewing, or perhaps multiple pauses?  What might that do?  What about user control of flow rate?  It would be nice to have more control over these and other parameters and experiment a bit.To be fair, the lack of these controls doesn't detract from the unit in any way.  Most users would never tinker with any of that, anyway.  But for coffee nerds like myself, the potential for even better coffee is right there.Bottom Line: Behmor has a great machine that can make very good coffee.  Better software could really make it shine.
