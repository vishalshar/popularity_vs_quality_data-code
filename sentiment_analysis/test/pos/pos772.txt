I have a very early model where some of the issues with the cap assembly were not yet addressed, hence the 4/5 stars.  I now have an upgraded cap and all is good in ukeg land.For me the best part about it is getting it filled up- every time I have gotten it filled at various growler fill stations it has created a big stir with both the people working and the randoms sitting at the counter.  It's always "hey Bob, come check this out!  This is so cool!" etc etc.  People pose for pictures with it, one guy was so excited he got on his phone and ordered one right there.  It's pretty fun and always a great conversation starter.  Going to a party where you don't know many people?  Show up with this thing and you will soon have an audience...It requires a low-moderate amount of technical know-how to own and maintain, but that's part of what makes it fun, and the GW website is pretty good with instructional videos etc.  The ukeg guys have responded quickly when I had problems initially, so I feel like they actually care about their product and their customers- it isn't some massive corporation, it's a few buddies working in a garage (that's how it feels when you talk to them).  No call centers, etc, it's real people with pride for their product.
