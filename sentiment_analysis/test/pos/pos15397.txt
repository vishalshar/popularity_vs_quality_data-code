I ordered a smaller bag of these to try out about a year ago, and really liked them so I added this to my subscribe & save order. They get my clothes clean and leave them smelling really great. I love the Lavender & Vanilla scent so I pair these pods with the Downy dryer sheets (Downy Ultra Infusions Lavender Serenity Sheet Fabric Softener 105 Count).I saw some other reviews where the pods didn't completely dissolve, and I've encountered this maybe a handful of times over the course of the past year, but I can't pinpoint the reason - I typically use cold water and occasionally warm, but rarely use hot, and a majority of the time the pods completely dissolve in the cold water. I've If I have a large load, I'll just throw two of them in and never noticed them coming out undissolved.I have a newer high-efficiency washer and these are the only product I've ever used in it [no liquid detergent]. I've never noticed the mildewy smell in the wash tub, and I've never had to clean my washer, which I hear is really common with new HE machines. Not sure if this can be attributed to the pods or not, but these are definitely a great product, super convenient, and no-mess like liquid detergent. I'd highly recommend them.
