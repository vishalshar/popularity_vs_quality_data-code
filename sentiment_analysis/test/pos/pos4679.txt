My first drone !I have been flying this drone for about two weeks. I was very happy with the learning curve on this drone. Very easy to learn to fly.Had a problem with battery after it said 90% It would tell me "voltage delta between cells to high land immediately."Contacted Ehang support by email and they responded very quick.  Ehang is in the process of sending me a new battery.  Great customer service.  So far I am very pleased with my ghost drone 2.0! I would recommend this drone for any beginner!Kurt M
