We have three canarys in the house to cover all areas. I gave the device a 4 instead of a 5 for three reasons.1. The power port on the back appears to NOT be as strong as it should be. Our satanic cat decided to knock one off it's high perch and when we found it, it was dangling from the power cord which had caught on something. From that day on the cable, which was fine, gave us trouble connecting and making proper contact in the port. We'd have ti jiggle it around, until finally it would not make contact at all. Ended up throwing it away and getting a replacement.2. I don't appreciate the fact that we are forced to pay for realistic storage on top of the cost of the device.  12 hours is NOT realistic. a week is realistic.3. Too many false positives, in spite of us tagging them all the time. Gets to the point where we just don't even bother checking anymore. And that defeats the purpose of the machine.
