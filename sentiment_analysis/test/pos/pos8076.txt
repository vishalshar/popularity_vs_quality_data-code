First off, I purchased this watch on Kickstarter so I didn't expect a perfect watch from the get-go, but damn is this watch near perfect. I own a Moto 360 first gen and the experience is like night and day! Here are my impressions of the watch.PROS:Bluetooth Connectivity: Personally, my experience in this area has been flawless. When I opened the box and booted up the watch (which was wonderfully packed might I add), I downloaded the companion app and they paired right away. Side note: I am using a Nexus 6p as my daily driver. I work in an office as an IT tech so sometimes I leave my phone at my desk and walk around. I noticed that the connectivity range is much better than my Moto 360. Though the range is really impressive compared to my previous experience, it still disconnects once you're too far, but it reconnects effortlessly which is something that I cannot say for my Moto 360. I have had this watch for a week now and I have yet to have a dropped connection *knock on wood*Battery Life: I don't like to wear watches when I sleep, so I really don't mind taking the watch off to charge every night. This might be a deal breaker for some, but I really don't mind it. Where the battery life exceeds my expectations is on my long days where I take my watch off of the charging station at 6am, go to my day job, go to school, then go to my evening job and get home around 10pm with about 20% battery left. This is really impressive since my Moto 360 would have hit and miss days, but this is still only the first week, so I will keep testing it out.Build Quality: The watch is EXTREMELY LIGHT. When I am wearing the watch, I barely notice that it is on there. The first day I got it, I was surprised at how light it was compared to my Moto 360. But even though it doesn't weigh as much as other watches do, it still feels sturdy and well built. Do keep in mind, the Snow and Charcoal watches are made of aluminum, so try not to bump too much on hard surfaces or it might nick the watch. I have the Snow version, and it looks slightly bulkier than the Charcoal version. Compared to my Moto 360 though, it looks alot less bulky I think due to the curved nature of the watch. An added bonus is that the watch can easily be dressed up and dressed down using different watch bands, but this isn't specific to the Ticwatch 2.Functionality: This is probably my favorite aspect of the watch. The watch has a "tickle" function located on the side opposite of the crown of the watch. It allows you to scroll through menus and notifications without covering the screen. This was actually one of the biggest reasons I wanted to buy this watch. Though it is not quite as sensitive as I would like it to be, it serves its purpose and it does it well, but you have to be sure that your wrist isnt touching the "tickle strip" or it loses sensitivity. You can also disable it if you dont want to use it. You are also able to listen to music and take calls on the watch itself. This was a feature that I didn't have with my Moto 360, and something I notice I use pretty frequently. Since I got the watch, there have been about 4 different occasions in which I answered a call using my Ticwatch 2 and every time, the caller could hear everything I said, and I could hear everything they said, though I would like a little bit more volume, but that's just my personal opinion. I usually have my phone connected to my car, and when it is, the phone will be answered on the car. If I answer a call on my watch when I'm not connect to my car, it will automatically answer to my watch and I can switch to my phone once I have it in my hand, which is really convenient. The text-to-speech input is really fast and accurate. The only time I notice a struggle, is when I try to say a name. The touch sensitivity and accuracy is really good, even when I test out the calculator app on the watch, 99% of the time I am pushing the correct number, and please note that I DO NOT have small hands. When swiping between menus and between different notifications, it feels so fluid compared to my 2 year old Moto 360. Notification pushing is really good. The only gripe I have with it is when you receive a notification for a text and the same person sends you two messages, you will only see the most recent text. I hope this is something that they fix in the next OTA. This is only an issue I have when texting. In hangouts or the Couple app, you are able to view ALL new messages and even the whole conversation. I hope they make this available to all apps. Another function that the Ticwatch 2 has that is fun is you can actually take a screen shot of your watch face that saves to your phones gallery. This isnt a must have function, but it is nice to have in case you ever want to use it.CONS:Implementation: Though this watch is amazing right now, they could improve it much more. The Ticwatch runs Mobvoi software, NOT Android Wear. So if you try to use apps that need the Android Wear app to run, unfortunately it won't work. This could be a deal breaker for some, and I thought it would be for me, but in all honesty, it isn't. There are a few apps that are not yet supported so when I select them, I receive an error message, but since I received the watch a week ago, Mobvoi has pushed two OTA's that have improved implementation and functionality of the watch. Though it still doesn't fully support Android Wear, I can now see some apps that were only supported on Android Wear, sync and work with the Ticwatch, so as long as they keep improving and listening to their customers, I will be a happy camper.Fitness: The Ticwatch 2 has GPS location, so hypothetically, if you were to go jogging without your phone, you could still track the distance and amount of steps you've taken. This is where I noticed its biggest pitfall. Sometimes the watch will count more steps than I've actually taken, or count less. It also sometimes undershoots the distance that I run, whether it's outside or indoor. But this is something that can be fixed with an OTA update, so I am not disappointed, but eager for the fix.tldr; I love my Ticwatch 2. It isn't perfect, but if Mobvoi keeps doing what they're doing, (bi-weekly OTA updates, listening to the backers, adding functionality, etc.) it can be. If you cannot live without your Android Wear apps, this might not be the watch for you YET. It may be in the future, but you have to give it some time. I'm excited for what this company has to offer.
