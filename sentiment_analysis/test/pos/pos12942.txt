I love this thing. It's the clearest sounding speaker on the market and being fully waterproof and durable I have no fear of bringing it places. I also have the XL which is hands down the best BT speaker for under 300 bucks. I love that I can changes songs on the speaker, something most competitors surprisingly cannot do. I listen to it every night for several hours as I fall asleep and honestly I charge it up once every month, that is not a joke. Not the loudest so not for throwing parties but for chill social events, this thing is perfect. The handle bar mount is good but the strap and multimount are kinda jokes. Overall highly recommend, even over the Boom2 and Charge 2+, which I also own.
