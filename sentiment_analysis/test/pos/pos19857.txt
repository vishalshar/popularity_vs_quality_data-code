Let me start out by saying I usually don't write reviews unless I feel strongly about a product, good or bad. I just took delivery of my FUGOO Sport and had a chance to use it in all the environments I use my speakers. Out of the box I also felt the max volume level was too low compared to my UE Boom and even my Bose Mini. I then realized through researching the internet that there was a firmware update available. After the update (01.00.36) I can tell you that it made a world of difference without sacrificing the clarity, lows, mids and highs!! It's not as loud as my UE Boom but I didn't expect it to be, loud does not translate to clean true music. It does not have the artificial base response that my Bose does, it actually reproduces music that is true and the way it should sound. Believe me when I tell you I now hear instruments in songs I didn't hear with the Boom or even the Bose.BUT here is what sets this speaker apart from all the others out there, it called CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I'm blown away by the reply time, every time I sent them a question. When do you ever get a reply back by the owner of the company? never.All I can say is, if your looking for a quality blutooth speaker with insane battery life, accurate reproduction of your music and superlative customer service look no further, this is the one. I actually went to sleep last night listening to Pandora through my Sport, I love listening to my music again, I hope this review helps.UPDATE 12/04/14I just took delivery of my 4th FUGOO! They ran a special on Cyber Monday for $139!!!  For that price it's a no brainer for me. As for me, I've had my sport since July and am still impressed every time I turn it on. What a great speaker and customer service, if they ever sell it again for $139, I'll be purchasing several more. I know FUGOO is working on pairing 2 speakers together via an app, so when that happens I'm ready, haha. Anyway I just wanted to give you an update in case your on the fence, go ahead and pull the trigger, you won't be sorry!!!
