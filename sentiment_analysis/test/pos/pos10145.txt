These are delicious. Its like eating a mild sour candy that is good for you. I love that it has Omega 3 and vitamin D all in one. Just fyi the daily recommended dosage is 6 gummies per day. Seems like a lot but I figure I just have 3 in the morning and 3 in the evening. Its only 50 calories for the 6 gummies. And it takes care of my sweet tooth after dinner.
