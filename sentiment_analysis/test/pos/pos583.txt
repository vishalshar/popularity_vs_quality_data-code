**UPDATED**Well, I saw there were different ways to lace them on the Hickies website and I tired the Extra Loose and they work so much better!  Check it out for yourselves![...]Original Review:Well, I was really wanting to like these but I do not. I have a high arch and instep, and these HURT the top of my feet they are so tight!  I put them in my Skechers and wore them out to lunch (no more than an hour) and my right foot went numb and they made dents in the top of my feet!  They also made my shoes much harder to get on than with my laces-even when I left the laces tied. Looks like they are coming out of my shoes and being returned...
