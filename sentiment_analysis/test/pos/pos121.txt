First real innovation in luggage in my lifetime. This bag is great if you can pack in a streamlined way. Less space than comparably sized bags due to the electronics. However it's well made and I love being able to charge my devices on the go and I never have issues carrying it on. Now if only they made a larger bag with similar characteristics (ability to self-weigh, track via app).
