I want to give this a five stars, I really do. However, the cost of the filament is a bit much in my opinion. To be fair, I knew that before I purchased it, but I didn't realize how little you can do with one pack. Overall, it's a very cool device and works as you would expect. It does take some time to get the hang of it, the plastic tends to want to drag around as your trying to draw. Peeling it up can be kind of a delicate process as well. I really think if they reduced the filament cost, it would be an even greater product. It's hard to be creative and adventurous when the materials are pricey and limited.
