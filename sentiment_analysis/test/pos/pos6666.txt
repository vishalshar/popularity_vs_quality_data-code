This is my second effort to  review this.  Hope doesn't show up twice.  Wanted wireless, need mobile so we can move around.  Took 15 minutes to set up.  Yes you still have electric cords but those are very manageable.  What's important is no speaker wires, the center console really delivers sophisticated management. Budget was set by the boss and I found this and am so pleased.  Movies, voices problems.  No more and surround sound is beautiful.  Bluetooth used my Samsung S6 to get Enclave app and download new firmware.  I have talked with Rob at Enclave, feels more like a family.  I look forward to many hours of pleasant movies watching!
