I was a little worried about the flavor of coffiest when I ordered it, but I think it's great! It's a very mild coffee flavor crossed with a mild chocolate flavor that goes down smoothly cold. It's reasonably filling and the caffeine/l-theanine mix is wonderful.My only nitpick is that the bottles I received did not have the foil seal that I had heard was being implemented a few months ago. Not sure what's going on there.
