Out of the box experience was straightforward. Quick start guide prompted me to download the Sevenhugs App, which walked me through the setup, which took about 5 minutes in all.Indoor temperature, humidity, and air quality are the initial readings. Temperature and humidity are pretty basic readings, but air quality was our first interesting find. We started off with air quality in the good range, until about an hour after I set up the system I decided to vacuum the house before some dinner guests arrived, at which point the ppm spiked and air quality dropped significantly. So much for making the house nicer for our guests!First night's sleep was less than stellar, apparently I toss & turn (or at least wake) more than I thought. Looking forward to seeing how the scores change over time and as the weekday craziness begins.
