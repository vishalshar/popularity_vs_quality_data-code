I've been using the MiniPresso daily for 3 months and it has been great. If you are looking for a legit espresso, then go spend $1000 on a good espresso machine but if you are a broke college student like me, this will let you make lattes astronomically better than whatever Starbucks can make.I hear people complaining about how much pressure you need to put in to make your espresso. Sure, if you are above 70 or a child. Otherwise, it is not bad at all if you grab it the correct way (look up youtube videos or something).Also, it takes me like a minute to clean in my dorm sink. Never had any trouble with that.In summary, it is a great machine but make sure that you read all the caring instructions really well and also the tips, especially:-Use really really hot water-Grind your beans fresh-Make the grind fine
