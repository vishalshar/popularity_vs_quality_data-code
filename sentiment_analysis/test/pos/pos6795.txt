From seasoned Cards Against Humanity players, this was a ton of fun! It works much the same, but the pictures add an extra element of hilarity to the mix. We adapted the rules a little bit to suit us, which is the beauty of this, and games like it. I could see this having longer play potential than CAH, which requires expansion packs to keep being entertaining. One thing we ladies noticed, this is a very male-centric game, at least so far (we haven't seen all the cards yet). We think crude jokes about ladies should be in here, too. Equal opportunity humor!
