I've seen ones like this for over $1800 bucks. This is a real bargain! This unit is really easy to fly.  It is also easy to crash into stuff.  And, it CAN BREAK. I flew into a metal sign, it broke the front two props, then tried to compensate and took a nose dive onto the pavement.  $40 bucks worth of damage, minor fuselage damage.  Should be flying again soon.  Great video from it.  I have it set on 720p @ 60fps, and the videos are small and really good quality.
