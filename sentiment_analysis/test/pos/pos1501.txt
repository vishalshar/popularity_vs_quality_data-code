This is a really fun game to play. Combines Old Maid, One Night Werewolf, and the paranoid suspicion of a witch hunt.  The directions make the game seem much more complicated than it really is; we got really over-whelmed the first time we read through how to play the game.  We found that just playing and having the directions nearby as a reference helped us understand best.  Now for new players I give them a basic understanding of the first round, then explain the next parts as we get there (i.e., explain Conspiracy and Night when those cards are played).  Would be good to have an app to give the directions during Night. Over-all this is a winner.
