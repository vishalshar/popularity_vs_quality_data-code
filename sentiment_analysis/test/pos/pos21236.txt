*ETA* I have talked to the co-founder, and he has informed me that their battery supplier has sent them defective batteries. They are receiving better batteries in September to hopefully avoid the possibility of a defective card. Not all cards are defective, I was just unlucky. It is not their fault. I definitely intend to order another card from them in the future. I am adding stars to reflect their customer service. I really do think they wanted to make a quality product, but that is impossible to do if the supplier gives them defective parts.I signed the card, pulled the tab, and then ate dinner. In the span of this time, the battery should not have died. After the button was pushed, it played for 3 minutes, not 3 hours. It was very quiet, and did not get louder. I tried to push the button multiple times afterwards, and it wouldn't even get past the first happy birthday. I hope I just got a faulty card and the rest of them are made as poorly.
