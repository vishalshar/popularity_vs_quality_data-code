Seriously??? Don't buy it just because the specs, unbelievable.I am just wondering about the original review, what is it that the Phantom 3 or 4 can do that this drone can't?. I own both drones, X-Star Premium and a Phantom 3 Professional.Let's talk about the controller first, Autel has added an LCD display to the controller itself which provides critical flight telemetry data such as altitude, range, battery remaining (for both the remote and the AC), gimbal's tilt, AC's orientation, etc. This redundancy provides an increased margin of safety and allows the pilot the option to use the full screen of the external display to view video coming back from the drone at 720P. Let's say that the battery of your tablet or phone dies or that your flying app collapses while you are flying the drone, with X-Star Premium you have an actual LCD that tells you everything you need to know to bring your drone back home safely.While DJI's Phantom 3 / 4 have a return to home feature (button in the controller), if DJI's Go App or the mobile device was to crash, the operator does not have the visibility of knowing how far the phantom is from the home point, orientation, battery level of the aircraft, altitude. Simply an RTH button in the controller.While many people choose to fly their drone for only for the joy of flying, the real purpose of camera drones is to capture photos and videos from an elevated perspective. The X-Star Premium 108's degree FOV camera is capable of taking video at 4K30, 2.7K60, 1080p120, or 720p240 fps. It has the ability to take 12 MP photographs and has burst shooting (3/5/7 seconds), time lapse (5/7/10/20/30 seconds) and Auto Exposure Bracketing (AEB) modes and saves them as JPG or DNG. This is something the P3P and P4 can do.The X-Star Premium is designed with an easily removable gimbal which only requires the push of a button on the side of the gimbal to slide it off. This feature will allow the camera to be easily upgraded as payload technologies advance. If youre happy with the platform and just want an upgraded payload, you can save significant money by replacing only the camera instead of buying a new drone. I know the Phantom 3 does not have this.Range can be subjective, the FAA requires to fly within visual line of sight. Speaking of range, the X-Star Premium advertised maximum control range is 1.2 miles. In practice, pilots have managed to extend the range nearly twice that far. Autel achieves this extended range by broadcasting the video link via the 900 MHz frequency band (via the controller) rather than the more commonly used 2.4GHz WiFi band. Not only does using this frequency allow for increased video range, it also reduces the potential for interference from other WiFi signals in the area, resulting in a clear picture at extended ranges. I get more interference in my phantom 3 than with the X-star Premium.The FAA requires pilots to keep their drone within line of sight. In most weather conditions, high-visibility orange should allow X-Star Premium pilots to fly at greater ranges while still maintaining visual contact with their drone.This is a big one and a deal breaker for me - In an ideal world, every drone would work perfectly, right out of the box. Unfortunately, in the real world, sometimes drones have problems. When problems happen, its important to have someone to turn to for help. Autel Robotics has made a commitment to customer service. They provide 7-day per week customer support via phone, email or live chat. After hours, you can still find the answers to many of your questions through an extensive knowledge base that can be found on the Autel Robotics website. Its difficult to put a value on customer support. If you never need it, its worth nothing, but if you must have it, theres no substitute.This is where DJI falls way short, try to give them or email them for support, good luck with that. Do you want to buy a drone without warranty and customer support?. Buy a Phantom from DJI, they have louse customer service and support.When you grab the X-Star Premium and touch it, the shell feels solid, well made. Unlike the Phantom 3 P3A - P3P  that feels like a cheap piece of plastic, not to mention the Phantom 3 Adv and Phantom 3 Pro line is prone to develop cracks. Apparently there is a major design flaw with the Phantom 3 shell around the motors area, the plastic is simply not strong enough. Customers are reporting cracks even after shell replacement.I have compared the quality of the pictures and videos side by side, I prefer the quality of the X-star premium video. The X-Star Premium is equipped with a 4K Ultra HD camera that has an 108-degree field of view. It takes 4K video and 12 megapixel photos. Footage is shot with an integrated 3-axis gimbal.If I could only fly one drone and pick just one, between the P3P and X-Star Premium, I would pick the X-Star Premium.
