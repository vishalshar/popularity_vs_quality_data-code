This is my third purchase of Morning Pep brand Xylitol.  I use this because I have type 2 diabetes and a strong aversion to the artificial sweetners.  Xylitol has no aftertaste and really tastes almost like sugar but it has a much lower glycemic level.  It looks a little strange inasmuch the particle size is larger than refined sugar.  The first taste of Xylitol was a different brand: made from CORN; not GMO labelled and; produced in CHINA.  This is American made; refined from Birch and not GMO modified!  It didn't hurt my feelings that the product was alos less expensive!
