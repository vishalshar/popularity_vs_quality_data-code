It works well if you have the right clothes. I could not get it to work on my bra strap and my summer clothes are too loose/hanging to attach it to. However, in the colder weather, it works well attached to my form fitting long sleeve shirts that I wear under sweaters and blazers. Kind of limiting, that it only works for me In the colder months, but then it has been very helpful to remind me to maintain my posture throughout the day.
