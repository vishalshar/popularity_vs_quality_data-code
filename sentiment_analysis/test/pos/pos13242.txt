I really loved my new carry on from the very first moment I received it wrapped in its own protective bag.  It is easy to use, so versatile and the sleek design really stands out from the rest. I just came back from a short two- day trip to Texas and this bag was just perfect, I was able to fit everything I needed, including my 13 size shoes. It was great to have the added benefit of using it as a charging station as you not always have stations available nowadays.Great product, very recommendable.
