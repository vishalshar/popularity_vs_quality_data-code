Best Posh phone I've had, its my 3rd one. Definitely the best less than $200 phone one can buy. I wanted the Google phone but couldn't afford it, this is a terrific alternative. The fingerprint sensor works quite well but I have very calloused hands so its picky but I understand. The 16gb ROM is perfect the phone is much faster than the Titan they offer but has a better weight and construction about it. The cameras are great too! The voice recognition is top notch too. Highly recommend!
