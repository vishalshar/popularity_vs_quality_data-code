Really great notebook. If you're like me, and get that same creative feeling as soon as you see an empty notebook, then you see why someone would spend $20 on one.I really love the look and feel of it. The outside material is hard to describe, it has a soft textured feel. The pages are nice and thick. I'm a web developer and so I like how the book was built so you can write out neat code, but you don't have to program to find the notched lines useful. Also, when not using them, they're not distracting at all.Anyways, overall I really enjoy using this book, and I'll likely buy the black one next time and maybe the smaller version too.
