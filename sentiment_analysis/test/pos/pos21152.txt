Soylent Drink, 12 Pack of 14 Ounce BottlesI'm intrigued and surprised by this new meal replacement drink, Soylent. It is designed to periodically replace a meal. At 400 calories in the one jar serving size, that's a reasonable expectation. It isn't a snack unless you drink half the jar. It is resealable and you can put the remainder back in the fridge. The taste, when fully chilled as recommended, is pleasant. I consumed a jar to get the full effect. It is not a strong overpowering flavor, more of a mellow creamy flavor. Have I mentioned, I really like Charlton Heston movies? It can be blended with flavoring mixes to enhance the subtle flavor to something you may prefer. Like, Planet of the Apes, that was really good, especially the ending at the destroyed Statue of Liberty.I'm not sure if the Soylent manufacturer encourages mixing it with an adult beverage but I can think of some that would work well with it as a mixer. Then again we wouldn't want to break any of The Ten Commandments, while drinking this. That was a great film, no?  A perfect accompaniment to a meal substitution of Soylent. Soylent, is a vey good source of protein and nutrients. If you have a cooler with ice packs to keep it cold, you could pack some Soylent when you go to see the races, with Ben Hur. That would be both fun and nutritious. That was a great film too. I really started getting into Heston films recently, not sure why?I'm sure you will love Soylent, the flavor is nice the nutritional value is quite good. It gives you energy, like El Cid had, he was something. As I write this in 20116, I'm anxious for 2022 to arrive and I'm not sure why? I'll figure it out, I'm sure. Meanwhile I'm waiting for dinner time so I can crack open another jar of Soylent and sit back and watch The Omega Man, tonight. Any other Heston films you can recommend, leave it in the comments.
