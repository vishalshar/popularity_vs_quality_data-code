This one formula works well for both of our dogs.  Their stools are much smaller - less filler, so they eat less but still maintain a healthy weight.  Less backyard poo for me to pick up.  That also means you get more for your money (as compared to a less expensive dog food) and you don't have to reorder as often.  Lots of win-wins in my book.Our puppy loves the stuff, but he's kind of a "Hoover" dog - eats anything and everything.  Our 2 1/2 year old highly active Border Collie eats it, but admittedly isn't as thrilled with it as some of the more "filled" dog foods she's had in the past.  She tends to snub ALL dog foods after a period of eating the same thing though, so take HER advice with a grain of salt (grass is always greener type eater).I also love that it is made in the US, with locally sourced ingredients and zero pet food recalls (to date).I wish this was sold somewhere close to my house (for a cheaper price- ha!), but I LOVE that this is delivered right to my door!  We've been using this brand for about 1 year.
