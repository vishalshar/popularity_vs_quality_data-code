My first MYNT was ordered after I misplaced my electronic car key fob. The MYNT is packaged very nicely - Apple-like packaging - with an extra battery, double-stick tabs, etc. Downloaded the app to the iPhone and followed the setup which went very smoothly. It tracked my remaining key fob thru the app both remotely by location on map/address and in close proximity with visual and audio.  After a few days I found the second car key fob - we immediately ordered another MYNT.  Setup was equally easy and both now appear in the app and are customizable to give them a unique identity.One thing I did not understand is that the app works logged in from one phone at a time only.  I tried to set it up on both of our phones but my password was not working as I tried to set up the second phone.  I emailed to MYNT and received an answer and explanation very quickly - it allows only one login on a phone at a time for privacy reasons to prevent spying on your MYNT locations.  No problem, you can just log in or out of the app on the phone of your choice.Very pleased with these little devices!
