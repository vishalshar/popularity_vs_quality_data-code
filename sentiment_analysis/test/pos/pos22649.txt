This is a great phone case- better than I thought it would be. It has a nice soft and silky feel to it. I wasn't sure about the thickness of the case because there were different measurements shared by different people. One person said it was an inch and a half thick. Not even close. It is almost as wide as the span of a penny. I took a picture so others could get a more realistic idea of its size. I like that this case has an optional strap.  It is convenient that you can place the strap inside of the case if you don't want to use it but you still want to leave it attached.  The wallet portion of the case is plenty large enough to hold several credit cards and a wad of cash.  The mirror is a great feature. It is clean and has a sharp image, and also has a small magnification to it, which makes putting on some lip gloss easier.  I have noticed that not all charger plugs work really well with the case, because the case gets in the way of the charging port. I have about 5 different chargers and with only one of them do I need to take off the bottom of the case. Overall, this is a great product!
