Bought it and used it for a presentation yesterday at a STEAM science fair, and it went very well. And was a big hit with the kids. It's obviously got some sensitivity issues that can be improved. There were some moments where it didn't respond, and it does take time to get used to it, but once you get your bearings it is so intuitive and simple to use. WELL worth its value and very cool.Thanks Thalmic Labs! You guys made all of our days!
