I too have tried many of the bulbs on the market including the Hue and many many others.  I have purchase 15 of them and replaces out half of my lights in my living space with Lifx.  I have owned them for over a year now and love the light they produce.  This is the first smart bulb that I felt was worthy to be in my living space and not just for novelty/decoration.  It is very bright and allows for easiestThe color spectrum and tones available in the whites makes it a pleasure to have in my living room, dining room, bedroom and den.When it comes to cons, the mobile application and lack of integration is the worst part of it.It is change of experience to not just control the lights with a switch.  Like most smart bulbs there is a mobile app to control the lights and it is very easy to change the colors or set scenes (scenes are saved profiles for any number of the lights). Although you can use a light switch to turn them on and off, I find that it is best to keep them powered on via the light switch and use the mobile application to control them.  Lifx has steadily added more features but the progress seems slow and it still feels like a stand alone product due to its lack of integration with other smart-home products.In short, there are a lot of people who got this product while the software was still really not ready for consumers and I believe that their 1 star ratings might be appropriate to their experience.  I, however, highly recommend this product.  Even without any further improvements, it is still a better light source than any other smart bulb on the market today.
