Works as advertised! I have an acre of property but neighbors on both sides and a road out front. I couldn't trust my 2 dogs to stay in the yard. They would run to see the neighbors or chase a squirrel or rabbit and it seemed like all I did was chase after them. After about 2 weeks of using the in ground fence they can spend all the time they want in the yard and I have the peace of mind that they are safely with in the borders of my yard. I rented a cable installer and it took about 4 hours to get the wire buried and the unit hooked up. We walked the dogs to the flags on a leash and taught them to back up when they heard the beep of the collar. I did eventually have to turn the collars to setting (3) after they ran through the barrier unattended. They stop about a foot short now no matter what is on the other side.
