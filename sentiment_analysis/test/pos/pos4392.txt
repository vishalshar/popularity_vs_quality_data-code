I really like this Petcube. As many others have already described, I did have some initial trouble setting it up. I had to take down my firewall to get it to connect to my Wi-Fi but afterwards, everything worked well.The only two complaints I have are: (1) the power plug in to the unit itself seems cheap and after only plugging and un-plugging it twice, the connection it doesn't feel secure and will "jiggle" around to make a positive contact. I reached out to their customer "no" service department and never heard back. I ended up putting a spot of super glue on the contact plug to secure it permanently. (2) The feedback from the speaker is ridiculous. Freaks my dog out every time. I just stopped trying to talk to him. We never have much to say to each other, a lot like my wife but he loves me unconditionally.That's why I bought the Petcube. I feel so much better knowing he's OK and just hanging out like a good boy when I'm not around.
