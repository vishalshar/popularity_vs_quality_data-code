Leaf does everything I was looking for in a activity tracker.  I wanted something that would track my steps and my sleep patterns and Leaf does exactly that, with the added bonus of leading you through stress relieving breathing exercises. But what sold me on Leaf was its appearance. It seems like all activity trackers anymore are blocky squares or ugly bracelets or clip ons I am sure I would lose. Leaf is beautiful and I love the way it looks. Its unique and I recieve compliments and questions about it everyday it seems. With the option to wear it as a clip or as a necklace or a bracelet I have plenty of ways to keep up with it and to personalize how I wear it. I would definitely recommend Leaf to anyone looking for a stylish and functional way of tracking their steps and sleeping habits. With the app you also have options to keep track of your monthly cycle as well as set alarms and activity, sleep and breathing (for the breathing exercises) goals. The app is easy to use and easy to sync to download the days data. The price is about the same as other trackers, but to me Leaf is superior. About the only downsides would be that it is not waterproof, and that the clip seems to be a little chinzy but still a fantastic product!
