One reviewer said he's never used them, just bought two for display. That may very well be the best use for them. They definitely do look cool. I haven't decided which one looks coolest, but I bought the black one just on price. (Not happy about Amazon's low price policy, which, unlike the competition, doesn't exist. But that's ok, I'll "prime" them to death anyway to make up for it!) Anyway, it looks great. Many have complained about the trouble walking, mine walks just fine on hard floors and short carpet. It's supposed to "see" objects in it's path and go around them. Mine sees them, stops and yells at them, then proceeds to bang his head against them incessantly like a special needs kid. I guess I'll have to get him a helmet... The complaints about the remote are justified- the remote sucks. You have to be right in front of it, up close, for it to work. Advantage- blue, for phone/bluetooth control, which they say works much better. Put it this way- don't expect much, and you won't be disappointed. One cat hates it, the other ignores it, the dogs aren't sure... It won't make a good pet, but if you have the time, you can make it do some stuff. For me, it looks good sitting,  and it's fun to make it wander around for about 5 minutes at a time. And that's what I bought it for. Well worth the sale price, not worth the regular price. (I will be keeping it.) Side note: Let it sit on "idle" and have the video ready when the dog or cat feels compelled to touch it and it "wakes up". Worth the price of admission.
