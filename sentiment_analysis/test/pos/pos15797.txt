Purchased as a gift. As such, I can't personally attest to the quality of the product, etc. However, what I can tell you is that the recipient's eyes absolutely lit up, and she squealed with joy on receipt of this 3 pack. She began ranting about how exciting it is that she can now preserve sauerkraut, etc. She began listing product after product she'd now be able to prepare and can and sell. I have no idea how well these work, but I can tell you that they're a great gift for people who like home canning and preservation.
