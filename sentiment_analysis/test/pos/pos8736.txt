I have this installed on a Mac (reformated it) and it is sitting on a native USB 3 port.  I'm using it to hold on the samples for EastWest QL sound libraries and it is wonderfully fast at loading the multitude of sound/samples used for a given instrument.  Much nicer than the spinning disc that it replaced.  Price is high, but the speed, esp since there is basically no seek time, is worth it.  Also, since I'm using this in a music setting, not having the noise of an external spinning harddrive is very nice indeed (you never realize how loud computers can be until you try doing recordings...).  The only downsides are the cable that comes with it is awfully short and the case feels a little cheap, but it weighs almost nothing so I guess the thin/cheap case still works out well.  Price is also a given to be high, but that is an SSD thing and not a fault of this particular device.  Also kinda handy not having to use a wall-wart to power the thing...  Short: expensive but nice and fast, just make sure it is on a native USB 3 port as USB 2 is sad...
