I love coloring, so when I saw these, I had to have them! The paper is a nice weight of card stock, and smooth to color. The card stock is bright white, not cream like a normal folder.There 4 designs (you get 3 of each). Two of them have quotes, with more designs on the back (see my photos). They will keep you coloring for a long time, but don't have any super-intricate detail (which I like). I used colored pencils and Tombow markers with no bleed through. I'm sure gel pens would work well too. The line-art is sharp and clean.Everyone who has seen me working on the one I'm doing says, "that is so cool--where did you get them?" So you can be a hit around the office with these!
