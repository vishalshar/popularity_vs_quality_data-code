This product works great. It does not impart any flavor to the product's being cooked, which is ideal for some recipes.  Often I have used olive Oil and did not like the result because of the flavor mix created.  The high heat for this product is also a huge plus; I find myself not using "Splatter Shields" when cooking/frying some foods.  Oil splatter may be unavoidable depending on the food cooked, but somehow this product does not make it worse, like other oils seem to do.  This maybe the perfect cooking oil !
