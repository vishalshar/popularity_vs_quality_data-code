I must confess that I was tempted to buy Bose Soundlink (probably has a slightly superior sound quality) but 2 things are deal breakers here:1) Weather proof (water, mud... you name it - I have not tested it yet)2) Long battery lifeThe Fugoo has a good sound and decent bass. I have tested with my Galaxy S4 (with Spotify) and with my Ipad.Bluetooth connection is easy to both cases.With Spotify I had to turn the equalizer on, which reduces the volume more than I would like, but this is a spotify issue.With my Ipad... great sound!So far.. loving the experience.
