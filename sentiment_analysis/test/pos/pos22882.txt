I bought this to go with a cold brew set and absolutely love it!!! It pours perfectly, and doesn't spill. I recently went on a road trip and took the bottle with me with tea in it. The bottle was mostly empty and fell on its side, but the lid did not leak (I would not try that with a full bottle of tea). The only thing that is slightly annoying is that the tab doesn't stay up when you are pouring, but I can easily hold it up with my hand. It's a great product!!
