** See below for updates.** Lightly edited initial impression follows:The August lock mounts on an existing deadbolt.  It does not include the deadbolt or the locking mechanism.  As a result, your existing keys continue to work with the deadbolt.  You cant even tell that there is an August installed when looking at the door from the outside.  The deadbolt can be easily reverted to its original condition, which is perfect for people living in an apartment.August includes everything needed to install the lock, with the exception of a Philips head screwdriver.  Unboxing the lock is great: the packaging feels like it was designed by Apple and there are compartments for all the pieces.  The instructions are clear and concise.Total installation time for me was about 35 minutes.  That includes everything from opening the Amazon box to having Siri unlock the front door.  The only major challenge I encountered is that I have a Pre-1997 Kiwkset lock.Augusts instruction manual recommends contacting customer service for special instructions with these older Kiwkset locks, but I was impatient and hung up after being on hold for about 15 seconds.  The underlying issue is that the August lock doesnt quite have the range of rotation to fully-set the deadbolt on older Kwickset deadbolts when the mounting flange is level.  If youre not familiar with dead bolts this means that you can push the deadbolt back into the door.  If the lock is set, you shouldnt be able to push it in with your finger.Im a perfectionist, so I found a workaround on my own, which is to simply rotate the mounting bracket slightly (about 15 degrees) so that the top is tilted towards the door frame.  It took about 5-10 minutes of trial and error to find the perfect angle so that the lock would set without binding on the tail piece. Even if you dont take the time to make this adjustment, the deadbolt should still stay in place after it is locked.To their credit, August called me (they must use auto number identification, because I didnt request a callback) later the same day to ask if I still needed help with the lock.After the physical install, HomeKit setup was super-easy:1) Download the app2) Register a phone number and email address (they send a 6-digit number to each, which you type in to the app).3) The app requests access to your camera and you take a picture of the HomeKit ID (on the back side of the faceplate).4) Youre done! For local locking.Getting remote locking (away from home) takes a little more work.  I didnt buy an August Connect because I have a 4th Gen AppleTV.  I had to sign out and in from iCloud on my Apple TV a couple times to get it to sync with the August Lock.Siri can't control the lock from an iPhone or iPad unless the August app is installed on that device (so you must install the app on every device).  To be clear, Siri does let you remotely lock and unlock your door if you have the app installed and you have an Apple TV or August Connect.  On devices without the August app, Siri will say that she doesn't know about any lock.The August Apple Watch app is a little broken right now (the week of the official launch).  The watch app looks like the phone app: there is a button to lock or unlock the door (stays grey and never works on the watch) and a list of recent lock activity (does work on the watch app).  However, you can use Siri on the watch to activate the lock, so this isnt a huge problem.Auto unlock (a feature of the August app) works really well.  You set a perimeter around your house, and the August will unlock when you *cross* the perimeter.  It doesnt do anything when you are inside or outside the perimeter, only when you cross it.  There is also an auto lock feature which will lock the door after it has been unlocked for a configurable amount of time (defaults to 1 minute, but you an increase it to 5 minutes in 30 second increments).Overall, this smart lock works really well, and does everything I want: Works with my existing deadbolt, lets me come and go without taking my keys from my pocket, and keeps the door locked when I forget.  The only things that August could improve hardware-wise would be to include a fourth tail-piece adapter (they already include three for different locks) for pre-1997 locks, which would make installation a little easier.  The apps and lock firmware still need a little polish, but they work pretty well for a just-released product.** Two-month followup:  After living with the August lock for a couple months, I have found a couple things August could improve.First, August offers only two access levels: "Guest" and "Owner."  Only owners can operate the lock from an Apple Watch (guests must use their iPhone).Second, the lock's firmware could have better auto-lock behavior when the door isn't fully closed.  The scenario is that you close the door, but not quite enough for the deadbolt to lock (it runs into the striker plate).  The August lock attempts to close the deadbolt until it encounters resistance from the striker plate.  It then makes some grinding noises and makes an error chime/beep.  Often the deadbolt will remain extended enough that the door cannot be closed, but the bolt cannot be retracted with the key or by turning the August lock handle.The bolt can be "fixed" by cycling the August lock with the iOS or watchOS app, but it's annoying that it is necessary to do so.  It would be better if the lock was more sensitive to resistance and/or retracted the bolt instead of leaving it halfway extended.It's not all bad, though. August has updated the iOS and Apple Watch apps since my original review.  The watch app now works well, even without the phone present. Operating the lock has reliable enough that I usually don't take my keys when leaving the house.** Six-month followup: Dropped one starThe August Smart Lock still works great after six months, but I'm pretty fed up August's support for iOS 10.  The new Home app in iOS 10 supports HomeKit-compatible smart locks--except for the August lock.  Ever since the first public beta of iOS 10, the Home app has displayed "firmware update required" next to the August lock icon.  August has sent emails to registered customers promising support for the Home app, but the new firmware has yet to arrive.
