Went camping on an island that allowed you to collect wood that was down. Unfortunately, just about all the wood was still damp from recent rainfall. I was very glad to have these fire starter packs. I had to use a whole pack per use and sometimes a couple when the first one burned out quicker than hoped and the wood was still smoking, not lit yet. I'd just apply another bag. They do light immediately with just a simple touch of a flame so I consider them the easiest fire starters out there. I don't know if I would of had a fire with the damp wood at that campground without these.
