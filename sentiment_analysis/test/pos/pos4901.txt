I've got to admit, considering the price, I wasn't expecting much, so I was pleasantly surprised at how well this camera works.  App installation and setup was quick, and now the app automatically launches when I plug the imager into my S7.  Image quality is low resolution (you do still get what you pay for), but good enough for a wide variety of uses and better than a lot of the handheld "gun" style IR imagers costing 2-3x more.  The sensitivity is extraordinary -- it can pick up the residual heat from my palmprint on an interior wall for up to a minute.  The accuracy is a little off, and as others have said, it can take a minute or two for the temperature to settle down to reasonable values.The usb connector has a small standoff that allows it to be used with thinner (~2mm) cases.This product is an excellent example of how to reduce the price of expensive imaging devices by removing the integrated screen, battery, and controls and offloading image processing to a mobile device.
