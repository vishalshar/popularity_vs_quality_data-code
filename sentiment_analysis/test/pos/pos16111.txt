I have purchased probably a dozen cell phone mounts for my various cars over the years.  This is, hands down, by far, THE BEST one I have ever seen.  I highly recommend this product.  It's innovative design make it compatible with pretty much any phone and they even have a tablet version.  It doesn't block the controls on my stereo, or the display.  It's sturdy with no bounce from road roughness, or from me touching the phone to use it while it's in the cradle.  It also doesn't block the phone's speakers so I can use it to make and take calls on speakerphone when I'm driving.
