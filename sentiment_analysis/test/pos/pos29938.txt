Excellent by all means Sound Quality, Excellent Build Quality, Connectivity, Ease of use !!!!!I was quite worried while reading the negative reviews about the core. But to my surprise the sound quality exceeded my expectations.As rightly pointed by many the core placement makes its important to get the full output of this speaker. Sound is really room filling even athalf volume. Bass on the lower side to my expectations but you cant expect more from this tiny little box. Definitely the additional sub wooferwill make the Core the perfect Home Theater System.Thanks to Amazon on their prompt delivery of the Product. No regrets whatsoever !!!!!!
