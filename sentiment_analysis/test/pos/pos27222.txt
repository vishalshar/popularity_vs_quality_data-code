I purchased the jamstik+ because I really wanted to learn to play the guitar. I have now had the jamstik+ for 2 months and I like it. It is not perfect, nor will it replace having a "real" guitar, but for what it is, it is very good.Functionality - for a beginner (like me), the jamstik+ is fine. It is a bit more difficult to hold than my "real" guitar, mostly because I can't use my right arm to wedge it in my lap (which is probably not the best technique anyway). And the back side of the neck feels more slippery than on a real guitar (plastic vs varnished wood). But with practice, it is getting better and less frustrating.Travel - I have been travelling a lot, and the jamstik+ is perfect to take on the road. It fits easily into my carry-on (though my next purchase will be the carrying case) and it is great for long evenings - something productive to do in the hotel room. And I can keep up with a practice schedule even when away from home. That said, you couldn't really play it on an airplane - the plink-plink sound of the strings would surely be annoying to others.Practice - With the jamstik+, I think I practice more than I would with a regular guitar. I can practice without anyone else hearing me (aside from the plink-plink) so it doesn't matter when I play - nobody is bothered. And I don't have to be self-conscious about my (lack of) ability.Sound - With wired headphones and the iPhone or iPad apps, there is no latency. Of course, the chords don't resonate the same way or sound quite as "full" as they do on an acoustic guitar, but hey - I'll live. No tuning required, and the bluetooth linking process works quickly and easily - better and faster than most other bluetooth devices I link with. When playing with other apps (the non-jamstik ones), I find the sound to be quiet relative to the sounds from the app. I have complained, but no resolution...Apps - The Jamstik apps are fun - instructional, and with a great Arcade-mode that makes practicing chords more interesting than just doing it on your own. There are different modes and you get a score, so you can challenge yourself. However, the two instructional apps only get you so far, so I hope they come up with more apps and ideas for the future. 4 Chords is one of the offered apps, which has a separate jamstik edition... but I only find it ok so far. For example, if you play the wrong chord or a wrong note in your chord, you hear nothing from your jamstik. Strange choice.Anyway, I am very pleased with the jamstik+. It is a fun way to learn to play guitar - and it is keeping me motivated and giving me more opportunities to practice. For me, right now, it is exactly what I wanted.
