This is one of the best fitness/relaxation devices in the market. I was skeptical about the purchase but now that I have used the product for 5 months I see the difference it makes in my daily life. Not only does it monitor you breathing rhythm it does a great job as a fitness monitor too. The device gently vibrates and notifies you if you are breathing too quickly (sign of tension). The iPhone app was recently updated and the interface now looks very simple and easy to understand. The only two suggestions for improvement aka next release would be - if it would be really helpful if the app can calculate miles in the Activity section and not just steps and if sleep monitor could be integrated with it.
