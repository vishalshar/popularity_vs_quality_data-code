You only need to use a little bit; all I can say is that my older dogs' joints are great; it is very likely from this product; in other words since he is on this product he doesn't seem to have any joint issues anymore. I read about the company and it appears that they are all about organic and it appears to be a product 100% USA made. Very good so far!
