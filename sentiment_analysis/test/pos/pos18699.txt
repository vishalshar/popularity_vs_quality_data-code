Amazing device. Works as designed. However I don't think there is much of an advantage for those who play mostly in standard or close (i.e. dropped D) tunings.  But if you frequent alternate tunings the Roadie is a Godsend. I have learned a few Will Ackerman pieces that I have almost forgotten how to play simply because it was such a pain in the arse to tune my Taylor to those weird tunings. Now that I have the Roadie it's a snap to retune so I fine myself playing those beautiful alternate tuning pieces much more.
