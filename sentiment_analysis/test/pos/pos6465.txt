I can go to work now a little more easy knowing my dog (aka Houdini) will be tracked if she escapes.This was easy to setup and it works well.  I'll test it out for another couple weeks and if all goes well, I'll probably buy another one to mount to some of my valuable lawn equipment...in case anyone decides to steal it, I'll know about it.
