We've been using this dog food for almost a year now and our Aussie puppy is growing wonderfully.  He has a great coat and he's at a good weight.  He's a very active, happy puppy and loves to play all the time.  I've never used any other dog food since this is what the breeder recommended and he's liked it. We put some warm water on it or low fat broth occasionally, making it a little soft and crunchy at the same time.
