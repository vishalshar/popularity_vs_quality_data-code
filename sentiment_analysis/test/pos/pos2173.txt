A package of 3 of these hand soaps, the bottles are large so they should last for a while. I use the SoapBox shampoo and conditioner that I get at Target, but I was happy to see that these were available at Amazon as well and in different smells which is great. I have never tried this hand soap before but I do really like them. They smell great and most of all I love the mission and the purpose behind the company.
