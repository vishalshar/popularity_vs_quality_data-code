I'm pretty picky about audio gear, and I've been nothing but pleased with the Zipp. Its connectivity options are great, the design and form factor are beautiful, and the sound quality is strong for a speaker its size. You're obviously not going to get perfect fidelity from a portable speaker, especially over Bluetooth, but the convenience makes this a perfect speaker for carrying around the house, setting up on the porch, and bringing along on trips.Highly recommended.
