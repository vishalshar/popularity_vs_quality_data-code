I have thin, fine hair that does not hold a curl well, so I've tried all kinds of curling tools, most curl fine but then my hair falls flat a few hours later. The trick is finding something that creates a lasting curl. When I first saw this brush/curler I thought it was too simple to be effective but I was wrong, it works great, creating a long lasting soft curl. I love that it's 2 steps in one-drying & curling so it saves time. The larger curlers give the most body. I had problems with getting the curler to stay by itself, I didn't want to grind it into my scalp to make it stay put-ouch!, so I just use the Conair Clips & the curlers stay even when I'm moving around doing other things. The key is to let them cool completely before unrolling, & don't over brush your hair after you remove them, just a light brush through is all you need. It's such a simple concept that gives you lovely soft curls & body.
