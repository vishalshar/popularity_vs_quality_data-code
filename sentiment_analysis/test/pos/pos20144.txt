I ordered this tracker as my 2 dogs love to explore the timber areas around our home, and I worry about them going places they shouldn't (other peoples homes) or if something should happen to one of them whether I could find them in the timber that is miles and miles long.I really worried about the coverage of the signal as we are in a rural area, but so far, I have not noticed any holes in coverage.  I love being able to "watch" them and track their location while they are off playing.I have already recommended this to my neighbor who has an elderly blind dog and she ordered it so they have peace of mind that they can find him if ends up wandering off.It has worked really slick for us, and I so appreciate this technology!  Would love it if they had smaller ones for our 2 cats, but not sure that it would work as well if it was smaller!My oldest turns 16 years old soon - may have to order one of these to attach to HIM! :)
