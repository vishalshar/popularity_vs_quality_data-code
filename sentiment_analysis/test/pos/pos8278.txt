Great value for the price. Every function works just as well as on my Samsung Galaxy note 5. If there is a difference in processing speed I am unable to discern it. Screen sharpness not as vivid as on the SG note 5. Otherwise, I will be using this as my primary phone when my lease payments on the SG note 5 is finished in 7 months.
