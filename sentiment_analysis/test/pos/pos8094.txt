These are great - but they don't look as cool as their picture shows; see my picture, lol.  The rings are sort of big so they flop a bit and you have to experiment with their placement through the eyes so you get the correct tension. Otherwise they hold my shoes on tightly but not so much that they're hard to get on.  Glad I bought them.
