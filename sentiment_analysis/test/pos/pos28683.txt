I really like this thing.  Easy to add to your shoe and you'll never know it's there.  Easy to set up.  After a run it's easy to sync and it'll tell you anything such a device could reasonably give you - not only distance (might need to set this manually once or twice to override it but mine was close to start), pace, cadence, how hard you're hitting the ground, how much your feet stay on the ground.  You get charts and graphs of how things went over the course of the run so you can say, oh, when I get tired and my form breaks down, this is what happens, maybe I can try to prevent that.  Or you can try to lengthen the distance where you're running really well or whatever.  So you can get into that aspect as much as you want (or not) but in any case it's tracking shoe wear.
