I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday. Him and our old roommate always used to drink beer from one of those glass boots and it was called das boot. I saw this and thought heyy let's change it up and get das horn instead! the strap Is awesome, really held on there. the black part that goes around the horn is rubber which is what I hoped. its taller than I expected. its like a foot tall. maybe a couple inches less. My boyfriend laughed and thanked me. The box it comes in is pretty cool too. Great gift.
