My first experience with the Shine 2 was dismal. But things turned around and I've gone from thinking of this as a zero-star item to a five-star item. My original complaint was that the disc fell out in the first week of use and I never saw it again. Bummer. But I did get a refund from Amazon, thankfully. I also lodged a complaint with Misfit on their website with my Amazon order number (so they could see that I did indeed buy the product). At first the response was perfunctory, like a robot had sent it. Then out of the blue a couple of weeks later, I got a personal email from a very kind Naomi at Misfit. She offered to send me a new Shine2 that had been revised to prevent the disc from slipping out. Not only that, she offered to send it for free. Isn't that generous? I waited to write a new review of the Shine2 until I was certain that the fix worked. And it does! I can wholeheartedly say that this is a great little doodad that helps me keep track of my activity and helps me decrease the amount of time I sit still. I wear it all the time and I really like it. Thank you Naomi!Is there a button for zero stars? Do not buy this product. Yes, it's sleek. Yes, it tracks your steps, etc. But if it falls out and gets lost almost immediately, like mine did, then what's the point? I bought Shine 2 after reading that the first version of the Misfit Shine had issues with the device popping out of the band. Hey, nothing is perfect the first time around, and manufacturers can learn from their mistakes. But I thought that since the disk falling out and getting lost was the chief complaint, correcting that problem would've been the focus of version 2. Wrong. I've had it for 3 days, and now all I have is the band and the strap. Can I get a refund? I'll ask. But I threw away the box so I don't have what Amazon might need for a refund--the box, and well, the product itself. Could I ask Misfit for a replacement? I can't imagine a corporation actually honoring its implied contract with a customer if they're wittingly sending out this product to unsuspecting buyers. But I'll ask. I'll pass on information I get...in the event that I get some.
