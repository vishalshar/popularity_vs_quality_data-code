I use this with 2 iPhone6's, each with a pretty thick case. It was very easy to set up -- just swap out for the right insert and thread my cables. It sticks very solidly to my antique wood nightstand. I can grab both phones out at the same time and the dock doesn't move at all, which is exactly what I wanted. Base is very solid metal.
