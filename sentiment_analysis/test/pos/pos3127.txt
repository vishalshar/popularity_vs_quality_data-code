I use this lid on an 8 cup mason jar that I use to store my cold brew coffee for the week in the refrigerator.  I have been using it for about a month now, and it seems to work perfectly.  I have not had a problem with it leaking at all (remember that I am pouring a liquid, so I would know if there was), and it pours cleanly, meaning that I don't have to wipe off the sides of the container after I pour.Just a note- as this is for a large jar that I keep in my refrigerator, I don't have the experience of carrying this around with me for using a mason jar as a water bottle.  If you're looking for how well that works, check out another review.  But I can tell you that the seal on the sides is liquid-tight.I wash it in the top rack of my dishwasher every week, no problems with that.The ONE negative is that it does its job of having a tight seal a little too well.  I have noticed that it's almost impossible to get off and is really a two-person effort every week to get the lid off of the cold brew container so that we can clean the jar and re-use it.  Maybe this is because I am keeping my coffee in the fridge for a whole week and this creates the seal, but for this reason I'd make sure you have a jar lid gripper thing handy (we just use a rubber glove but it's still hard), or if you have arthritis, make sure you have a mechanism to deal with tight jar lids.
