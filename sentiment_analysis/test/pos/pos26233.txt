After doing some research I decided to try this brand for our dog who has a problem with food allergies.  She would itch and scratch at her snout and chew on her feet when we used other food and have severe ear problems.  Since using this brand she has had a happier life and so have we.  She loves it and I noticed that her breath isn't terrible anymore.  We haven't had a problem with her ears or her constantly scratching and biting at herself.  I am definitely reordering some when she's getting low.  She's a happy puppy now and her fur is so shiny. Everyone has noticed and commented on it.
