The scale has a sleek, modern design perfect for my minimalist bathroom style. The scale took a few minutes to pair up to my wyfi but it may be my slow internet connection. Once the scale is programmed, it gives you so many options: weight +BMI, pregnancy weight etc. It can track your weight over time through the Qardio app. This would be useful for pregnant females who need to track their weight gain during their pregnancy.
