I got these for my 94 y/o Dad so he wouldn't trip over his laces. The are great but since he couldn't hook them himself we had to leave the last two rows out so he could slip his shoes on and off. If I were going to change anything it would be to have,a few longer for the last couple of holes. He loves them.
