Just gave this to my 10 yo grandson. I gave him Sphero for Christmas, BB8 and Ozbots for his b'day. Though Sphero has more educational qualities, this one is great fun. He has now rated them: Sphero #1, Ollie #2, Ozbots #3 and BB8 #4. Ollie is VERY fast and has the ability to jump. It was easy for the grandson to get him going. Walking him down a flight of stairs left him unscathed. We have some ramps but making your own is more rewarding.
