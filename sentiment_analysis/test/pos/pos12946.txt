This is a brilliant speaker, with impressively expansive and accurate sound.  I haven't tested the battery life or thrown the speaker into a bathtub, but for my primary criterion--sound quality--the Fugoo gets the highest marks.  I consider myself something of an amateur, old school audiophile, and I'm not especially interested in booming bass or dance-party volume.  I want a balanced mix of clean midranges, bright highs, and precise lows ... and this speaker delivers.  That said, I do need a speaker that has some punch, and I'm baffled by complaints about the volume levels on this unit.  I would have to shout to be heard over this thing at 3/4 volume.  To paraphrase Homer Simpson: Fugoo me!
