I was on the fence about getting a sense to help track my sleep due to the myriad of less than positive reviews. However, I noticed a lot of them were from a while back and that more recent ones stated the company's improvements, so I decided to give it a try.First of all, the design is beautiful. The hardware and app both look great and the app is really easy to navigate. The pill is inobtrusive and stays clipped to the pillowcase, something I was skeptical about.However, for the first few nights I had problems with the tracking. My dog frequently wakes me up to take him out in the middle of the night, and whenever I'd get up to walk him, sense would stop tracking for the night. That's almost a nightly thing, so if the problem couldn't be fixed it was going to be a deal breaker.I sent a message to Sense customer service about the issue. Received an email reply within four hours stating they had their engineers working on it. Less than a day later, I get another email stating that they had updated the tracking algorithm on my unit and that the problem should be fixed. I open the app and boom- not only was the tracking working better now, it actually retroactively fixed all the messed up nights that had already happened. Bravo, sense. Bravo.
