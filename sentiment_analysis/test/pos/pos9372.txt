Shoelaces are not shoes.  These review questions are inappropriate for the product.  The product -- no-tie shoelaces -- is a fantastic idea and, in my case, work perfectly.  I always wanted sneakers without having to tug on laces each time I put them on.  The fact that they are a one-size-fits-all product means it might not work for all people or all shoes.  I have only had them a week and cannot attest to their durability.
