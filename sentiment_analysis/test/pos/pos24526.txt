The product itself is a beautiful sleek designed laptop. Its very portable and capable to run any current game out in high or a suitable playable setting compare to your old laptop. It does tend to get hot playing a game so a cooling fan is a must if you wish to protect your laptop especially in the summer . The battery life however is that not great only lasting generally about 2.5 hours-3 hours for casual browsing and 1-2 hours for gaming. However you should plug in your computer while gaming that is. The start up time is really fast and accessing your files have never been faster thanks to the wonderful SSD. It comes with window 10 which is a easy to use and great. The webcam quality is relatively bad on this computer but its expected from a gaming laptop. The charger block is a large brick so if that bothers you just order a different charger. The track pad works fine and the keyboard and back light are fine. I do not use back light since the battery life seems to drain faster with it on.It is however a finger print magnet and speakers aren't that loud. Shipping came in a huge box. Its a wonderful buy so far for the price.
