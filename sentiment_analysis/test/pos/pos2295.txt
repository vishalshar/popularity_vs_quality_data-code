I would give this six stars if I could.Back in May I developed a form of Eczema around my nose. At first I though it was just a touch patch of acne but nope! My skin would get flakey, look like scales, peel off, and the once the bleeding stopped and my face healed I would be right back where I was before- with scales around my nose. None of the acne products I tried worked (duh, because it wasn't acne. I've been blessed by not having bad acne so I went into this extremely naive) and somebody on a 'what's going on with my body?' Health site recommended this to me. After two days I could immediately see (and feel- no more pain!) the difference. I'll admit, I didn't use it every day after the first week so my symptoms didn't go away completely but once I used it every day for three weeks straight you could no longer tell that I had such trouble around my nose! My skin was flawless again! I haven't had a problem since, but I do make sure to apply it as a precaution about once a week.This saved my face. I'm not kidding. If you are on the edge, it is totally worth the money.
