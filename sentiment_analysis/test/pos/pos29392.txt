I love this gadget.  Thermal imaging works well. Keep in mind it is a small, low cost device so you not going to get super high def images, but they are more than sufficient.  Also something not documented, the lens does turn to give you some focus capability in case auto focus does not get it right.  1 other thing that is good to know is that some case might place to much of a gap between you usb port and the case, that the camera cannot plug in all the way.,  This is an issue with the case design and you might have to remove your phone for the case during use, or switch to a new case.
