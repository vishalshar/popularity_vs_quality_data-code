The nomadkey is great. Really like its size, fits on key ring perfect and does not make your keys heavy or too big. Charges my phone just fine. It really deserves a 5 star rating but I got this charger because my only other charger broke and realize it's not the best cord for wall outlets or when u want to text and use your phone while charging it's nearly impossible.But that's pretty obvious from its size.
