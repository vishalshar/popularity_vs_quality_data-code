This is a review after day 1. I would like to clarify one config issue that was not clear to me from the product description and LIFX website. You do not have to operate the bulb in the same network as your smart phone or tablet. I have an Internet of things (IoT) wifi that is separate from my normal WiFi. All you need to do is connect the bulb to the IoT WiFi and then temporarily switch your phone to the IoT WiFi and claim the bulb to your LIFX cloud account. Then you can switch back your phone to your normal network and still control the bulb from your phone. Technically it means you control the bulb remotely all the time instead of via the local WiFi. The result is the same: you have full control over your bulb from your phone. Only downside: should you loose your external internet connection you cannot control the bulb locally. But I think a separate IoT WiFi is a good trade off if you are generally concerned about the security of IoT devices. The setup was quick and painless. While I will operate the bulb mostly in one fixed setting, I love the fact that light wise I can do almost anything I want: from cold whites to warm whites to almost any color you can think of at any brightness I want. This bulb also proofs to me that smart lights should not have to rely on a hub. LIFX,'s decision to use the cloud as hub seems right to me. One word of caution: I look at smart bulbs as a complement to non smart light solutions. I would not rely on all lights in my place being smart to avoid sitting in the dark should the smart bulbs ever get compromised. Last but least a complaint: some of the Nest integrations with the Nest cam require a Nest cam subscription even though I don't really see why those features could not be implemented without a subscription. Overall still a great product.
