I bought this to track my sleep and my son's sleep. He is five. Setup was pretty easy and I was able to quickly configure the mini Hugs with the app.  It's been great to see how much my son is actually sleeping. hugOne is showing that he's only getting enough sleep about every other day. So I'm trying to change his bedtime routine and get him to bed earlier. It's also really helpful to see the temperature fluctuations and air quality levels in the rooms.  Our rooms were too cold before using hugOne and I'm looking into ways to improve air quality.  My son seems to be sleeping better with fewer wake-ups now and he seems more rested in the morning.  Overall, I'm extemely pleased with the product and the information it shares with me.
