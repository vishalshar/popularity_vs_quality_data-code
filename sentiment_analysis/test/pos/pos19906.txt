Very nice with a nice taste.  I like the granulation that is similar to typical sugar.  Other xylitol products I've tried are more like powdered or confectioner sugar.  That's fine as well but this product will work well in our sugar dispenser that pours.  I have several from Ikea that tip and pour one teaspoon at a time.  It would also be nice for other uses, like dusting sugar cookies or cinnamon toast, where that texture is more expected visually.
