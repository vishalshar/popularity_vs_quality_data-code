I had a specific reason for purchasing the eero wifi product... blanketing my home with Wifi signal so I could reliably use the Wifi Calling mode on my iPhone.  In particular, I wanted a system with zero handoff so I could move to anywhere I had Wifi coverage in my house without dropping a phone call.  And eero does this quite well.  I have absolutely zero cellular coverage at my home from any carrier.Prior to purchasing my eero system I tried many times to configure my many Wifi routers and access points distributed throughout my home.  Although it was easy enough to get less expensive routers to cooperate enough to work together, there was no way to accomplish the zero handoff.  Until eero, I consistently dropped calls as I moved from one Wifi connection to another in my home.By using a lan scanning program, you can see that eero uses the same SSID and channel number for the Wifi router and access points, and uses the same channel for all 2.4 ghz access and all 5 ghz access respectively.Setup is easy, but manual configuration is limited... although with the smooth automatic configuring to allow cooperation between access points I did not feel limited in what I needed to do.To sum up, I get very reliable Wifi coverage for my computers, smart home products, TV and video systems, and zero handoff for Wifi calling applications.  All with very good through-put, frequently maxing out the internet speed supplied by my ISP (see photo).  My only reason for not providing 5 stars is the system cost.
