This mount has a durable, quality feel to it. The screws work very smooth with no thread binding you get from cheap manufacturing. The lever works well for releasing the camera mount and the rigidity of the clamp keeps the camera in place. I bought this unit to mount to my Scuba BCD. It works great however I would also recommend PolarPro's ProGrip. The ProGrip locks into the strap mount and releases with the lever. If you're wearing scuba gloves (or even snowboard gloves) you don't want to mess around with the small screw. The ProGrip also has a storage compartment for SD Cards and extra batteries.
