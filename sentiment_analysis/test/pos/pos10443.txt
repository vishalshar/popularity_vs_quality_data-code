Excellent little game where you lay down cards to add to areas of color to score more points.  This game is very small and is actually about the size of a pack of gum.  I took it to a wedding and played with 4 others who would mostly fit in the light gamer category.  They all really enjoyed it and it only took a minute or two to explain the rules.  We were able to play several games in the time between the wedding and the bridal party showing up at the reception hall.  I do recommend bringing a pen and getting a bit of scrap paper for score keeping.
