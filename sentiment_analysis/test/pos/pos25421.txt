A little pricey but I think it's worth it.  I took my own temp with an old school glass and mercury thermometer and then with this one and they were spot on - did the same thing with my son and got the same results.  I like being able to link it to my phone also.  When you've got sick kids and a bunch of stuff going on, it's nice to be able to look up and see what the temp ranges are so you don't forget.
