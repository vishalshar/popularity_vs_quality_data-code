I was fascinated by the idea of field camera from the debut day, but $400 price was not something I would bear. Now for $70 I can buy it even as collector item.I'm positively surprised by how mature this thing and its software is. Also the control offered by  manual mode is something I didn't expect, especially with built-in ND filter (though it was everywhere in the specs). I'm negatively surprised by the inability of processing the photo with transparent content.As for negative surprises everything is being broken down to layers and processed with fake 3D perpective shift, which in most cases is awesome and of great consumer value, but I really wanted to do things impossible with other cameras and this is a big disappointment.. I'll have to try the older version of software yet. There is also 3rd party soft already on Lytro Meltdown...
