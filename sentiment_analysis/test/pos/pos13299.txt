Wow, these things work REALLY well. We don't have a shower at work and I wanted to start riding my bike to work... 12 miles each way. After a test run with these on a hot day after a ride (sweaty and stinky) they worked like a charm. I did my first ride to work last week and arrived quite sweaty. I only had to use one wipe (cleaning strategically) and air dried for 15-30 seconds. No residue, felt (and more importantly... smelled ) as clean as if I just took a shower. As the day pressed on, I continued to feel clean... even more so than after showering. These things are fantastic.
