I absolutely love this device and wish I'd discovered it sooner. As my TV and stereo systems are IR and the Nexus Player is Bluetooth, this clips on the side and brings me back to 1 remote instead of 3.It is super easy to program and use.Also, in an unlucky event in my house it was thrown against a wall and disintegrated into pieces. I was shocked that everything clipped back together and it still works perfectly. I love this device
