At first, I wasn't getting great results--I ordered it to mainly help with sleep.  I started by jacking up the percentage as high as it would go thinking "more is better".  I got a bit of a relaxing response but that was all.Then I read someone's review saying they found the sweet spot to be 46%.  So I tried again at the default 50% and it worked so much better.  At the end of the sleep vibe I barely have enough energy to put the strip back on the paper for re-use.  I then go to sleep immediately and sleep through the night.I also used it for a nap yesterday but ended up sleeping over 2 hours which was way more than I intended so I'll be more careful with that in the future.I get about 3 uses from each strip.  I sometimes can get 4 but the connectivity at 4 uses is iffy.  I really hope they come up with a mothed for a reusable strip to bring down the cost of ongoing use.
