After updating to MacOS Sierra I had to reinstall the operating system on my MacBook Pro due to OS problems, and in so doing my 250 GB TarDisk was unpeared.  So I had to go through the process of pearing again.  It was not an easy process but Wellington Sartori  of TarDisk provided outstanding technical support and helped me through the process.
