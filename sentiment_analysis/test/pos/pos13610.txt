Best smart controller out there.  Blows Skydrop out of the water.The Android Rachio app is a pleasure to use,  and is super intuitive.  Pairing the device was a breeze.Very very easy to do anything from old school fixed watering schedule with no intelligence to full save the Polar bears, Al Gore eco mode.  Couldn't be easier.I started with a LONO, but they can't develop an app.  Then I bought a Skydrop. That thing is so convuluted it's not even funny.  The Rachio was going to be strike 3 for fancy controllers.  I was going to head to Menards and buy an old mechanical timer style controller and cut my losses.  Luckily Rachio knocked it out of the park.  This thing is solid.As an added bonus,  there is s weather station about 1.5 miles away,  so I should get really accurate weather.Thank you Rachio!
