LOVE this suitcase. Forget the tech for a second...the case/bag is roomy, the wheels roll smooth, making it breeze to push around. The bags design is great and truly secure when locked. Now...the tech! WOW! Simply wow! Works exactly as the makers claimed, brilliantly! The two USB charging ports are perfect. ONe in the bag (for an iPAd or other type of device) and one external for when you are sitting somewhere waiting. The iPhone app allows me to lock and unlock it, tells me when/if I left the bag somewhere or it was taken (via bluetooth connectivity), tells me the amount of battery charge the bag has left, and weigh the bag and contents, and can tell me the location of the bag when not in my possession! The only thing it is missing....built in clothes washer! lol. Love this bag!
