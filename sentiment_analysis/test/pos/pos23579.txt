I recently switched to glass drinking containers after seeing a horrific documentary on plastic waste (long story).  We stopped buying single-serve bottled water and I got my family to start using refillable containers (or hey, how about a good old-fashioned drinking glass??)Me, I started using mason jars as my drinking container of choice, but ran into the problem of taking drinks in the car with me or leaving a jar on my night table (and not accidentally knocking it over.).  Twisting off a standard mason jar lid while driving (as well as drinking out of the wide-mouth opening and not dousing oneself in liquid while the car was in motion) was problematic.  And then I discovered reCAP.  Problem solved and I've used nothing else since.  I take my mason jar(s) everywhere.One tip.  Make sure you twist the reCAP on snugly (finger tight).  Initially I was getting the 'prank dribble glass' effect and then realized I just needed to twist the lid on a little more snugly.I bought two lids so I can always have a clean jar handy (or for when I unintentionally leave my mason jar on my desk at work).  I'm thinking I need to order a couple more...
