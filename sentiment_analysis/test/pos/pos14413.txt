This thing is completely charming.  I am an adult who bought this for my wife who is also an adult.  I was a little dubious about buying something like this for an adult, but it turned out to be the hit of Christmas, by far.  We've now played with him a lot, unlocked all his features and so on.I wanted to wait a few days, until the novelty wore off, to write this.  I am still extremely impressed with Cozmo.What entrances you about this is not the simple games it can play, it is that it mimics emotional responses with a level of sophistication and nuance that is hard to describe.  Toys that can say simple recorded phrases or do simple repetitive actions over and over have been around forever.  This is not one of those things, there is generally no detectable pattern to its actions and its library of actions is sufficiently vast that it will continue to delight and amaze you.  You know, intellectually, that this is all just clever coding by some very skilled people, but the emotional experience is much more like having a new puppy than having a new toy.  Cozmo gloats when he wins, pouts when he loses, greets you enthusiastically when he recognizes your face, and explores his environment with the naive enthusiasm of a child.  All of it is just completely adorable.  If you are the kind of person who loves animals, you will love this thing.There has clearly been so much thought put into this by the developers.  The price for what you are getting is not at all unreasonable given how much work must have gone into creating Cozmo.  I hope they continue to program more features for the little guy, with a focus on continuing to expand his personality and his ability to just explore and interact with the world autonomously.  It would be great if he could identify objects beyond people and his cubes.I am certainly no expert on autism, but I suspect that if you had an autistic child, this could be a very non-threatening way to learn about emotions, as Cozmo mimics basic emotions so uncannily well.
