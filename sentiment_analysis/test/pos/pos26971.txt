I am in the middle of an eczema flare up. For weeks I couldn't sleep more than two hours at a time because I was so itchy. I was getting rashes all over my body and I was uncomfortable all of the time. I was planning to go to the dermatologist but I couldn't get schedule until a month out. I would not be able to survive all that time not sleeping.I ordered this after seeing a few good reviews and the night that I first put it on, I slept almost all the way through the night. Now that I have been using it for about a month, I ordered  another tube. My eczema everywhere is healing really quickly. It is still itchy sometimes but it isn't anywhere near as unbarable. I am so happy with it and have confidence it will end my flare up soon!
