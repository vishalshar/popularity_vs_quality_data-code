This is my first drone and i've had no flying experience.  This is a very nice little aircraft.Great because you get a case and super nice machine.I was flying in about 15 minutes.  Just download the app, get the gps and compass setup and you're good to go.The app is really nice and easy to use.  You just clip your phone to the controller and you're ready to rock.I had two small crashes on my first day.  Both due to being to close to stuff when landing.  Make sure you've got about10 square feet of a landing pad so you don't touch stuff.I'd recommend getting a second or third battery right away and the prop guards.  Guards just in case you get close to something.  It'll probably be cheaper than swapping out props.The battery life is 25 minutes but that can pass quickly.  So while you're flying you can be charging the dead battery.I also had trouble with the compass and called customer support.  Super good experience.Finally, I think Autel did a great job.  My only recommendation would be to sell it with two batteries and the prop guards.
