This is just great. It is well designed, I don't have to touch the dirty rodent. I have in 3 days killed 2 chipmunks and one mouse. It is easy to use and setup. It blinks when it has been successful. At first you think the rodent will some how crawl out but they are dead. I used it on the outside of my house with a cover in dry weather and now in the garage.
