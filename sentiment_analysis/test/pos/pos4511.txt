This might be the most ridiculous thing that I own, but I love the Fitbark. I was worried that it would look too large on my dog's collar, but it looks great. It also syncs well to the iPhone app, and the information is easy to read. The reason that I got this is to help me keep my dog active. Having a point goal really helps me to do this because it's easy to see when I'm slacking in the form of a lovely chart thing. The only thing that I would change is the way the daily graph is displayed when a lot of points are earned at once. If my dog earns a lot of points in one hour (dog park), then the graph is skewed so that the rest of the daily activity is difficult to see. Annoying, but not a deal breaker.
