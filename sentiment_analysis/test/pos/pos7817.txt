First I would like to say that I had tried this product first in the 2.5lb bag.  The product was absolutely wonderful!  It is made from birch bark & NOT corn which is important!  It is also made in the USA!!!!  It tastes exactly like sugar with NO aftertaste!!!  I have used it in making all types of deserts to replace the sugar - even Flan (without the caramel- because Xylitol can't caramelize) and ice cream!  I re-orderd in the 5 lb which arrived on 9/9 with the bag broke & the crystals all over the bag & box.  I called in immediately and new bag was resent to me which arrived on 9/15.  This bag was perfect and as usual the product is wonderful.  I highly recommend it to anyone needing to replace sugar in their diet and wants a sugar replacement without an after taste and because it is crystalized it is as if you are scooping sugar into your coffee or tea!!!  We have not experienced any gastro issues that seemed to bother some reviewers....  The only warning is if you have dogs you MUST keep it away from them as it is pure poison to them.  This would include anything you bake or make with it.  Our kitchen is now off limits to our Pom!
