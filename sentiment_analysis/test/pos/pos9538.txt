I believe that this hands down the best mouse I've owned so far. And that's something coming from someone who's been constantly buyinggaming mice since the Intellimouse 3.0 from Microsoft.Pros:-The sensor is nearly flawless: PMW 3310. Unless you are some human cyborg that can detect changes in micrometers & 1/8 of a pixel,you won't see any irregularities/acceleration/jitter/prediction.-The shape: My good god is this a mouse to hold. It just fits right into your hand nearly perfectly like a glove tailored specifically for you byGerman engineers (relatively to other mice).-The switches: Omron classic switches with nice tactile feedback. Standard in gaming mice but I commend Mionix for not settling for less.-RGB Lighting: Now this is just aesthetics, but if you're looking for a mouse that can complement your exact computer/keyboard setup, thisis the right mouse.Cons(Easily fixed but still should not be something we should do):-The braided cable is KINKED on arrival. Now this is common amongst manufacturers but Logitech has been able to just wrap the cablearound a big "spool" to avoid kinks. Mionix could go for that simple extra step just to impress more.-The scroll wheel is not stable in CSGO (probably because I near slam my mouse on the mousemat when I play). This means that since Ibound my scroll wheel to +jump, every time I "slam" my mouse to the mousemat I jump because the jitter from the scroll wheel isrecognized as a scroll step.Playing games: Although there is a severe lack of any buttons, that's not what this mouse is made for. CSGO competitive play is a blisswith this mouse along with SC2 (Starcraft II) and LoL (League of Legends). MMORPG player will sorely miss the plethora of buttons like theRoccat Tyon or the Razer Naga. But if they really put precision over button utility, then they won't regret buying the Mionix Castor.Conclusion: This is a wake-up call to those major corporations out there like Zowie, Logitech, Steelseries, and Roccat that a new competitoris on the rise. This mouse, in my opinion, stumps all competition up to date in terms of wired mice (WIRED due to my recent acquisition ofG900).Would I recommend someone buying this over any other mice?You bet I would.'
