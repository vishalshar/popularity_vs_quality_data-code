I rarely post reviews about products but feel as though I have to with the Novi.  After receiving my Novi it didn't work exactly as described and had a few bugs.  I contacted Novi and received a reply almost immediately and then a phone call. The guys that created Novi really care about you and their product and want you to be satisfied. After a few tests I was told that the sensor wasn't working properly and they sent a replacement right away. Ethan kept in contact during the shipping process and was available when the new sensor arrived to help me install and getting it working.  I have to say that the system works GREAT and they are always performing updates to either fix bugs or add features to make using the app easier. For example, while on the phone with Ethan I asked if there was a way to delete pictures from the app, he said "not yet but we will be adding that feature"; the next day the delete feature was on the app. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that wants an affordable security system that is easy to move and/or add to.
