I dial in while stuck at airports and in the morning at hotel to chat & play with my Savannah cat. She enjoys the laser play immensely on too of the orher play while I am gone & it makes me feel connected to her more. I have had trouble figuring out light setups/timers at night so I can see her thats the only downfall I have had so far.
