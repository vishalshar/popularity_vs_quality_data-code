I bought this one to replace a motion detector by Simplisafe.  Had too many false alarms and SimpliSafe sent cops to my home 3 times in a month.  One more false alarm and I have to start paying fines to local police so this was a good replacement.This thing works well, but with one major disadvantage.  It needs to be plugged into a power socket.  Most likely you will mount this in the middle of the wall about 4 to 5 feet from ground for it to be most effective and cover a wide area.  These sensors are thermal image type and the scan straight and down.  Especially for pet owners, you have to mount it a little higher to avoid false alarms or mount it upside down (ok you may miss alarms if intruder crawls on the floor but its unlikely they are that clever).  Further, the most ideal location for such sensors will not be in range of a power socket.  I had to buy a 10 foot extension cord to mount it where I wanted.The WPS (automated joining wireless network) worked for me from iphone app.  It did not work for their camera (DCS-932L). This requires MyDlink Home app.  The Android app does not work!  However iphone app works well.  I was able to upgrade firmware using iphone app and also do get notifications on my wife's iphone.But my Android app simply does not work.  I DO NOT get any notifications and the app says I "there is a new firmware available" even though I am on the latest version.  D'Link - please fix the Android app.  Also have one app to control all devices....cant understand why each device (camera, motion sensor etc) require they own different apps.
