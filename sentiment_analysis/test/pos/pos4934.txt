I have a MacBook Pro Retina Late 2013 (dual graphics) down to 20% charge.  My brand new Charge Tech 24,000 mAh fully charged.  So I decide to try it out so I plug it in,,,, 25 minutes later I noticed that the MacBook was no longer charging and had only charged to 30%.  So I check the power status of the Charge Tech and to my surprise it only has 1 power bar indicator.  I had only been surfing the web and watching a few videos on CNN/BBC.I also noticed that it discharges fairly quickly when stored away.The real problem is that I no longer can return because I missed by a couple of days!--------------------------------Update--------------------------------Apparently ChargeTech reads these posts!  They contacted me and offered to send me a replacement Battery but unfortunately for my scenario I need a higher output Battery.  Now this is how a company builds loyal customers!  If ChargeTech comes out with a heftier Battery sign me up!  Thank you ChargeTech.
