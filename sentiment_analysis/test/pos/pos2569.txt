The Garadget Smart door controller is great! It was super easy to install too! The only  part that might be a little difficult is identifying the right wiring ports to use on the garage door opener, but that itself is not difficult. All you need is your garage door manual, which is easily found online for me. it installed in like 15 minutes. once you read through the instructions. It does not include instructions in the box. You will need a QR Scanner app for your smartphone. Then scan the QR code on the box and it takes you to a website with all the instructions.  This thing is worth every penny and I never have to carry around or keep track of the garage door remote.
