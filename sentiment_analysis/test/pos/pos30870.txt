1/22/16 - Only been using it for a few days so I'll update this as I note new things.  First, the idea is great and the product is nearly perfect.  There are some design flaws though, in version 2, which is what I'm reviewing.  First, taking the grow bed out to do anything like move around the decorations if one gets messed up or make sure your snail didn't die (which mine did, sadly) is a massive hassle because of the cord(s).  A simple design change could alleviate this problem entirely.  Here's my suggestion:Where the cord(s) pass up through the grow bed opening, simply remove the back wall or make a small "cord-width" cut from the bottom of the grow bed to the top of it to allow the cords to pass through as you lift the bed out.  If it weakens the bed wall too much then maybe have some sort of "snap in" component to pop in and out of the wall.  I'm going to enlist the services of a friend with a dremel tool and perform this modification.  I'll post the results (with pictures) when complete.1/25/16 - I posted an update but it never updated the review (might have been rejected).  The cuts were successful but they do weaken the grow bed walls as a result (see disclaimer, below).  Not enough to cause problems with function, in my opinion, and they do make it 2x easier to take the grow bed off without disturbing the contents of the tank.  I still think this design change needs to happen in future builds of the product.  The cord trough needs to be deeper and slightly wider, also.**DISCLAIMER** I claim no responsibility if you choose to modify your own product in this way.  Keep in mind that this will void any kind of warranty from Back to the Roots so do it at your own risk.2/17/16 - I have successfully grown sprouts.  They were tasty but a huge pain to get right.  They repeatedly fall into the grow bed/tank and have to be sucked out or otherwise removed.  I am now growing the wheat grass and I have to say that it is much easier and nicer, in my opinion.  I plan on buying a second one of these products for home with my cats and growing nothing but wheat grass for them to eat.  I think they'd enjoy the fish, also.I will say that I haven't had good luck with snails in this habitat.  The betta, Odin, seems to care little for either Sir Snail I or Sir Snail II, both of which died within weeks of purchase.  I have two Ghost Shrimp in there, Cheech and Chong, and they are perfectly capable of cleaning the cage of debris and algae.  I recommend at least two if you are going to do them.What I've Learned:- Aquatic plants are a nice edition to the tank but Petco seems to sell a lot of plants that actually aren't aquatic plants.- Shrimp are great and fast enough to avoid being picked on by the betta.  However, the personality of your fish will dictate that.- As mentioned, wheat grass is easier of the two packet types shipped with v2.- You can grow any kind of plant you want in the grow bed.  Currently I have an aloe plant, a type of plant originally sold as an aquatic plant from Petco (it was not), a cactus (yes, they can grow in aquaponics), and I'm sprouting Pothos in the feeding hatch of the unit.- Aquatic plants I have are an Amazon sword (floating on the top of the water), a bamboo shoot, some sort of sword plant from Petco, and a marimo ball.- You need a turkey baster, trust me.  It'll be so much easier to clean up after the fish and remove seeds that fall into the tank.- It takes about a week to cycle the water and make it 100% safe for all life forms.  Currently, my nitrate/nitrite/chlorine levels are all at 0 and the pH is neutral.- You'll want to get a testing set of some sort to monitor for levels.- Removal of dead animals from the tank is key to preventing dangerous ammonia spikes that could kill everything.- A little bit of cloudiness or bubbles, the first few days after adding water to the tank, is normal.- Aquarium salt is useful for fixing the nitrate/nitrite levels but it's even better to just let your tank cycle itself by germinating seeds for the grow bed and planting a few aquatic plants.  Once it's cycled you can add fish and plants without needing any added items.
