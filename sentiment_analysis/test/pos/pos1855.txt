Have been using the laptop for about a week now. I'm a heavy gamer and its been excellent. I do have a cooling fan underneath, however, even while playing graphic strong games such as Subnautica and No Man's Sky, the laptop hardly heats up. It is also capable of Steam Streaming over 5GHz wifi connection. This, however, does heat up the laptop to an uncomfortable level.
