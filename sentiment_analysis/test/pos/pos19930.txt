Its a fun camera. It's different how you have to take shots. Wouldn't use as a regular camera but to play with focus and post some fun pictures on Facebook its great. Software for your computer to download and edit is slow. Also would like to have a Android app to edit and share on the go. It's an older product so that's probably not happening anymore.
