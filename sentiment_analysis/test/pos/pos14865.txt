Halleluja! I am in love with these snacks!!These apple chips are just what I've been looking for in a snack!So crunchy and so delicious, I cannot stop eating them...  and best of all, they are guilt free, people!Nothing naughty in them... just apples.... baked!  No fats, no added sugar, no junk!!I love them so much, I keep them in my car, my briefcase, and drop them in my kiddos' lunches.Thanks Bare Fruit!!xoxxo Giselle
