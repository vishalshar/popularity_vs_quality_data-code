FroliCat Bolt Laser Toy / B0021L8W6KI wasn't too certain about buying this toy for my cats' fifth birthday. I knew that they like to chase lasers, so that wasn't the problem - my concern was that they don't like to STOP chasing lasers. Our last foray into laser pointer territory ended with me letting the laser dot "escape" through an air vent in the wall, thinking that would end the game - no, they just sat vigil under the air vent for five hours. I didn't want a repeat of that.On the other hand, they are housecats and seem pretty bored and listless, and they definitely need the exercise, so I broke down and bought this... and could not be happier.The best thing about this laser toy is that if has a mechanical 'servo' sound - a kind of light-pitched soft whirring and turning whenever it is in operation. The sound is soft enough to not really bother a human (although you probably wouldn't want to sit next to it while you watch TV), but it is distinct enough for a cat to hear it in the other room and come running. The practical upshot of this is that your cats figure out really quickly that the magical laser dot ONLY appears when the whirring noise turns on. So if the whirring noise goes off, the laser is gone, and they don't hunt endlessly for it. Indeed, my most active cat has figured out that the laser dot COMES from the whirring thing and will lead me to its spot on the table and demand that I push the button to activate it. Awesome.I suppose the other best thing about this toy is that it works. It's silly that has to be a product 'plus', but such is the state of the cat toy industry these days, I suppose. But boy, does this thing work! It takes 4 AA batteries, and I recommend they be fully charged (try Eneloop batteries, you won't be disappointed) in order for the light to be as bright as possible. We have the toy sitting on a coffee table, with the adjustable mirror set to the perfect angle so that the light appears on the carpet a few feet away. The light swirls in slow patterns, jumps in fast leaps, and holds still for a few seconds so that my lazy calico can leap on it and cover it with both paws. The best part is that the cats never seem to get frustrated with not being able to 'catch' the light - they seem to recognize that it's a game, not real prey, and that's fine with me. My tuxedo always plays, but sometimes my calico just likes to lay on the floor and watch the light. Thy both come running at full speed, though, when they hear that motor start.The toy has a fifteen minute shut-off point so you can turn this on and leave the room without worrying that your cats will make themselves sick chasing a dot for hours. It's as easy as putting the batteries in (with an easy sliding-door chamber - no tricky maneuvering required), setting it down on a table, and pressing a button to turn on. If you want it to shut off before the 15 minutes are up, you press the button again. So easy! I am seriously considering buying more of these - one for each room in the house.~ Ana Mardoll
