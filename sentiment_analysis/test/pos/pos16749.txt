Our son has been a board game guy since he was a little kid.  Now that he's in his late 20s (and still loves ALL kinds of games), I was on a mission to find a fun game that didn't last for DAYS like Monopoly.  This is it!There is a lot of luck involved in this game but there is enough strategy to feel like you're at least PARTLY in control.  And it's fun!  Buying/selling stock, working (up the corporate ladder to CEO maybe), when to sell, when to buy and those awful "chance" cards that are either a spectacular windfall for you or dead broke (it seems) makes for smiles or groans.  And don't forget taxes.Somehow this equals fun!  The person with the most money doesn't necessarily win.  The person who retires (and meets several criteria) is the winner.  And retiring isn't as easy as it sounds.I especially like that the game last for as little as an hour and MAYBE up to 2 hours plus a bit.  Most of our games (3 peeps) are around one and one-half hours.The only con we've seen after playing 6 games is some of the cards aren't totally clear.  The explanation and reference book of rules is clear, concise, and easy to find answers.  The cards, sometimes, raise a question that isn't explained anywhere - so we made up our own rule.  That worked just fine.LOVE this game!  Great for family game night!
