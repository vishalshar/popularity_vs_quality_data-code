This is extremely useful.  I have this for my first generation iPad mini for GPS and music on my 2015 328.  It fits the CD tray perfectly and does not interfere with CD play (I did try having a CD played although I mostly use my iPad to play mp3).  All in all, this is a very nice, sturdy, and well-designed product.
