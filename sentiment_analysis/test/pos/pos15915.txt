first batch of mushrooms was a big suprise and they were so good. they are kinda spicy if just eaten raw and will numb your toung to a degree. i find them very tasty and every once and a while i get a few more mushrooms off of it.just a warning dont leave this in a room with drinking water open. if left over night you might end up with mycelium growing in your water. just an fyi lol
