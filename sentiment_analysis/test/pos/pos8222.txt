So I ordered a set of these prop guards from Amazon and really liked what appeared to be a good quality product and added a nice look to my drone. I have been very cautious about what I add to the drone and the mods I do to it. After installing the prop guards, I ensured that I had proper clearance and test spun the motors before lift off.Well today after my third flight with them this happened. I was hovering around 300 feet and winds were around 10 mph max. About six minutes into the flight I noticed the drone started to fly erratically and was rapidly losing altitude. I repeatedly press the pause button to try to brake it but the drone would not respond. The Solo landed hard but luckily stayed upright. I guess I had just enough lift to keep it stable and avoided catastrophic damage.I contacted Dan with Polar Pro and he asked me to email him the pics. I told him I was disappointed that the very item I purchased to protect my props destroyed two of them and nearly destroyed my drone.I will say that I do believe the leg extensions I purchased at the same time may have saved it from further damage.They can replace the guards with a new set but I won't use them unless they do a redesign that somehow allows more than 2-3mm of clearance.*Update* Polar Pro immediately contacted me back and has made everything right. I am very pleased with their communication and customer service. I believe this product can be dramatically improved with just a bit more clearance between the props and the guard.
