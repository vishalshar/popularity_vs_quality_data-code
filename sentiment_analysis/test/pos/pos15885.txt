Hi my name is Ayaan Samad I am 13 and am from NY I have been skating for 2 years and could never ever land a Ollie no matter how hard I tried I saved up and bought skatertrainers I was thrilled on high my ollies were I used them for about 4-5 days then I took them off and landed it so high I was so stoked I showed my parents they saw it and we're so impressed I just wanted to personally thank you skatertrainers!
