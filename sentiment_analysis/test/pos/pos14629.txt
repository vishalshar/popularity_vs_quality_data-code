I now own two of these devices. I bought the first one approximately a year ago and used it until the battery died. When I needed to order replacement batteries I went ahead and ordered a second tracker to find my work keys. I love that I can change the battery and don't have to buy a whole new device. I also love that the app will let me light up the tracker or cause it to make a sound so that I am able to quickly locate it when I have misplaced it. I do not love that the tracking app does not always know where the keys are, even when they are close if I am running the app in the background. I have found that I have to turn off the app most of the time and just turn it on when I have lost my keys. I like the functionality of the app and tracker with the Apple watch, but false alerts have left me turning off that function as well. I love the tracker and would give 5 stars if it weren't for the problems with the app giving false alarms of lost keys.
