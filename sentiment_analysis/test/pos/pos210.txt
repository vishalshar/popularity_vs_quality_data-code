For a portable, versatile speaker, it's perfect. Balanced 360 degree sound, indestructible and a long battery life. Exactly what we want in a Bluetooth speaker. If I want to rattle my ear drums and get super high fidelity, I'll crank up the old home stereo. I don't need a brick to carry outdoors. And these days, the price is right.
