I explained to him that I just purchased this headset a few weeks back and all of a sudden the micro-usb port would no longer make a snug connection.(Paraphrase) He says, "I am so sorry, i may have heard of this happening 1 time before.  We will get a new one to you by the weekend."Note that this was Tuesday and the product would have to be shipped nationwide.  I gave him my information and he said a support member would contact me later that day to get everything squared away.  A couple hours later, i get a call and an email.  Asking me what color my headset was.Friday Afternoon - Headset arrived at my doorstep.  Still amazed and psyched.If you ever have a problem, which you shouldn't, the support team is there to help.{Product rating (87/100)}
