The aquafarm came quickly. Nice outer package with suprizingly armor protected inner box. The quality of manufacturing is excellent and the unit went together in minutes. I like the fact you receive everything but the fish.. We used some pure artesian well water and skipped some of the chemicals that came with it. we are running all stock equipment and filled it up with Gynura procumbens herbs. We love the fish "Sammy" and really enjoy the entire set up. To your health and knowledge. Check out my pictures of this gynura aquafarm and youtube video. http://youtu.be/B4Pu2Um_4-8
