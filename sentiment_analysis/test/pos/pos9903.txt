Does not improve tackiness to leather (tackified) football gloves. I applied three separate applications to the gloves, but did not improve the grip. Had high expectations for this product.UPDATE 12/17/15: I've been contacted by the Grip Boost team and they wanted me to have a second chance with their product. I was sent a second bottle with a "new formula" for testing. I applied it on my Cutter Rev gloves, and it seems to have improved the grip comparatively to the previous applications. Perhaps it is due to the new formula, or better conditions to use the Grip Boost on. I can't give a perfect rating as the inconsistency in the grip boost shouldn't occur. However, I am quite satisfied, particularly in their customer service.
