When I purchased this product a few months ago, there were a number of reviews indicating that the adapter didn't "click in" correctly. There were also a number of reviews pointing out that those reviewers must be doing it wrong. I needed a smaller USB-C connecter than the one sold by Apple, and this project, developed out of a Kickstarter campaign, seemed like the only good option, so I purchased it anyway.I have had ZERO problems getting this to "click in" to the USB-C slot on my MacBook and have been 100% happy with its functionality. It has a great look, to boot -- matches my gold Mac exactly.
