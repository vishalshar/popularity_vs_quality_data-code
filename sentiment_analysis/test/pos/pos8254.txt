I am pleased with these vitamins!!  After doing a lot of research I decided on SmartyPants vitamins for my 3 year old and for myself.  SmartyPants is committed to high quality.  These are non GMO and have no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.  They also have no high fructose corn syrup.  This company also partners with Vitamin Angels and makes a 1 for 1 matching nutrient grant to a child in need with each vitamin purchase made!!  I LOVE this!!  Awesome reason to support SmartyPants!!
