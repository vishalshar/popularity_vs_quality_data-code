This was a great buy.  I was unsure about purchasing it after reading reviews that the unit did not put out enough sound. After using the Fugoo for the past month, I can honestly say that those claims are false. I have used the unit at the beach, in large rooms with lots of noise, etc and the Fugoo performed exceptionally well. Loudness will depend on the quality of the recording. I have noticed that certain songs in my collection play louder than others but even in these cases, I can't keep the volume turned all of the way up for very long. The unit is well worth the price in terms of ease of use, its high quality construction, Bluetooth reliability and distance, sound quality and loudness.
