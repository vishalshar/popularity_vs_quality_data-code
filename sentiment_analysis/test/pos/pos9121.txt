Seriously, wow! I was happened to come across a review of this online and figured I would give it a try since I'm trying to eat healthier between Whole30 and Paleo. So far I've used it for fried eggs, saut√©ed veggies and meats with great results. I was a afraid from the name of it that there was going to be a nasty flavor to it, but I'm pleasantly surprised that there is no taste what so ever. This is definitely something I will be buying again.
