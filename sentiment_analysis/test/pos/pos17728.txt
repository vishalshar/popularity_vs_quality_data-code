I bought this as a pet tracker even though they don't necessarily recommend it for that use. I have a cat that tends to wander off but never very far. I figured with a 100 foot radius + me walking around enough I'd be able to track her down.I tested it like crazy with all her usual hiding spots to make sure it'd work for me and that I wouldn't have to return it and was very impressed with the range. I didn't actually measure, but I counted my steps; 95 steps away and it still kept a connection. However, once it lost the connection I had to take 10-15 steps to get it to re-connect. Still...not bad!Before I put it on her collar, several times a day I'd activate it with her nearby so it plays its tune, and I'd give her a treat. Hoping she'd learn to hear the tune and come home for a treat. Well that part worked.  When she's in range, I click "find" to play the tune and she runs home for her treat. Or perhaps she's running home because she's freaked out about this music that's chasing her.  Either way, success!The only downfall is that sometimes she's 10 feet away and it will say "out of range". If I stand there long enough it does usually connect, but it's frustrating to wait for it to catch up. Also, the dotted circle that's supposed to tell you if you're getting hot or cold isn't always very accurate. So I find myself walking back and forth quite a bit feeling like I'm being punk'd by my own cat.All in all, it's surpassed my expectations.  I've been able to find her every time. Sometimes it takes a lot longer since it has trouble connecting at times. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, but since I can't, I'll give it 5 since I'm using it for something it's not even advertised to do, and it's still doing it quite well.Update 9/16/16:  well I've had the Tile for almost a year now and I still think this thing is pretty wonderful. It has its moments where it just won't connect, sometimes for hours, but that's very rare. For the most part it's been really solid. I wanted to share what just happened a little while ago. It was around 8pm and my cat was nowhere to be seen. Very unusual for her. She never wants to be outside when it's dark. So I grabbed my phone and went searching in her usual spots. Nothing. Finally I see my Tile app shows her as nearby and connects so I can ring her Tile. I could just barely hear it ringing but finally found that the ringing was coming from a neighbor's garage!  Our garages are lined up in the alley behind our condos and without the Tile I never would have even thought to look near the garages, and I never would have known which one she was in. There's a stretch of about 50 of them. As soon as I went up to the garage door and called her she meowed her little head off. I was able to ask the owner to open the door so I could get her out. Without the tile I would have been up all night looking for her and worried sick and what if the owner of that garage was not planning to open it for several days?!  I get sick even thinking about it.  So.. Here I am ordering 2 more tiles for my other cats even though they never go anywhere.  I will just feel better if they have them.  Tile has a customer for life right here, especially after tonight!
