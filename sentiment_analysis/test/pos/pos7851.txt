Two things you must note:  (1) there ARE different ways to install these to make them looser or tighter!  (2) I was able to use 1 set for 2 sets of shoes.The instructions as I could see only showed insert through hole on left, on to the hole on right and connect -- straight across.  I didn't take the card out of the clear box to see if it opened and more instructions inside.  Apparently there are, but it looks like you can read both sides so I didn't bother and chucked the box.  Was going to put a review on here that they need to make graduated lengths because I couldn't use  them in the top 2 holes of my sneakers (too tight, I have a high instep), then I read a review that pointed to the instructions folded out of sight in the box AND to instructions on Hickies' website.  Aha!However, by the time I'd found the instructions for a looser fit, I'd decided I actually liked using only 4 hickies per shoe on one pair of shoes and only three (left off the holes closes to toes and top two by ankle.  Both pairs stay firmly on my feet, easier to take off, not too tight.  Might remove one more from the first pair!  The result?  I got TWO pairs of shoes out of a package meant for one.  So that's even better than making them fit all the holes in a looser manner.Just thought I'd pass this along.
