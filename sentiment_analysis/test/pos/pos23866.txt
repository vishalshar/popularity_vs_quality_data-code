These are exceptional socks. it would be difficult to underestimate how much I appreciate these perfectly made socks.  I have been suffering from some kind of neuropathy complicated by an unusual form of arthritis that has attacked my hands and feet. Until I got these wonderful socks a few days ago, every time I put on a pair of shoes I felt phantom bumps and lumps on the ball of my foot even though the shoes are perfectly smooth. I tried numerous competitive sock brands before stumbling on the Galiva and I know that  the only change I've made is to change for the socks, and the pain and bumps and lumps have completely disappeared. This is a godsend. They are the smoothest socks I have ever felt. I followed up my order with two more for higher socks as these are not suitable for most winter days.
