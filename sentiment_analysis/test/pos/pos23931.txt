After several trials of other (way more expensive dog foods) and challenges with explosive stool and enough fart power to compete with the cattle, we decided to try the redpaw X1 on our malamute pup--- amazing improvements, literally next day!  No more liquid stool, severely reduced farts, energy level is still high and the pup loves the redpaw food.  The bag is waterproof, well sealed, and if you read up on the redpaw brand, it has great reviews by working and domestic breeds as well for a great value! Highly recommended!
