Simply amazing piece of tech. I've had a FLIR pathfindir in my vehicles off and on for several  years that is relatively cheap as far as LWIR equipment is concerned. This unit is less than 1/10 of the cost of my vehicle mounted unit and while it has roughly half the dimensional resolution and a third of the frame rate I am probably more impressed with the seek solely for the fact that it is so darn affordable. A military grade aerial unit will run well over $100k with commercial applications costing $10's of thousands of dollars and consumer grade versions are still thousands but they somehow managed to make a capable functional unit that everyone can afford. Well done
