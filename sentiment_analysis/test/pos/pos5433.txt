After a long search for a deodorant that's safe and natural in addition to somehow being effective, I have finally found one!  This stuff smells great (I got the patchouli) and actually works!  Bought a jar before my trip to Maui, and have not been disappointedn in the slightest.  Even after a full day or hiking and swimming in the ocean, I do not stink at all, and usually can still smell the patchouli at the end of the day.  I use only a pea sized amount per pit, and that's really all u need if u rub it in good.  I haven't gone through the whole jar yet, but at this rate I think it should last closer to 2 months than 1.  No rashes of any sort, and my skin is usually pretty sensitive (part of what started my search to begin with).  PPP has just earned themselves a customer for life here!
