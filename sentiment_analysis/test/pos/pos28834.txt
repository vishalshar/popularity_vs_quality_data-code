Love this product. Works perfect. The Grandkids are freaked out about it and my wife hates it and took it off her toilet. She'd rather use a night light. I don't have to turn the light on anymore when I enter to use the bathroom. I keep mine changing colors all the time. During the day, it never comes on (which it is designed not to).
