What a great little speaker. (FUGOO tough) From the moment you feel how heavy it is you know it is quality. The package itself was easy to open and the directions are so easy to follow, just turn it on and it tells you what to do. Mine came with updated firmware. After you pair it with your phone and play the first song you will realize how nice this speaker sounds.  The sound quality is amazing, great tone, base, and mid range sound. I only purchase Bose home speaker systems so for me to say the sound is good says alot. The update is great, it tells you what the battery level is, what sound level, etc... I love that when my phone rings and I am in the kitchen or outside I can answer it with the speaker. The siri/ Google is such a nice addition. I plan to use this on my boat, on the beach, next to the fire etc... I also update my posts as i use items good and bad.Update**** seriously this is a bad ass speaker. I have absolutely zero complaints!!!! If you are honestly complaining about the volume of this speaker then you need to purchase an actual surround sound system. How loud do you need a portable speaker???? The wireless distance is amazing, I put my phone in my pocket and walk into the house shutting a solid glass door and walk downstairs to make a drink and it doesn't miss a beat. Seriously people will complain just to complain. Don't worry about purchasing this. You won't regret it! For all you idiots with bad reviews this speaker isnt designed for a night club!
