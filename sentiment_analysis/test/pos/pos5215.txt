I purchased this phone as a transitional phone.  My old one had broken and I couldn't yet afford the one I really wanted, so I snagged this inexpensive option to tide me over for a month or two.  You really can't beat it for the price.  It served me perfectly.  It IS tiny, so be aware that typing is hard, but I just texted with voice recognition.  Keeping  it as a backup, just in case.
