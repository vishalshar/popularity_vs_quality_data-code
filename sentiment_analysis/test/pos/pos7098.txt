He is very smart and loves to play with balls...so I figured this would be a no-brainer. Well, I was wrong. He didn't like the texture of the fuzz on the balls, he is more of a bouncy ball kind of guy. My female Shih Tzu was a different story. She usually doesn't like balls, but LOVES this toy. I haven't been able to teach her how to drop the ball into the unit, but she will come running when she hears the motor "whirring" and excitedly wags her tail waiting for the ball to go flying when I drop it in. (Sometimes I have to cheat and trigger the mechanism to get her to return with the ball...hence, the whirring when she hasn't brought it back yet....)  The three distance choices are great, I have a large recreation room and I have used all of them...and even worked at ricocheting the balls off different walls to keep her guessing.My only complaint is that she is a naughty little chewer and has managed, after a few months, to destroy the covering on the balls that came with the unit. I was able to save them for as long as I did by taking putting them away when she gets tired of running. She only has access to the balls when we are using this unit, they are not her "play" toys so to speak. I have ordered more of the ifetch balls, even though I have read in reviews that the Kong ones work. (I have not tried them so can not say if they do.) Anyway, I figure it is a small price to pay to keep her busy and the boys watching her running around keeps them entertained as well.I took off the one star for the balls being so easily destroyed'....otherwise a great product.Update:  I did try the same size bouncy balls from Oriental Trading company, and they will not work, they get jammed up in the machine. (Maybe something to do with the weight? Just an FYI that size isn't the only consideration when choosing balls)Update #2: I have provided a video of the iFetch and my female Shih-Tzu. She really enjoys playing with this. I hope this provides more insight for those considering on buying this device.
