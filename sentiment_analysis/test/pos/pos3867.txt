I travel a lot and have been looking for a carry-on that allows easy access to laptop/tablet for security. This is the best solution of all those that i have tried, because it is easy to open and get the laptop out. I have however only extra-thin laptops MacBook Air 13" and MacBook 12") and I can imagine it would be harder with a normal sized one. The macbook air fits comfortably with its sleeve. The size of the Bluesmart also fits my needs quite well, and it is easy to navigate narrow aisles in airplanes with it. I do like the charging ports -- I run out of juice for iPad and phone all the time on long trips... it's great that one of the USB ports is inside the front pocket for the laptop so that one can store the charging device safely away when changing planes etc. The bluetooth connection sometimes takes some time or multiple attempts (most of my bluetooth devices have the same problem -- it's probably my phone) and so I often leave it unlocked while navigating security etc. There are handy pockets for cables etc with see-through covers so it is easy to find things. The price is hefty, but not unlike some other brands (I paid more for a Briggs & Riley I got for the same purpose which has less functionality and fell apart after a couple of years). Overall, I like the look a lot.
