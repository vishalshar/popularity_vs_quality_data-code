I get terrible motion sickness in the car and on boats, but I hate taking medications that make me drowsy. I went on a whale watching boat before discovering these and was so nervous about getting sick that I took 2 dramamine. Then I sort of forgot I had taken them and had a beer on the boat. Needless to say, I was basically a zombie for the next 12 hours. I tried one of these before my last boat outing (a day sail) and felt great! I was even able to enjoy some beverages without feeling lethargic. I've tried ginger candies in the past but I didn't get the same result, plus the flavor was way too strong. I will be keeping these on hand from now on!
