AWESOME! I love this little thing! I bought this for my wife and I to use on the way from Michigan to Texas, and it works great! We tried to start a regular fire after 2 full days of rain and it took an hour. But with the fire ant and the way it's built creates a perfect up draft airflow system that helps fires burn/continue to burn quickly. It takes about 30 seconds to set up, 6 min to boil water, 1.5 min to cool down (titanium) and about 5 seconds to disassemble. And to top it all off it picks into a durable and thin pouch so it takes up minimal space! I think it's less than a half an inch thick when all packed up.
