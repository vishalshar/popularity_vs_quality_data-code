this is fast drying.  i bought it for a camping/hiking trip.  however, there wasn't any running water to be had, so i didn't use this much as a towel.  for  few occasions where it was used as a towel, it worked well.  although, this was really helpful to use over the top of my sleeping bag overnight.  there was always condensation on the inside of the sleeping bag roof by the morning-time, and it would drip on top of my sleeping bag.  i really liked being able to put this over, to not get my sleeping bag wet.  if you decide to use the towel for this purpose - you would need a larger-sized one, and also some safety pins to pin it into place, so it doesn't slip off overnight.  it is a little slippery.
