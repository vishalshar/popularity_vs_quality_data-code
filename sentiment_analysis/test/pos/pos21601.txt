Is this stuff even kidding me?? I had to write a review because I honestly was a little annoyed with how little sand there was in the bag for the sixteen dollars that I paid for it.  But the stuff was a godsend for me so I feel I owe it to the world to write about my experience.So the bag of sand arrived the other day and it was not much bigger than my hand. Along with that I also bought a small litter pan here on Amazon for less than three dollars, and the litter in this bag barely covered the bottom of the pan. But it DID cover it.I got some nice squishy warm blankets, kitty's food and water, and the litter pan with sand...and set my little bathroom up like a teeny tiny little loft apartment. Then shut her in there after a short petting and introduction to her space. She was not happy. There was some serious initial vocal display of indignation along with an impressive show of paw strength yanking from underneath the door but that only lasted a few minutes. I guess it was good timing -- I woke her up from a deep slumber to put her in there,  in the hopes that her bladder would already be somewhat full -- because after a couple moments of silence I heard the familiar litter scratching sound and then more meowing by the door. Sure enough, when I peeked in, I saw a sufficient amount of cat pee just sitting on top of the litter! The little pipette syringe thingy and collection test tube that came with the litter, came in very handy.  I definitely would've paid a few dollars extra for those parts so I can mentally remove that from the price of the sand and now I feel like the whole thing was well worth the sixteen bucks.Anyway, I will not hesitate to recommend this stuff to anyone I know with a cat! I do want to add that the product itself seems to be no different then that kids' play magic sand stuff, and my guess is you could technically find recipes online to make your own -- a whole lot more sand for a whole lot less.  Since I hope to only need this amount, I'm glad I just took the easy route and bought it...  But if someone needed much larger amounts, for multiple cats or reoccurring issues, it might be worth checking out. That Steve Spangler will help you make anything ;-)
