Wow!!!! How freakin cool is this.  just got my pen today and I'm really excited.  I'm a propmaker for the motion picture industry and have been 3D printing for a couple of years.  This is a toy, for sure, but its more than that for me.  If you're interested in 3D printing this is a must have.  It allows for repair of your prints with the same material you printed.  The filaments included in the package are awesome.  So many colors and options.  This is a great start for into into additive manufacturing.  Kids will get a lot of distance out of this as it's very easy to use and hold.  It's very slim and compact.  Obviously its a heated element so it requires care, but the pen itself stays cool and quiet.  It's robust and would take a drop ok.  The best part is its simplicity.  It's a very simple welcoming package that let me get started right away.  It takes a steady hand to get drawing but then the options are limitless.  Too much fun.
