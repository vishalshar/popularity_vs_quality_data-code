I know there's been concern about durability but I've used it on a couple trips and so far so good. **knock on wood** Love the ear functionality control. It may take some time to get used to or may take a few times to press depending on the thickness of your gloves and helmet audio liner but once you get it working, it's so convenient especially when you're with friends on a lift and want to chat without having to take off your gloves and phone/audio player.
