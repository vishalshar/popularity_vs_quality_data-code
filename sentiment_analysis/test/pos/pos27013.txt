Coming from a PC perspective.These headphones are amazing....1) Set up is super easy2) Design, looks and feel is quality.3) Wireless Range is amazing! I live in a single bedroom 800 sq ft and I can walk around my whole place without interference. Granted position of the Base is important which i have on top of my computer which is on top of my desk and in the middle of the living room.With that saidLucidsound really have to market these for PC platform, because I'm sure as hell they will beat the Razer Man o War, Skullcandy plry 1-2, and possible even match up to Astro 50's and steelseries h800 in terms of sound quality.For me the product that i have received there was no noise crackling or no defects yet. and for 149$ I don't think you can beat these headphones.Music sounds great whether its in passive or wireless mode.If you heard it might had a little too much deep bass, it doesn't but you can change it, if you wanted.For the games testedFor FPS genre of games such as CSgo/Black op 3/Doom/BF4/The Division /r6 siege - Sounds crisp, where you can hear the footsteps clearly and also the position, whether its to the left or right. From here you can change the EQ with the button on the right side of the headphone. To me the default was the best sound overall. These def perform better than my logitech wired headset with virtual 7.1 surround.Just beware for me default volume on my initial start up was high so be careful, crank the volume down and tweak it from there.As for comfort these are on the heavy side but the cushions are great, it will make up for the weight of these headphones.My heads circumference is 24 inches, and these fit just fine.Haven't been able to test the battery life due to the time frame of my gaming but they are marketed at 15hours.Mic is good enough, not the best but good enough where your team can hear you clearly.I bought mine so this is not a biased review.Only Con While i was looking for a wireless headset for PC gaming, Steelseries h800 was the only one that caught my eye, due to it having replaceable li-ion battery. I'm sure like all batteries they will lose their charge at a given time, just wish these could have a replacement for they look and feel like they will last a long time.*Also Discord seems to make this mic quality realllly poor* but skype/steam/and other Teamspeak software work fine.
