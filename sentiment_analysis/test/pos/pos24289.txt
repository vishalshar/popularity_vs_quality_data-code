So after a few hiccups with shipping (amazon sent me a blanket instead of my headset, they took care of it right a way. Top notch customer service amazon.) I don't know what people are talking about having to be a usb extender with the ps4 pro, I hooked everything up just fine. After hooking them up it all worked and sounded perfectly. Definitely worth every penny.
