I bought this as a gift and the recipient has absolutely loved it. Before, they were having an issue making sure the watch stayed on the charger through the night if they accidentally bumped their nightstand. Now, there's no worries as to whether their watch will be fully charged and ready to go when they wake up in the morning. Highly recommend and even better in person.
