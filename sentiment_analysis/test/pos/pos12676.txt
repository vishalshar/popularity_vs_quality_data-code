These are the only bowls we use with our son. Magnetic force is strong enough that my 8 month old can't throw his bowl across the room. The size of the bowls are great for small snacks as well as full size meals. We haven't used the silverware much but everything else is used every single day. Definitely recommend purchasing this set if you have or are getting the 4moms highchair
