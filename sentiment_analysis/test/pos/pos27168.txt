Mine just arrived on Friday and I immediately took it down to my favorite brew pub to be filled up...it caused a huge stir, everyone very interested and impressed with its concept and appearance.So I filled it up, took it home, released some CO2 and it blew up killing the dog and cat, leaving food grade shrapnel sticking out of me, but keeping enough beer fresh and cold so my wife had a couple glasses full waiting for the ambulance to arrive...kidding.This works as advertised, keeping beer tasting fresh from the tap tasting. I will be buying the 124 oz version after Christmas. The CO2 adjustment has a nice little push back on the control knob, to assure not over pressurizing, and it holds the pressure very well. It dispenses perfectly, the gauges for remaining volume and pressure work accurately. It looks great, the handle is nice for carrying.I say get one. For the price it is a steal compared to those that only keep beer for 24 hours.
