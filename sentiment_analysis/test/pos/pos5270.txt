This food is great for dogs of all ages/breeds.  We bought this food because it's not full of fillers like a lot of other dog foods.  We have used it from day one with our 10 week old puppy. She did great with the size of the kibbles.  Our 7 year old miniature schnauzer does well too.  Good quality food.
