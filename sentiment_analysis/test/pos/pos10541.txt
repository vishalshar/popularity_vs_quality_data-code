There should be a Nobel prize for the guys that invented this awesome device! I received this right before Christmas, and have used it daily since then. It does exactly like they advertise, makes bottle beer taste just like a freshly poured draft, with a creamy head, and great taste! It could not be easier to use and clean up after. If you like draft beer, and want it without going to a bar, and paying premium prices, this is exactly what you need! Best money I've spent in quite awhile!
