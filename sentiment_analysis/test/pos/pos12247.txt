I bought four; each installation went without a problem. After finishing the linkage to the D-Link app, I paired them to my Amazon Echo 1, 2, 3, 4 ... A breeze. Then I IFTTTed my Ring doorbell to my foyer light so it turns on for 30 seconds after motion is detected by Ring (to simulate a response inside the home). I grouped my lights according to location for convenience, done! I finished all of this in 45 minutes on the outside. I am very pleased with the result. My wife loves the ability to turn on virtually any light in our home with a voice command, no more groping for switches.
