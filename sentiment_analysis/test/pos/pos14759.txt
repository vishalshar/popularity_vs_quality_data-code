Initial take:I live on Long Island N.Y. everything is close by CAR! I'm 22 and have a car of my own however, I don't want to keep paying for gas when ever I want to visit my friends, get some lotto, buy a newspaper, get some groceries from a store a little ways a way. To far to walk to close to drive! That is where this guy comes in handy. Just today there was a festival down the road from me a good 30 min walk away. I got on this and rode there with my music playing and had a lovely time riding the Glion. Heads will turn and look. This is an amazing item!However: this is not a smooth ride on a sidewalk. But, it is manageable and can be fun for the younger rider. Here is a hint. Ride slow to reduce bumps in the sidewalk/street. Also weight... It is light, one of the lighter ones on the market today. Still, this doesn't mean that you will be able to carry this up 9 or ten flights of stairs unless you are someone that works out everyday for fun. That is where the dolly feature comes in handy! walking it around is 100X easier and stores are more likely to let you just walk right in without question.Set up:Easy enough, there is a manual for a reason, read it, or at least look at the pictures. Simple once you get the hang of it in like 2-3 tries.I highly recommend and happy riding.You really do get what you paid for here and that is quality! It is not a kids toy(unless you're rich). But it is fun!
