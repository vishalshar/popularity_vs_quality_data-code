This gadget is as simple as it seems and it works well.  It is a tiny circuit board enclosed in an off-the-shelf plastic case that you twist open with a coin. It measures and logs temperatures and transmit them to your iPhone or Android smartphone via Bluetooth. The app shows you the current temperature and a graph of the log. It's cheap.  It's simple.  It works.Note that BATTERIES ARE NOT INCLUDED.  You will need a CR2032. Bluetooth range is understandably limited. I put the device in my refrigerator and have to stand with my phone by the closed refrigerator door to use it.  My unit did not work reliably out of the box (envelope actually), but a slight tweak to tighten the battery contacts solved the problem.
