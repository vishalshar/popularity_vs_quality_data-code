I was very pleasantly surprised by this soap.  After reading other reviews, I expected a bad seaweed smell.  I found that it does have a strange, slightly sweet scent, but it isn't unpleasant.  Also, it doesn't linger on me for long after my shower.The soap has some grit to it - it feels like sand (probably the coffee) - so it does seem to be good for exfoliation.  It leaves my skin squeaky clean.  After using it for a few weeks, I feel that it has gotten rid of the occasional bumps (keratosis pilaris) on my arms.  I've used it on my face as well.  So far, I haven't seen any signs of over-drying of skin.The soap does melt fast if you leave it wet so it requires the usual precautions of placing it somewhere dry after use.
