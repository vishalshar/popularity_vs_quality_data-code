We had been getting these treats through a local pet outlet, however Amazon's prices have recently been better, and the dates are very good.Only reason I wouldn't rate the product higher is that we have to use it sparingly as true 'treats' because, over time, they add up to a significant part of the pet budget! Our cats would eat them like regular cat food if given the choice!
