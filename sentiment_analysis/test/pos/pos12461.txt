Nice adjustment features - quick release because it holds by spring pressure.  I like it for Skype, FaceTime and for taking photos.  A very important notch is cut into the ball/cup pivot assembly... It makes this unit very, very, adjustable.  I haven't tried to wrap onto things much, but the leg quality is good - I imagine it works nicely to wrap onto somewhat smaller objects - between soft ball and bowling ball sizes maybe... Think branches or any type of pipe... Either way, the tripod can get adjusted to any weird but stable surfaces in just a few seconds when you get used to it...
