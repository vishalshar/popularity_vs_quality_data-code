I love The Seaweed Bath Co. lotion.  I bought the peppermint eucalyptus scent a while ago.  It goes on in the winter without burning and absorbs fully.  There is no greasy feeling either.  The eucalyptus peppermint smell was overpowering, so I decided to go unscented this time.  This lotion has a clay like smell.  It is not pleasant.  I am mixing it with a little of the eucalyptus scent to be able to tolerate the smell.  Still a great lotion, I would just opt for a scented one.
