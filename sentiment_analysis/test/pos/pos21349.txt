I tend to write reviews on products that really impress me.  Here we are with the Robo R1+ 3D printer and I am very, very impressed.The hobby or industry, for what it's worth, is still bleeding edge.  I wanted a printer with a large build size for home that just worked... without a lot of fuss.  I decided to go with single extruder for convenience and reliability.I have a more expensive, dual extruder printer at work that was built from a kit.  That printer works well and prints almost any material that is available today but it is also in frequent need of adjustment and calibration, especially with bed leveling.  I replaced that kit printer's stock bed with a custom designed spring loaded bed so that I can level it in just a few minutes.  That's still a pain.Now, as for the Robo R1+...  Wow.  The videos and positive reviews are true.  It literally is plug and play.  It auto-levels itself before each print, which will save you tons of frustration and time in the long run.Upon starting our first print we accidentally lost power.  When everything came back up it wouldn't zero home properly.  I was now worried about our plug and play experience.  I was sure that I would have to re-flash and called their 24/7 support line.  They quickly and calmly told me that it was probably a simple software issue.  I was instructed to delete and re-add the printer profile in MatterControl, and that was all it took.  Everything was fine in less than a minute.  I did not expect that.  I was instructed where to find the firmware only because I asked, just in case.I am impressed with the price, the quality of the product, the packaging, the quality of the prints, the extreme ease of use, their 24/7 support and the fact that it was available in stock on Amazon and on sale, the week before Christmas.  I can't say how much this single extruder printer has impressed me and how happy I am that it's printing, simple and direct.  I am smiling because I don't have a pile of hex wrenches sitting next to me to keep it running.  One last thing... about the price...  This printer is built from real production...  it is not a reprap type machine that uses a ton of 3D printed parts.  It uses real injection molded plastic parts and has a very well thought out design.  It makes use of open-source or commercial software to drive it.  The price is nothing short of amazing.  There are tiny improvements that can be made but this product prints 5 minutes from being unboxed... tiny improvements are purely optional.Owning any 3D printer is a challenge because they are still bleeding edge.  With this printer, like most, it helps immensely to have previous 3D experience... partly because you know what you're doing and you know what to look for but also with this printer, because it will make you appreciate the overall accomplishment that this product represents.  Excellent job Robo team!
