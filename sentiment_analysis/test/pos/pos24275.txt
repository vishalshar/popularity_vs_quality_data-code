I have been using this chair for about a week now and it easily is better than any chair I have had in the past. When I first opened the packaging, the incredible build quality is what struck me. The sturdy metal base and legs and high quality leather and stitching scream a premium feel.Building the chair was difficult as it is quite heavy, but the instructions made the process easy to follow. I had a hard time installing the wheels onto the base. I tried multiple different strategies but there was no luck. After going to their website, I found a helpful video which helped me install the wheels in seconds.The included headrest and lumbar support are a great touch. I like the headrest but I rarely find myself using the lumbar.Over the past week I have noticed myself trying to sit up straighter. The lower and upper back support are incredibly comfortable. Although this chair encourages a productive posture, you can lower the back to a very comfortable and relaxing napping position. I would be lying if I said I haven't taken a few extra naps since I got this chair.I highly recommend this gaming chair.
