I'm glad I didn't buy more of these things...  I purchased it for the novelty at first, just to add a little color to my room. I used it that way for 3 months and now it is my primary light source, which is not dependable.  It took an hour of resetting and unplugging repeatedly to get the SSID to finally appear, and if you turn the light bulb up to anything over 60% the wifi stops working. The problems are progressive. In the beginning silly stuff like the the bulb would appear online, but it couldn't be controlled via the app, so I would just flip the light switch and problem would be solved. I didn't think much of it until I started using it like a normal bulb, selecting only the daylight options, which is when the connectivity problems occurred. This thing gets really hot too.  I had to reset it 2 times, both of which take an INCREDIBLE amount of time and tinkering, and now on the third reset which will not take.  The bulb just flashes red and orange which is an error code for failure.I contacted  Customer Support and they responded:------------------------- (LIFX)Jan 12, 14:25Hey Rob!Thanks for making it LIFX! Sorry about the trouble you are having, let's see if we can get it fixed together.Unfortunately your bulb will have to be replaced I will need some information to start the RMA process:-------------------------I still not have heard back from customer support yet, and it's January 29.UPDATE: LIFX did replace the bulb with an upgraded model, it's much more compact and seemed to have worked some bugs out. It's been 6 months and no issues that a power switch cycle can't instantly fix.  Overall, I am satisfied with the bulb(s), I purchased a couple of white only 800 model, and mixed it in a group as the Color 1000.  Not the same hue, lesson learned, don't mix bulb models.
