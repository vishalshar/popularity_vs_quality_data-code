Overall i highly recommend this phone, i feel as though it is the best value on the market right now priced at 150USD as of 1/9/2017Things I LIKE about this device-the screen, its very crisp and colorful-the front facing speakers are very nice for watching videos and speakerphone calls-the cloud storage function is unique and cool-the fingerprint reader works well 9 times out of 10, and its placed very well. this is my first phone with a fingerprint reader and im quite impressed by the tech-the processor and RAM are very nice, i haven't seen any slowdowns on this phone-the WiFi adapter must be pretty quick i have very fast download times on this device-its fully compatible with my network including 4G LTE (tmobile)-it looks, feels, and runs like a premium device, despite the price-the built in apps (messaging, phone, contacts) are nice-there is no bloat software to take up space and never be used, more phone makers should do this!-USB-C is the future and this connector and cable is awesome!Things I DON'T like-the display is not AMOLED, which would have made the display much more vibrant-the screen has a mild amount of ghosting, but it took me about a week to notice that at all, its not a huge deal.-NO MICROSD, but the cloud storage kind of makes up for that.-the phone is slightly too big for me, i feel like i have to use both of my hands to use the device, again its only a 5.2 inch screen, the trend right now is 5.5 inch screens, which would be too big to operate comfortably.-the speakers don't sound amazing, but its only phone speakers, they usually don't sound amazing, but at least they are loud-non removable battery, im so tired of this on modern phonesADDITIONAL OPINIONS-the downside to this phone using USB-C is that its so new, that i don't have any spare cables, the only cable that i own is the one included with the device, but that's not really an issue with the phoneI was extremely picky in looking for phones, my previous phone was a galaxy s3 that had become so worn out that it was basically unusable. i wanted a phone that would be an upgrade in almost every department, such as-android 6 from the factory-under 5 inch screen-made in 2016-removable battery-1080p AMOLED screen-microsd card slotThat's all i needed, and believe it or not there are no phones that check ALL of these boxes that were within my budget (under 300USD), so i had to settle on something at some point. i could have got a galaxy s5, but it was made in 2014, and im so sick of Samsung products breaking on me. I also looked at Motorola products and they didn't impress me for the price, that being said the Motorola G4 plus was a serious contender for my next phone. then i found the nextbit robin after my friend bought one, and i was initially drawn to it because it ticks enough boxes that i was willing to compromise at that price point. it just doesn't use an AMOLED screen, or have a  microsd slot, or a removable battery, which i would kill for, but i don't think i will ever get a phone perfect for me if i want a brand new phone in a market dominated by phablets and limited to no expandable memory
