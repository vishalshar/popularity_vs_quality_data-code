Such an interesting concept for a game. Good mechanics. I just wish they had more cards cuz we run through them super fast with a bug group. And some rules aren't completely clear. It's also a pain to teach it to a group and they still don't understand. Cuz the instructions are a little much. But not impossible. Overall, fun game for the group I play with.
