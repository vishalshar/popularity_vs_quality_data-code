Before Bluesmart I honestly thought MUJI designs best looking suitcases. But this smart bag totally changed the game. You can tell Bluesmart was designed with lots of care for details, aesthetics and durability. Apart from all the smart technology perks it's a genuinely nice thing to interact with. Also a great conversation starter at the airport :)
