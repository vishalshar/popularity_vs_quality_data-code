Honestly, I don't travel a lot, but when I do, I end up needing to have is charging for my electronics and the ability to find my luggage when I travel. I came across this in a crowd funding site and was very pleased to see how easy to use, durable, reliable, long lasting for power, but most of all affordable. I enjoy my Bluesmart and I know you will too! (HINT) there's a switch in the liner, you need to turn this on before it works :-) also helps if you read the instructions. LOL.
