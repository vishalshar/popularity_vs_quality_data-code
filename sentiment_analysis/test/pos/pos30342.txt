Before I bought one more phone mount, I finally looked up the bested rated mounts.  This rated so high, I couldn't resist at the price.  Wow, was it worth it.  Grabs my phone nicely however, I did put both magnetic devices on my phone.  One on the phone and one on the case.  Not that it necessarily needed it but just because I drive off road and wanted extra protection.  Have to say, this is truly, by FAR, THEE BEST phone device I have ever purchased.
