I use Hickies on all my tennis shoes. I have about 4 pairs with them. I have high arches and shoe side is between 6 -6.5. I have such a hard time find comfortable tennis shoes. Ever since I did the loose fit on them I could stand being in them throughout the day.Now I don't have $180 shoes laying around unused because they hurt.
