So far for me, this product is great. The battery life lasted a long time for me, enough to get through the day without charging it up. This was my biggest concern when buying a smartwatch because it may not last a long time. I get many notifications as well as use it to control music so I have it on quite a bit. I did not have tilt to wake on but did have ambient mode on and it lasted all day for me which was great. Durability wise, I think I is decent and the build quality is great. I do martial arts and wearing it on my belt did not break it. However I'm guessing if you kick or punch it, it will break. the right side has a tickle sensor and works well with the innovative idea. The software works relatively well and already had some updates and bug fixes. There are some watch faces and I thought they were all great. My only wish is a little more customization for each watch face because I may not need to use the pedometer but may need a stopwatch. I am trying it later with the ambient mode off and the tilt to wake on so hopefully that will make it last even longer. Overall, great product for the FIRST day of having it. I will update any changes that occur.
