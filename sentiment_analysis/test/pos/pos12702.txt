Filters are great, but they came with smudges. Not a big deal, just not going to give 5 stars. Also the bags they come in are annoying and flimsy. Would prefer that they came in something hard, like the cases that snake river nd filters come in. They do make hard cases you can buy, but that's extra money. They should already come in hard cases for how expensive they are. That said, the filters themselves are great. No complaints there.
