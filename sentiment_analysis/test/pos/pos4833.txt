We get our milk from a local farm that sells it in quart jars.  These are the perfect solution to the messy drips that we were making.  The pop up part stays up when you pour.  It can handle the vigorous shaking necessary to mix the cream in, and it also has a little more space under it than a regular lid which helps with shaking up a full jar.  I had bought 2 so I could have a clean one ready when one needs to be washed, but I found a use for that second one right away (olive oil) so here I am buying 2 more!  It may seem silly but it's a simple little thing that is a pleasure to use every day.
