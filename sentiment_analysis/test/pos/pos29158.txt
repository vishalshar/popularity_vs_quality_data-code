I was really glad to find this vitamins for my daughter. she loves the taste and has no problem taking them.Unfortunately I came across an article about the organic brown rice syrup and was a litlle sad to see that is one of the other ingredients in this vitamins. This is the article https://www.myfruitsmax.com/when-organic-is-not-good-the-story-of-organic-brown-rice-syrup-issue-393/ . I wish that was not one of the ingredient in this vitamin. And also I have a question : Does anyone know what is the source of the gelatin used in this vitamins?
