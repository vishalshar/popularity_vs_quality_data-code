I read a lot reviews before purchasing this machine none that were very convincing . Truth is I had one similar to this one only older with the cone filters and much bulkier unit.  This one is much better and the reservoir does not leak!  There is a hole in the back of the machine. as long as you don't fill past the hole it will not leak.  I recommend this machine highly.
