This was a dud. Followed the directions to a T and got nothing. We tried re-soaking the block, breaking it up some and re-soaking, and eventually gave up after a month and a half with nothing to show.Edit: I was contacted by the folks at Back to the Roots and received a code for a free replacement. The second farm has yielded a decent bunch of mushrooms after about 3 weeks. Not a bad product product and pretty good customer service.
