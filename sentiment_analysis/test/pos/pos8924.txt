I've known about the Elvie for a while now, having seen an article on a random website at some point in the past. I thought it was a great idea, but I'm wayyyyyy too cheap to spend $200 on something I could theoretically do without spending anything at all. So I went with out. Until about three weeks ago when I had a big coughing fit and had to change my clothes from the waist down. Being only 35, my future flashed before my eyes and I realized I had two choices: get motivated to strengthen my pelvic floor or buy stock in Depends. I'm glad I went with option 1.The Elvie is easily one of the best things I've done for myself in a long time. I not only don't have an issue with bladder control, I've also found that sex is more enjoyable for both myself and my husband. The customizable workout schedule and reminder notifications are a nice touch. The storage container/charger is nice and discreet. It's comfortable to use and easy to clean.Of course, few products are perfect. I have problems with the Bluetooth connection getting lost in the middle of an exercise. It would be nice if the app were more robust (i.e. there is information in the package brochure that could easily be added to the app). I'd love to see a sort of "free play" option where you could try out different muscle groups without being in an actual exercise. The ability to pick the exercises you wanted to do would also be cool.
