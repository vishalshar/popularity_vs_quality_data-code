I purchased this sleep tracker mainly for the family features. I was very interested in learning about the sleep patterns for the 4 of us. At first I thought I'd have to hide the trackers from my kids, but after only a few days they now wake up and ask how their sleep (data) looks. Kind of funny to have this discussion with them but they've started to understand how sleep can be helpful. As any parent knows, getting your kids to "appreciate" sleep is a monumental struggle. My wife and I have also really enjoyed seeing the data and the fact that we don't have to wear anything on our wrists or heads to record it. Setup was quite easy and we're very happy with this product. Lastly, although we don't have any "smart lightbulbs" in the house, I'm now thinking of getting them based on the potential integration with the Sevenhugs sleep tracker.
