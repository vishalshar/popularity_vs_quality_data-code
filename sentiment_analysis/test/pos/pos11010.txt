This is an awesome product! So glad I found this before Christmas - it was the perfect gift for all the guys! Solves a major headache for travel, and I'll be using it for every trip now. Easy to pack, easy to use, and strong metal construction makes this a winner for me! The package comes with two sets, so it's easily one set I can leave in the closet and one with my luggage so that I'm never short collar stays. I've seen reviews discussing the issue with wearing them through airport security - it hasn't been an issue for me yet, but its no big deal for me to just take them out before I go through the detectors and toss them into my carry-on bag.I highly recommend this as an awesome gift idea for any guy who has to wear a suit or shirt and tie - makes like much easier, especially for a traveler!
