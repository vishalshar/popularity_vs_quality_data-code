I received a sample of this hand creme in an ipsy glam bag and LOVED IT!  I am a nurse and wash my hands constantly.  I need a hand creme that moisturizes and lasts through washing.  I'd say I reapply after about 3 washings.  The scent is mild and those that notice it comment on how nice it is.  I have never had a patient complain about the scent.  I love that it is not greasy and it keeps my hands feeling nice with no split knuckles or cuticles through our rough winters.  I have this on my subscription list, I love it that much!!
