This toy is awesome!!! Who doesnt want to own a drone they are a thing of the future :)My boys were so excited to open the box. They just couldnt wait! We had the drone up and running in about 5 minutes flat. Once I downloaded the app on my phone it was easy peasey lemon squeezey. My sons loved the experience and took turns. They loved the thrill of figuring things out and the fact that it was like a live video game. They asked to bring it to school to show their friends too.
