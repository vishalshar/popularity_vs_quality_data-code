Sounds amazing & is super-easy to setup. I've had issues with previous Bluetooth speakers before, where the computer and the audio device weren't connecting properly. The Libratone one comes online as soon as my laptop is on, and there is never any lag time or loss of audio quality.As far as the sound, the shift from other speakers I've used to this one is day and night. I can hear bass, drums, voice and about every other instrument as-if-on-its-own channel--which is probably the case, but I'm speaking here as a non-audio expert. Battery life is generous as well; thought I haven't timed it, it seems to last a couple of days without having to plug in.In addition, the downloadable app lets you control volume via phone, and also includes an equalizer option as well as preset radio stations plus a nifty battery charge meter.All in all, a fun and useful (and great sounding) speaker that's beautifully designed.
