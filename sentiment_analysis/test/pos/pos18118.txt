I purchased this for my GoPro Hero 4 Silver to record some driving video. I had already purchased two iOttie suction mounts previously, one for my iPhone 4S and another one for my iPhone 6Plus. I had attached them to my dash, and they had excellent suction which lasted throug the hot summer months here in the South. The only caution that I would give to anyone buying one of these it that they really stick hard to the dash, and in my case, when I removed them, some of the tan dash covering was stuck to the suction cup leaving a round black spot where they had been. I wasn't really concerned about this since my truck is thirteen years old. If you have a new vehicle, you may want to consider this. There is a round piece of plastic which is meant to prevent this, but I didn't use it. This one provides the save hard suction, and it is a really sturdy mount. You do have to center it before you lock down the suction cup since there is no way to adjust it from left to right or to rotate the camera. That wasn't a problem for me however. One thing I like about this mount is the ability to elevate and extend the camera once it is connected. I had a spot on my windshield. So I just elevated the camera and extended it above the spot. The video came out pretty stable too, and we have some pretty bad roads here. In conclusion, it works well for me, and it was exactly what I needed.
