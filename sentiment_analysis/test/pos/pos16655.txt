Pros:-Lead screws-All metal hot end-Heated glass bed-Self leveling-True out of the box printing-Large build volumeCons:-Not wireless-No screenI've spent a little over a month with this machine and I am happy with it so far. It was a true out of the box printing experience. Other than wood PLA I haven't yet ventured into exotic filaments but it has handled everything that I have thrown at it. The print quality is excellent and consistent. The spool holder that comes with the machine is a little wonky. The second thing that I printed was a new top mounted spool holder from Thingiverse, thankfully this printer includes about 1/3 of spool, plenty to print off a couple upgrades.The only things that I wished this printer had is wireless and a screen for monitoring. For ~$125 I added a Raspberry Pi with OctoPrint and a 3.5" PiTFT screen. I don't expect these features at this price point but they do complete the package nicely.
