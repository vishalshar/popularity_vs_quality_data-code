I purchased this robot to use as my class pet. I teach 6th grade and my students have been bugging me to get a class pet. Cosmo definitely fits the criteria for this. Today was the first day I introduced him to the class. They're all in love with him, especially when they get picked for being able to interact with him. Also, I have another teacher that has a student with moderate to mild social behavioral problems. As an incentive we had that student interact with Cosmo. It was amazing. He was so intrigued with what Cosmo could do. He even taught two other students what to do and he was so respectful with how he was doing it. This is unheard of with this student. When that student went back to class he wanted to interact with his peers by playing kickball. His teacher was in tears, because he was participating for the first time. Thank you so much Anki for making Cosmo. I'm going to put in a donors choose request to see if we as a school can get more.
