I cannot believe how my 9-year-old nephew and 6-year-old son took to this game! Granted, they both like math and used calculators to figure some of it out, but it was not frustrating at all. They were learning strategies in no time and really had a grasp of what they were doing by the second time playing. (Note: they played this FOUR times in a row in the first sitting alone!)
