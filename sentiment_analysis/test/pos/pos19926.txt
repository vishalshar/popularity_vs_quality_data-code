Good, fun compact camera.Lytro servrcie on the other hand, is VERY poor.The screen protecting gladd shattered and when I contacted them for help they told me that on top of the cost of repair I hade to pay a $165 fee for them to take it and the $50-$60 that it will take me to ship it to them, which ends up being more than what I originally payed for this camera. AWEFUL. Take care of it like if it was made of diamonds.
