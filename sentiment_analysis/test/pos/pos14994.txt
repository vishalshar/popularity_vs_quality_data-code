As I use Lamas lash tint, and now the Intensive Repair Hand Cream, I decided to try this pumpkin facial scrub. I was very happily surprised to apply this in the shower, and the first thing I noticed was a nice scent with a touch of vanilla. The texture is perfect to actually exfoliate. And I was glad it did not contain menthol and ingredients that tend to make me feel uncomfortable cold. I have been trying different scrubs in an attempt to replace one from an expensive premium line, and this one is it. I had already tried 5 or 6 others from stores, but the granules didn't feel as if they were doing anything. And, one I liked, but the menthol made me very uncomfortable. I am in my 50's, fair skin. Although my skin is sensitive, due to my own unique issues, I must scrub often or my skin becomes itchy and unmanageable. So this is my new replacement scrub and it costs much less than my old favorite.
