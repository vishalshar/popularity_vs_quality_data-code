I can't say enough wonderful things about these. Honestly, I ordered them because I loathe tying shoes but I love tennis shoes. I ordered the neon pink for myself, but after configuring them based on their website instructions for different fit, I ended up with enough extra to do a pair of my six and eight year old girls' shoes as well. So I ordered more. And that's when I put some on my 9 year old son's shoes. He has always had issues tying his shoes. He gets very frustrated and down on himself because he thinks he is just unable to figure it out. So we have a pair of tennis shoes with laces that he still wears a few times a week, but hickies in the other, in a combo of green and red, his favorite colors. The first thing he said to me was "now the other kids won't make fun of me when I have to keep tying my shoes." And that to me is worth just about any price. Our entire family now has at least one pair of shoes with hickies "laces" including my mom, sister, and husband (who uses them in his cross training shoes). I'm a fan and definitely recommend that if you're interested in them enough to be reading reviews, that you take the plunge and order a color to try out. Hopefully you'll be as impressed as I am.
