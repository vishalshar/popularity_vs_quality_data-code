Because I am eating gluten free right now, I am always looking for treats to eat.  Cookies are my favorite.  A flight attendant on American Airlines gave them to me for a snack when I asked if there was anything gluten free.  They are divine!  Had to order some.  Amazon carries them.  They are too hard to find at my local grocery.
