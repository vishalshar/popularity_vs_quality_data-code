From a person who suffered through the first generation smart lights (not Lutron), I can honestly tell you this product is lightyears ahead of it's predecessors.  The key difference here is - without wifi they it still functions like a normal switch.  The first generation felt "gimmicky" and wasn't very practical.  For a while there, I felt like the smart lighting industry was dying just like the 3D Television did....Then Lutron released the Caseta.Finally a smart light system with smart switches instead of smart bulbs!  Just the switches and hub alone are incredible.  Then add the Pico remote.  At first, I didn't think I would need them.  Then I realized I could purchase the wall adapters which gave me a wireless 3-way system which I could install in less than 5 minutes!I love the feature where you can set up a lighting schedule based on sunrise / sunset.  The geofencing feature works great as well.  Would highly recommend this product and I plan to continue adding more to my "switch arsenal".
