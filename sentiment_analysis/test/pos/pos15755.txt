I've used another brand and had non stop problem with communication issues.  Watt Vision was super easy to install - took 10 minutes to do.  I had data on their website in minutes.  Already found 1 wall wart (home alarm) that was drawing excessive power - replaced the power pack and dropped 25 watts on one device.  My only complaint is the cost of the monthly service if you want data retained longer than 30 days.  Otherwise, works just as advertised.
