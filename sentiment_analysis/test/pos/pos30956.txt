Bose quality sound for less than half the price. I wanted a portable speaker with good quality sound but I soon discovered you get what you pay for. I decided to spend a little more money and got the Libratone One click. Im super happy with it! It has a big speaker sound for a portable speaker. The surround sound fills the room. The app is handy with features to help calibrate surround sound levels to my preference and easy to use! Surprisingly this speaker has REALLY GOOD BASS. It has a deep, warm, rich, solid bass tone! You gotta have BASS! I dig it!The packaging feels quality though made of paper so recyclable better for the environment. Overall, I love the design.The only thing I was having trouble with was I couldnt figure out how to attach the handle and I couldnt find a video on how to put the handle on.
