Really good camera, video quality is great.Its really easy to setup and the app/website are user friendly, easy to use and sleek.The only complaint I have is that its integrated with the app and website. It records short clips of every movement -- which is nice, but I wish you could delete them and manage them. It seems like they are kept there forever.
