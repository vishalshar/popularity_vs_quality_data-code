First time using Mionix and they may have found themselves a lifer. This mouse is extremely comfortable, tracking is excellent, and the software is very functional. I am by no means an expert when it comes to mice but I have owned a few Corsair ones as well as Logitech but this Mionix is by far my favorite. If you want a comfortable well made mouse then look no further. Mionix has done a stellar job with this one.
