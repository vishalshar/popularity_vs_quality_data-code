Excellent extra storage for my macbook pro 13 inch retina with SSD, since the internal storage is extremely small. However it's a new design for removal which is suppose to make it easier and doesn't require any tools like the old thrifty minidrive which comes with a hook for removal, I find that it is still extremely hard to remove without a tool, almost impossible so I wish it came with a tool like the old designs.
