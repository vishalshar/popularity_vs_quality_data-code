WUJU is without a doubt the best hot sauce I've ever had. I was very intrigued when I learned of the product and saw that it was a different take on the traditional hot sauce that is on the market. And I was extremely pleased when I finally got the opportunity to taste this product. It is very versatile, and can be used in so many ways whether you are eating or cooking. I use it as a condiment, but I love it even more when I'm baking or broiling chicken and use it as a marinade. When all those delicious spices get cooked into the chicken like that, it tastes so delicious. For anyone who is a true food lover or has a passion for cooking, this is the perfect product to spice things up and make you fall in love with hot sauce all over again!
