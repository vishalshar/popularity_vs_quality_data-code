This toy is much appreciated by the cat who uses it.  The Frolicat is very easy to use: just load the batteries, push the power button, and it runs for 15 minutes.  You can adjust the mirror to change the range of the light play.  You can't change the speed at which the light moves.  When I ordered this toy, I looked for information about batteries--what size, how many, and whether they were included.  I did not find this information, and when I got my order, I was dismayed to find that the 4 AA batteries required by the toy were not included. If I had known I would have ordered a pac with the toy.
