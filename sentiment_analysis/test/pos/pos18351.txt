A very simple but creative toy!  After opening the box with my twin 4-year-olds we started to create some of the example builds that were featured on the box.  Within minutes their imagination was triggered and they started building their own models of ice cream cones, coconut trees, and other favorite objects.The pieces are thick and sturdy and they fit very snug so that the model stays together when the child wants to run around and play with it.  I also love that the product is made of recycled/recyclable material and is made here in the USA (in my home state of MN nonetheless).I'm very happy with the possibilities with this 60-piece set, but I wish I had paid a little more and gotten the 120-piece set.
