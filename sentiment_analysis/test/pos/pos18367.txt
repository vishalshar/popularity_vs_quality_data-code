LOVE THIS KEY ORGANIZER SOLUTION!  Much more comfortable in the pocket than any of the other new companies offering metal key organizers (which may look nice, but which are a pain -- literally and figuratively).  Limit of just 3 keys is a little disappointing, but it forces me to keep irrelevant keys off my key ring and in a drawer where they belong!).  Still would be nice to add one more key (maybe have an optional longer connecting screw?), but it's not enough of a problem for me to lower my rating.  I may "upgrade" to the stitched leather version soon as a present to myself :)
