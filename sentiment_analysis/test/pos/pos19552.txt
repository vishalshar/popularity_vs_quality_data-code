This pillow arrived in a VERY , VERY FLATTENED STATE!! LOL!!  It had no chemical smells, and it took less than 6 hours for me, with the aide of a teenager (who found it fun) for us to refluff thus pillow!!  It is snuggly soft and sleeps as well as my previous pillow of which I paid over $90 for.. The big name brand one...  On the 3rd night of this pillow and I am very pleased with how it feels now. Actually, close to the big name brand one!! Am very happy with my purchase, just have to fight for it from my teenage son, and the 65 lb Standard Poodle who believes that she is small enough to fit.Re: some reported chemical smells, I have not experienced thus and will be back to replace if it looses too much loft!!
