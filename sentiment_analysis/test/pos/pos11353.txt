I used these in a pair of Tod's driving shoes that were a little loose. I left in the original insoles and now they're a little snug but comfortable. These make bare feet feel awesome. They somehow keep feet feeling dryer and cooler. They're pricey but they'll extend the life of expensive sockless shoes and feel fantastic. Check them out.
