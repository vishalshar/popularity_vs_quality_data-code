Fun toy, got it for my 6 year old for his birthday and all the kids there FREAKED OUT when they saw it.  Mine strangely shipped with no big white remote control which was a buzz kill at first, used the the app remote with an iPhone which is pretty average at best ... reception was not great with mine.  I went to the WowWee site and filed a support request with them, after posting my invoice from Amazon they shipped me a remote in pretty timely fashion, so 5 stars for their support for sure.
