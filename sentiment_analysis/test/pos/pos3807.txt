Its OK.  My only complaint is that the field is not round and seems to fluctuate greatly (5-10ft or 2-3m) on a daily basis, however my toy poodle figured it out very quickly and now won't leave the yard, even without the collar on (unless she is on the lead and then she knows we are off for a walk).  For the past few weeks we haven't even turned the box on, we just put the collar on the dog and let her out!  We started with the shock on 2 and she didn't feel it (neither did I when I tried to shock myself), so we upped it to 3.  As far as we can tell she has gotten shocked twice.  She reacted like she'd been stung by a bee.  Because I followed the instructions and taught her to come back into the yard when she heard the beeping, she ran back into the yard immediately.  All in all I am very happy with the product and the results.
