I bought the Whistle GPS pet tracker for our dog Boomer and our recent family trip.  Boomer has a bad habit of taking off when something of interest catches his attention.  The setup was simple and straight forward, only took about 10 mins. The Whistle device attached to his collar without issue and did not seem to be noticed by Boomer.  Now Boomer is a big dog, close to 75 lbs, so I could see where this device may be too big for a smaller dog.  Once we got to our location I setup the based and put a geofence around the new location.  All of which can be done from your phone or the Whistle website.  The device worked without issue, notifying me if Boomer went outside geofenced area.  Notification seems to depend on cell service in that area but for us cell service was good so we received timely notifications.  Overall I think the Whistle is the a good product that does what it is suppose to do. I will update this review in 6 months with how it did over a extended period of time.
