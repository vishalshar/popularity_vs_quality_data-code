For anyone who enjoys and appreciates fine cheese, this product is an absolute necessity.  WIth local cheese shops unable or unwilling to sell their storage paper, I resorted to the storage method recommended by America's Test Kitchen:  parchment paper enveloped loosely with aluminum foil. While this method works better than plastic wrap, it still allowed the cheese to dry a little too quickly. The cheese paper eliminates this problem entirely.  It absolutely matches the product(s) used by the professionals.  I am so enamored by this product, it is now replacing the standard bottle of wine used as a host/hostess gift!  It's a hit with everyone!!
