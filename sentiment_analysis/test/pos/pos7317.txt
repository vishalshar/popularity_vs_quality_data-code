I have two elementary/preschool boys and the fight over who gets to take Omie to school. Guess I have to invest in a second one! Very convenient and gets them to eat more before running off to the playground. Cause they don't have time for wrappers etc. Nice and neat, proportionate sized snacks and all in one spot. Super sturdy and easy to clean. Great quality!
