I am giving Singlecue 5 stars because I love the idea and I think we all understand as early adopters there are going to be missing features and some bugs that will need to be ironed out overtime.I have had it up and running for about 1 day but am still learning how the gestures work. The biggest problem I am having right now is controlling the set top cable box. While it "works" for basic functions like setting / changing favorites, increasing and lowering volume, I for the life of me cannot get it to mute audio when I give it the "hush" gesture. I have Time Warner Cable so the only way to configure the cable box was by using "Arris" which is the manufacture of the box. While the front of the box reads model "DCXxxxxx" it will not work when I select that option. I have to chose IPC Series Video Client and I get the basic functions as mentioned. I am not sure if this is why the "hush/mute" gesture is not working, its quite frustrating as this is one of the most used gestures I can see us using in our configuration.List of features I would like to see added in the near term would be as follow, some of these are shown in the product demo video so I was surprised they are not already available.Features------------1. Nest Product Line Integration2. Chromecast Support3 SmartThings Integration this would be HUGE for me as we are 100% smartthings.4. Low light improvements, I understand a recent software update address some low light problems but I think there is still room for improvement.5. App disconnects when left open and then prompts you to "re-configure" when all I do is actually "close" the app (iOS) and relaunch it and it sees singlecue again.6. While it sees my finger gesture my 7 year old who has smaller fingers cannot get the thing to read her gestures at all. This is a big source of frustration for her because she loves the idea and wants to be part of "showing it off" and using it.Support Related-----------------------1. Blog. Maybe one exists I could not find anything other than the support FAQ's2. More Video's on how to use. Seems the 2 videos the app has are hidden on YouTube and you cannot access them once you have seen them during the setup.3. Community Forum - Sometimes the best people to help people are the people using the device! (yes people)4. Roadmap of features / enhancements, being in sales I know how important it is for customers to know what is coming and when.I'll try and update and I get more time with it but in summary, If you are an early adopter and can deal with the pains and missing features I would certainly recommend this unit it has the "cool" factor. I am not sure this is for everyone yet, I cannot see my parents or in-laws using this as it will drive them bonkers until it is much more polished.Hope this helps any future buyers.
