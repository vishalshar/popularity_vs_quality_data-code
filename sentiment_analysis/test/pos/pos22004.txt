I'm in a 1200 sq ft apartment and have FiOS coming into my bedroom closet in a far corner of the apartment. With no ethernet run, my connection to the FiOS ONT is literally limited to the closet. I had an ASUS RT-AC68U that could reach to the living room but was constantly being overrun by idiot neighbors whose hardware was set to automatically select a channel. Every time I would tweak my 5GHz to a channel with less interference, my neighbors' hardware would select my channel and render my Wi-Fi unusable. In addition, my 2.4GHz signal wouldn't reach to my patio, where a HomeKit switch exists. I knew I had two problems I needed to fix:1. I needed hardware that could use DFS channels. None of my neighbors have any 5GHz hardware on these channels, and Portal is the only router that can automatically switch channels when radar interferes with the channel you're on.2. I needed hardware that would extend range throughout the apartment, with my hands tied to poor placement.I purchased a single Portal and after a week's use, I was very happy. The device itself popped onto 5GHz channel 100 and as far as I can tell, I've seen no radar interference. And I have had no problems with my neighbors whatsoever. Performance in the living room on 5GHz is ~80mbps, which is almost double what I had with the ASUS. Overall, this fixed issue #1 above, but I was still seeing speeds in my Living Room slower than my FiOS connection, and 2.4GHz still couldn't reach to my patio.Portal provided me a 2nd router for free to test their new Mesh 2.0 feature. Setup wasn't painful, however I had to quit the app and restart the 2nd Portal a few times in order to get it setup. I've seen Portal update their iOS app twice within the last few days to fix issues related to Mesh setup, so I doubt you'll run through the issues I had. I threw the 2nd unit on my wife's desk in the den, and boom... my Wi-Fi is PERFECT!!! I am seeing ~320mbps consistently on 5GHz in the living room, and more than decent speeds on 2.4GHz from the patio.Overall, I'm extremely happy with Portal. For the first time in a long time, I have ZERO Wi-Fi ISSUES!
