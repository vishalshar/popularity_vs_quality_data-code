These cards are a very helpful educational tool for all ages.  I love the vibrant colors.  The alphabet letters are big and an excellent visual aid.  I played the color and number matching games with my grandkids. These cards are great to play with the kids, because we could play games together - and it wasn't an app - so we had a lot of interaction with each other.  I am learning STEM, computer science and binary numbers right along with the grandkids.  I highly recommend this product for families.Â Giggle Chips STEM Toys + Games ABC Computer Science Game Cards
