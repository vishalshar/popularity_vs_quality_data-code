Great price. As of this review I've ordered 2 spools (White and Orange) and my wife ordered 3 spools for my birthday (Grey, White and Orange) of AIO Robotics PLA 1.75 filament. I'm am 3d printing on a Monoprice Select Maker and the M3D Micro. I haven't had any noticeable problems with any of the filament. The diameter consistency is good.
