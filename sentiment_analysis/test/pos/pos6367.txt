The first unit arrived minus the actual bracket - the package appeared to be re-taped and likely a previous return.  I had the complete system resolved within a couple days. I am satisfied with the fit of the phone case, the bracket seems nice a rugged/sturdy enough to handle the jolts from pavement and highway surfaces.  I do have one criticism, and this might be just a 6+ issue.  the mount arm is not long enough given the length (height) of the iPhone.  The result is that it limits the variety of angles and positions available to mount your phone.  In my case, I already have a coffee cup bracket mounted on my left handle bar.  Since most bikes have a front disc brake, that cabling usually limits mounting anything on the right side of the handle bar.  So, so are left to crowd the left side up and, given my previously mentioned 6+ issue, you have only a few ways to position your phone to be able to see it at all. On my Harley bagger - I didn't want to block the fuel gauge, so the phone has to stand quite tall to be seen - any other position would block the gauge or "hang-up" on the clamp and make it impossible to attach the phone or remove it. If the bracket arm was 1/2 to 3/4" taller - it would allow more positions for mounting.
