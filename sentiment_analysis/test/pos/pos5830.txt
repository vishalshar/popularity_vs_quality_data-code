The taste is better than Stevia in baking - no bitter or chemical aftertaste.  However, I still found my digestive system to be sensitive to both this and Stevia.  Not nearly as much as white sugar, Splenda, or Aspartame, but I still get tummy gurgles and stuff.Overall, I recommend this product because of the many great things I've read about it in my research of food and how it affects the body.  The taste is good, and the problems are minimal.  My end theory is that our bodies don't tolerate most sweeteners/sugars very well and that consumption of them should be only very occasional and in small, healthy amounts (not what I've typically done in my life).PROS:- not so hurtful to your body and metabolism overall- taste is the best out of all the sugar substitute options- highly recommended by nutritional experts as the best sugar substituteCONS:- still can cause slight problems to digestive system- grains are large, so they don't dissolve well in all recipes (like meringue), leaving some with a sugary crunch- the cost is crazy!  This bag is pretty small - better prices can be found in organic food stores
