I bought two of these cases for my 8 yr. old and 6 yr. old to use for their new iPad Mini 2's; I got a pink one and a blue one. They love them!  They especially love the carrying handle.  The iPads replaced their Kindles and it was difficult for me to get them to keep the cases on the Kindles but these cases are fun and they love the way they feel in the hand.  I'm very happy with my purchases, so far.  I think the cases will really protect the iPads. It does NOT come with a screen protector, so I may look into purchasing one.
