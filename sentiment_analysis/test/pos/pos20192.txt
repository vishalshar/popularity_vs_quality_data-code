It's so easy to use that this product is great for everyone.  I bought this originally for my husband to use on his car that he is always cleaning.  Thought it would be a great way to clean the wheels which are always tough to get easily cleaned.  The Brush Hero worked amazingly well for that.  However, I also found it was an ideal way to clean our garden furniture - so much more effective that just hosing off and so much less painful than scrubbing with a bucket and brush.  Definitely made my day!
