Never a bad thing to know what your BAC is, especially on  a night out.  Don't know how it compares to a police one, but it does show different readings, it doesn't come up with always the "same" BAC if that makes sense.  I like that it is small, I keep it in a small little zipper case in my purse.  Used a sharpie to put marking on for my husband and I plastic piece, gave friends their own.  never have had an issue with the app not coming up or working.
