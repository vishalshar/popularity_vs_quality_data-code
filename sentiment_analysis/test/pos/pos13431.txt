This as a gift for my dog and robot-loving 6 year old -- and she loves it.  Does it do exactly what it seems like it will do in the ad (such as work as an alarm??)? Absolutely not.  Is it still pretty cool? Some have complained that it doesn't recognize their children's voices (you have to say "Hey Chip!" to get the sound-activation to work).  Just use the app - there is a feature that lets you change the sound of the voice and the words you say and the robot will recognize whatever you record as the magic words.  The ball doesn't work all the time, but when it does, it's pretty cool.  And the "yoga" trick is awesome.  My 1 year old loves this too.  I wouldn't buy it for a kid much older than 6 or 7 though.  I think that's the right age.
