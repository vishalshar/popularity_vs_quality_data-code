OMG where have these been all my life? Seriously? I bought theses and have waiting to do a review till I can fully use them for awhile. They work awesome and are a good snug fit but not tight on my feet. You can take some out and leave some in or all. Easy to install in your shoes too. They have a ton of colors to choose from which is really nice to have for variety. Next buy is for the kids.
