When my phone is in my purse, I usually don't hear it. I clip the ditto on before I leave every morning, and I never miss a call or text (unless I want to).This thing is a relationship saver. If I'm out late with friends or working late, I tend to lose track of time, and my BF often calls or texts to make sure I'm OK. Before the ditto, I'd miss it, causing him to think I was lying unconscious in a ditch somewhere or had run off with the circus. Now he knows I'm alive and well and just as acrobatically challenged as ever and just didn't realize how late it was.App is easy to use, and the product itself is reliable. Also, customer service is great - I called about some weird thing and got a regular person on the phone right away. Neal was friendly and was somehow able to understand what I was trying to explain, and he went out of his way to resolve the issue without any hassle on my end.
