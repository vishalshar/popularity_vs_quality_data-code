I LOVE these apple chips!  I started eating the bulk Bare Naked Apple chips.  I loved those!  Then I ran out and came back to Amazon to buy more.  They were out of the bulk so I bought these instead.  A little different apple, but with cinnamon - which I love!  I got them and tried them right away.  Totally fell in love with them.  Not only are they organic, but there are only 2 ingredients - organic apples, organic cinnamon!  No preservatives!  A whole 2.6 oz bag is only 2 Weight Watchers points.  There are 4 apples per bag.  Great low calorie, low sodium snack!  Great for kids, dieters, or just anyone who loves a good tasty snack!  You will not be disappointed!
