These do a great job of keeping newer style EarPod phones in place. The phones are secured both by the increased friction of the silicon rubber and the triangle part that locks into the fold of your ear. There are two sizes of "hook" in the pack. Three would be better, but two is still probably enough. I find the large ones a little large, and the small ones a little small for best comfort, but both sizes still work fine.The positioning of the phones is good and allows decent sound quality to be delivered. The hooks fit on the phones well enough and overall you get a secure fit and little to no chance of the phones falling out. OTOH they take longer to put in. Though you get used to this, grabbing the phones to jam in your ear in a hurry (say answering a call) is a bit awkward.The advantage of this design is it doesn't trouble you if you wear glasses or hats or anything else that some headphone designs or securing mechanisms don't agree with. It makes the otherwise useless Apple EarPods into a good pair of phones. Definitely recommended.
