This is economical and works very well for my uses as a building design engineer. I like the ability to do a split screen video panoramic with half of the screen showing a camera image and half showing the IR temperature. Also, it has no batteries so it is never dead when I need to used it. It is VERY small and comes with a very protective (and small) case that takes up very little room in my briefcase.
