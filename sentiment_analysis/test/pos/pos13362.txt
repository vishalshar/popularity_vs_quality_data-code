For anyone with an iPhone 4 or 4S this is an awesome way to document your adventures.  The wide-angle lens that comes with the case is essential.  Too bad they don't still make these for other iPhones.  The harness is stretchy, adjustable and very comfortable.  The phone is held very solidly in the harness and it's easy to get it in and out.  I also love the safety leash to prevent an accidental drop of the phone.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone with the right phone.
