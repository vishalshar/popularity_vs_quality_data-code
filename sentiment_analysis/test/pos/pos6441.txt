Had to return the medium and get the medium/large size because the part around the chest was not big enough and not giving enough of a squeeze. The instructions for the harness installation tells you to make sure it's a T-fit, instead of a Y-fit when you look at the harness on the side of the dog. It's very easy to put on once you've got the fit set up. I have noticed that the harness threatens to slip off if the dog is lavishly rolling on her back on the grass and I'm gently trying to pull her along back to the walk. That happened just once. Overall, the harness has made our walks so much calmer and my 9-year-old has no problem taking our once-headstrong puppy on enjoyable, relaxing strolls.
