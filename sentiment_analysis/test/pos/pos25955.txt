Fantastic first outing for anki! Love Cosmo, he's super expressive and fun to play with. Also the way Cosmo comes boxed is amazing. Anki seems to have given every aspect a lot of thought and spared no expense in creating an amazing product. That being said another reviewer really hit the nail on the head. Cosmo is awesome but he requires a phone to function. While it's fine in the beginning it does get kind of old having to get your phone and open the app to play with him. There's a few things I would love to see in version 2.0. First I would love it if they could find a way to make Cosmo completely autonomous. Possibly interacting with him through touch commands on his cube or something more brilliant rather than being tethered to a phone. Also it'd be awesome if they could improve his fall avoidance and possibly give him the ability to find his charger and charge himself. I would love to be able to just switch him on and let him play and wander the table until he gets tired and returns to his charger then wakes to play when he's charged again. Thanks anki for making such a great product! I'll be checking back often and I look forward to Cosmo 2.0.
