I just received my RIF6 Cube, a fast delivery and nice packaging already set this purchase off with a bang. Once I open the packagei noticed it does contain alot of different cables, one which is used for HDMI connection which is awesome. I connected it to my PS4 to it and played with it outside... Too cool. Very easy setup, but I would say that the audio this cube brings is not best for outside use since it doesn't project. I connected my ps4 to my external speaker so it's all good... Picture quality is great, you do get a nice HD quality especially when you see it at 90"+.  It comes with a micro-usb cable for the Android users but it does not come with lighting cable. So for the iPhone users we have to buy a lightning to av adapter which is an extra $50... Awesome ...ehh...  But an extra 50 bux so I can have the power to project anything on my iPhone at my beck and call totally worth it...Overall I love the purchase I can hang out outside and still stream videos. Once you have an external audio speaker it's perfect for any outside event. Wish it had an USB port or came with a lightning cable for iPhones but other than that it's a great purchase especially for the price....
