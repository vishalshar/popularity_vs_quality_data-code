They are a little tricky to slip on the earbuds because they're form fitting but once on they're awesome.  I put them in and they lock the earbuds in place. I shook my head vigorously to see if I could dislodge them but they stay put. I like my earbud's sound and the hooks fixed the one issue I had with them.
