Fun little magnet set. Good for keeping kids occupied on trips or for short times at home. One complaint is that the size of the magnets is a little strange compared to the size of the pictures on the board. Things are at a bit of an odd scale, but then again, I'm not sure that would bother the target audience, young children, as much as it does me. Magnets attach firmly to the board, so it works as it should.
