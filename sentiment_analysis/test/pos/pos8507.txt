I believe that activity trackers have a major impact on how motivated we are to remain active and get a good nights sleep. What gets measured gets managed applies very much in this case. I have, however, shied away from trackers like the fitbit because of how they look. I don't like to wear much on my arms so when I do I want to make a choice based on that thing being something that I really like. I wear a nice watch for that reason. The Amazfit fills this roll perfectly. It looks great and does exactly what I want it to do.Design- Beautiful and does not look like a fitness tracker. Even using the Sport Wristband still looks good. I get compliments on it from people I meet.- Comfortable. The standard band to some getting used to but I really like it now and the Sport band works for any situation.- Seems indestructible. My 18 month old daughter takes it and drops it or bangs it on the floor and it looks and works just fine.App- Is easy to use and tracks the main things I want to track - activity and sleepImprovements- The initial sync seems more complicated than it should be.- I would like an alarm feature which I think others have pointed out.Overall this is a great product.
