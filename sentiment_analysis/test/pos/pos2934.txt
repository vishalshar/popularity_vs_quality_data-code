I love the fact that I can see my baby any time I want, I work long hours and to have the option of speaking to him is great. and have taken some pictures of him, I love that and he absolutely loves the treat that come out. The only problem I have is that there is a delay of between 5-10 second. But with all the other options, I can live with the delay, I recommended this product  to my friends and I know that at least 3 others will be buying it.
