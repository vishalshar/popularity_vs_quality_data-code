It's a nice accessory. My biggest complaint is the size. I knew it would be big, but I find that it's really pretty huge. I understand the reasons why, but the circumference is making it difficult to find a good fitting strap to hang any keys or other items from. So while I give this 5 stars, be aware that it has it's limitations - mainly that you have limited distance from USB port to device. You have to have your USB port near a desk or table , or be prepared to get clever with some way to prop it up (e.g. if you want to use a USB wall charger that isn't close to any furniture.)Clip is strong, and feels like it should hold with no worries.
