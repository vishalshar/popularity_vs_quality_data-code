I was really impressed with this product for several reasons. The quality of the packaging is exceptional. I like that they include the optimal temperature to print their filament on the spool. Also the spool comes in an airtight sealed bag that you can reuse to store your filament when you aren't printing. No more buying huge ziplock bags to store filament. I print a lot of stuff, but the 1kg spools just take up too much room. The size of this spool is perfect.The filament melts perfectly and prints as smooth as butter. The adhesion was great. I never had any issues with the filament tangling and I went through the entire spool. The filament never clogged my nozzle either. That has happened with literally every brand I've used, but not AIO's. I am extremely satisfied and will only be buying AIO filament from now on.
