I've traveled quite a bit, and always find it to be a hassle (if not a rip-off) buying SIM-cards for use overseas.. roaming charges just aren't going down anytime soon. Came across this nifty little gadget and decided to give it a try before my trip to England. Buying it of course was easy enough.. not so easy was purchasing a package then verifying it afterwards. Took a bit of back and forth with customer support to figure out why my balance was 0.00mb when it should've shown 1024mb (~$30, very reasonable) -- turns out the device won't activate and reflect these changes until you're at your destination. Fine by me, and it worked as support described. Depending where you are, it can be tedious getting a decent signal, but what can you do? That's with any phone really.. One thing I didn't like, aside from the size (imagine a double-thick iPod classic -- practically a little brick that constantly got hot to the touch) is the battery life. It was charged consistently, and yet one day it would last and last.. and the next it would drain before the day was half over. My only complaint. Past all that, can't wait to use it abroad again.
