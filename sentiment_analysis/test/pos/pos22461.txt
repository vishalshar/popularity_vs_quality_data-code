I purchased these after seeing the packaging featured in a design contest.  Also, my one beagle's name is Buckley, so I sort of had to.Both of my beagles loved them.  They break apart fairly easily so I can give small treats to them when needed.  Also, they don't contain grains (bad for dogs) so I was happy.My only complaint is I found them to be expensive compared to other dog treat brands.
