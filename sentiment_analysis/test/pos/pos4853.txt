I purchased my Spire about a month ago to help me determine times of tension and remind me to take a mini-meditation break during these times. It works perfectly for this purpose. It has helped me to determine situations that cause tension that I would not have otherwise considered stressful and be more prepared for those situations.I wish I could turn off the tracking steps function as I don't want another device nagging me about exercise. I've also noticed that Spire has some difficulty determining between tension and exercise.I like the short "boosts" these are the perfect small breaks I need to decrease the tension in my body.
