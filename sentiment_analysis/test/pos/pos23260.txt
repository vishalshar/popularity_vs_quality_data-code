I used the glue to create tablet holder hooks for my surface pro 4 in my exercise room and in the kitchen to stream videos and movies while working out or cooking.  First I placed 3 nails in the wall as a stable foundation for the glue. Then I planted the glue on the hooks and molded them into hook shapes. Next morning the glue had solidified and now I can slide my tablet in with ease in either room as I do my activities. Check out the picks.  The glue works!!!
