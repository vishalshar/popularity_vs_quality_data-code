My children love this. I only wish it had a rechargeable battery as they through the batteries in only one day. We did end up buying some rechargeable batteries for it, but we have to take them out, put them in the charger, wait on them to charge, then put them back every.single.day.It really needs to be a plug in charge.If it had this feature, I would give it 5 stars.
