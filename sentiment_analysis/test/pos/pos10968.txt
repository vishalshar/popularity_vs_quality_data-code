I wanted to try a activity band without spending the money before trying at least once. This was a great value and the band works well. I downloaded the app and haven't had any glitching and the band seems to be accurate when counting steps. I would definitely recommend to someone who is interested in using an activity Fitness band but not quite ready to invest in more popular products.
