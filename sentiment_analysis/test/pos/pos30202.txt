I was worried Ollie would be too technical/complicated for my 6 year old - but I was wrong. She loves it and after 2 days with it she's a trick master. I'm not sure if she or her dad like it more though. The app is very easy to use - and we have used both our Samsung galaxy and the iPhone with equal success.Ollie is cool, lights up, fast, spins, does tricks - and it isn't fragile.  5 stars from the whole family.
