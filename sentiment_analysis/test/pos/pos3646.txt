Compact, the paper doesn't bleed with gel ink pens, and it feels really nice to write on. The pages aren't falling out, and the cover is still intact, despite throwing this book in my bag everywhere I go. I wish it was a tiny bit bigger for more writing surface area, but the price is unbeatable for a "Moleskine" type notebook.
