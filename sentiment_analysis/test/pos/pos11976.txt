I love it!  Its great!  I always look for xylitol that is made from pure birch, not the cheap corn xylitol they pass of as being good.  Corn is a dangerous product and is added to many foods in the form of corn syrup, and now they are making xylitol from it.  Corn is universally infested with mycotoxins (fungi) and is GMO, with poisons built into the kernals to keep bugs from eating it.  I once loved corn but will never eat it or products made from corn again.  This Pure Birch Xylitol suites me to a tee!
