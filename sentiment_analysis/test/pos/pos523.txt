Some of the reviews had me worried, but I was so fed up with Samsung's Note edge (it was turning off with 70% or more battery left. Battery was replaced, as was phone, but it kept happening. Nothing worked, tech was no help) that I had to get an affordable and effective phone that wasn't too different from the phone I had. This thing is amazing. Got it in the mail 5 hours ago and it is SO customizable, holy crumbs! It's a huge improvemnt from Samsung. I'm going to stay away from the big brands from now on.
