Loving this soap!  It arrived quickly and nicely packaged.  I ordered one for each shower in our house.  I did not notice that it had any type of "scent".  We have very sensitive skin and had been using a basic ivory soap, but that would leave your skin feeling dry.  This works great.  Even using it on my face does not leaving me with that dry, tight feeling.  Your skin feels nice and clean.  And I have even noticed that it keeps you smelling fresh even after a tough workout.  I also do not feel the need to use lotion as much after using this soap.  My teenage daughter is also using this soap, we have not had a long enough time to see if it will help out with her acne, but so far she is liking it overall.  Will definitely order again and will highly recommend to family and friends...may be a great additional to gift baskets!
