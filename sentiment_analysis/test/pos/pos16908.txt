I have very small ears. Not point and laugh or traveling freak show small but when I mention it to people they look and say wow!No ear anything has ever stayed in my ears.  One size fits most - means not me.  I've tried them all.  Behind the head. Over the ear. Even those that come in multiple sizes. I recently took up running again and since the EarPods that come with my phone won't even stay in long enough to walk the dog on a cold day ( that means out to do business then we both go back in), I wear giant can type headphones.  It's less than ideal and they get sopping wet.  Also, they do not work for yoga.  Downward dog means downward to the ground headphones.So I really wanted these to work. And they did.  Make sure to put them in correctly so the point top is points up into the top of the ear.  I ran 3 miles sweating and they stayed in.  They even work for downward dog but if I get too sweaty it will fall out occasionally. But not every round.So all that said. They work.And that said, since I was using these everywhere instead of my big cantype headphones - I promptly lost the EarPods with the ear holder things. ;-(. Something that was worthless to me (earpods) because of this device became essential and now I have neither.The world is a cruel cruel place and fate is an evil mistress.
