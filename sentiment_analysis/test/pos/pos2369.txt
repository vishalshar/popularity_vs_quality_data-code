Given that the cost of the imager is only $245 it is very well worth the price. Justification for one of these is experimentation however if one of these could help identify heat leaks in one's house, it could possibly pay for itself.Does it have the resolution of a $1200 imager? No. Is it an awesome tool? Absolutely but remember is functionality depends on how well you understand thermal heat transfer and the quality of your phone and if the app works with your phone.I have used mine to identify wall studs, heat ducts in the floors, automotive engine heating, car vent A/C identification and cooling system operation.
