Tried this device recently on a trip to Warsaw, Poland, and it worked flawlessly. I also have a competing product - Skyroam, which I tried on the same trip in order to compare the two. GlocalMe was more reliable and also faster, with support for 4G. The device is well made and easy to use. Two minor issues - it is fairly large and heavy. Personally, I would have preferred to have a smaller battery, forgo the powerpack capabilities, and just had a hotspot. Second, when you purchase a new package, the total available data does not change until the current package is exhausted. This was somewhat confusing. The device came with 110 MB of free data. I purchased the 1 GB package, but the display would not show that until I had exhausted the 110 MB package.
