I wanted to love it.  For the price, I guess I do.  It is mostly really quite good, but a few annoyances leave me wanting.  The volume is really weird.  I haven't been able to figure it out yet.  There are times I'm listening to some music or playing a game, and the last tick of the volume before off is WAY too loud.  But then other times, full blast is too quiet.  It seems like if the phone rings or I get a text/email alert that messes with the volume of everything else.  For example, I'll play a game and I have it fairly quiet then a text comes in and all of the sudden the game's music is really loud *and I can't change it*... it is permanently loud until I shut the game off and reload it.  So annoying.Something's also wrong with the microphone, I think.  Any time I've tried Skyping, the other person repeated says they can see my lips moving but no sound for a few seconds.  Comes and goes.  It isn't the connection, because I call them back on the laptop and everything's fine.But it was a really good price for a mostly good phone.  So 4 stars.Ps.  if you see a duplicate review that's because I bought two of these.  It was a great price, so I figured why not.  One in each color.  I figure that entitles me to two reviews.
