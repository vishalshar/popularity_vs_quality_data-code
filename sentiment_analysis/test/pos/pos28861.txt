I'm always a bit wary when a majority of a product's reviews are not "Verified Purchase" and they are all 5 stars. Not saying that those reviews are not legit, but I always place a bit more weight on reviews that are from verified purchases. So here it is, my two cents.I've wanted a smart door lock for quite some time now, mainly because I'm paranoid about whether my front door is locked, and if not, to be able to remotely lock it. It really didn't help my paranoia that my girlfriend had left the house and forgot to lock the front door a couple of times. The Lockitron was universally panned, and the first gen August Smart Lock had its share of issues. Chalk it up to growing pains! So when August finally released the new 2nd gen Smart Lock HomeKit edition, I knew it was time to give it a try.Before we dive into the details, I wanted to thank Amazon for its excellent customer service. I was actually supposed to receive my new lock last week. But alas, disaster struck. The post office's tracking showed that it was delivered to my mailbox, yet it was not there. After waiting a couple more days and starting an official investigation with USPS, I decided to check with Amazon. To my surprise, the service rep immediately ordered me a replacement without questioning my story. I'm happy to report that I received my replacement shipment today. Funny thing is, USPS finally found my package (it was put into the wrong mailbox) and delivered it to me today, which I will be sending back to Amazon. Great customer service Amazon!Ok, back to the actual product:----------------------First Impression----------------------It came in an attractive yet compact package, and is heavier than the small package tends to imply (see photo). Tucked inside is the lock, manuals, and mounting accessories for various door lock models. Even though most dead bolts are supported, there are some that are not. Make sure to check the compatibility list first:[...]The production packaging is very Apple-like, which is high compliment indeed. The unit itself feels hefty and well engineered. I like the textured grip surface for when you want to turn the dead bolt manually. The raised ridge helps to show what position the deadbolt is in at a glance from a distance.---------------Installation---------------I have one of the supported deadbolts, so I went for the install. The instructions and illustrations are easy to follow, and the installation only involves a few simple steps:1. Remove stock deadbolt turn-knob.2. Install the appropriate mounting plate for your lock model.3. Slip the included plastic sleeve over the metal rod that turns the lock.4. Slide the August Smart Lock over the whole apparatus, and then lock it in with the two levers on each side (not visible when installed).5. Remove the plastic strip that stops the battery from draining during shipment.6. Set up lock with the August Home appIt sounds more complicated than it is. But it's really easy to follow. What actually took longer was the mandatory firmware update during the app setup. That took about 15 minutes or so.--------------Operation--------------Once you go through the entire setup process in the app (including HomeKit setup), you are ready to go! There are 3 ways you can control your lock:1. The August Home app.2. One of the many HomeKit hub apps, such as Home, Ezzi Home, and Hesperus. I used Hesperus (see photo).3. Voice control via Siri (see photo).============================================Q: Do you need an August Connect for remote operation?============================================Short answer: No, but only if you have a newer AppleTV.Long Answer: This is a question that I had prior to purchasing the unit but couldn't find a clear answer on. First, a little background: The August Smart Lock uses Bluetooth LE, which is a short range wireless technology. So if you are far away, say at your work, then you cannot control the smart lock... unless you have a wireless bridge. A bridge is a device that can speak to the August Smart Lock via Bluetooth LE, but also has WiFi so it can connect to the internet so you can control your lock remotely. The August Connect is one such device. Prior to the 2n gen August Smart Lock, that is the only way to control your lock remotely. However, the new Smart Lock is HomeKit enabled, which means it works with Siri, including controlling it remotely. Apple actually spells out the requirements:[...]"Control your accessories away from homeIf you have an Apple TV (3rd generation or later), you can control your accessories with Siri commands when you're away from home. Just sign in to iCloud with the same Apple ID on your iOS device and Apple TV.If your remote access isn't working, sign out of iCloud on your Apple TV, then sign back in. To sign in, go to Settings > Accounts > iCloud."I happen to already have a 4th generation Apple TV, which can act as a bridge. There is not much else to do as long as you've already set up your smart lock for HomeKit. Some other reviewers mentioned having to restart his/her phone or Apple TV, or signing out then back into iCloud to get remote Siri to work. I had no such issue - it just worked. But if you do encounter difficulties, do try those steps first.This is a great reason to get an Apple TV that does a lot of cool things, instead of paying $80 for August Connect, which does only one thing.=======================================================Q: What should I use to control the lock - HomeKit app or August Home?=======================================================It's more or less a personal preference. Note that when operating remotely (at least using an Apple TV as the bridge), the August Home app takes quite a while acquire lock status - about 10-11 seconds. HomeKit apps are much faster - for example Hesperus takes about 2-3 seconds. However, the big caveat is that HomeKit apps don't seem to refresh lock status automatically. For example, in both Hesperus and Ezzi Home, after I locked or unlocked the August, the lock status in the app doesn't change until I manually refresh them (by leaving the app then coming back). I emailed the developer for Hesperus about this and this is what he told me:"Sorry for the inconvenience. Hesperus relies on the notification sent by accessory to decide when to refresh accessory state. However, due to an early limitation of HomeKit, most of Bluetooth Low Energy HomeKit accessory won't send notification when state of accessory changes. I'll try to add the ability to manually refresh the state of accessory in future release."The August Home app must have some kind of built in automatic status refresh, as it showed the change in lock status no problem. It's slower, but doesn't have this annoying quirk. But if you have a bunch of HomeKit devices, it would be a lot easier to control them from one app.UPDATE (Dec 27th, 2016) - With iOS 10, there is now the official Home app, which the August Smart Lock is compatible with. See additional notes at the end of the review.===================================================Q: What if I need to push/pull my door a little to latch the deadbolt?===================================================I had the same worry and know a lot of doors are like that. My front door requires me to push on it slightly to latch the deadbolt. I was afraid the motor in the August Smart Lock wouldn't be strong enough to operate the deadbolt. But I was wrong. So far it has not once failed to lock the door.UPDATE (Dec 27th, 2016) - The slight misalignment between the latch and the strike plate appear to get better or worsen depending on climate change. See my update about this at the end of the review.---------------Conclusion---------------I've been playing with the lock all night and I have to say I'm quite pleased. It has not once fail to lock or unlock, either in the house or remotely. HomeKit functionalities work great. I'm able to query the status and operate it with just my voice via Siri. It has done everything I want it to do. It's a bit spendy, but if you are in the market for a smart lock and have an iPhone, I wholeheartedly recommend the August Smart Lock HomeKit Edition!=====================UPDATE (Dec 27th, 2016)=====================It has now been 7 months since I first got the lock, and I still like it a lot. There have been a couple of hiccups, however both both have been resolved:1. When iOS 10 was released on Sep 13th, 2016, it came with the official Home app for HomeKit enabled devices. However, the August Smart Lock initially did not work with the Home app - it would see the lock but says it needs a firmware update to work with Home. The frustrating thing was, August did not release the firmware update until Nov 3rd, 2016, nearly 2 months after the Home app was available. Of course, this is no longer an issue if you are buying the lock right now.2. I had mentioned that my door requires me to push on it slightly to latch the deadbolt. Initially the August Smart Lock had no problems with operating in that condition. But at some point as the weather got colder, it started having issues overcoming the resistance and latching. August sells a tapered deadbolt to help with this issue. The tapered deadbolt is thinner on the end of the latch to give it more leeway to enter the strike plate. I ordered one for $40 in Satin Nickel (apparently that color is not available on the August's web store as of today). But by the time I got it, I realized I can't just swap out the latch inside my Kwikset deadbolt. I would have to replace the whole deadbolt. I didn't want to do that, because then I would end up with 2 sets of keys, one for my front door with the new deadbolt, and another set for my original garage and back door locks. So I ended up not installing the tapered deadbolt from August. Eventually, I found out that Kwikset also makes its own tapered latch for their deadbolts, but it's very hard to find. But I managed to track one down. To find where to buy them, search "Kwikset 80391-003 Deadbolt Latch, Tapered ~ Satin Nickel" (also available in other colors). Finally, after I got the Kwikset tapered deadbolt latch and installed it, the August Smart Lock no longer has any issues latching, regardless of the weather. The whole saga was a bit frustrating, so I'm deducting one star from my initial review (4 stars now).
