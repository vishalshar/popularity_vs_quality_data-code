Great alternative to products that cost over 3 times what this does. I would caution you to note the direction the micro USB on your device faces. I purchased this to use with my Google Nexus 6 for home inspections. It works well but the micro USB port is such that the camera faces the same was as the screen when it's connected. I didn't buy this to take thermal imaging selfies. (LOL!) So, what I had to do is buy a  male to female micro USB cable to hold the camera by hand while I use it so I can see where the camera is pointed on my screen.The camera will point to the side that the "flat" part of the port on your phone does. If the flat side of the port is toward your screen, you will need a cable or an adapter that swivels, which is how SEEK should have made these to remedy this problem and make them work with either situation.
