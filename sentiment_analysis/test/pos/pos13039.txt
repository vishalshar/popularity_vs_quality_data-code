Bought a spool of this to try out. Love it! Love that I can buy multiple colors half Kg amounts. Don't really have a need for a full Kg of every color of the rainbow. Comes well packaged in a resealable bag with silica packet inside. Looks like it will do a great job of keeping the filament free from moisture. I am using this in an MP Select Mini, at 195/50 for my settings, and no problems with printing.
