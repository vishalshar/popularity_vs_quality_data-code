I use Further handsoap only in my kitchen because it cuts the grease on my hands and does not dry my skin out.  Also, it smells good.  I would like to Thank the supplier for proper packaging.  Had trouble in the past with another supplier and the bottle arrived leaking inside the box.  Will buy from this supplier again.
