Works as advertised.  You would never know the suction is working until you try to knock it over. Pick it up normally and it lifts like a regular mug, but bump it and it locks onto the surface. The smoother the surface the better It works. It makes a great conversation piece too as people are surprised at how easily it lifts and then resists attempts to topple it over. They then attempt to figure out why. Good fun.
