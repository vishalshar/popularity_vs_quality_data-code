I recently saw this case on a YouTube video and said this looks awesome but it can't be true. So I went on Amazon and bought it.  It came today and I decided to test it out so the first thing I did was stick it to my wall a it stuck for a while. The weird thing is the back doesn't even feel sticky. And the best thing about this case is it comes with 4 different covers that you can put over the case so hair and lint don't stick to it. Also it is a really thin case but it has a lip above the screen so it's very protective. Here are some pros and cons that I've encountered about this casePros :Sticks to almost any surface ( great for sticking to glass or screens)Very thin but protective against drops because of the lipComes with a back plate so hair and lint don't stick onto itThe back plates have 4 different colors rose gold, gold, silver, and black ( so it can match your phone )Great for selfies to get all your friends into the shotAlso you get access to all your portsSo you don't have to buy special cords that are smallCons :It's super sticky and sometimes sticks to well against some surfaces like glass
