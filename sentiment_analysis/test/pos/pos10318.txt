The Bellabeat LEAF is great, especially for women. Along with functions other products have: tracking activities, sleeping, it also comes with some cool functions like logging your period, wake-up alarm and breath exercise. The app looks beautiful, very simple but user friendly. I also love their design and the ability of wearing it with different style. Personally I dont like to wear anything on my wrist, so this is great where I can wear it as necklace or as a clip. I usually just tuck it in my jeans, and I cant feel it at all while Im sitting or walking, which is awesome.Pros: This product doesnt require charging. You just replace the battery every 6 months. I love it because usually if I charge something overnight, I forgot to wear it. And also since I dont have to charge it, I can wear it all day long.Activity/sleeping tracking is pretty accurate. And in the app, it always ask you to confirm if they logged correctly and can edit it if you want, which is great. The little histogram of your steps is super cute, it gives a little start for the period you exercise the most. I love looking at it. Also you can hover the distribution to see how many calories you burn every 30 mins.The breath exercise is very helpful. I have pretty bad anxiety and it has really helped me to just focus on my breathing a couple times a day.Cons: I dont like that you have to clip it to your waistband to do the breathing exercises. It is annoying to have to move it all the time. It would be great to improve that. Other than that, I think its a great product. Looking forward to see it comes with more features.
