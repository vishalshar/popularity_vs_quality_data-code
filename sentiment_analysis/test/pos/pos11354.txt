I'm in Marching Band, and my feet often hurt after a long practice or performance. When I got these, I had to march a parade the next day, and my feet didn't hurt AT ALL. They are extremely comfortable, and because they are made of cork, there isn't a layer of fabric that peels off after a few weeks. On a side note, the size 15 insoles work in a size 16 shoe!
