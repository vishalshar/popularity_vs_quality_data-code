While at the expo for the '16 R'n'R NOLA marathon, this was offered as the course 'GU'. I was skeptical as I'm used to a thick paste like substance for my needs. Thank goodness that race day was going well and I decided to do the unthinkable and try something new during a race. I took 1 packet between mile 16 - 17, it went down so smoothly I saved one for mile 21-22 when I knew I would need it another. I figured if it didn't stay down I'd ditch it but it stayed down and did it's job. It gave me a nice controllable level of energy that made a difference on the course. Once I made it home, I immediately bought more and I've now used in it 4 races with the exact same results I got after the first usage.I had a 20 mile trail run 2 weekends ago and this was perfect as it wasn't heavy on my stomach out on the trails.
