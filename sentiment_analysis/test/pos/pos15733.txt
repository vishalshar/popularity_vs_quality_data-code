no, it doesn't have the sound that an expensive model would, but for the size, the sound is fine.  Its a unique conversation piece and since I received mine, two of my friends have purchased the same one.  I also had no success in getting 45s to play vertically but Lps work well.  CD player has the remote and is convenient.  The description states the bluetooth will reach up to 33 feet, mine actually reaches much further.  All in all I am pleased with this record player.
