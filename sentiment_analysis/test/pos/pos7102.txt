I have a 7 yr old Silky Terrier/ Shih Zhu mix who is just shy of 20lbs and he loves this! It does make a soft grinding noise when it is getting ready to release the ball and that was a bit nerve wracking to my dog at first.  Once he was over that, he really got into it.  He has been smacked in the face a couple times on accident when he was checking out the device and the ball released, but it didn't hurt him and we made sure to teach him to stay behind it and wait.  I chose this one because it was smaller and while this fits my dog, I want to make sure others know that the balls are SMALL!  I was actually surprised at how small they were.  The machine works great and I would definitely recommend this to others, especially if you want the extra exercise for your pet in the winter months!
