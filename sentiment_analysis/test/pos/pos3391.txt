I bought these broths off amazon and they a delicious. I was new to the whole sipping broth experience but these fulfilled my expectations. The spicy tortilla was my favorite, it had a kick to it but it was not extremely spicy. I am very health conscious so it was nice to see all of the broths are relatively low in sodium for what they are and the taste they have. They only have a 260 mg (11%) of sodium in each bag which is low compared to a traditional chicken broth which usually has around 900 mg (36%) of sodium. The tomato and basil and the curry spice are both very tasty as well. I would recommend these broths to anyone that loves tea and is looking for a new caffeine free and savory taste or someone that is trying to lay off snacks at night since I think it tricks your mind into feeling full. A must try!
