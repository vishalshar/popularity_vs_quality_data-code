I bought four handy camels for storage of hardwood charcoal and wood chunks for a big green egg. I store these items inside to avoid moisture and due to limited storage outside. The handy camel works well to transport the bags and keep moisture in and the smell of the charcoal/wood out. The only, minor, downside is that a full, large bag of charcoal requires a bit of finesse to use the handy camel. The size limits are clearly noted on their website, so no false claim whatsoever.Bottom line: it works exactly as advertised. An enormous chip clip that also helps you carry. I'm glad I purchased and would highly recommend.
