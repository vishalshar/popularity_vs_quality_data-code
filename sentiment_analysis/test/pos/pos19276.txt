The powder dissolves very easily... I've never had any issues with a gritty texture.  Mixed with water, it is not 100% flavorless in my opinion; it adds a sort of sweet after-taste.  However, the taste is very subtle and is not bad.  Unlike some other reviewers, I have not experienced any adverse symptoms such as an upset stomach but I also cannot speak for it's effectiveness yet.  I just started taking it at the end of my last ovulation window and have yet to enter another one.  Will update review when I've been taking it longer.**Update- Oct. 2016**:After 5 months of trying unsuccessfully, I am now 5 weeks pregnant after taking this for one month.  We also used SASMAR Conceive Plus Fertility Lubricant, so I'm not sure if it is just a happy coincidence we conceived or if one or both of these products did the trick, but I think they can only help your chances (especially since I did not have any negative side effects from either).
