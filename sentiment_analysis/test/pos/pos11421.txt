Excellent item.  Already used it at the beach and waterfall expedition.  The bluetooth connectivity works great! We even left the cellphone at the bag (in the shore) and had the speakers in a surf board in the water !Excellent sound quality, sound in all directions - 360degrees balanced sound!Used it for two roadtrips already and battery life is amazing.Love the design!If you are curious and open the tough cover (like I did), you will see how protected your speakers are. Extreme ruggedness!Highly recommend it :) can't wait to have the strap mount to use it in my Kayak.If you want a LIFE PROOF speaker, you should definitely get this one!
