I have  been using this  product  for about a week  or so. It does exactly what it says it does. No hidden fees. Installing was straight forward. I in taller on two garage doors. I had one minor issue with an ope!close sensor. I contacted customer support which answered via email within a short period. The issue was  the sensor does not sit on the base and tends to seperate. Being magnetic I found it stuck to the track. A little tape and it works like a charm. I use ITF to notify me when a door is opened or close. You also get notified if the door is left open (you can shut that off but not adjust time,). Five stars if not for the low quality sensors. Worth the price.
