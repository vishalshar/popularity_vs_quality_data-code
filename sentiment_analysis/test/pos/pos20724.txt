Ive bought one for my girlfriend as a gift and since she likes to normally leave reviews for everything, heres what she has to say:I have been using the leaf for almost a month now and Im pretty happy about it! At first I thought I wouldnt be able to wear it every day, especially since I go a lot to the gym and wear currently only jewelry on the weekends but it looks so nice and the clip is also so practical that I surprisingly managed to wear it every day, at work, at the gym I bought myself a couple of matching jewelry and Im very happy! Received also lots of compliments from my friends and that even before they knew it wasnt just a unuseful piece.I really enjoy checking my sleep record in the morning and I have to say that it seems to be quite accurate. The leaf doesnt track some short awake periods (going from the sofa where I felt asleep to the bed, for instance) but I do not find that relevant.Also the alarm clock is very nice and smooth for waking up and usefull as a reminder for taking the pill. My period is because of the pill very accurate so that I cant speak for the accuracy of the prediction of the Leaf but I find the information about the different moments of my cycle very useful. Certainly to be taken into consideration for future mothers to be.The only thing that the Leaf is missing is a heart rate monitor, it will be the perfect device as you need to define which activity and for how long you did it, regardless of your pulsations. Maybe it is possible to combine the leaf with a heart rate tracker of some kind?Regardless,  I'm very happy with the leaf and I would buy it again!
