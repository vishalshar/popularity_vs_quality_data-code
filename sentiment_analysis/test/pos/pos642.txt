So I ordered two of these and one is growing like crazy and the other is totally dead, not sure what happened with the one as I did the exact same things to both cans, they were side by side on the window, watered at the same time, with the same amount....Maybe a bad batch but overall I like it and I'm starting to get some good basil already
