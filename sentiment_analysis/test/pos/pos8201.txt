I purchased this as an upgrade/replacement to my Chemex poor over. I was tired of spending the 20 minutes or so it seemed to take to make enough coffee for the two of us, every morning, but I love the flavor I can get out of my Chemex using high quality and/or home-roasted beans. I was originally shopping for a drum roaster to replace my air popper that recently bit the dust, and found out that Behmor would soon be replacing a web-enabled ("Connected") roaster. I figured that Connected Brewer offered me a good chance to get to know Behmor products and the Connected app, before their new roaster is available, while speeding up my morning brew. Plus, if I wanted to load my fresh grounds the night before, I could have it brew before I raise out of bed.After one month of daily use (as of 2016-06-28):Overall, this brewer is close to the quality of the Chemex I know and love, with the convenience of a drip system. Most of my current complaints (the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) could be alleviated with future software updates.Pros:* Carafe - the coffee stays hot for several hours...enough time for lazy bones to wake her ass up and still get a nice hot cup of coffee. Actually, I recently brewed a second pot for some house guests, but nobody drank it. It was still lukewarm 24 hours later.* Brew - the quality of the flavors I perceive is very similar to the Chemex - better than any drip or percolator style system I have had coffee from.* One button - if you are happy with the configurable preset, you can easily brew with a single button push.Cons:*Brew strength - compared with my Chemx, I cannot get as strong of a brew. I ditched the reusable filter that comes with the unit for paper #10 filters. Even if I double up the paper, the strength of the coffee does not compare. I feel like I need more coffee when I normally would not with the Chemex. I think this could be remedied if they app developers add a custom configuration for the dwell time of each "pour," and the ability to use a slower flowing filter.*App: Device setup - Setup is not all that difficult. However, I purchased this right before moving, where we had to stay at a friends house for several weeks. It refused to connect to their wifi (I don't know who is to blame here). Then I had to reset it to my home wifi once we finally moved in. Probably not an issue for most users, but very annoying. I ended up using the preset to brew for the period it wouldn't connect to the friend's wifi (three out of the 4 previous weeks).*App: Brewing - "Brew," "Buzz," or "Craft" - which would you instinctively choose for brewing coffee? It turns out that for replacing a pour over like the Chemex, you probably want "Craft." Okay, after you have calibrated the system (not difficult, but also not without some flaws), this is pretty easy. Set the temp, the pre-soak/delay, and set the desired boiler temp. However, I have to set these every time I want to setup or schedule a brew. Why isn't there recipes or at least a default recipe to minimize the amount of work I have to do...isn't that the main point of having such a "smart" system??? I should add that the reason I don't use "Brew" to make coffee is that it always throws back an error about the temperature not being right or some other thing.*Filter/coffee bin - It is easy to put the bin in, but not all of the way, especially first thing in the morning when you aren't your sharpest. It's hard to visually tell when it is not fully inserted, when viewed from the front. Make sure to insert it all the way or, obviously, it will leak. I'm guessing that by design it clicks into place - so check for the click.*Carafe - While the pot is excellent at keeping the coffee hot, the shape and/or lid design makes it hard to pour the last half of a mug or so. You have to completely invert the carafe to get that bit out, and it feels very unnatural to the wrist or to any expectation you have from a conventional glass pot.*Top-loading for water - you don't want to put it directly under a cupboard even if it will fit. Hopefully you have some counter space where you can push it against the wall and load the water without having to move it around.Pro or con?*LEDs - It would be nice to be able to have the option to turn them off for aesthetics. The green color is very bright and a bit jarring. However, it doubles as a night light for the kitchen. I was concerned about the waste of electricity, but being an LED, this should be minimal...I'm guessing most of it's standby usage comes from the wi-fi. I checked with my Kill-O-Watt, and the system uses about 3 W when it is idle.
