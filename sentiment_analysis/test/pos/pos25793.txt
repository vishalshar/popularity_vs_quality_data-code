Paying premium for a sexy lightbulb is very silly, but if you're in the market for it then this is the way to go.I was in the Kickstarter for the original model and it was bright as Hell. Very impressive, but wasn't the most natural color and my wife didn't approve. This one is very soft, and warm. I'll just hope you understand lighting terms and leave it at that.
