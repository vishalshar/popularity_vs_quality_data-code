I have eczema, sensitive, and dry skin for a year now. Being a teen, that means lots of insecurity. I've had dry skin for years on my face and my self confidence was plummeting to the pits of Earth. I've tried everything and after going through ten pages of Amazon, I've finally found my love. I managed with a moisturizer that's in liquid form to minimize my dry skin so you can't see it, but you can feel it. I had one stubborn patch on my forehead and it refused to go away after lots of moisturizers. I finally found this one and BAM, it completely disappeared. Now my skin is smooth, soft, and not irritated. I definitely recommend this!I wasn't given a discount or given this for free to write this review. This is my honest opinion.
