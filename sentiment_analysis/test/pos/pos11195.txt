I really like this product. The materials are high quality and seem like they will last through a lot. They've been particularly convenient for bringing my lunches to work because everything fits together and I notice when something is missing. The one thing I don't love about them is that the texture of the utensils seems to cling to certain foods. That's not enough of a drawback that I won't continue to use and enjoy them, though.
