The nightlight we had lit up the room and I am sensitive to any light.  This bowl night light was great.  It lights up as you enter the bathroom, stays on for two minutes (or longer if need be, by your movement (sorry, bad choice of words?).  We first had only red light, but after I dropped it, it ran the full gamut in spectacular colors.
