This could help change the way we interact with our televisions and entertainment systems. As a remote hub it is simple to setup and has amazing customization capabilities.  However, where I see a product like this really setting itself apart is when you use it with an Amazon Echo, as long as you have an old iPhone/ipod laying around (fortunately I have several). The reason I say this is because in order for the voice commands to work, the Anymote software has to be able to receive push notifications from Alexa AND have an active bluetooth connection with the Anymote hub. I know that theoretically once you open an app and then background it, any push notifications and bluetooth connections are supposed to remain active, but it seems that is not always the case. I have found that setup to be very unreliable and many  times I would use the Echo only to have the Anymote not respond until I opened the app again which defeats the purpose of the voice commands. I don't see this as a flaw with the Anymote as much as a limitation of the hardware. So I installed and set it up on an old iPhone, turned off the screen lock, turned the screen brightness all the way down, opened the app, and just left it running in the foreground. Obviously you will have to keep the iPhone plugged in but that isn't a big deal. Since using this setup, the Anymote works flawlessly with the Echo and voice commands. Now I need to see how to make a second one work in the bedroom with a different Echo and Tv. Great product!
