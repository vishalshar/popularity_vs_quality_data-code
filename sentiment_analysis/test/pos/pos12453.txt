Very good build quality. It works with a Droid Maxx with an Otterbox Commuter case on. It also works well with a micro USB extension cable. It is not the best quality image, but for the price compared to other thermal cameras, it is good and still has enough detail to allow you to know what you are looking at (assuming there are enough temperature differences). The range of temperatures is useful, such as checking an oven or a soldering iron.Update: This also works with the Droid Z Force using a USB type C to micro usb adapter.
