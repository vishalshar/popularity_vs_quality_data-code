The MOCAheart offers a nice concept.  Initially it will not pair with my Samsung S7 Edge.  I installed the Android app, and while setting up the account, the app would constantly crash and would not let me change the gender to Male.  But it didn't matter because I could  not pair the two devices.  I thought of trying to pair with my iPad only to find that there is no iPad app.  However, I was able to install the iPhone app on the iPad and it paired with out problems.  I also installed the app on an Android 5 device.  The MOCAheart worked perfectly with that device as well.Using the iPad and the Android 5 device, the device worked well and gave consistent readings that compared with a Pulse Oximeter that I have.With assistance from helpful MOCAheart support, I was able to get the device to work with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, though the  connectivity occasionally requires disabling and enabling Bluetooth on my phone.  The interface is fine with the iPad and Android 5 device.I believe the MOCAheart has the potential of being a useful device, and I will rate it 5 stars when it works as well with Android 6 as it does with the iPad and Android 5 tablet.
