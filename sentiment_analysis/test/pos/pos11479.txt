Fast, a GREAT price, and good quality.  The winding is smooth and the color is strong.  They did not cheap out on the colorant amount like many companies. At first I didn't want a .5K spool, but now I am a convert, because I can have more colors on hand. -  I just bought 2 more spools I like it so much.  Color is close to hot wheels track.  In the photo -- the new packaging has a BIG sticker to show filament color.  Old version below.  It helps me see what I have quickly... nice detail.
