I have had this lock for a little over 6 months. For the first two months I used it with two different Android phones (Moto X 2014 and Moto X 2015), all running the latest version of Android.  Quite simply, auto unlock on Android is so slow it is basically useless. If auto-unlock is the killer feature for you and you use an Android phone, don't bother with this. It was always faster to use keys over waiting for auto-unlock or opening the app.In the last two months, I switched to iPhone and with iOS the experience is much, much better. Auto-unlock is faster and works 99% of the time. With an iPhone and auto lock and auto unlock, I don't need keys for my door any longer. I'm quite close to relying on this lock completely and not using the lock on the knob any longer.
