This thermometer has been a godsend for us!  We've had the hardest time taking our toddler's temperature...until now.  He loves the bubble app that distracts him while we take his temp and I love that we can just stick it under his arm and get a very accurate read.  The app is nice because it allows you to keep track of all the data from the thermometer without having to input any information yourself.  If you have a smart phone, this is the only thermometer you will ever need.  I went through 3 thermometers before we found this one.  This would also be an awesome baby shower gift.
