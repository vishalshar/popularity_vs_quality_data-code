This is a well made, heavy duty product! It easily holds and seals a 40lb. bag of dog food. I would recommend it for anything from mulch and soil to charcoal and dog food - anything you want to seal or carry easily. Doesn't tear the bag. Easy to lock and unlock, but depending on how bulky the bag is, it can take a little bit of hand strength to snap it shut for a really tight seal. Really useful and reliable product!
