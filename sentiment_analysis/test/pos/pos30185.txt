From the design point of view its slimmer than you might think. It's super light, and the material seems like it will last for very long time, which is a huge plus for me. I haven't had a chance to charrge/sync with it yet, but I am sure its going to be fine since its MFI certified.Super stocked that I finally have a such small charging cable and that I can be worry free if I need to charge my phone or other devices when I am on the road.I had the chance to charge/sync with the NomadKey and it works perfectly! Worth the money.
