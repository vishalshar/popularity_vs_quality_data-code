I love this product I think it's great.  I was looking for something to put in the back of the house for security and I found this.  The light is very good quality and to mount it is very simple.  I downloaded the app from the Apple Store to my smart phone, connected the light to my Wi-Fi and I was set.  I did have to contact Kuna Support by way of email for a couple of questions.  Kuna Support team was very good and very quick at responding to my questions.  Kuna Support team notified me when they noticed my light was putting out error messages.  They notified me and told me they were replacing my light.  They are sending me a new light with instructions on how to return the light I have FREE of shipping charges.  To me, that's great support.  I did not notice any problems with the light, as far as I could tell everything was working great.  I was getting notifications when someone approached the house.  I was getting great videos.  For their support team to notify me because they saw a problem.  I think that is excellent support.  It doesn't bother me if I don't get phone support.  As long as I can contact you when I have a problem and you respond and help me I'm OK with that.
