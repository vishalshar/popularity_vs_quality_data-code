Is it expensive? yes.Will you look like funny riding one? Yes.Will people think you are a Hipster? Most Definitely.Is it worth it? It depends.The URB-E will not fit everyone's mission, hence some of the bad reviews. (Mostly from narrow minded people that don't own one) If you have a need for a well built, well supported, compact mode of powered transportation, then this is for you. The URB-E fulfills a mission for me. I have knee issues and I am unable to walk any distances more than a few miles but I absolutely love to fly to different airports (I am a pilot) and explore the area. The URB-E is the only device that would fit in my plane (2 of them actually) and fit my transportation needs. I did look at scooters, but being able to sit down sure is nice on a 10+ mile ride.The quality of the URB-E is outstanding, this is not some cheaply made Chinese device. It is obvious that much thought went into the design. For example, there is no suspension and it has hard, tiny wheels... yet because of the way they designed the seat to flex it handle bumps very well. 15MPH is plenty fast enough and I think any faster and with the little wheels and the design of the bike it could get dangerous. (Yes, this will take a little bit of time to get used to) I am pretty light (125lbs) so I cannot comment for larger riders but it handles hills very well. The only thing that I really was not expecting and do not like is it's ability to handle less than perfect road conditions... It simply does not do well on anything other than a hard surface in decent condition. You will not be taking this on even the most tightly packed gravel trails due to the small, hard wheels and the front wheel drive system. Other than that limitation, this works very well for my need and at the time of writing this there is currently no other device on the market that will fit this need.I thought i might add that I found some better accessories than what URB-E offers (sorry URB-E)Light: http://amzn.to/1Syecyg (Mounts Cleanly, Removes easy for standalone use and it is extremely bright!)Phone Holder: http://amzn.to/1XKVgL5 (Clean Design)Cup Holder:http://amzn.to/1XKUX2A (not much to say here)If you know what you are purchasing, and it's limitations, you will be happy with the URB-E. (Plus, it feels good to support a product that supports jobs here in the USA)
