I purchased this bulb because it needed no equipment to work.  It took some time to set it up because I did not read the instructions first.  Once I did that, it worked beautifully.  I love this bulb and all the things it can do.  I cannot wait until my google home has intergration, but for now it works well with IFTTT.  The colors are nice and the app is very easy to use.  You have got to try this it is amazing.
