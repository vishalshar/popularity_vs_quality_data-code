My son is 3yrs, he still doesn't fully understand Halloween yet. The switch witch is now a tradition. The candy was donated and in return he got a puzzle.  Plus it prevents us from sneaking pieces too. It's a great learning tool. my friends all asked about it, even better their kids asked about the witch.
