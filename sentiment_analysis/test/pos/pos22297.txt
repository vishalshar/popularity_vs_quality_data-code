I absolutely love it! I never knew if it was possible to fall in love with an iPhone Charger, but I have. This helps lighten up my keyring, and simplify my life. Just having an "emergency" iPhone charger has helped me out a TON! The other plus is that because its so small and just sits on yoru keyring, there are USB plus everywhere, so that you will NEVER ever be without a a charger, or have a dead iPhone! This is my second one! I love the design and will definitely be buying more of Nomad Goods' products soon.Buy one. You will NOT regret it!
