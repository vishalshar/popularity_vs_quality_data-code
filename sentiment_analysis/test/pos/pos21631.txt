I needed a water source for long runs in south Florida where hydration is important.  I LOVE this.  It fits me perfectly and is extremely light in its construction.  The neoprene is great.  I didn't like the camelback because of the heavy canvas straps and the canvas body - all I could feel was bulky and chafing.  It has a small place for the gu if you use that, but no where really to hold your phone - I just tuck it into the strap and it works fine.
