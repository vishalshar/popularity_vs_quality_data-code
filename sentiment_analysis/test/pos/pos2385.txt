I recently purchased the Care+Wear PICC line cover and I was blown away by the original black cover. It was way nicer than the mesh option that the hospital had provided for me. I saw a number of options and shared them with my nurse, who told me that they wouldnt work as they constricted air flow and prevented air from getting to the insertion site. And then I found Care+Wear with my nurse and we were both amazed. It has a unique mesh window which allows for air to get into the dressing and allows you to see the insertion site and monitor for leakage and infection. The antimicrobial treatment made me feel more comfortable about wearing the product and being able to wash and dry it with my clothes has made caring for my PICC line amazingly simple.The company also has a number of other colors and designs and what I love about this is that it was clearly designed with fashion and functionality in mind. It allows me to feel more comfortable in social settings and Ive felt super comfortable going out and not having everyone staring.
