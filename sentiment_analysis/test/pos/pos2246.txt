I looked at a lot of fitness trackers. I picked this one because it would track my steps, calories, sleep,  my daily workouts, & I LOVED the way it looks. I didn't want an ugly rubber looking bracelet. I really liked that it can be worn in many different ways. I get compliments on it all the time.One thing I wish it had was more fitness workout options and I wish it would tell me my heart rate.  With that said, I would still buy it all over again. I highly recommend it.
