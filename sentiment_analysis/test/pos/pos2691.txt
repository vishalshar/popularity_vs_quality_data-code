This plays exactly like Liar's Dice with the exception that you use cards and not dice. Each card is the size of a stick of gum and has a die face on either end of the card. You draw 5 cards to start with and can choose which side you play with which adds some extra layers to the metagame. You also know there can only possibly be 10 of the same die at the table because of how the cards are printed. Great adaptation that fits in the palm of your hand.  You could probably even play without a table.
