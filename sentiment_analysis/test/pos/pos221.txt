I have never written a review before despite having ordered hundreds of items from Amazon, but this product is so good that I had to.  This item comes with a minature wooden Popsicle type of stick. You use the stick to scoop a little of the product and apply it to your underarm area. The product melts a little while you're applying it so you can spread it more evenly over the area you want. I give it a few seconds to dry and then I put on my shirt. I like that I don't feel it on me or notice it during the day. I have tried those crystal deodorants, which didn't help me at all, but this one is like a miracle in a jar. I think it would probably work a little differently on each person since we all have a different chemical makeup, but this product actually works BETTER on me than a standard aluminum-based deodorant. I can barely smell anything on my clothing, even on a warm day. When I used the typical deodorant, it would leave a stain and my shirts always smelled under the armpits anyway, but this one doesn't. Of course it's more expensive than a standard deodorant, but I think it is completely worth the cost. I am not the type of person whose armpits never smell- mine definitely do and this kills it. I also read from some of the reviews that there is a two week detox period. In my case, as soon as I started to use it, the product worked and I there has not been any odor. I can't recommend this stuff enough. It's amazing.
