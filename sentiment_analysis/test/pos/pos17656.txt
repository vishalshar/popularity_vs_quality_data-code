Arrived promptly.  I used it on my chrome rims today and it worked perfectly and much easier than using a manual brush.  Love the water shut off capability, saves a lot of water.  Also a nice touch from this company was an email send soon after my order asking me to let them know if there was any delay in receiving their tool and to let them know if I liked it or had any problems, etc.  Shows this company cares for their customers!
