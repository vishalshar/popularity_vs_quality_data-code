This product is for Medium to Extra-Large Dogs.  The quality of the strap and clasp are of good quality and appear to be very durable.  It can be adjusted for different height dogs.  The product has "LIFETIME GUARANTEE", so keep your sales receipt for full refund or replacement.  This product can work with Flexi Leash but I suggest that you try the Flexi Leash 3 for big dogs.  Due to the lack of product information, I got this for my small size dogs (11 lbs and 18 lbs); I have a Flexi Leash 2 and the strap/clasp would drag on the sidewalk as the Flexi Leash 2 struggled to re-track due to the weight of the strap/clasp.  Now, I found Sporn has an XS Coupler for extra small and small dogs.
