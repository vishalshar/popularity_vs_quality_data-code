For the price, this is a good little Thermal Imaging Camera. You're unlikely to find one cheaper at present. The smartphone app allows you take stills and video (with a watermark), and has a good range of viewing options. One thing to note; don't expect high-resolution thermal images with his. I purchased with rather low expectations of the image quality, and what I got was a little better than I expected, however don't judge this by the thermal images on the manufacturer's website, they appear to be much higher quality than the device is capable of.Having said that, I am more than happy with my purchase, and quality is comparable to units costing 5 times as much.
