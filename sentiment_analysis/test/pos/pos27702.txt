so delicious...good portion...I love that it has quite a bit less sugar than other brands. I haven't tried the other flavors yet but certainly plan on it!My only complaint is that I wish the company would have a variety package option with all of the different flavors. Sometimes, you don't want to commit to all of the same flavor and you don't want to drop $100 buying all of the different flavors.
