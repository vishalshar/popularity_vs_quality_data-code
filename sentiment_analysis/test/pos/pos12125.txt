Well - I am cautiously optimistic.  I just put it on my bed and the GREAT news - it fits a deep mattress and it does NOT stink or make noise!!!  I need this for my 18 year old male cat that is a bit out of control of his kidneys sometimes - so the verdict is still out on the waterproof and whether it shrinks after washing - but if those check well - this will be an AWESOME product for any price.
