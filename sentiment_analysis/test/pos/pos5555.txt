I've had very good luck storing cheese in these bags.  I shop at COSTCO and, therefore, a single block of cheese is large & hard for me to use up before it spoils.  I just strip off the plastic wrapping, toss the whole block into the bag, fold it over & store it in the refrigerator.  It's easy to just use what I need & return the block to the bag.
