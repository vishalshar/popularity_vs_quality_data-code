Although I was skeptical at first because of how you need your bluetooth on, I quickly didn't mind as I had it on most of the time anyway to connect to other things around my house. I was amazed that my Alexa could work with the TrackR, which made things even easier. As a person who systematically keeps things organized and in the right spot, I absolutely lose my mind when they aren't. TrackR helps solve this problem with little bulk added onto my belongings.Not sure how well it works with long distance lost items. It does show you predictions as to where it was found lost, which is helpful.
