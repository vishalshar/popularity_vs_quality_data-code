i couldn't be more pleased with this purchase. I read tons and tons of reviews. At first I was sure I would get a Fitbit. Then I was sure I would go with Jawbone. But I kept hesitating. And I kept coming back to the Pivotal. Well I am glad that j did! I had one minor issue due to user error (that would be ME) and upon contacting customer service, I was responded to within the hour on a Friday night after 6pm and given helpful information and offered a replacement. Well, I didn't need the replacement because it was my own fault and since then, I have not had any troubles. It's helped me to keep moving and to get better sleep.My one complaint would be size. I have a very tiny wrist and the smallest setting fits great, however the molded part of the band is a little too wide for my liking. If it was more rounded or offered in a smaller size, I think I would like that better. Attached is a hoot to demonstrate.
