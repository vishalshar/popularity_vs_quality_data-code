This mug is awesome! It really works! While there are some surfaces that it doesn't stick so well to and while it won't stick well if the surface is pretty dirty, on most surfaces it sticks really well to. It is amazing how it sticks in such a way that if you try tipping it over from the side it will stick, but if you try picking it up vertically to drink from it the cup will easily come free. If you need to use a mug somewhere there is a high risk of knocking over your mug or just want to make sure your mug won't easily be knocked over, this is a great mug to get!
