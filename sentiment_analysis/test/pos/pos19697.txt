To be honest, I chose it because it was drop-tested, and the only drop-tested case I was able to find.Now that it own it, it is pretty great: if feels good in my hand and setting it down, having the feel of rubber bumpers.Also it looks pretty good.  Very industrial.  It's clear with some texturing.  It even has fake torx bolts molted into it which is pretty funny.They did mess up the design, however, by placing the UAG logo over the htc logo at a right angle.  It looks kind of bad, like a design mistake.Also, it came with a screen-protector but without instructions.  I have been unable to figure out how to apply it, but I already had a screen protector so I made only a very weak attempt to understand this one.By the way I use a plastic spoon to get it off.
