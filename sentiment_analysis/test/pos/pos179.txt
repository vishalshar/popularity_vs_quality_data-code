This set is a nice change of pace than your one dollar plastic spork from the camp shop. This will actually stand up to some abuse and wont snap right away. You could actually pass of the fork half as a fork. Typically sporks do not really function well as a fork, but I will give it the approval. The spoon is sufficient in size, like a large dinner spoon. I do like its shape and does scrape well. I would recommend this to someone looking to use it more than once rather than an essentially disposable spork.
