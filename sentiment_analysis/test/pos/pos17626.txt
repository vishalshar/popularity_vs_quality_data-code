I thought the cp, nd4, and nd8 were great until I got an extremely washed out picture on a no cloud sunny hot day. Now the 16 is my go to sunny day filter and I've gone as dark as the nd32 shooting video into the sun. If you want the perfect camera shutter ratios for beautiful movement without washed out pictures you absolutely need these. And they are glass! Not plastic.
