Non smelling, non tasting, not grainy. I'm in my early 20s and wanted to give my eggs a little oomph to them post birth control. We are not trying but not preventing. As I want my stepson to have another sibling. This drink mix is very blendable. I mix it with orange juice and water, doesn't have no after taste. I bought two packs just in case I ran out.
