Received my laptop yesterday, charged it and installed my programs on the laptop; so, I have not really used it a whole lot yet. The keyboard took me a second to get used to because the keys are smaller than on my previous laptop and the numeric keypad is a much different.However, I absolutely love this laptop, so far. It runs really fast, really nice back-lit keyboard and the HD screen is stunning. I did not have to go through the usual uninstalling bloatware process; which amazed me. I played a game and was the graphics are fantastic, default was medium settings, tried it on high and it did not really affect my games performance.I'll  post an update if anything changes.
