I have been all natural since Summer of 2015, I threw away all store bought products and immediately started experimenting in making 100% all natural house hold products.  None of it has been simple I must admit, especially replacing my store bought shampoos. I tried many of the no poo methods, I have tried countless all natural homemade shampoo recipes that the law allows, and still no success finding the right recipe for my fine fragile hair.  Most recipes left my hair to dry or lifeless and oily.  Some all natural recipes even damaged and broke my hair. I was just about to give up and go back to my local salon with my head hung low.  Then I decided to not accept defeat and I started researching all natural shampoos on the internet. I indeed gave up homemade shampoo recipes after spending so much time, money, and effort over past twelve months, but I did not give up on using all natural ingredients. There are many all natural shampoos on the market, but this one caught my attention.  After researching the product, reading the reviews, and watching youtube reviews, I decided to give this company a try.  I purchased the shampoo and conditioner, and I am so glad that I did.  I am so pleased with this find.  My hair feels so clean and soft.  It looks amazing.  I did not use the conditioner yet but I am looking forward to it.  I will definitely purchase their Eucalyptus and Peppermint Balancing Shampoo soon. Love it, love it, love it!
