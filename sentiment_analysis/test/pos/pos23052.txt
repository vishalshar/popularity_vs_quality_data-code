I travel a ton for work and I'm tired of constantly eating unhealthy meals packed with unnecessary sugar. I ordered the plain peanut butter and that's exactly what this is. No hidden sugars (like some other brands I obsessively compared), easy to pack, easy to open, and really filling for a snack or meal. I put this on a banana, toast, or into a protein shaker bottle to make those protein powders more enjoyable. The price seems reasonable for the health benefits - I can grab a free banana from the hotel and add some peanut butter for ~$1.50 and that gives me a healthy option. Priceless. Sometime I do wish there was a crunchy version, but maybe that's to come (hint, hint).
