If you or someone you know has a nut allergy their cookies are awesome!I'm allergic to all nuts, and just about everything either has nuts in it, or is manufactured on the same equipment!And if you find nut free stuff it's lumped into the gluten free, and dairy free etc.Well I like my gluten and dairy, I just don't want nuts! These taste great, and their other flavors as well.Thanks Skeeter!!!
