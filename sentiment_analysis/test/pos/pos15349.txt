This isn't a mind blowing review, but it works exactly as I expected it to. I replaced by Hunter XCore and needed this to protect my Rachio as the sprinker system is wired to the side of my house. Fits perfectly, easy to install, the only thing I didn't pay attention to was that the white faceplate of the irrigation controller needs to be off for this to close properly.  It says so right on it, but who reads directions when you can get straight into playing with electricity.
