Gifted this to a close friend / pet lover who had her eye on a few different webcams, so she could keep an eye on her dogs while she was at work. Her dog and her boyfriend's dog are pampered and well-taken care for. She loved how the sleek design fit right into her adorable apartment. And the set-up for her Petcube was super easy and seamless. There was even live chat on the site to walk her through any set-up questions that she might have. The laser was fun to play with, and she sent me a hilarious photo of her dog sitting on her dining room table. What a funny surprise to see what her little buddy gets up to while she is away!
