I did extensive research before purchasing the LucidSound LS30's and am very glad that I did. This is NOT a cheap plastic, cheaply made, funky or stupid looking headset. These seem very well put together, not at all cheap in feel, construction or appearance, and if cared for, you should not have any issues with them breaking. If they do break it's most likely only due to misuse, complete carelessness or just being an idiot. They were very easy to set up and feel great even with glasses. The sound is excellent and for only $150.00 you would be hard pressed to find a wireless set that comes close, looks as good, and is so versatile, even for $100.00 more. The controls are simple, easy to use and took all of 30 seconds to get used to. They do exactly what they say they will do and I am extremely pleased with this purchase. I suspect the majority of the negative reviews are the result of either not taking care of them or expecting them to do more than they are advertised to do. I would gladly recommend these without hesitation. If anything changes I will update this review but I seriously doubt that there will be any issues.
