Very functional and holds my phone securely. I previously had magnetic mounts, but my new phone does not have a removable back where I can insert the metal plate; the only other option was to attach the metal plate directly to the back of my phone and I was not willing to do that. I was concerned about using a different type of mounting system and how easy it would be to get my phone in and out of it. It can be a bit awkward for me because I have small hands, but once I got used to how to operate it, it became easier to use. I cannot mount or dismount my phone while driving, but it's safer that way anyway :)
