It works well for me but from reading the other reviews it seems that what people expect from the product is not what it actually does.  Personally I find it very useful but I can understand that other people find it frustrating since people seem to expect a GPS style tracker and not a device that uses various technologies to answer two questions:  did my luggage make it on the plane and if my luggage didnt arrive at the airport I flew into then what airport is it in?LugLoc has two modes of locating your luggage:  Bluetooth and GSM.  The Bluetooth mode is useful for finding out if your luggage made it on the plane and for finding out if its on a carousel or in say oversized.  The way it works is you push the Bluetooth icon in the LugLoc app on your phone and if your luggage is close by youll see some bars showing just how close by it is.  So once you get on the plane and sit down you turn it on and if your luggage is loaded on the plane then the proximity display will show you its close by.  I usually do this after everyone is aboard but before they shut the doors.The GSM mode has a different purpose.  Lets say your luggage doesnt get on the plane and you arrive at your destination.  You can then send a trace (you buy traces in packages of 5, 10, or unlimited) and it will tell you what airport your luggage is in.  So if you left from Seattle and flew to Moscow it will tell you if your luggage made it to Moscow, is back in Seattle, or went to Miami.  Its not a GPS so it cant tell you exactly where your luggage is.  Instead it triangulates off of cell phone towers and gives you a general area which is good enough for knowing which airport its in.  Its important to know though that in order to be FAA compliant the LugLoc turns off when its moving (so it doesnt transmit in a flying plane) and only wakes up and responds to traces when its been stationary for 12 minutes.  So if you send a trace and your luggage is in transit then you wont get a response until it arrives at an airport and stops moving.  Similarly, if youre using Bluetooth to find out if your luggage made it on the plane with you its worth waiting to give your luggage time to get loaded and become stationary again.I do have a few small complaints about the device.  The first is you have to turn it on to charge it.  That means you have to remember to turn if off when youre done charging it.  If you forget then the device will remain on and be discharged when its time to put it in your luggage.  The second complaint is that it takes a long time to charge.  So if you do forget to turn if off after charging it and its now dead when its time to put it in your luggage then there isnt much you can do about it since it takes 8 or more hours to charge the device and you probably dont have that kind of time left before you fly.  However, these complains are small and in general I find it answers two questions I want answered when I fly:  did my luggage make it on the plane and if my luggage didnt arrive at the airport I flew into then what airport is it in?
