Got this to "encourage" myself to be more active, and it's amazing how much motivation one simple dial on a watch face can provide. If it wasn't for a blister problem with my right foot, I'd be hitting my goal every day, and I've still logged thousands and thousands of steps more in two weeks than I would have without the Activité. Really wish Health Mate (their App companion for the watch) had some method of tracking cycling, just to give more activity options, but I knew it wasn't there going in.Only downsides so far are the VERY weak vibration of the alarm (slept right through it the first time I used it, went back to using my phone) and some small issues with sleep tracking. The sleep tracking app on my phone that I've been using for years (Sleep Cycle) is usually more accurate in tracking when I fall asleep and actually wake up, where the Activité shows me taking longer to fall asleep and mistakes time spent reading just after I wake up for shallow sleep, even though it knows that I woke up when my phone alarm went off.Overall, though, I'm thrilled with my purchase. It's a good-looking watch that doesn't advertise its "smart" functions, and if you're looking for something less nerdy than normal activity trackers, any of the Activité options will fit the bill.
