After successfully treating my elderly feline (14 years) for an upper respiratory infection using antibiotics, I was dismayed when just four weeks later, she had a runny nose and was sneezing constantly.I ordered and used this product according to directions, doubling the dosage for her weight for the first 7 days. By day 5 her runny nose had cleared up and sneezes were no longer wracking her body constantly. By day 7-no signs of illness.I am continuing to feed my pet this product at the recommended normal dosage for her body weight because I feel that it did as promised: boosted HER natural immunity. NOTE: this cat is already on a partially raw home cooked diet, fish oil supplements and probiotics. This is part of a total health care regiment.
