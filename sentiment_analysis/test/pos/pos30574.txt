Purchased this for our GoPro and ABSOLUTELY love it!  We purchased it specifically for scuba diving.  It fits perfectly on our BC, but would also fit perfectly on a backpack strap.  We loved being able to take the attachment off and on to be able to get closer to sea life.  We were never worried about the go pro becoming unattached.  Before purchasing the product, I personally spoke with a representative from polarpro and they were some of the nicest people!  GREAT customer support!  Will definitely be purchasing from them again!  We actually purchased a red underwater filter through them, too, which we love!
