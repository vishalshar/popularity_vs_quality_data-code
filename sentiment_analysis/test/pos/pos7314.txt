I bought two OmieBoxes for my 7 and 10 year old sons and I am very happy with both of them.  They really enjoy being able to bring soup to school and I like having options besides sandwiches.  I am being much more creative with their lunches while also offering them healthier foods.  I would love to have another OmieBox that is a little larger for my older son!  Maybe by the time they get to high school that will be available :0)!
