On my first attempt, our mushrooms failed to grow. I contacted the seller via email and heard back the same day. They were really fantastic giving me growing advice and sent a new kit, one with an organic formula that was showing more consistent growth. I followed the directions exactly on the new kit. I got mushrooms growing in 4 days and harvested them within 10 days. For best growth, the mushroom kit needs to get indirect light, and lots and lots of misting. The mushrooms grow so fast, it's very very cool.
