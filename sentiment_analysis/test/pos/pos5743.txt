We played this game with 12 high school friends (Class of 1963) and had a blast! It was so much fun to hear all the side stories and explanations that came with each answer. Even after being friends for more than 50 years, we learned new things about each other thanks to T&D. We took turns answering each question and we only got through 12 questions in 2.5 hours! Each couple who played for the first time said they can't wait to purchase it for themselves, and also to give it as gifts to friends and family. Our daughter introduced us to the game and we often bring a pack of the cards out to dinner. Busboys, waiters and bartenders have all gotten in on the game when they overhear us asking questions and cracking up at the answers. We would recommend this to anyone. If you are considering this game - definitely buy it!
