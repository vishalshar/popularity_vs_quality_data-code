Purchased the motion sensor to pair with other devices, such as the siren, as a DIY deterrent to someone breaking in my home while I was away. Also wanted something that would send me an alert, on my phone, when motion was detected. This works well. The easy setup of pairing with your router didn't work, but the manual setup using my iPhone was very easy. The only real problem I had was setting up a schedule for when to automatically turn on and off. Through luck, I found that, even though I put in my time zone during setup, it is actually 4 hours off. Once I knew that, I could set it with the proper hours of operation I wanted. Haven't figured out how to reset the time zone. Happy with it so far.
