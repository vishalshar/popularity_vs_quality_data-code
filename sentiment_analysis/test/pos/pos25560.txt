I love these and I buy them all the time to eat at the office and mostly for backpacking.  The packaging could be made a bit lighter.  There has to be something that can be used besides those HUGE plastic screw top.  Don't get me wrong, I love that I can reseal the tube and save for later.  I only wish they were smaller tops.
