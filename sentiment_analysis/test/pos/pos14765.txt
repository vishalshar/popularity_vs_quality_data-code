Scooter is as advertised, runs fast. I used it for 4 miles daily commuting in NYC. After two weeks while riding on a bike lane some car cut me short. Electric breaks are too slow to respond to critical situation, so I felt on my back, sliding about 10 feet on my back. Thanks god I didn't break any bones just got some abrasions on elbows, ripped my pans and got some minor back pain. So I concluded that although it is great scooter but in New York City is very dangerous to ride. No matter how careful you are some careless driver will eventually cause you to crash.
