Such an awesome product! My boyfriend leaves early for work and some days the dog will get up with him, and others will stay in bed with me. He would wake me up every morning to tell me if he fed her or not, but I would never remember and have to text him. This has fullllyyyy fixed the problem! The silver had a little bit of discoloration but I could care less because I got it for function not looks. Bigger than expected which makes it easy to read. Magnets don't hold it up on its own so I just added the additional stickies to the back and it's solid!
