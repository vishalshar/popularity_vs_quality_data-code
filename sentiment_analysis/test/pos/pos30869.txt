I was really excited to buy this tank and plan to use it in my classroom this August. I bought it at the beginning of the summer, so I could work out all the kinks before my students got attached to a fish. Fortunately, my original fish is still healthy and active. When I first got the aquafarm, I planted the provided seeds to give me a couple of weeks to figure out a more long term plant solution (the wheat grass and radish sprouts are great because they grow really quickly, but have to be replanted every 2-4 weeks). The seeds sprout right away, which is nice, but it was such a mess to deal with. There were sprouts everywhere: in the tank, under the tray, stuck to the filter...not cool. At that point I decided that I had no desire to use seeds ever again in the tank, so I bought some mint and basil small plants and planted them. They have been in there about 3 weeks and are doing great. I keep the tank sitting on a window sill so they get plenty of light. I am so excited to share this experience and the responsibility of maintaining the tank with my 3rd graders.
