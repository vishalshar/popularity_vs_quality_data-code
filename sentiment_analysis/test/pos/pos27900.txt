I purchased two of these switches.  The first to operate my outdoor lights.  The second to turn off and on a ceiling fan.  I use the switch for the outdoor lights to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise.  I don't have to change the timer because it is all done automatically.  I really like the way that the light can be configured to automatically change the the seasons!!!  The second switch I use with my Amazon echo.  I can tell Alexa to turn on the switch when I need the ceiling fan turned on.  The combination of the Wemo switch and Amazon echo is pretty cool.  The switch does take up a bit of room in the switch box.  It also requires a neutral wire.  I installed them both my self with little difficulty.  The instructions are good and there is also youtube videos that show the install as well.  I suggest that if you have concerns about installing or compatibility that you review the youtube videos before purchasing.  These switches both connected without any need for me to do anything after a power loss.  The wireless setup was pretty simple.  I suggest that you make sure that you read the instructions...
