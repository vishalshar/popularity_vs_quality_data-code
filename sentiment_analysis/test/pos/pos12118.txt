This thing really does it's job! I have a memory foam mattress and without the cover I was overheating and sweating like mad! Literally soaking through my clothes and the sheets. Gross. I purchased this cover and was a little hesitant because I didn't know if it would mess up the contouring of the memory foam. It does change the contouring slightly but you can barely feel it. I still get all of the benefits of the memory foam and my back feels great when I wake up. Now I sweat much less and don't feel overheated by the mattress. And when I do sweat I don't wake up on a soaked pair of sheets, the mattress cover seems to absorb it. WIN!
