[EDIT 2: May 5, 2016.  It's been over a year since I've been using these tags, and I'm happy to report that since I've written about the problem of the tags falling off here, Golf Tags took it upon themselves to send me additional tags for free.  I've also replaced my grips and, thankfully, I have not had the problem of the tags falling off anymore.  I am keeping the 4 star ratings because I do enjoy using these tags to keep track of my game and hope that the software keeps improving in general.  I have written about this before, and I will re-write it here, the key to this product is having a smartwatch that you can pair with the app.  I now use Samsung Gear S2, and in one of my recent rounds, my smartwatch's battery died mid-way through the round.  Because I wasn't getting the immediate feedback regarding (1) whether I had correctly tagged my shot and (2) the distance of my last shot, I had to resort to pulling out phone on every shot, which got annoying really fast.  In fact, I stopped tagging my shots because I got tired of checking my phone on every single shot.  I can't say enough about how important the smartwatch makes the Golf Tag experience functional and enjoyable.  If only it were possible for me to tag the smartwatch instead of the phone.  I asked GolfPad about this, but apparently smartwatches (including my Gear S2) do not have the correct type of NFC sensor to allow this.  Maybe GolfPad should make their own golf watch to pair with these sensors?  That would be awesome!][EDIT: May 20, 2015.  I've played a few more rounds with this, and I've lost one sensor (on my 8 iron) already.  It fell off somehow and somewhere.  Moreover, when I was practicing at the range recently, the sensor on my 7 iron flew off on several shots.  Luckily, I was able to retrieve it, but now I make sure that I take the sensor off when I am practicing.  Regardless, I think this goes to show that the quality of the  plastic NFC sensors are rather cheap.  Good thing they give you one extra sensor, because if I lose any more, I will have to test how much the manufacturer stands behind their products.  For now, I will keep the ratings as 4 stars, but this could get lowered if any more sensors fly off the clubs.]Nice product with potential for getting better as the developers update the software.  I have a much more detailed review below, but the short version is: as advertised, Golf Tags allows you to accurately measure and provides you with key statistics of each of your shots, as well as key course information, as you play your round of golf.  As of now, Golf Tags works only with Android phones.  The downside is that Golf Tags requires you to tap your phone with your club on every shot, as opposed to a competitor golf GPS unit by Arccos which automatically keeps track of all your shots without requiring you to tap your phone on each shot.  (But, Golf Tags is $100 while Arccos is $400).  The upside of Golf Tags is that it provides you with immediate feedback on how far you hit your shot as well as keep track of your entire round that you can review later on your phone or your computer.  Moreover, if you happen to have a supported smartwatch, the entire Golf Tags experience is improved 100% as you can get the key necessary information immediately on your wrist without having to pull out your phone.  The bottom line is, if you can get passed the tapping requirement, as I have, Golf Tags is quite useful in terms of helping you accurately determine the distance of your shots under real playing conditions (again, especially if you have a compatible smartwatch).  Reviewing your shots after your round is similar to watching your game tape, which is a fun way to identify your weaknesses and strengths to help your game in the long run.  And as the developers improve the software and add more features, this product should only get better!Here is the long version of my review:(1) Hardware.  When I first received the Golf Tags box (super-fast delivery as usual thanks to Amazon Prime), the first thing I noticed was that it was extremely light - almost as if it was empty.  Upon opening the box, I realized why.  All you get are one small, square sheet of paper with minimal instructions and one small felt bag containing 15 identical blue tags (it appears they give you one extra tag).  The Golf Tags feel like cheap plastic pieces and have almost no design on them (other than the Golf Pad logo).  Golf Tags are virtually weightless and do not affect your swing.(2) Setup.  Installing the Golf Tags on the clubs is easy - you screw one tag onto the end of the grip of each of your clubs.  Then you launch the Game Pad app on your phone and pair each club with the phone via the app.  With Golf Tags, the pairing is done by tapping the tags of each club onto the NFC sensor of your phone.  This literally takes about 5 minutes.(3) Functionality on the course.  Because Golf Tags utilizes NFC sensor on your Android phone, each time you are about to hit your ball (or immediately after your shot if you prefer), you must tap the Golf Tag on the end of your club's grip to your Android phone (usually to the back of the phone).  Utilizing the phone's GPS sensor, the app will mark the spot of your shot.  When you are about to take your next shot, you again tap the phone with the Golf Tag, which (1) marks how long you hit your previous shot and (2) marks the beginning spot for your next shot.  You repeat this process until you putt out.  Your phone will either vibrate or make an audible ring tone to confirm that your tap was registered.  In my experience, I have found that most of the times the tap registers immediately, but sometimes you may need to tap it a few times.  This tapping requirement may bother some people as it does require you to add one more routine to your swing process.  Depending on the golfer, this may be a deal-breaker.  But I was able to get used to it by the end of my second round of play.In theory, tapping your phone with the tags is simple and easy because all you have to do is keep your phone in your front pocket and touch the back of your phone with the handle of the club.  This tapping process on every shot can be slightly annoying at first, but more importantly, can also be totally distracting in certain situations.  For instance, my first round using Golf Tags was rough because my Galaxy Note 4 has the S-view flip cover on it.  I found out the hard way that the S-view flip cover automatically shuts off the Note 4's screen, which also automatically shuts off the NFC sensor on the Note 4.  This prevented the Golf Pad app from recognizing my taps.  (Apparently, all Android phones automatically shut off the NFC sensor when the screen is turned off.)  The developers of Golf Tags have somewhat anticipated this and have programmed the app to prevent your phone from turning off the screen while you are running the app.  However, this does not work with the S-view flip cover.  Every time the flip cover was closed, it would turn off the screen, which in turn, turned off the NFC sensor.  This meant that every time I took a shot, I had to take my Note 4 out of my pocket, open the flip cover then tap the phone with the Golf Tags.  Obviously, this was very distracting, especially in putting situations where I would have to tap two or (gulp) more times in a very short span of time.  When I played my next round without the S-cover, this made all the difference in the world.  Now, tapping is not that annoying and, in fact, it feels almost automatic to me now - although I still have to take some care to make sure that the NFC sensor did properly register the contact.There is a competing GPS system by Arccos that has built-in impact sensors in each of the tags that automatically determine that you have hit your shot.  And via the Bluetooth connection, the Arccos app will automatically mark the placement of your shots using your phones GPS sensor.  As you can see, both Golf Tags and Arccos require you to have your phone on you while you play so that the phone's GPS sensor can accurately determine the location of your shots.  However, since Arccos only works with iPhones and costs $400, this may not be a good alternative for everyone.(4) Smartwatch.  If you have a smartwatch, such as Moto 360, Pebble or Gear S, the Golf Tags experience is significantly improved for two reasons.  First, you do not have to constantly take your phone out to verify that each of the taps was correctly registered because your watch will give you an immediate confirmation that a tap was properly registered.  Second, your watch will also tell you the key statistics, including how far to the green, how many strokes you've taken, and how far you've hit your previous shot.  In my opinion, the ability to use my Samsung Gear S smartwatch makes the whole Golf Tags system work.  Its fun to see how far you actually hit your last shot while getting helpful information such as the distance to the green just by looking at your watch.  [Heres a helpful hint if you have a Gear S: change the Wake-up Screen option in Settings to Last Screen so that the Golf Tags app will always be displayed first on your watch.]  The downside is that the ability to use the smartwatch is apparently a premium feature for which you need to pay on an annual basis.  While you do get one year of premium service for free with the purchase of Golf Tags, I think this is a big mistake on part of the developers.  You are already paying $100 to buy the tags, which are cheap plastic NFC devices that cost literally a few dollars to make.  The developers have every right to charge for the premium services of the Golf Pad app, but pairing the smartwatch with your phone should be a basic feature included in the purchase price of Golf Tags.(5) Cell Signal.  Golf Tags requires you to have either cell or wifi signal as you play for all the features to work.  In fact, if you are playing at a course that does not have any signal, you must click on "start the round" prior to getting to the course.  This will allow the app to load some of the course data that you need to be able to use the app and the golf tags.  According to the developers, without cell or wifi signal, the map view of the course will not work but the rest of the app should work like normal.  By comparison, Arccos will work without cell or wifi signal since you can pre-download the course onto your phone.  (According to the developers, downloading the course onto the Android phone is not currently allowed by Google.)(6) Battery life: Golf Tags do not need to be charged at all since they are simple plastic NFC sensors.  But, running the Golf Pad app on your phone will drain your phone.  My Galaxy Note 4, paired with my Gear S smart phone, was down to about 55% by the end of the round.(7) Software.  Golf Tags uses the Golf Pad app on your Android phone while you are playing your round.  Golf Pad app has been around for a while as a free golf GPS app, and as such, has robust features.  Adding Golf Tags will not only tell you how far you hit each of your shots, you can review the holes you played and visually see where you hit the shot (i.e., whether you hit the fairway or the green).  Golf Pad app also keeps your score for you.  You can easily make corrections to your score or shots as needed.To summarize, there are three things you will need to consider to determine whether Golf Tags is right for you.  First, do you have an Android?  Golf Tags works only with Android, so if you have an iPhone, this is not going to work for you.  Second, will you be OK with constantly tapping the club to your phone for each shot (and putts) you take?  If tapping the club to your phone is too burdensome for you, then you may want to look at Arccos (if you have an iPhone and dont mind spending $400).  Third, do you have a compatible smartwatch?  Without the smartwatch, Golf Tags works just OK.  But, with the smartwatch, the experience is 100% better as you spend less time worrying about whether you have correctly tapped your phone and you get immediate information about the golf course and your shots.  For me, using Golf Tags with my Galaxy Note 4 and Gear S smartwatch has made golf a little bit more fun as I can now keep track of my shots and review my round of golf anytime I want.
