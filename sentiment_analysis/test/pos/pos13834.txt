I love, love, LOVE Pique Tea. I've been traveling around the US recently, and because of that, it makes it really hard for me to sit at a restaurant and expect good tea. I'm the sort of person that prefers loose leaf teas and I brew it myself when I'm at home or at work, but when you're out, that's sort of difficult. I don't really want to pull out a gong-fu set or my personal tea strainer, because that stuff would have to go back in my bag, and ain't nobody got time for that.This stuff is simple. And it's brewed by Roy Fong, who is an actual Tea Master (he owns Imperial Tea Court at the Ferry Building, as well as the Berkeley location). I know I'm getting a good, consistent cup of tea every time, and all I really have to do is ask for some hot water and I'm good to go.If you're looking for Lipton, this may not be for you - but if you prefer loose leaf teas and you're out and about and don't have your strainers with you, this is a fine alternative. Plus, it's a really interesting conversation starter if you know your teas to begin with!
