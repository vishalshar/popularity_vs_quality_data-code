I cannot believe that I've finally found a NON sweet, great tasting snack bar.  The Srirach bar is not overly spicy, but rather it reminds me of a Planters Peanut Plank with a little heat thrown in.  I can't believe this thing has chia, flax and kale and still feels so very decadent.  If I could have given this product ten stars, I would have!
