The rubber seal around my car's windows had degraded, making it very loud and windy to drive on the freeway. The autoshop was going to charge me $600 to replace the seals, but I decided to try this first. I applied it and let it dry and it works PERFECTLY! I've been driving my car with the new Sugru 'seals' for around 3 months now, and they're still holding strong. They are both on the inside and outside of the car and are exposed to high speed and weather fluctuations and still look as good as the day I applied them.I also applied some to a charging cord where the rubber had split, exposing the inner wire. Good as new. Love this stuff!
