I love this product! With that said...I regularly use hair powder, and I wash my hair daily. If you've never used hair powder before, it will be an adjustment the first time you do, as it's not like any other type of hair styling product. If you're looking to add volume to get that messy look, or you want a "bump" but don't want to tease your hair, this is the product for you. You don't shake it on your hair; give it a finger tap, and work it through your hair (add more if needed).
