My cats will just about do back flips for these!My cats eat a raw diet, and I use these both as a treat and as an enticement  I crush them into a powder on my magic bullet food processor and sprinkle it over their meat  they will eat just about anything with this as a topper.If they have a stomach upset, I give these as a meal  OMG  it is a HAPPY DAY!!!!These are 100% Chicken Breast and nothing else  there are no preservatives, and no nasties whasoever. They arrive in great shape, unlike other Freeze-Dry items I have purchased from other Companies.For kitties that have gone off food and need an extra boost in their diet, these are a great and healthy way to give them those extra calories. When My kitty Lucky was sick for a couple of weeks, her vet told me it was ok for her to eat this on its own before going onto a balanced diet  she loved and she never dropped weight  it bought the time she needed to heal.Great product that can be used as a healthy treat, as a topper to entice kitties to eat more wet food (or to transition to wet or raw), to complement a diet.. without any of the guilt of giving them the over-processed carb-heavy treats available in the market today.
