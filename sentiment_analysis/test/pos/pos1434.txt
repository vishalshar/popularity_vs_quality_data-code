this is a fun gadget. Works great. Only wish it wasn't zoomed in permanently. Makes it aliitle hard to do close ups.I lost it in my first week and was disappointed but then i found it in the washing machine after i did a load. The case that they provide with it kept it safe and it still works. I was impressed. Didn't think it would survive the washer.
