Installation was easy since I was replacing a basic type that also had 8 zones. Setup was equally well thought out. I love it when the app on my Samsung walks you through everything. No manual needed for programming. Even my not-so-tech-savvy wife can use the app.The wires stay in much better than my Orbit it replaced. Well thought out design all around. Also connected to my Echo for voice commands, which is always cool, even though the app is easy enough.
