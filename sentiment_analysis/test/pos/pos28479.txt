Just used it in Ireland a little and it worked just fine.  It connected to the network relatively fast and the performance was good.  No problems at all.  The display makes knowing where your at easy to see and the phone app is also easy to add data if needed. I plan to use it in Greece soon, so I will see how it works there as well.I'm glad I bought it!
