It's great for mason jars - easy to pour. But a little awkward for fermenting with a cork and air-lock placed in the pouring spout (hole). It becomes top heavy and with any kind of significant movement, such as when you assessing the bubble volume, the cork/airlock fall off. I prefer drilling the hole and using a grommet in either a plastic or metal Mason jar lid.
