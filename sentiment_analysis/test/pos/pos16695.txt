Quite happy with this case! Prong's got it down with the hybrid style of this case. A couple things that could be improved that I've noticed with just one day's use:-The power button on the bottom has a few issues:  -- It's quite easy to bump with your pinky, at least with how I hold the phone, as this case does add some (nice) heft.  -- The plastic nature of the button itself rattles annoyingly whenever the phone vibrates, perhaps a silicon-esque button could replace this, or move the button to the back  -- Again, easy to accidentally start charging; a preferred method of turning on the external battery would be a held input rather than just tapping the button- The clear version I got is quite slick, definitely has a neat/different aesthetic. My two gripes with this are that it has a somewhat slippery finish to the plastic, and that the opposite facing LED shines through the PCB and shows up a green light, which was a bit confusing. Not a huge deal!- The bumper itself is also great, but the back clear plate could have a less "square" or sharp fall off into the section that shows the top of your iPhone's rear. Also, the buttons on the side could use some sort of tactile touch. It's a bit hard to tell where the power button is unless you've got it down to muscle memory/are looking at the device's bumper. The same goes for the volume rocker, and the silent switch is a bit difficult to get to, the opening could also do with less sharp edges!@Amazon: I purchased this on Tuesday with Prime shipping and checked the page Thursday for updates on the shipment. The case was on sale for 20% off, which isn't all too little of a deal with a premium case like this. I called customer support and they said they can't honor the sale; their suggestion was that I return the case and rebuy it at the lower price. I understand how the Amazon market works and all but this is a bit crazy! TO ANY THAT MISS THE SALE, PRONG OFFERS 15% OFF FIRST PURCHASE IF YOU SIGN UP FOR THEIR NEWSLETTER!All in all, a great case and I look forward to future improvements!
