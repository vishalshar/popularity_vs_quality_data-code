This is a nice sleeve to use and it fits my Macbook Pro 2015 13 inch.The color in the picture is wrong as it's an orange color and judging from the packaging it's meant for a 13 inch Macbook Pro and not newer Retina models.  As the non Retina models are bigger size wise compared to the Retina model Macbook Pro.The sleeve is slightly loose on the sides and around an inch of space left at the top.So if you're ordering this by the description that it works for the 13 inch Macbook Air/Macbook Pro be aware that from the packaging it just says 13 Inch Macbook Pro and the color isn't red but orange.I'm fine with the sleeve being loose fitting but I think Amazon should update the description and picture as some may not be okay with what they see from the picture.
