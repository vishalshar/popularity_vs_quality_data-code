So far not good.  Installed the two dimmers.  Attempted to install and connect to the bridge, got to step 5 of 6 and it "can not connect to your bridge" .  Told by Lutron service their "servers are down".  ( hours later I'm being told "this is what I've got to tell you, try later".  Someone previously stated 'not ready for prime time'. .. They're right.EDIT!  Jumped the gun...the servers are now back up and works great.  Very easy to set up and the app is great too!
