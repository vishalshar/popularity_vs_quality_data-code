Ive had many, MANY, bluetooth speakers and this thing HONESTLY amazes me every time I play it with how loud and clear it is at full tilt. I STRONGLY think you should check this thing out, its waterproof kinda floats super rugged and looks great!! Gets loud too!! I truely do believe you should really invest in this speaker considering how quality it is.I work on a lake and the dock I'm on sells these and my manager asked me to advertise it by playing it in the store, at first I thought it was an average Bluetooth speaker that talked a lot of game on the box but after like 4 months of hard abuse, throws in the lake, thrown as a football, and dropped on the concrete many times, this speaker finally broke in and sounds better and louder than any other I've heard! And still this speaker takes it! I will admit the range isn't the best but this Bluetooth speaker has two 1.5" tweeter/mid ranger drivers up top and one massive 1.5x2.5" subwoofer underneath handling all those lows! And damn does this thing scream! The $80 price you see on the box is most definitely worth it, I can garuntee that this speaker is the best you'll find, after broken in of course. Easily 110db.
