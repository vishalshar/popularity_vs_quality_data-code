I never liked the look of any of the other fitness trackers that looked like rubber bands on your wrist, so when I saw this, I thought it was cute and unique. It seems to be quite accurate in counting my steps but it doesn't always register my sleep patterns or when I get up in the middle of the night. I actually clip it inside of my shirt on my bra because it feels more secure here than wearing it on the necklace and it doesn't always match what I'm wearing. It does seem to have stretched out the metal clip a teeny bit because now when I clip it on my thin shirts at night for sleep it slides on the neckline. The bracelet it came with is only a s/m, it would be nice if you could choose which size bracelet you receive. Overall I'm quite happy with it and my husband says my app is much nicer than the one on his fitness tracker.
