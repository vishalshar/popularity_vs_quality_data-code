Looks great on the shelf, and infuses alcohol with a nice oaky flavor. I really like that I can leave it out on my home bar while its infusing. One thing is to make sure to follow the directions and wash it out well before use, as it has a bit of a smell right out of the box (but the manufacturer knows that and has you soak with water before adding liquor). Overall, turned some cheap whiskey into something I could drink on the rocks. Nice!
