This is such a great camera for watching your pet if you want a simple user friendly camera made for exactly that reason! I ordered the rose gold and it is a really nice finish while still looking cute! I really love that this is something that not only works well, but is designed to look very sleek and fancy on your shelf. I do wish they had a high gloss white option, but the rose was a really nice surprise!Setup is 10/10 very very easy to do, they really did a good job making it very painless which I appreciate. I have some home security cameras with app features and I wish they were as quick to set up as the petcube.I have 3 cats so I put this in my living room where they like to hang around so that if my friends peep in on my cube they can always spot a cat to give them a little exercise! The audio feature must be very useful for dogs, for cats it freaked them out a little but I think when I go away on vacation next time they will be a little happier to hear my voice! I also helped my mother get the app on her phone and she was thrilled to be able to pop in and talk to my cats or play with them a little.Camera quality is pretty good, although in low light it is lacking. Best for daytime spying!
