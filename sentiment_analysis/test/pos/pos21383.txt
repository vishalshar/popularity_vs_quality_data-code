As a guy who travels a lot, it's hard to remember to bring a comb. With the Go-Comb, I just leave it in my wallet and forget about it. It's especially helpful after I just slept on a red-eye flight and need to look presentable for a morning meeting. I even use the other side (with the holes) as a nail filer. I don't know how they make this thing, but it's super durable and just looks really cool. It a good conversation piece, too. Highly recommend, especially at this price point.
