Was back and forth based on reviews because there was mention of it slipping out.  I did not have that problem.  This mount was easy to install and looks great (I got the lime green) and works perfectly.  The design allows for the bottom to have the ear phone jack fully exposed on the iPhone 6.  Have used it on two long rides and so far so good.  Great product.
