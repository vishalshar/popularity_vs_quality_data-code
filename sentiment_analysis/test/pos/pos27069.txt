this is nice  and after using once, It is what I expected.  All I wish is color and that's what this is.  It does take a bit to dry so if you want to buy this and wear glasses...wait a about 5 minutes before you put your glasses on or you will get this mascara on your lenses!I will decide if I will buy it again when I use it more times
