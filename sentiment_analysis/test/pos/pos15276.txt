I needed a lock to use at the rock climbing gym. I didn't want to have to remember yet another code, and definitely didn't want to carry around a key while climbing, so I searched for something a bit more modern and found this guy. It uses NFC, which means I should be able to tap my phone to unlock it.So, let's get the basics out of the way: It's uses NFC to unlock... which means you need a phone that has both NFC hardware and that gives apps access to that hardware. Sorry iPhone users, this isn't the padlock for you. Android users with high-end phones, you're in luck. Of course, if you don't want to use your phone, it does come with 3 standalone NFC tags, which also work -- and easily attach to a climbing harness.The lock itself feels solidly built. It's not waterproof, but it could probably take a fair amount of abuse and still be okay. Supposedly there's a separate waterproof casing you can buy, but I couldn't find it. Aside from the NFC tap target, there's no other buttons. Just a slightly hidden USB port, useful as a backup power source if you let the battery completely die by mistake.Unlocking using the included NFC tags works like a charm. You click the lock to wake it up, tap one of the disc-shaped tags, and it responds with a beep, green LED, and a satisfying "click" to let you know the shackle's unlocked. When you close it back up, it beeps again to let you know it's locked shut.Unlocking with a phone is a little more tricky, if only because the lock's NFC antenna is a small target. Your phone's NFC antenna probably isn't where you think it is. On my Nexus 6, I found I had to hold the lock on the center-left side of the phone to get it to get a good read. Expect to spend the first 15 minutes after you unbox trying to find the perfect alignment. Don't get discouraged.The only part of this that's a downside is the Android app. In addition to unlocking, it's used to authorize extra phones, register extra tags (any standard NFC tag will do, by the way), or download the access logs. Which is all great... when the app isn't crashing. Which it likes to do. A lot. I never got account registration to work (crashes), but you can skip that and things still work. I also managed to somehow corrupt the local settings for my lock, but deleting it and re-registering using the master password fixed it.Just about the only thing that works reliably is unlocking, thankfully. So it's still usable, especially once you get past the setup process. Just make sure the app is actually open. For some reason it doesn't auto-launch the app for you, even though Android's NFC framework is totally capable of doing this.Would I buy it again? Totally. Once you get past setup, it's solid, and the convenience is real. But I'm still hoping that somebody writes an open source replacement app that's a little less frustrating when it comes time to change any of settings.
