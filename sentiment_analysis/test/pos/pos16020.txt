As a adult player. I recently bought the new and improved version from gripboost and boi. This stuff is probably the most useful way and easiest way to restore a glove. Save your money money from buying new gloves all the time try gripboost which is 55% cheaper than a new pair of moderate gloves. I'm really enjoys this product so that's why I'm rating this 5/5 also go check out his website at gripboost.com he has cool t-shirts and hoodies. Also customer service is very good.
