Um.... wow. I was a fan of another sound machine - one that sounds only like a fan and costs quite a bit. But that one developed a click - not big, but enough to bother me. Saw this one recommended in the reviews and I just have to say again. Wow. It is so tiny, but super loud. Ten sound choices (several fans, ocean, several white noise), so I could pick my favorite. Then you can turn the volume where you want it and angle the speaker. Also works as a blue tooth speaker. It does not have a plug - just comes with a short USB plug. I actually use a longer kindle USB plug on it with the adapter to plug it into the wall. EXCELLENT.
