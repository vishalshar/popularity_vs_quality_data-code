This little kit is a fun and educational escape from grocery store button mushrooms (at least for a while). I had my initial doubts over the soundness of my purchase when I first opened the kit. You are greeted by a compressed log of plant matter covered in a white mat of mycelia. At first glance it resembles a moldy piece of bread. However, I quickly got disregarded my prejudice (the majority of fungi are harmless) and soaked and misted the kit as was instructed.On day 3 (after having soaked), little dark-brown spots began to appear on the surface of the mycelia. These were the primordia and their growth was explosive. The package details are not exaggerating when they explain that the mushrooms double in size every day. As promised, I harvested my mushrooms 8 days after soaking. It is important to note that you have to pull on the entire stalk so that it may come off clean upon harvesting. If you choose to harvest by cutting the stalk with a knife you risk infecting the stump that would remain.Because I had never cooked anything other than grocery store button mushrooms, I went the safe route and only cooked the parts of the mushroom that had gills on them. The first taste was enough to convince me that I had made a very, very good buy. I'm a fan of white button mushrooms, but these oyster mushrooms are orders of magnitude more flavorful.These mushrooms have a bit of the savory essence of button mushrooms. However, what really amazed me was how much they tasted like nuts. It was like eating pecans and they were even sweet, too!The educational part of the kit came when I became obsessed with learning everything there was to know about these mushrooms. After all, the more you know about something, the easier it becomes to manipulate it to do what you want. My kit has not gone into a second flush and it has been about two weeks since the first. However, it looks very healthy (the mycelia have covered all of the bare spots) and I'm pretty sure that it will go back into reproduction mode soon. I'll try to update on this.Overall, this kit is fun to watch and learn from. I recommend it to anyone who loves mushrooms and knowing where their food comes from. It is fascinating to know that you are indirectly consuming the energy stored in useless plant matter (useless because we can't digest it directly). If you choose to purchase this kit, be aware that this is a living organism and does require a bit of your attention for its water needs. Also, be patient with our fungus friends. They will not always fruit when you want them to (as I have learned), but the manipulation of their environment can lead to better and more frequent fruiting (also part of the caring process).
