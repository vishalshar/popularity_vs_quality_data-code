Our whole family loves these chips! We make sure to buy these whenever we're going camping or on a road trip, but this is actually an item I would like to just put on a monthly repeating order. My husband likes the Granny Smith ones, I like the Fuji ones, but the ones with cinnamon we all think are the best! And the most amazing thing about these chips is that there is only ONE ingredient - Yes, just one AWESOME ingredient - Organic Apples!!!! In todays world of page long ingredient lists, who knew that only one ingredient could taste so darn AMAZING! We will continue to buy these very often.
