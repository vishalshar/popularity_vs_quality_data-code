Tastes good, doesn't leave you hungry after a bottle. Unfortunately, I got my package right around the time Soylent's food bars started making customers sick, and Coffiest was revealed to not contain the advertised vitamin count. So even though I enjoyed the product, I'm not convinced I got the nutrition I paid for, hence the docked star.
