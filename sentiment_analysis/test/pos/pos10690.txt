The fitbark is a great way to monitor your dogs activity and make sure they are getting enough exercise. We personally have used it for recovering from surgery to be able to see progress in her healing. If she got a lot of points one day and then the next day not very many we knew the day before was too big of a day for her. Over time we could see weekly a range she thrived in, so later in the day if she wanted to play and her points were still below that I knew we wouldn't be over doing it. Extremely helpful, and fun to see so we will keep using it now that she's better from surgery.My one complaint and reason for not giving 5 full stars is Fitbark either needs to STOP advertising this as waterPROOF, it is at best water resistant or they need to fix the problem. I shouldn't have to stick my fitbark in a bag of rice for two days every time it gets wet and pray it comes back to life. People on their FB page are constantly posting different ways of keeping it dry during water activities. The most popular seems to be sticking in inside a tied water balloon and that works. So there are ways around it not being waterPROOF and still being able to use it around water. Just frustrating they advertise it as safe when it is not!
