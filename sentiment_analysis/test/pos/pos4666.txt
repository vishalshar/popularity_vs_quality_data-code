Dream Water is one of those natural products that actually works. I don't know why or how. If I try taking melatonin and/or 5HTP instead of dream water, it does not work as well. I'm not crazy about the price on the waters, so I wait until sales and try to stock up on a few of them. But now that they've made this powder, it's a no-brainer. Very affordable and it works exactly the same as the actual water version. There are now dozens of products just like this on Amazon where they pay these people to post phony reviews. I actually bought this at retail and will continue to do so because it works so well for me. No one bribed me to write any of this.
