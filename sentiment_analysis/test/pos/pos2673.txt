I LOVE these! I ordered the spinach and was devoted at first bite! I actually said, "Mmm, this is so good!" out loud upon trying it, and the people around me were looking at me, saying, "What?! Spinach?"I could probably eat the entire box in one day. Love how with just one strip you get 1/2 your daily serving of fruits and vegetables (meaning when I eat two in a day I know I don't need to worry if I've eaten enough vegetables during the day).The strips are not what one would normally think of in terms of "fruit leather." These are far less sticky and much more easy to unwrap and bite.I am now ordering the other flavors! I highly recommend you try these. They're also a great way to make sure kids get their proper serving of fruits and vegetables. Seriously, give this to a kid and don't say it has spinach, just let them try it and they will love it!
