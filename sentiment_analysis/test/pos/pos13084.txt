Nice product as usual with QuadLock products. I can't recommend these enough for their bike mounts. I researched my butt off looking for something I would trust to hold my phone on my bike and this is it. There are others out there, but the cases are huge. As soon as summer hits, I put this case on and leave it. It's nice and slim, and when I put it on my bike I have complete confidence it won't fall out. I got one a year or so ago for my Galaxy S5. When I just got this one today for my iPhone 6s, I immediately noticed the case itself has a more "matte" feel to it. The other one felt smoother, but I like this feel better. Also, this one has a felt-like material on the inside to better protect the phone back. The other one didn't.
