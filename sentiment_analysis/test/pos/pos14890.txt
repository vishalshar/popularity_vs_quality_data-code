I have loved to use differently lacing patterns for a long time and I used to simply use normal laces which I would tie off and then burn the end to melt it together. When I came on Amazon to buy a pack of normal laces I found that I had fallen far behind the times and that there were tons of lacing "systems" now that offered cool looks, practicality, while not requiring me to destroy a set of laces to make it semi-permanent. Hickies were my first purchase in this new marketplace. I've only had them for about a day so my feelings are still preliminary but here are my thoughts.First off, my issues: When looking at these one of my primary concerns was how an item that boils down to an elastic band could be "adjustable" as I saw claimed it turns out that my fear is somewhat justified. Adjustable is a bit of a stretch (ban puns!) since what is really meant is that by using different lacing patterns you can adjust how tightly they fit. For example, using a Hickie for each set of eye-holes (resembling a typical bar-laced shoe) is their "regular" fit. I wear a mens 9.5 normal width so my feet are far from big but even so using that pattern on a pair of Converse was extremely restrictive and uncomfortable. The biggest annoyance is that effectively by design in order to see how they will work on your feet you have to try a wide range of different lacing patterns. I ended up using a bar across every other set of holes but it took a lot of experimenting and I suspect that if I were to try and use them in a different shoe I'd need to do it all over again.Now for the positives: Once I found a good fit they are easy to get on and off but still very secure. They look very good and there are definitely enough provided for most shoes.As for whether I would buy them again, that is a tough one. I don't think they are the be-all-end-all of lacing. They're very good but I think I'll probably give something else a try before deciding I want these on all my shoes (particularly since they don't seem very practical for ankle or higher boots).
