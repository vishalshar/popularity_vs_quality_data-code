This is definitely a must-buy router.I got this two weeks ago.  This is a tiny, nicely designed router, which can fit in anywhere in your home.Your guests and family members can simply log in your home network with just a "kiss" to the router with their devices.I am really tired of keeping telling guests my wifi password.And you got notifications when any new devices connect to your network at the app(iOS and android), which definitely improve your home wireless security.The network configuration is very simple.  You can use it as your main home wireless router or an wireless extender if you had already got one.I highly recommend to download & install their companion smartphone app, which works perfect and gives you all the controlling options.FYI, if your home wireless is DHCP mode, which means you don't need to enter ISP account and password when connecting to the Internet,then you should chose "MORE"->"DHCP", at the portal page when you connect to the router first time using your phone.The network is stable and give me 30M out of 50M of my Cox network. For my old router, I can only get to 50M using 5Ghz, while only around 10M at  2.4Ghz.  This router must have some self optimization scheme inside to make sure you get a great signal.Generally, I get a good signal at my apartment using just one. If you have a large house or apartment, you may need two or more to cover all the area.I would recommend this router to my friends.
