I've been a Misfit Fan for a while, having bought 2 Flashes (which have unfortunately each made a journey through my washing machine and dryer) and have bought my girlfriend one of the original Shines.I initially held off on purchasing this one after reading the Amazon reviews of the now discontinued version of this product. Once I saw that they had a new version with an improved version of the wristband, I decided to get one and put it through a test over the weekend to see if the new wristband really was better than the previous one.I took it to a rave.And to my surprise and delight, the device DID NOT fall out of the wristband, despite the fact that I was dancing and waving my arms around like a maniac and spinning glow sticks on strings for about 6 hours straight.  The only potential loss I had for the night was when the string on one of my glowsticks caught the clasp and unbuttoned the wristband (my fault).  I caught it before it hit the ground, put it back on, and continued with my lightshows and dancing for the rest of the night with absolutely no problems at all.The next day I took it to the pool at my gym.  I already trusted the device to be waterproof like my previous two Flashes, but I wanted to be sure that I could swim with it without it falling off.  I did my normal 80 laps in the pool without a single issue.What I like about the device:The Tracking - Yes I know the speedo shine does better on tracking my swimming progress, but this device satisfies my need to see my general progress quite well.  I really like how this device shows you how much progress you've continued to make after you achieve your initial goal, something my Flashes did not do.The Capacitive Touch - It is so easy to make this device light up and check your progress.  It was easy with the Flash as well, but I always felt like I was pressing it into my skin when I would check it.  The Shine 2 eliminates that with just a nice, light tap.The Bluetooth Sync - The Shine 2 syncs with the app on my smartphone very quickly and feels like it maintains a more stable connection than my Flashes did. And the blue whirlpool syncing lights look cool too.The Overall Design - As usual with Misfit, the Shine 2 is very lightweight, though I find this one to be more comfortable to wear than my Flashes. The Wristband snaps on more easily, and despite adding an additional piece to the wristband to support the device, it doesn't make the device itself feel bulky at all.The Smart Alerts and Notifications - I liked how the Shine 2 reminded me to get up and move around a bit while I was binge watching netflix after such an intense weekend.  I really don't want to become a couch potato again.  Additionally, I'm going to be using the text and call notifications to help keep my phone in my pocket rather than on my desk while I'm at the office.What I think could be better:Activity Tagging - I wish I could activate an activity (like swimming) before I begin my workout rather than having to go back to the app and manually change it.  This was something that I really liked about my Flash as it helped me keep a more accurate eye on my progress without having to check it on my smartphone.  I'm using an Android Smartphone, so the feature may exist if you're using an iPhone, but I can't say for sure.Ultimately, the Shine 2 was a great upgrade from my Flashes, and I'm happy to see that Misfit was able to solve the wristband problem.  It's a great tracker for people trying to keep an eye on their general progress throughout the day.
