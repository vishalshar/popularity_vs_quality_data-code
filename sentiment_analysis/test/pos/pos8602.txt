I got this for my husband and he loves it. Great for large bags of birdseed, pet food, charcoal and more. Works great for carrying and pouring big bags without making a mess of your clothes (if you usually hold the bag with both arms like me) and gives much better "aim" when filling bird feeders, bowls, etc. than pouring straight from the bag. Loved the fact that this type of clip didn't punch holes in the bags. A neat little gadget!
