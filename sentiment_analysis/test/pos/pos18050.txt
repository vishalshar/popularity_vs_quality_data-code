I love primal pit paste. Finally, I'm able to ditch the traditional deodorant. I feel better knowing I am not clogging my pores with aluminum and preventing my body from doing its job! I also am happy to not be poisoning my body with parabens! I love the fresh feminine scent of jacked up jasmine. The scent is not over powering by any means. I barely notice it because you only need to use a small amount of product with each application.
