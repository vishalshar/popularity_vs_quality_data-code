The app is really nice.  Lots of helpful articles to help you set up your sprinkler system.  You get to name your zones on the app and take a picture of it .  Very nice UI and flexibility at every step of the way.  Rachio is also doing frequent improvements.  It's like Nest but for your sprinkler system.Great integrations (IFTT).  This is useful if you want notifications, say via email rather than the app notifications that your sprinklers are doing something.  We run ours early in the morning and I have to keep my phone on as I'm on call.  I don't like notifications that my sprinklers are running at 4am.  If you have a local weather station (Netatmo) it integrates with that as well.If you have a zone with a mix of sprinkler heads you kinda have to just pick something or create a custom sprinkler profile.  Not Rachio's fault or anything they can do outside of a bit of guidance.  But when you're setting it up you have to make a choice or have a rain cup and figure it out.Here's the main problems:* Doesn't seem to look at rain historically when deciding to run or not run, so if it's been raining hard all week it but it got a day off it might still run* Won't work without being connected to the internet.  It seems like it should download the schedule regularly and be able to run off of the last one.  Perhaps alarm you if it's gone X amount of time without syncing.  It's not like there could be that much data to save locally to the device that would throw the cost up significantly.That being said about the required internet connection, the service is free.  It's not like the Kwikset Kevo where to make it actually work you need to pay an extra $100.
