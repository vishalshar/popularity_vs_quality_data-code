I'm in the market for a new AC and wanted to get a feel for potential savings so started looking for an energy monitor for just the AC.  When I came across this product I thought why just monitor the AC when I can monitor the whole house. Installation was pretty easy (I did it myself).  I prelabeled the breakers and prewired the CTs to the terminals; cut the main power to the breaker box and snapped on all the CTs.  The CTs separate on one side so they just snap open, place around the wire and snap closed.  For 240 circuits you just use one CT and in the software identify it as a 240 VAC circuit.The brain needs to gets its power from the breaker attached to the receiver.outlet as it sends the information over the house wiring. I preferred the non wireless to wifi or ethernet connections as these wouldn't work where the breaker panel is located.I've had the unit installed for about 2 months and already I've learned alot about what is costing me money.  I can actually tell when and how often the fridge cycles on, when the Keurig is cycling to maintain temp, when the hot water heater kicks in.The software is a free web based app and no information is stored on your PC (bummer).You can see all power usage or individual circuits. In general the web app is intuitive and provides the basics.  I would like to see more data export options in the future.
