I absolutely LOVE these lights!  I was worried that they wouldn't be as adjustable as I'd like but thankfully, that isn't the case here.  I purchased two and use them in conjunction with another LIFX light (color changing variety) and a Magic Home light.  My Amazon Echo does a fantastic job using them together, like "alexa turn on the lights" and she'll turn all of them on, not just one brand over the other.  All in all, they're fantastic lights.The only con that I can think of is that every now and again, I have had to reset them because they stopped taking commands from my Echo and the app wouldn't work.  It's a simple fix but it does take about 5 minutes to reprogram all my lights and get them working again.  It's not a huge deal, but it's something to consider.
