This unit surprised me in how easy it was to back up my iPhone 5s files. I was changing cellphone carriers and needed a way to transfer my old iPhone contents into the new iPhone. Now I plan to use it regularly to archive a backup of contacts and to offload pictures so as to clear up space on the new iPhone. It's too bad that Apple is so closed minded with their products. My older Palm Centro would link to my laptop and I could create and/or edit phone contacts on the keyboard of the laptop and then transfer back into the Palm Centro - same with other cellphone information/files.
