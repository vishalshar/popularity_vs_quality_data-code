Let me start this review saying I went through 5 headsets looking for the perfect one. I started with the Playstation Gold, which sounded good but felt like they would snap any second. Next I tried the PX4 Turtle Beach, which I liked but also felt flimsy and bulky. I tried the Hyper X Cloud II's which were really good but sounded too low, also I wanted a surround sound headset. Next I tried the Lucidsound LS 30 and fell in love, despite the lack of surround sound. When I saw this was coming out in a few weeks, I decided to go with the LS40, which is the same as the LS30 with surround sound and a few new features. Overall, I decided on these due to durability, volume control, and surround sound quality.The build of these headphones is solid, with a metal band going around the entire frame. They don't feel cheap whatsoever. Leatherette covers the top that rests on your head. It seems that Lucidsound really wanted to make a durable, lasting headset. I also liked the pouch that comes with the headphones, giving it some protection in a nice bag.Lucidsound headphones all look gorgeous. They're not designed to look like the typical "game" headset (techy, lights, sci-fi looking) but rather something you can wear out and listen to music without anyone looking twice thinking you're wearing a game headset. The volume controls are built into the sides of the ear cups, allowing you to rotate them for game (right) and chat (left) volume. This adds to the "non-gamer" headset look as it has very few buttons on it, giving it a sleek look. Lucidsound also added a red accent to the black leather that goes around the headband. Overall, they're a very good looking pair of headphones.When I first tried the LS 30's, I was blown away by the clarity of the game sound quality and the volume. These features are all back with the LS40 with added surround sound mode. A small button under the right ear cup allows you to change modes from stero, game surround sound, and other modes. When you push the button, a voice will tell you what mode you choose. I tried them in stereo first, and was blown away the second I adjusted to surround sound. Playing Titanfall 2 I could clearly hear the things immediately close to me amid the chaos of titans and explosion around. I could identify each sound, from reloads to footsteps, even though I was hearing all the other noises the game has to offer. The LS40 gets very loud, but never once did the quality of the sound break. Always sounded great.The microphones on this are built into the headset, but it also includes an attachable boom mic. You can actively hear yourself the way others hear you. This surprisingly is not distracting at all and you can adjust this volume as well. It's helpful to know if you're too low to your friends or sound like you're shouting. The clarity on the mic is also fantastic.Lastly, setup is extremely easy. A USB dongle is inserted into the front of the PS4 with a wire that reaches back into the digital audio. That's pretty much it. You turn the headset on and it will sync immediately to the PS4 and you're immersed in the sound.
