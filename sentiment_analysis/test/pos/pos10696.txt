So far so good! I ordered this for my pup because I know I am being a lazy pet parent and wanted to see how much exercise he is missing out on and to see how much he sleeps while I'm at work. Came super quick and it's really easy to set up. I can't wait to get home to see how my baby was while I was out (we do not have the wifi receiver so I can only see his progress once I get home and sync with him). He is only 9lbs and I love how the tracker is super light and cute. I also love how Amazon customer service replied to my concerns and fixed them immediately. I am so glad I purchased thru Amazon.Update: the Fitbark does everything it says it does but the frequency of having to charge it seemed to increase? Maybe it was user error but it was a hassle having to charge it twice a week. Their customer service (Fitbark) was remarkable and helped a lot. Have to change to 4 stars just because of battery.
