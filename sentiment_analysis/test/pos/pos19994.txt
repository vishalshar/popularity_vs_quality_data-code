I am in love with this camera!! It's so comforting to be able to look in on my kiddo and my dog while I'm not home! This camera has great quality and even in the dark it is crystal clear. I am able to look in from an app on my phone. It's really simple to set up and it's ready to use. I would highly recommend this camera. You can use your finger to slide across the screen to move the camera. You can add viewers to view the camera so my wife is able to look in also. You can control what the viewer is able to do and control. There is a 2 way speaker so you can listen and talk.I received this product for free or on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. I received no monetary compensation and I am not required to give a good review in order to have received my discount. I write my reviews as honestly as possible, as I personally rely heavily on reviews when deciding to purchase an item or not, thus understand and respect the need for honest reviews. Being given a discount to review an item will never influence me to rate higher or lower than I would have otherwise done so if rating an item I wasn't compensated for.As I do frequently review products, it is important to me that my review history, as well as my integrity within it, is shown to be helpful to customers. Thank you!
