The AirJamz product is shaped like a guitar pick and is a little larger than an actual pick. It comes set in a nice gift box. The instructions state that you need to download the AirJamz Music app in order to make the product work.The app downloaded very easily to my iPad Air and required me to activate my Bluetooth to find the device. After it pairs, you are ready to play. Hold down the small button on the pick for a few seconds and it's music time!As you move the pick up and down, the music will play. The faster you move, the quicker the tempo is on the song.The app itself has different song genres, from rock to classical to country. When you select the type of music, you have an option of four different instruments to play. Clicking on the 'on' button will change the instrument. The app also allows 3 additional instruments with the touch of a finger to your iPad or iPhone screen. But, you can also have multiplayers if you have multiple AirJamz picks.I had a blast playing with it. My young niece loved it after she learned how to flick her wrist and then played with it for about 20'. My grandson, who is 4 years old, played with it for over an hour.  After a quick demonstration of the software, he was able to play the instruments with the supplied background music.  At first, he was a little embarrassed because everyone was watching him.  So we left him alone with it and he made some amazing sounds!  I even hooked it up to a small speaker and he was in love.  He spent over an hour playing with it; changing instruments, changing tempo, changing background music, all on his own.  He even learned how to hold the pick at a certain angle and it held the note like a real rock guitar player.My husband was not impressed. He was a drummer in a rock band years ago and the device didn't make sense to him. He then realized that it was just a pick that changed the tempo of recorded songs.  My younger son, who is a programmer, was very impressed with the software.  He was really impressed with the interaction of the pick and the sounds.  He really enjoyed choosing different genres and playing with the different instruments.I can see where the pick could be short lived, but it does come with 25 different songs. I'm sure young kids will have a blast with the AirJamz because they can make "cool" music with the flick of their wrist.
