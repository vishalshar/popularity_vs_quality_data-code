Am Ã— military with many years,of whear from service time and life at sea as a Merchant Marine. I feel lucky I found this product as it has given me back my independence. The cane  sits and the walker gathers dust. I use the bike all the time. I can now go any where around town in and out of stores all day if I choose. I am very polite in stores and all ways give the public the right of way.... No complaints at all.  this is not a extreme sports bike. I would like to see it in some forms of colors that honor our new vets ...I like it's small footprint and you can fold and walk with it anywhere... I have been allowed to use it inside all stores. no more drive around looking for parking with short trips to the local store. This bike has given me back a quality of life I thought I had lost forever...THX URB-E Team.
