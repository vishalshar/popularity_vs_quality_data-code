This is a very good product. My pre-teen kids loved putting it together, and enjoyed it. They got tired too soon though (blame it on video games). I would've liked for them to use this more, so that they learn while playing. I bought 2 of these, but returned 1. I'm still giving it 4 stars because that's what the product deserves. I also have to give a very good rating of Amazon for processing the return so quickly. Kano will not accept any return if the box has been opened.If you want to give it a test run before buying it, go to Kano.me first and see if your kids have any interest in coding.
