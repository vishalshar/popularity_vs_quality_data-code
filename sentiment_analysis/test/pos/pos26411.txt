I just received this and got to putting things together immediately. I love it, I think it's a great idea, but I had a number of issues with the product right off the bat. There doesn't seem to be enough connector cables, first off, to do anything mildly complex, and I feel a push-button would be handy as well for a drum synthesizer (I noticed the lack in the parts list, so I ordered a pressure sensor, which has worked alright. Great for other fun noises, too!). Secondly, the magnets don't hold together quite as well as one would hope, so occasionally, pressing on a key or turning a knob makes loud noises in the speakers as the connection breaks. Lastly, the octave selector on my keyboard has a bad connection somewhere, so it's always at the lowest octave (maximum resistance) unless I push on the variable resistor just right. Unfortunately, this being the main HMI in the package, it handicaps the kit rather severely.I'd love to be able to recommend the kit, but due to the issue with the magnets, I feel I can't. Great for learning, but frustrating if you want to have a working project in the end. The broken part was a huge letdown, too.UPDATE: There are mounting boards available that I was unaware of, so if you have an issue with your project coming apart too easily, a solution exists. Also, the customer service was very helpful. Getting the defective part replaced was quick and painless to say the least. I'd still recommend getting extra connectors and some sort of push button along with this product, but it seems the remainder of my gripes have been addressed. Very likely to pick up a few additional pieces.
