This is exactly what I was looking for! I do not like for mascara to be obvious and this is amazing at just simply darkening the lashes and brows with a tint rather then caking them with black goop. It is great for also shaping eyebrows in that it acts like a type of gel. I 100% recommend this stuff!!
