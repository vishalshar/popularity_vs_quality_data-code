Inexpensive. 4 1/2 Stars. It literally is easy as placing an 8-oz. mug beneath the k-cup the filling with top container with hot water, and pushing down to squeeze the water through the cup. My only complaints would be it leaks as long as you have water on the top (fix this by keeping a mug underneath) and that it only allows a small cup (8-oz.). It gets five stars still because time saved & easy clean-up!
