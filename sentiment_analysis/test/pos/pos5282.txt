Ok so I have been using it for the past 5 days, the quality of the prints is amazing even in medium quality, you can hardly see the layers, so obviously when you use high quality they are almost invisible.The printer is stable, very good build quality and the software is very easy to use, although it is limited and sometimes slow.The new spool holder still sucks, so I highly suggest to print a different one.This is my first printer and I really liked it and recommend it.If I had to say something negative would be the load/change filament process, it is very tricky to get it right, and I actually clogged the extruder while doing it(very easy to fix).The support team is amazing, they are very friendly and they reply really fast.Im very happy with it.
