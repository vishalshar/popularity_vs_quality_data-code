This set was purchased to be used at home during game design. I consider the faces too cluttered for use during game play. The faces are not unreadable, but when the action is fast and fluid it does tend to slow down number recognition, and this multiplies slowing play slightly. I do enjoy them while contemplating various machinations to be used against my players.
