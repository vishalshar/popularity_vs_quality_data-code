These are a little hard/crunchy (my dogs teeth are getting too old for that) but they soften if I add a little water. I bought another brand in a pet store and it had much more dark chewy strips in it which I didn't like, so now I'm only getting these. They're made in US, only one ingredient and you get a lot for the price!
