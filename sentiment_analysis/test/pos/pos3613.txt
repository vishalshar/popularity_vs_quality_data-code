Fairly good for the price, particularly for those of us who cannot afford a 3D printer. It is easy to set up out of the box. I gave it as a Birthday present to my 16 year old daughter and she was up and running before I had time to help her, which is not normally the case with non-software items. Going vertical with the "pen" takes a little practice, to get the hang of how much the extruder can handle before tearing a thin strand. The smoothing tool was hard to get both on and off and does not come with a tool designed to do it, so keep some small scale long-nosed pliers near for this purpose. Also try and buy black and white plastic replacement strands before starting, it is amazing how necessary they become. Overall, a very good purchase, hopefully MakeBot or some competitor will come up with a "true affordable 3D printer for the people", perhaps they actually forgot how poor "we real people", especially this of us overseas, who have to pay even more taxes on top of items generally only available in the US, Europe or Australia (so much for FREE TRADE)  truly are!
