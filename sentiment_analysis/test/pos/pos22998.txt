I've been using these for about a week, and so far so good. I wear a woman's 9.5 wide width and have a high arch and instep, but a narrow heel.  Using their instructions as a starting point, I was able to play with the configurations to get them to work for my weird shaped feet.  I can slip them on and they are still tight enough that the shoes are still supportive I'm not worried about walking out of them.
