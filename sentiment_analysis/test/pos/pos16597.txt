We ordered two of these cases for our 5 and 6 year olds since they are not all that careful with our ipads.  The cases are rubbery and make it a lot easier to grip and carry it around.  Now they have a handle to hold instead of trying to remember to be careful all the time!  The case is easy to get on and off, but I don't see the iPad falling out.  The power and volume buttons are cleverly done and easy to use.  The pink is more raspberry than expected, but my daughter loves it anyway, and the yellow is very cheerful.  These are a very decent option!
