I SO wanted to love this product...Their branding & customer service is really fantastic! It is a quality product with the Coolest.Branding.Ever. You will grin when you open the box! However, I was personally not too keen on the taste. Many self-proclaimed "coffee snobs" who reviewed the product, love it. So I am fully open to the possibility that it's just me and my pedestrian coffee sensibilities that weren't a good match. It's also pretty expensive. I have since tried and really loving Cool Brew Coffee Concentrate, which costs a lot less and tastes just like Starbucks, but smoother.  But still...you should give Bizzy a try & see if you like it.
