This is a two sided review.  I got this to play with 3 generations of family over Thanksgiving.  The two men refused to play... that is to say put in the mouthpieces... (party poopers).  Everyone else, rolled their eyes and did it.  We were laughing so hard we could hardly talk even without the mouth pieces.  I just labeled baggies and everyone washed theirs, and put it in the bag for next time.  Our nine year old grandson wanted to keep playing over and over, he was laughing hysterically!  Once you get over how ridiculous everyone looks, it's really quite fun.  We will work on the two PPs who seemed to have pride issues of trying to talk like that.... but one was calling out guesses from another room, and the other came in to help guess but still wouldn't wear the mouthpiece.  The grand kids LOVED it!  And that was really the point, so it was a win!
