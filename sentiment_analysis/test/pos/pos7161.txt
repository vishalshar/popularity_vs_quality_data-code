Amazing, when I ordered this I wasn't sure what to expect, but when I received it and took it out of its box, I knew I was holding something that is very well designed and thought out.Hardware:If I could describe the physical properties of this light bulb in one word, it would be Quality.The product has an excellent weight, and nothing feels cheap from how it is constructed to the materials chosen. It doesn't feel like it is going to break or come apart, very solid and reliable.The brightness of the light is nice as well, only ordering one of them and replacing 4 LED light bulbs in a fan fixture with only one bulb, I could notice a slight difference but amazingly still lights a larger room with no problem. The colors it produces not only fills the room but is completely customizable, literally any color you want and you can even change the saturation and brightness of that color with a very intuitive and easy to use color wheel.Software:The Ilumi app in one(or two) word(s) would probably be Thought out.Setting up the light bulb was as easy as making an account, with only an email and password in which I have not received any emails or spam from, and connecting to the bulb by taping and naming it. The app interface is very similar to apple design but with a dark theme, if you are using an iPhone or IOS everything here will feel very comfortable with siding to turn on and off lights and features and holding down to edit names or delete the bulb from the app. Even is you are using Android it is very intuitive and easy to use while still giving full control.While I did have some crashes with the app and did unload its self from memory (unsure if that was Android M or the app) occasionally making some features less convenient, which can be fixed with updates, the app still is nice to use and still does everything as advertised.?The Features that this bulb offers compared to some other smart bulbs are great! They work just as you would expect them to and are versatile, you can set up times that certain lights change color, turn off, etc... I found torch, where as you walk into a room the lights turn on and when you leave the light turns off, the alarm, turns on the lights to wake you up instead of an annoying sound, and shake to turn on/off to be most usefull for me. Other features like music sync and Circadian (changes the light color throughout the day to feel more natural, which I kept on) work as you would expect even offering more configuration like the type of music your playing. While I wish the music sync provided more app compatibility with apps such as YouTube Music and Soundcloud, I'm sure that's something they can do in the future.Overall this is one of, if not, the best Smart bulbs on the market especially for the price.
