This product is so far the BEST postpartum girdle I've found in the market!!!! It can be super tight with the binder part and because it's attached to shorts it won't ride up. Love that it had area for crotch ice pack and lower back ice/heat pack. Only down side, no hole to use bathroom ... So you have to continuously take it off and slide it down to use the bathroom. In the beginning when wearing pads it's okay actually helps, but once pads are no longer needed it can be a little tiresome.
