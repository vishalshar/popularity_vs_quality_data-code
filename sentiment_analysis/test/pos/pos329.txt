Sometimes the simplest product ideas are the best.  Instead of spending 5x this amount on a nest, this takes what I already have an makes it smart.  Simply replace the battery in my existing smoke detector, and viola I have an internet connected smoke detector or carbon monoxide detector.  Given that a 10 year smoke detector that isn't connected costs the same price and requires me change my wiring and will still beep at me in the middle of the night when the battery is low, the roost battery seems like an amazing deal.  The UI isn't fancy, and does a few basic things:1) Setup the battery to my wi-fi network.  There are simple straight forward picture driven setup instructions.  Tones emit from my phone's speaker and 30 seconds later my battery is connected.  Make sure you follow their instructions and take the case off your phone, turn up the volume, and hold the speaker about 1/2 inch from the battery's microphone hole.2) Lets me know when the alarm is going off (which you can find out quickly by pressing your test button, which they suggest you do).  From the app you can click on call 911.3) Lets me know the status of the battery (connected and power level).  Both easy to do from the app.4) Have my wife or others able to monitor as well.  Easy to invite other to monitor your smoke detectors as well.Thats it.  There are NOT 15 different confusing functions in the app, and I don't need it.  I now monitor my house for fire, and it works amazingly with my existing smoke alarms.  I did have one smoke alarm that it was a little tougher to squeeze the battery into.  Some patience and wiggling got it in.  I wish the corners were more rounded then squared.  However the good news, I don't have to go back for 5 years to change the battery.I also want to take a moment to address two reviews here that weren't flattering.  Simply put, this works with an APP only on iOS or Android.  If you don't have this, this device won't work for you.  This device is super simple, and it is designed to do one thing, turn my smoke detector or carbon monoxide detector into a connected monitored device.  If you want it to do something more, you may want to look else where.
