Love it! I've been able to isolate a short in a PCB, see if my kid has a fever, and find an air leak in my basement. I will continue to find the leaks as fall rolls around. Easy to use as well. I might like to be able to turn off the auto scale of the color, but I leave the high and low points on most of the time any how.
