I bought a pair for my boyfriend who has arthritis. He liked them and said, "get some for my sisters." So I did. They liked them and said, "get them for my husband" and "get them for my daughter (in rainbow!)"  So I did. Then my boyfriend said, "can I get another set for my other sneakers?" So I did.Beware that if you do get these, you'll end up buying them for everyone you know. And everyone they know.
