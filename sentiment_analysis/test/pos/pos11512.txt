I have arthritis in my hips and back.  I tossed and turned on my old mattress and when I got up in the morning I felt like I had been beat up.  I could hardly walk.  I knew I needed a new mattress and I decided to try the Lull Mattress after seeing that it was supposed to be good for arthritis sufferers.  I love it.  I sleep much better and when I get up my hips and back hardly hurt at all.
