Very pleased with this keyboard ! It makes my iPad feel more like a laptop. It's quite small and even having small hands makes it cramped, but it's to be expected. Extremely easy to set up, just flip the switch ! What sold me was the lighted keyboard, arrow keys, and functional controls at the top for brightness, backlight, etc, and the fact that it acts as a stand for my iPad. It sits on my lap or desk and easily holds the iPad at a comfortable angle. The grips hold my iPad easily and adjusts to angles well, but falls down after certain spots going forwards and backwards. The way it grips to my iPad also makes it hard to press things on the bottom edge of the screen, which bothers me. Hardly a deal breaker, though. I love that the music controls on my keyboard work for YouTube as well. It makes my iPad look very sleek when folded down, like a tiny netbook. When closed, it is a little difficult to open even with the notch, but to me that means it's more protected than those floppy keyboards. Also, a few of the keys are quite squeaky, mainly those on the right side, but they're not loud when typing, probably quieter than most keyboards if you ignore the squeaking. It's very light as well. No keyboard scuffs on my iPad as of yet. I typed this review with it :) Overall, I'd recommend this product !
