If you've been wishing for something fresh to replace Cards Against Humanity, wish no longer and pick up Joking Hazard!  This game has a similar premise to CAH, in that the judge plays the set up, the remaining players play the punchline, and the judge chooses their favorite with the winner getting a point.  However, playing in an animated comic format adds a lot to the humor and leads to some truly hilarious and surprising results.  I would also say that a good 97% of the cards are fantastic, and there are so few instances of "throwaway rounds" where you just can't put something together because a card is too obscure/unfunny.  Our group ended up playing the whole box our first time playing, and all commented how much fun we had.  We're already hoping for expansion packs!Also like CAH, this game is for those with a pretty "messed up" sense of humor, and is ABSOLUTELY NOT appropriate for kids, your mom, or your friends that are beyond moral reproach.  There is no shortage of middle fingers, death by cancer/AIDS/suicide jokes, sex acts, etc.  That said, and note I've already established that I'm one of those "messed up sense of humor" people, I never felt anything was just for shock value and SO offensive as to not be funny.  I've removed cards from other card games for just being plain terrible, but all the cards here manage to find that balance in my opinion.So if this sounds like the type of ridiculousness that you and your friends get up to, place the order already!
