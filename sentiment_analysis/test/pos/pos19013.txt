This is a very cool camera, set up was easy, even though I'm not a computer geek, it took me few minutes to figure out how it works.The main point of the purchasing a camera was to be able to see what's going on home with kids and nanny. So I set up camera in a living room. But now I'm thinking about getting one more camera to place over a staircase. For safety purpose,  if someone will break in into our house, we will have a clear pictures for police report.Definitely a must!
