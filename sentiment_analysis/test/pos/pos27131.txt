So... Let's start off with the one drawback before we get to the good part:The track selector doesn't work. I rarely will skip forward, backward, or stop and start songs.The rest of the earbuds are great. The contouring molds work perfectly, the earbuds are loud without distortion, and I can wear them all day on my Harley and enjoy them for hours.I'd def buy another pair.
