I was skeptical but this is actually working!  My son's first car was a used car previously owned by a smoker.  He had tried all sorts of home remedies to get rid of the smell, but they just covered up the smell temporarily.  My son seemed to think this made a difference but he uses the car every day, so I figured the best test would be for me to get in and see if the smoke scent was still as strong after a few weeks of this product being in the car.  I can happily say it has improved quite a bit.  I can still smell it faintly, but we've only had this in the car for 3 weeks and in that short of time it has made a significant difference.  I am very happy with the purchase.  Seller shipped very quickly as well.  I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
