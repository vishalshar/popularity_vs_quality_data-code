I purchased this collar to go along with my system.  I use the system with two collars for my two Rat Terriers.  So far everything is performing as described.  As a rule we charge the collar every night and replace them on the dogs in the morning.  We have left the collars on a couple days and the red light comes on indicating a low battery.  As the dogs learn and the collar is used less the collar may last more than this but for now we just charge them every night.  Setting up the system to use the two collars was very easy and use is easy as well.  I have noticed my male needs a higehr stimulation level so if you have a larger dog or a very stubborn dog this collar stimulation may not be adequate.
