1. BloatwareNormally I install my laptops from scratch, but I did not need to do this with this laptop as I did not find anything that I thought was overbloat-y. There are some ASUS stuff on it, but nothing huge, even a clean desktop!2. PerformanceWhen plugged into the wall I had 0 issues with the i7 and 960m, when on battery I had some graphics card crashing issues notably when running League of Legends, so don't expect to do tons of that on battery.3. BatteryPretty average battery, pretty good but not earth shattering, especially due to the issue noted above.Complaints- Mouse pad is painful to use, there aren't separate buttons for left/right click, so I find myself often right clicking when I want to left click.- There is no indicator telling me whether numberlock/caps lock/scroll lock is on, so whenever I enter passwords in I can't tell if caps lock is on, same with number lock and pin.- Fairly easy to smudge the top of the laptop- Gets a bit hotter than I am comfortable with even in mid loads, especially on battery.Overall I am happy with my purchase of the laptop in September 2016 priced at $869.99, the value may change drastically, and I would not purchase this laptop at that price in 6 months (roughly March 2017, maybe even a bit before due to the new 1000's series nVidia GPU's coming to laptops), as there will be something of better value.
