About a week in and I've been using it everyday.  It's definitely worth the price so far and I am glad they made plastic ones.  There hasn't been any sign of leaking, although I bet with a certain amount of force it could crack (the plastic flexes when squeezed).  Obviously be careful on how you toss it around when placing on the side of a backpack or in a workout bag.
