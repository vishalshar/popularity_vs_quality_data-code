I like this, so much that I bought one for our other dog so now I have 2. Originally I bought this for our rescue Husky as it seems Huskies like to escape and run and I wanted to make sure if he gets past our defenses we can find him. The other one I got for our older pup to track her movement not so much for the tracking she's not looking to escape. It's sturdy, stays on them both well and is useful.The reason I am giving it only 4 stars is the pricing. I'm now paying $20/mo for both of these forever I guess. Also, the GPS can be slow, sometimes a few minutes, sometimes as much as 40-50mins behind. I noticed this more with our second one. Hers will tell me she's back in the whistle zone after she's been home for 40mins...not great if she ever gets lost, but the Husky Whistle seems to be faster somehow so I guess it's ok for now. Honestly, if you love your dog and think there may even be a 10% chance they might get lost I think this is worthwhile. It will give you a very close area to search for them in. Just make sure to charge it when it tells you to and, of course, put it on them.... ;)
