I just love this super-simple modular kit. I'm a musician and analog synth enthusiast, so this is more than just a great toy to me. I've been making some awesome little sounds come out of this kit. It has everything you need to get started with some cool sounds. It's easy to use, takes all the guess work out of connections by using magnets and fits-only-one-way connectors. It comes with all the synth essentials: 2 oscillators, filter, envelope, delay, keyboard, sequencer, mixer, noise, speaker with headphone jack (which silences the speaker output that you can also just detach).  The included manual provides a good primer for theory and history of analog synths, as well as a bunch of project ideas and easy-to-follow illustrations of suggested configurations. You'll definitely want to have some free table/desk space to layout your setup, everything stays connected on flat even surfaces, but quickly pulls apart on uneven surfaces. I recommend picking up a precision screwdriver kit from the bargain bin at the hardware store for manipulating the various knobs that are close to the board -- although the tall pot knobs are easy to handle, some of the knobs that sit closer to the board are tight and hard to turn without an extension of some kind. I think beginners/kids would like this kit, but it also holds up to regular analog synth users.
