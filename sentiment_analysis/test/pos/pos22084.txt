I had a fitbit in the past, but just didn't like the way it looked.  I wear bracelets everyday and the fitbit just didn't go, so I have been on the hunt for an activity tracker that doesn't look like an activity tracker...lol!  The Amazfit Moonbeam has done it!  I received it a few weeks ago right before I left for my cruise vacation.  I've had it on ever since (except in the pool and ocean) even when I shower.  It's EXCEEDED my expectations.  My only concern is since the band is so light, it may show signs of dirt and wear in the future, but for now it looks awesome.  I get multiple compliments on it everyday.  GREAT JOB!
