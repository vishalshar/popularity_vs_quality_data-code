I have to say, I was not expecting the comfort and durability from these laces. I put these on a pair of Nike Flyknit Racers for my trip from Los Angeles to Iceland to Netherlands. I even went for a couple of runs when I came back to LA. These things really hold up. The only downside is that they do absorb some dirt but its not a bad thing considering my whole shoe got dirty anyways.
