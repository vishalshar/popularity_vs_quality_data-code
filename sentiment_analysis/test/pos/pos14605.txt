I use this with Astro photography and it works great it is easy to set up and use. I have used it for static and time lapse and had no problem whatsoever with it if you are doing long time laps sequences with it it is best to use a backup battery on your phone I did have the phone battery die before the sequence is done but back up fixes the problem.  This company has a bracket for your phone which is made of parts available on Amazon for about half the price.  It has several triggers which I have played with and seems to work, but I have not put them to use yet but have plans for some of them great product and works much better than the off brand standalone intervometer that I bought.  Also it helps if you have a old iPhone that you don't use anymore you can't really use your phone when photographing.
