I received my blossom and quite literally had it setup in less than 15 minutes.  Hooking it up to my wi if was a breeze.  The only problem was that it wasn't opening the water valves despite calling for watering.  I phoned their tech line and someone answered right away, after a few basic troubleshooting steps he confirmed that I had a defective unit.  I ordered another one through Amazon had it in a few days, hooked it up, again very easy to setup, and voila it works great.  The app is very easy to use.  As I'm in Canada, the smart watering feature doesn't work, but I knew this going in. The scheduling works great, I just have to shut it off through the app if it rains, no different than my old controller which the rain sensor didn't seem to work.
