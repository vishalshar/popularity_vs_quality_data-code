My cats love this kibble and I feel better knowing I'm feeding them a well balanced, nutritious diet. My two kitties are very picky, but they both love this kibble. Their coats are shiny, with very little shedding. Less odor in the litterbox. They are also quite active. I have a big 3 year old male tabby mix and a 1year old female rag doll mix.
