Our fetch-obsessed doxie learned to use this with just two days of training. While he prefers human based fetch, if he's still feeling active and we have this out, he'll use it. Compared to other auto-fetch devices, this is easier for a smaller dog to drop a ball into, provides immediate feedback when the dog drops the ball in (our dog starts dancing with his front paws in anticipation as the motor spins up), is intended for indoor use (it's perfect for the medium length hallway we have), and so far has been pretty resilient against the half-torn apart, slobbered up balls that get dropped into it.The iFetch balls are a little more fragile than they should be (and are more expensive than they should be), but I've found that the Kong Extra Small squeaker balls work well and last longer. If you can stand the squeaking!
