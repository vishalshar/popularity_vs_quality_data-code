Great Laptop. Bought it for school since it had the specs that I wanted. Something that had an i7, 512GB SSD, and a 960M. This laptop fit that criteria. One thing I didn't know was that this laptop had an integrated Intel HD Graphics 520 so that this laptop wasn't always using the 960M, saving battery life.3DMark Skydiver results shown in the pictures using the stock laptop. Please understand that this benchmark is designed to push computers to their limits outside everyday use.This laptop gets HOT but only when you push it to its limits so I recommend getting a laptop fan to alleviate the laptop's temperatures. The second picture I posted shows temperatures of up to 80 degrees Celsius. The benchmark wasn't long enough to trigger thermal throttling but as others have stated, it throttles over time. The GPU Load on the second picture during the Physics test should be noted that the physics test tests the CPU, not really the GPU so what you're seeing is not the thermal throttling.Overall, I am happy with the laptop. Great trackpad too. Really love it. ( Pictures: imgur.com/a/G0o9z )
