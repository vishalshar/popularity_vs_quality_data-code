I was looking for a way to store my extra brushes, when I came across these in an old youtube video. Essentially, they are like a plastic finger trap, that holds the bristles in place, helping the brush keep shape. With a brush roll, I believe that they will keep my brushes in great condition for a long while. So far, I am very pleased with what I got.
