Organic Apples & Organic Cinnamon baked into crunchy yummy chips. When I got the box filled with bags of chips I worried it was going to taste like it is good for you.  It is good for you but these crunchy chips taste really good. It is 90 calories per serving, but there are two servings per bag.  Personally I think one bag is a serving. It's non GMO and made in USA.  I like it right out of the bag or sprinkled on yogurt or oatmeal.  I realized processed dog food and cat food was making my pets sick. Through Amazon I found great food made in the USA for them. Then it occurred to me maybe I need better food too!  Amazon showed me food I had never seen before.  I'm buying more because every one keeps stealing my snacks!!!!
