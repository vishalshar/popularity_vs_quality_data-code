I do a lot of single track cross country mountain biking and this phone mount is awesome. It's solid and really grips the phone. It can hold my Galaxy S5 with Otterbox Defender case just barely but in fact this only holds it more tightly. My phone hasn't jostled off yet, which would be a nightmare if the phone fell off in rough terrain and you ran over it. So this mount has to be reliable for me to trust my $600 smartphone on, and so far it has been. Whether it holds up in the long term over constant mountain biking use remains to be seen, but if you're a casual rider and don't take any tumbles, this mount is great. I give it 5 stars.
