I've been looking for a mattress for years to meet my needs. I've spent thousands of dollars on mattresses that didn't meet my expectations from furniture stores and sleep number mattresses. Needless to say I might have better flushed the money down the toilet. I love my new memory foam mattress from lull and my wife also. Thanks Lull for a great mattress at a reasonable price !!!!
