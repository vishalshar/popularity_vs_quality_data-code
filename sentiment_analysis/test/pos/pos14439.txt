Perfect execution on this product.  Bought ten of these elsewhere and got a better price.  I purchase gallons of milk for my stepson and break it down in to quart jars.  We have less spillage especially from full gallon containers first pour.  I also buy half gallons of half and half and break it down into pint jars.  These store in less space in the refrigerator and on those occasions when the container is left out (common with a kid)  the spoilage is reduced.  I use glass mason jars through out my kitchen for leftovers and lots of other things.  A cut onion in a glass container does not pass it's odors to other foods.  The glass is recyclable too.There is a silicon ring that keeps it from leaking around the edge.  Be sure and seat this in the grove or you will have dribbles down the side.I noted that this as a kick starter project.  Very cool.  I don't know if there is a wide mouth version, I haven't yet looked.  If there is I'll get some of those too.I use glass mason jars through out my kitchen for leftovers and lots of other things.
