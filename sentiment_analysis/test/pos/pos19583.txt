Our two raw-fed cats go crazy for these treats, and they're good for training.  There's a good range of treat sizes, and the treats break into smaller pieces fairly easily.  The bag does tend to contain a fair amount of chicken-powder, which I think is an inevitable part of freeze-drying chicken.If you feed raw (or canned) you can mix the powder into food rather than waste it.
