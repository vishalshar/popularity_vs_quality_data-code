AMAZING headphones and the best you can buy for the price. While I was doing my research, I came across this digital trends review (http://www.digitaltrends.com/headphone-reviews/plugged-crown-headphones-review/) which helped a lot in my decision. There are 4 main qualities that make these headphones awesome.Packaging and Design: One word - Beautiful. Honestly, this was one the best presentations I've seen in any product. You could tell that the company really took time to think through how the user would actually open the product. The product comes with an insulated carrying pouch and 2 AUX cables one for Apple products and the other for Android products (you can actually use these in your car too). Although I was a little worried about how they would feel wearing them over long periods of time, I have to say they are incredibly comfortable especially due to the memory foam padding which is also great for blocking external noise.Sound Quality: I'll admit I'm not an expert in evaluating sound quality but what I do know is my music is crystal clear and the bass does not hurt my ears nor does it reverberate the headphones so the music doesn't sound muddled.Durability: I've only had these for a few weeks so I cannot definitively comment on durability but I can say that I keep them in my backpack which gets flung around and dropped a lot and so far everything works perfectly and actually there is not even a scratch.Aesthetic: Aside from the sound, the look of these headphones is definitely eye catching with a lot of people commenting and asking where I got them from. These headphones are simple, sleek and beautiful.Bonus: A friend can actually plug their own headphones into one of the other AUX ports of these headphones (there are 2) and listen to the same thing you're listening to. This comes in surprisingly handy.
