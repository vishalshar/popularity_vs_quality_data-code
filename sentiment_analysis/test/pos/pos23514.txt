Its a good system. Definately a little rough around the edges and the app is very basic (lots of stubs for future funcitonality). I've encountered several bugs to date (my controller attempts to upgrade its firmware every few hours). It's not difficult to setup, but wasn't quite as easy as products like Nest and Eeero.However abode is already pretty good and has lots of potential. I like the idea and execution of security system with home automation integrations. I only have the abode base set and 3 Nest cams to go with it, but plan to add more devices as the products support by abode grow.Despite the shortcomings, I'd reccomend this product and would buy again.
