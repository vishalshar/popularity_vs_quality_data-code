This is by far the best case I have owned and I have owned all of the high dollar one's like Life Proof and Otter box.  The magnetic feature and accessary work really well.  I bought the car suction adapter which works great to pop on any car your going to be temporarily using.  I have the magnetic button with the self adhesion on my truck and it sticks to it wonderfully.
