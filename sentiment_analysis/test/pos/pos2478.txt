On the third day of using the device, i lost the tracker because it fell out of the wristband. If the tracker can easily fall out of the wristband, this seems like a faulty design - especially with people jogging and the likes when they wear it. I recommend not using the wristband feature if you get this, and instead wearing as with the rubber clip-on tool so that you don't loose it.  Withings was helpful at issuing a replacement and I'm going to be using the clip-on tool instead of the wristband. In the 3 days that I got to use it, i have to say that I really like the features, the simplicity, and the accuracy and I am still giving it 4 stars.
