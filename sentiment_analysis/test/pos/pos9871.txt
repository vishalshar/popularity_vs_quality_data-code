We had our last mattress about 11 years and I did a lot of research when it came time to replace it. I am used to a very hard mattress but my wife likes one somewhat softer. We considered the sleep number but found that the divider in the middle was just not something we wanted to deal with for several years to come. We looked at other traditional foam mattresses but could not justify paying the outrageous prices attached to some of them. Then we came across the Lull mattress and started to look into it. All of the reviews seemed to indicate that it was definitely on the firm side and people really seemed to love it. When you factor in the 100 night trial, free financing and quick low cost delivery (unless you buy through Amazon.... but that is another review) free return and 10 year warranty it is absolutely a 0 risk trial. We got it, set it up about 6 pm in the evening and slept on it that night. It definitely took 3 to 5 nights to get used to it but we both love this mattress. For the first time in years we can sleep on our backs as well as our sides and definitely sleep much better through the night.  As someone who likes and is used to  a hard mattress this is amazingly comfortable.
