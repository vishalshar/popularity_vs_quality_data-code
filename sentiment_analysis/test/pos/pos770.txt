I've used the growler several times now and I love it!  It works great.  I love that it's easy to use and it keeps my beer fresh and bubbly for days.  It also has really great design features: a dial to adjust the amount of pressure you want, a pressure gauge, and a window to view the amount of beer remaining.  It's a great conversational piece too...I've gotten compliments on it every time I've filled it up!
