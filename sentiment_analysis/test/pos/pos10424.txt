I purchased the Dane Elec because it was the cheapest 8GB flash drive I could find that didn't have a separate cap. I wasn't expecting much for the price, so I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package.The drive has a soft plastic (rubberized?) texture that makes it easy to grip. The USB connection slides out by using firm pressure, but not so tight to make it hard to open. It stays closed in my pocket. The keychain hold is inset far enough that it should not break.Once I plugged it in, Windows XP pro recognized it immediately with no problems. I transferred a large number of tiff, jpeg, mp3, and various video files, and they all transferred very quickly. I then plugged it into my Mac, where it also was recognized immediately. Read times were also very fast, and everything transferred with no problems.I think that, for the price, this offers durability and speed at a great value.
