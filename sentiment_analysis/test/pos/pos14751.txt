I have read some reviews where they claim that the X-Star is a phantom knock off. In my opinion they simply improved on what the phantom has to offer. It comes with a beautiful hard case. The controller has top notch functionality and feel. If you invest this kind of money you are bound to have a few questions and the tech support is easy get a hold of. This is my first drone and I did a ton of research and finally decided to take a risk on the lesser known X-Star Premium. I'm writing this review to assure others facing the same decision that the X-Star is the real deal and I wouldn't hesitate making the same decision again.I was concerned about not learning with an inexpensive toy drone first but with the automated takeoff and landing features this thing really requires no prior experience. Just do a little research and have a some common since and you'll do you just fine.
