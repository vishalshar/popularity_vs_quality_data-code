Excellent and innovative product that really shines if you use wireless charging on a phone. The metal plates that other mounts require often interfere with the connection. Its surprisingly stable as well. So far i have not been able to jostle the car via bumps or turns enough to make the phone move when sitting in the cradle.The seller is very conscious of customer satisfaction and demonstrated that before I even received the product by sending mounting tips based on my car make/model.
