Purchased and installed two CURBs in my home. One went in outside panel (connected to mains, solar arrays and various HVAC systems). Second went into indoor sub-panel (measuring various rooms and indoor appliances).Installation was fairly straightforward. Biggest challenge was fact that my breakers werent labelled correctly to begin with. It also wasnt clear which direction to face the sensors, but easy enough to flip polarity in the mobile installer app. In the process, discovered that one of my solar arrays was down due to a faulty fan. Otherwise wouldnt have known. HomePlug networking seems to work fine (had my doubts beforehand) and doesnt conflict with ADTs HomePlug traffic.Mobile app is handy for quick at-a-glance view of current loads, but you need to use web app to see anything other than real-time data. Hoping a future version will let me access historical data away from my desk. This is going to sound really dumb, but it feels really good to see when the house is producing more energy than my family is using  even if only a few bucks at a time.Looking forward to being able to track my solar arrays separately. Im also curious about the cost of being able to see more than seven-days of trailing data. Other than that, CURB seems a more capable hardware and software platform than other solutions currently available.
