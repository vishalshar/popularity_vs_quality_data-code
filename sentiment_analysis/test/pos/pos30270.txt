Great Packaging and my 6 yo Son was very excited to get the next installment for his Osmo!  Kept his attention for at least an hour the 1st couple of days we had it.  We tend to put up the Osmo stuff when not being used so we don't lose any pieces.  Just got it out again recently, and he went directly to the Numbers app instead of the other ones.  He really has enjoyed using the different numbers to play the games.
