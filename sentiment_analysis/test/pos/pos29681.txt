I was looking for an alternative filament for my 3D printer that could withstand the South Florida heat in my car without warping, and I didn't want to invest to upgrade my printer for ABS. This has worked out great, so far the phone holder I printed is holding up good, no warping and it doesn't lose rigidity when hot like normal PLA. I would characterize it as follows:-Prints are nice quality, very rigid/stiff and light, I wouldn't say stronger than normal PLA, but it seems strong. The black has a nice, dry, carbon look to it.-So far it seems to hold up very good to heat, I think my car accessories will survive the up 150 F I've measured in my car during the summer.-I had to raise the printing temperature from 210 F to 225F on my Prinrbot to avoid jamming.-My printer has a 0.4 mm nozzle, I didn't have any issues.-The heat treat process is a bit scary, I wish they had it documented in more detail, but my prints survived! Basically you "cook" the print for an hour in the oven at 220F, in my case when possible I taped my prints to flat Pyrex cookware to avoid warping, although I'm not sure this was necessary.-I would say this is definitely for certain uses only, where rigidity and high heat resistance is necessary. If not I still use normal PLA.I hope this helps!
