I started using this superfood for the 3 outdoor feral cats that I take care of.  One got sick in the spring, and I was worried she was going to need to be put down...eyelids raised and coughing/sneezing.  I took her to the vet and she was put on antibiotics and the vet kept her for a week.  When I released her, I made the decision I needed to add an immunity booster to help keep their immune systems strong to ward off any future sickness.  I put a spoon full of this powder in their dry food every day, and they don't seem to even notice it.  I can say for sure that over the last 9 months, none of the 3 have even shown a hint of sickness.  Now, that could be a coincidence, but even if there's a chance it helps, it is worth the $25 every 6 months!  I'll update this review in a few months to see if they are still going strong!PS - They are only 2 year old cats, but no matter how hard I've tried over the past 18 months, they won't let me touch them or bring the into the house (I catch them using traps to go to the vet).  The vet said they are just outside cats and to take care of them the best I can.
