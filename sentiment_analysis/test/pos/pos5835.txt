Started using this instead of sugar due to yeast overgrowth.  This is made from birch bark instead of corn.  Been used by Europeans for years.  From all the research I did it's safe and doesn't promote tooth decay.  I make ice cream, sorbet, bake, etc with this and it does well.  may have to taste things along the way until you feel comfortable with the amt that makes you happy.  One thing it will do is give you some gastric issues until you get used to it.  I found bloating was my worst part but if used in moderation it has very little if any issues.  May have to use small amts. until your gut gets used to it but it doesn't take long to do that.  It's a great alternative used in moderation.
