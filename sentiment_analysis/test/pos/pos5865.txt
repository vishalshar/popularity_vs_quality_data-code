I use this with my iPhone 6 Plus and it fits tight without a case. I don't like that I have to take it out to change the settings on the games I wish you could do it through the trigger on it.  Makes my face sweat a little and my phone gets hot but the games are un real so cool..  A bit of a workout to play the games,you have to stand up and move around,it's awesome. I recommend if you have balance issue play with someone watching you. try not to get hurt because you tend to reach for stuff that  are not really there, use it in a open area. safety first
