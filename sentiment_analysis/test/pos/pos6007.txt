I love this system. I really was concerned the rollers would not stay in my hair while cooling, but as they instructs, shake the brish side to side ever so slightly before disconnecting the handle and the brush will stay without frizzing, tearing or creating a birdsnest. The curls come our the closest I can find to my beloved hot rollers which are cumbersome to travel with. The handle would be ideally a little stronger with, perhaps a cushioned handle, but what they give you works perfectly and without flaw. You can release the handle with on hand easily. The set is wonderful and I'm back to get another one to compliment the small size I have for my shoulder length hair. The curls created is smooth and longlasting, and much more realistic that metal heated tools create. If this review helped you, please click "YES" below. This is a full price paid review.
