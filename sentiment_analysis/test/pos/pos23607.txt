So I like it. As a first 3D printer, this couldn't be a bad choice if you would not like the hassle of using SD cards and leveling yourself, etc. Print quality seems just okay, it prints to a quality that I would consider standard - not great, not bad, just right in the middle. I have printed constantly for the past week and a half (it has only really had a break for maybe about a day or two), and it seems to be running good. There are some quirks to it though, like it randomly disconnecting from the wifi, although that has only happened once. Also, during the calibration/heatup of the extruder, it pumps out some filament, making me get all overly critical about the print so I remove the filament that was extruded on the bed before the print starts.The online portion is cool, I like how I can select something online and print it wirelessly and check its progress if I am not at home. I only wish for two things, for me to not have to click the button to initiate the print (say I wasn't home) and then it would print, and for the progress percentage to be reported online for a print that was sliced in a program (Cura) that was uploaded via USB.Before buying, I contacted about using other PLA filaments, and they suggested me to to "stay away from white, black and grey spools from other brands," and that "those specific colors from other companies has been known to cause bubbling and clogging." Obviously they mentioned they strongly recommended THEIR own filament, but $30 for .5kg spool is ridiculous. With that information, I went and bought eSuns 1.75mm PLA PRO (PLA+) 1kg black spool for $22. Quite a good investment, as there hasn't been ANY problems with printing for 15+ hours with this black filament.I have seen people enjoy Hatchbox as a choice of filament as well.Finally, for the price point, I may suggest something otherwise. The MP Select Mini 3D printer ($100 less) is apparently is getting appraised really well right now, for its performance, price, and a heated bed. YES. A heated bed on a $200 printer, also, it uses any filament, mind you. Check out both, make a wise decision. There are more printers in the $400 price range as well.But I am not saying this printer is bad, because it is not. It's good, it gets the job done. I enjoy the ease of use and the sleek good looks it has.I have posted some pictures of the prints I have done.Thanks for your time, if you have any questions, let me know!
