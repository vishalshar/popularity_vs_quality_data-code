Amazing sound. great build quality. Works with PC even though it is not specifically marketed that way. gave 4 stars instead of three because of the weight of the head set and shape of ear pieces. Compared to similar gamin headsets this is very heavy to wear for more than an hour at a time, and the ear pieces can pinch and hurt your ear over time. other than that they are great.
