I know this product is basically marketed for dogs but is a great treat for cats too. I give this to my cats for a bedtime snack. I don't leave it in the whole strips instead I crumble it up very easily by hand. And I will also say that it looks like it would last longer than you think so buy more than you think, once you've decided your pets like it.
