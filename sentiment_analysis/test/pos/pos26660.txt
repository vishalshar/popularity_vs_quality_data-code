This product has misleading packaging and name.I bought this item specifically to use with my Android tablets.This product clearly says OTG (On The GO) which for Android means it should work with an OTG adapter and be visible in the Tablet as a HDD or USB Stick.I have the externally powered Samsung OTG adapter that has 2@USB and a Ethernet connector. I have used it successfully with all USB sticks I have and some SSD drives (Patriot Phoenix). This Samsung adapter does NOT work with this SSD device.It turns out the Samsung adapter was the problem. Using the very cheapest OTG adapter cable, this SSD device is visible/readable on ALL my android tablets and android phones.I corrected this review as the product does exactly what it was promised to do. It is most convenient to have 480 GB available for my trips and in the car/plane entertainment.Product works fine with Windows computers and my Mac computers.
