The Brush-Hero is a very impressive device.  The brush head rotates continuously with a surprising amount of torque.  Water exits the Brush Hero at a strong enough velocity to clean the brush and wash the surface being cleaned.  It is extremely effective on automobile wheels, especially ones that are prone to heavy break dust accumulation.  I have found that the brush head with the (softer) black bristles works best on wheel surfaces.  The softer bristles are extremely efficient at sweeping away break dust and road grime with very little effort.  The long handle enables you to get the inner surfaces of the wheel and in between the "spokes" without getting break dust or grease all over your hands.  I have used the Brush Hero for a variety of other applications with similar effectiveness.  I have used the device with the white brush to clean algae out of the corners of my pool and around the skimmer returns.  It's also very effective for any sort of outdoor cleaning where you need surface pressure, but where a a pressure washer might cause damage -- painted surfaces around doors, window sills, window trim, gas grills, lawn furniture, etc.  Finally, it is terrific for cleaning bicycles -- both the frame, cogs, chain, and other parts that are hard to reach.  Brush Hero is a great product that lives up to its name.
