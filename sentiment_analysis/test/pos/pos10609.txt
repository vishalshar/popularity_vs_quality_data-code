I just got this oven this week and tried it out on a Brinkman 6 burner BBQ grill (used 4 of the 6 burners) and it worked great - knocked out 8 pizzas at around 4-5 mins each. I experimented with both white and whole wheat dough with seasoned olive oil and tomato sauces and various types of meats - all came out hot crusty and darken like what you get from a wood fired pizza restaurant.I read some of the negative comments and think the minimum requirements are understated - you really need a 4 burner grill that is also at least 17" deep***My grill was 15" deep so the oven actually hung over the front. Initially with the lid up - the oven after 20 mins only got to the upper "Oven" temperature on the gauage as some others have found. With the oven sticking out I lowered the lid of the BBQ on top of the oven - resting on the metal rectangular label with the temperature gauge inside. I think what this did was force the heat into the oven through the bottom/back open slot of the oven. After 10 minutes I raised the lid and the temperature gauge was in the Flame area. After another 5 minutes the temperature gauge went well past the bottom. At that point I propped up the BBQ lid a few inches off the oven using a metal smoke box and started making the pizzas.After cooking and cool-down (3 hrs) - the temperature gauge went back to normal and no damage anywhere. Scraped out the inside of burned material and wiped down the outside and back into its storage bag that came with the oven.Conclusion:While I can't say the temperature gauge won't be destroyed if you fully enclose the oven inside BBQ - I think by adjusting how far the lid comes down on the oven does help get the oven up to temperature and protect the oven from damage. I've had to replace temperature gauges on the BBQ in the past when I let it get well beyond its max temperature.So if you have a 3-burner grill or one that isn't deep enough - my experience and work-around seem to work pretty well.
