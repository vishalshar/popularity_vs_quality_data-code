I bought this to make pizza, but the Bakerstone arrived before my pizza peal, so I decided to give this a whirl on roast chicken (bone in skin-on breasts).  Assembly was pretty straightforward (even for a middle-aged woman).  Got everything in place and then the pizza stone supporter bars were misdrilled and misaligned.  So I called my neighbor, Jim and he came over with his high powered cordless drill and cajoled the screws into place.  Btw, I deducted a star for this.  If Jim weren't around, I never would have been able to get this up and running.Anyway, this maiden voyage was a complete success.  I have a cheap Walmart five burner grill and was able to get the oven to 700 degrees in about ten minutes with the flavor bars on and the grill lid open only about 4 inches.I melted some rendered bacon grease (available here) in the bottom of a cast iron skillet, seasoned the bone-in, skin-on chicken breast with olive oil, jalape≈Ño dust, granulated garlic and tarragon, placed it on the skillet and put it in the oven at about 650 to 700 degrees.  Roasted for 20 minutes until the skin crisped and then finished on the stovetop on low for another 20-25 minutes.In the meantime, I microwaved a packet of Cascadian farms organic frozen spinach and sprinkled with a drizzle of truffle oil.  At the same time, I used up the residual heat in the oven by lightly crisping a fresh flour tortilla.  Broke apart the moist chicken breast and CRISPY skin on the tortilla, topped with the truffle oil spinach and topped with crumbled feta cheese.  Ohhhhhhh my!!!Update:  October 4, 2014So, I finally got my pizza peal and have used it twice.  Once with dough from a local high-end pizzeria and once with my own dough (Jim Layhey's recipe.  Great results both times. I have gotten it to well over 800 degrees (5 burner grill, flavor bars on, lid closed 3/4) in less than 15 minutes.  Things have gone so well that I am having a dozen people over tomorrow for a make your own pizza party. I am so happy with this that I ordered another for my weekend getaway home.I had my pizza party a week ago and learned the following:  those that heeded my warning not to over top their pizzas had great results.  Those that threw on too many toppings had either uncooked dough or a bloody mess of a pizza.  So watch your toppings.  If you want to glob it on, please be sure to put the plain dough in the oven (brushed with oil) for a couple of minutes before topping your pizza and putting back in to fully cook
