They were great little backups for when I leave my glasses in the car or at home. Unfortunately after over a year of use they fell out of the case and they are gone. I tried to get the warranty replacement from the website but it keeps giving me an error. I will try again because I like them. The tape on my phone case did leave a sticky mess though.
