I am a chronic insomniac.  I take a prescription sleep aid which helps me stay asleep, but when I'm under extra stress I still have trouble getting to sleep.  On those nights, I take this product as well (with my doctors approval) and it helps me get to sleep a lot better.  The Dream Water liquid works as well, but this is much cheaper, and personally I think it tastes better.  I just consume the powder without mixing it in water.
