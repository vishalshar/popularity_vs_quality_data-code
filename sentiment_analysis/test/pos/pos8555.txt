Reluctant to try yet another "good for your dog" treat, I was told by a friend our dogs would love it, so I went ahead and got some.  And here I am writing a review a week later to pass the word around that these are actually worth it.  Our finicky dogs who do typically do not like "good for you" food were crazy for these "no junk" jerky treats.  Literally jumping when I would pull the bag out. My only critique would be, STUFF MORE IN THE BAG PLEASE!  Thanks!
