They are great, so far. I sweat a really lot when running and that seems to destroy all the earbuds I purchase, but so far those ones have survived (4 months so far, which is longer than any other I tried). The music quality is decent considering the use (entertainment while exercising, so I don't expect opera-grade quality) and the mouldable plastic allows a perfect fit, they never fall - only draw-back which is inevitable due to the design is that the moulded plastic is not a very nice sight, especially with all the finger-prints all over...
