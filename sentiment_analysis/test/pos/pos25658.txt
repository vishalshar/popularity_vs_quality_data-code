I am extremely pleased with my Canary flex. This is the first time I've ever used an outdoor camera, or really, any security camera or system. But after break ins in my neighborhood became frequent, I looked into options. I had heard great things about Canary from friends, and was happy to see the flex was wireless and weather resistant.I'm thrilled with the product. I put it right on my garage and it gives me such peace of mind given what my neighbors have experienced with break in. The set up was extremely easy, the picture is clear, the app user friendly. I would highly recommend!
