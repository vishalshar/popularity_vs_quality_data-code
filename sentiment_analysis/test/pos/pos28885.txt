If you love anything pumpkin, you will not be disappointed. Instead of making the mix as a bread, I make it into muffins (and added chocolate chips). They turn out AHHH-mazing. Seriously. They are so moist and tasty. Eating just 1 is simply not an option. I picked these up on a whim one day and I am so happy that I did. What I love is that it is so easy to make and if you read the ingredients, you can ACTUALLY READ and UNDERSTAND what is inside the mix. All you need for this mix is...well the mix (of course), a can of pumpkin puree, water and oil (and chocolate chips if you oh so desire). Bam. Wah-la. You are done and everyone who has a taste thinks you are a magician in the kitchen. Enjoy
