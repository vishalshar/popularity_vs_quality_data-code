It's not the cheapest,,, but you get what you pay for.  This dog food was originally recommended to me by a bulldog rescue group (I have an English Bulldog) because it has no fillers.  My dog had some health issues before, and the change in her has been like night and day after the switch.  I will never buy another dog food again.  I am hooked.
