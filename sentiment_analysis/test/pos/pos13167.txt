This pet camera/treat dispenser has been the best solution to our separation anxiety issues with our dog!  As we don't believe too many treats are good for her diet, we use one third of her daily dog food amount each time we leave for the day.  We use Organix dry dog food, as the kibble size is perfect for at least 4 to 5 treat times. So, if I have to run errands, go out for lunch with friends, or am otherwise having to leave her at home, this is the perfect answer!  And, our dog loves it too! She looks forward to hearing my voice, and licks her lips, knowing that a treat is soon to follow! ?
