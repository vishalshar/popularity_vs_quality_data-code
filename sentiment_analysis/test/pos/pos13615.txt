This pillow is comfortable and helps greatly with my occasional hwartburn and  when my allergies act up and I can't sleep/breathe. I aired out the pillow for two days before using and washed the pillow case. After airing it out the foam smell was almost non-exisitant.Only drawback for me is the need for  some neck support. A small neck pillow solved that issue.
