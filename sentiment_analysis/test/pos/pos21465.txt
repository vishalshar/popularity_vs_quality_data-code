I got the purggo car air freshener in hopes to keep my new car smelling new and clean. At first I was unsure about this, But figured I would give it a try and see what would happen. At first I really did not think it was working. My car did not smell at all, like most air fresheners they have a fragrance to them. Well I just put it in the back of my mind that when the car seems bad ill have to find something. well time went by... I went on trips with the family, my little one has made a mess of the car. I have had wet towels from the pool left in the car, and other things that don't smell to great left. Then one day it hit me I was cleaning out my car and I was about to toss this car air freshener away. Then I thought about it and noticed with all those things in my car, I never smelled any of it. That although I did not smell a good smell  in my car that this car freshener was working amazingly. Best of all its not just hidden the smell and no one even knows it in my car. After you clean out the car you would never even guess I had a kid. Amazing produced.
