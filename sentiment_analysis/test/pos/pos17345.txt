Before I bought this cheese paper I would do the cheese search in the refrigerator. After buying cheeses, opening them, and then rewrapping them in heaven knows what--namely plastic wrap, aluminum foil, plastic containers, it was always the same result, moldy cheese.  Not only that, but unless it was an identifiable cheese, like Brie, I didn't know what I had wrapped because the label was no longer there.  This paper is similar to what Kerrygold cheese is wrapped in--it's a lightweight paper lined with a porous type of plastic. The box contains the paper in sheets plus some stickers that you can write on with the name of the cheese and the date it was wrapped or even sell by date.  There are also pictures of a sheep, cow, and goat so the source can be identified by circling or checking one of them!  What I also like is that the cheeses can be rewrapped after use and amazingly the stickers still stick!  The paper can also be cut to size to wrap smaller cheeses. So far I have noted that the cheeses have stayed fresh with not a trace of mold.  I found this product advertised in Cooks Illustrated and was delighted that I could order it here on Amazon! I highly recommend this product to all cheese lovers!Just a note:  I've also discovered that deli meats keep very well in this paper as well.
