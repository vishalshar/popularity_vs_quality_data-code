This stuff is amazing! My 13-year old Lab/Boxer mix has arthritis in her hips and back. The poor girl could hardly move. It broke my heart to see her in pain. The vet tried giving her a supplement that was full of what I consider questionable ingredients, (sucralose, polysorbate-80, etc.), and in good conscience, I could not give it to her. I started giving JOINTS to her a few months ago, and she is feeling so much better! She is mobile again, and has the energy of a much younger dog! Matter of fact, she was feeling so great, that she tried playing with a Great Dane puppy at the dog park. That unfortunately resulted in a knee injury to her, BUT, I gave the recommended therapeutic dose on the packaging, and some crate rest, and she's back to feeling brand new again. I highly recommend this product. It's done wonders for my sweet girl!
