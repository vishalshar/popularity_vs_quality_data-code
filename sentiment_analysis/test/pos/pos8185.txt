I got both D-Link and SmartThings Sensor. For me, push notification is useless. So, I also got a Siren. When sensor senses something, alarm goes on.Pain of SmartThings Sensor: The only way to integrate SmartThings sensor with siren is through IFTTT app. There is scheduling function for this sensor nor anything with IFTTT. So, I have to manually turn on alarm from my phone and switch it off in the morning. If I forgot to switch it off in one morning, I will be waked up by an alarm. Also, after 2 weeks of use battery is 10% down.Big win for D-link: In D-link, we got scheduling. We don't have to use IFTTT and we can use the D-link app itself. My sensor will be automatically active in the night. And it works perfectly.  And setup was super easy. I really don't understand what people are complaining about. Even Facebook app got tons of bugs and D-link did a good job in designing their app.
