I have had so many compliments, and no one can believe that this beautiful necklace / brooch is a fitness tracker! Reasonably accurate (however if you're a serious athlete probably not). The only problem is had is that the vibrate alarm is so faint that it didn't wake me up so I just don't use it. Great for keeping me motivated to move more.
