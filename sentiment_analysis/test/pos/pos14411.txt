I've had this for almost a year now and it still looks like the first time i pull it out of the box.  I twist, fold, throw, squish this thing and it still goes back to its normal shape and works as good as ever.  Even the best charging cables go bad eventually, especially if you like to use your phone while its charging, but this one seems to be far above the restthe two ends are made of a hard plastic and the middle is a flexible rubber.  i can plug this into a small lipstick size charger, fold it so the charger and phone are parallel and put it in my pocket no problem.  I was looking for a small charge cable that would fit in the pouch that came with my charger, and this works awesome!
