The Splash was easy to set up, and I was very impressed with the customer service. There was a very small glitch when I edited an item in my profile. I called Customer Service, and the rep assured me that nothing was wrong and all my info had been registered. Even though I did not request this, she then spent about ten minutes walking me through all the functions and the benefits, and at the end of our conversation, she had me place a trial call using the Splash, so I could see exactly how it would work in an emergency. The service was exceptional, and when I made the trial call, the emergency rep on the line was just great. Even though I told them it was just a trial call, the emergency rep asked if I was all right and safe before ending the call. I feel so much safer having the Splash close at hand.
