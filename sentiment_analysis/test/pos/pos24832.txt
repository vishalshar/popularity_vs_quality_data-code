My beautiful, good girl is getting on in years and slowing down. I wanted to make sure she gets the best nutrition I can give her. It may be my imagination, but she seems to have a little  more "spark" and seems more playful after a month of this supplement.  It's no fountain of youth, but it ain't bad!
