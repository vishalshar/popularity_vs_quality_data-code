I'm not good at envisioning an amount before the actual product arrives, so in retrospect, I'd say this at the current price of $3.58 is a little steep, but it was also pretty good.  I'll definitely purchase again, *IF* the price gets under $3.00.The curry flavor isn't overwhelming (it actually reminds me somewhat of the powdered soup base of Lipton Chicken & Noodle soup, but not in a bad way), & only one pea in the entire bag was too hard to bite through ~ the light, airy crunch was compelling enough to eat the entire bag in one sitting.
