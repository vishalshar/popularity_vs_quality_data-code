Its been three months, I took a bet with my irrigation guy who was pushing me mush established brand, I always like the startups (aka Davids); theres been no issues, the brain, software, seem to really work and keep up with the rain cycles. Now after using it for three months for my 7-zone yard I am happy about my decision.If at all any, I am waiting for the API's to open so that the controller can be integrated into my home -automation. Support teams been very responsive and helpful too. Good work Blossom.
