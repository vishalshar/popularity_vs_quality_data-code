Got my kids the race track for Christmas and we got 2 extra cars as well, Nuke and Guardian.  Everyone has their own favorite car in the family, but mine is definitely Nuke.  This guy has a great combination of speed and firepower, and the weapon systems seem to work well together.  Pull them in with a tractor beam then blow them up!  This may change as the cars all get leveled up more and unlock more options, but hopefully this car keeps pace with everyone then too.  Looks sharp on the track too.
