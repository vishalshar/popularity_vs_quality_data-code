So much peace of mind being able to check on our cat when we go away for the weekend - and feed him!  Works great - and has made it possible for my husband to relax more on vacation.  Of course the cat loves the food shooting out at him too! Recommend it for all pet owners - you can check in while you're at work or while you're away from home.
