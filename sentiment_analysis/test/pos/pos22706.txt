I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this product, the only thing that I was afraid of was my Moov falling from my wrist or ankle while I was exercising, but so far everything has been fine, the tracker stays in place even while I'm sleeping. Only downside is that sometimes it fails to track activity if you have to walk and wait to cross the street
