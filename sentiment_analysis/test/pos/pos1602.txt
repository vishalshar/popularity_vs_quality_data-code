If you ride I strongly suggest you get this. Easy to install. Fits your basic motorcycle licens plate just right. Works just as they said. Flashes as down shift or release the gas. Then flashes like crazy when you break. Seems to do a great job of keeping most cars from staying to close. With all the activity it keep their attention pretty well. With everyone so distracted while diving we riders need all the help we can get. Check them out on YouTube.
