I used Sugru on both bigger and smaller projects. For smaller projects, 1. the paint on my glasses arms were chipped off, and repeated contact with it caused inflammation on my skin. I covered the glasses arms with a thin layer of Sugru, and it took care of the problem. It was a lot harder than I thought to apply a very thin layer of Sugru on metal though. Smearing Sugru through a layer of plastic wrap helped. 2. I fixed a couple of cables with Sugru, which is fairly easy. The bigger project is a shower improvement. The shower in my room has only hot water, and it gets really hot in the summer. I'm a renter, and my landlord doesn't want to deal with the shower. My only option is to somehow turn the sink into shower, but still be able to use the sink when I'm not showering. The problem is I couldn't find proper adapter for shower to fit the faucet. But then with Sugru, I don't have to have the perfect size of the adapter. I used Sugru to connect a 3/4 to 1/2 adapter to the faucet. So now I can connect the shower to the faucet when I need it, and remove it when I don't need it. All in all, in my opinion, Sugru would be perfect if there's a way to store opened but unused Sugru for later.
