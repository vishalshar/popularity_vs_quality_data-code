Best case I have ever used - had one previously for my iPhone 4S also.  Carries about 4 credit cards as well as some cash and the mirror is an added bonus. Have dropped my phone a couple times but it has survived the fall just fine.  I get compliments on it constantly and regularly have people asking where I got it.
