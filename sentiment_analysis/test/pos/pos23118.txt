I just got my little teeny tiny LectroFan micro. It really is tiny....  But it has a great big sound! I've tested it with its various sounds, as well as as a bluetooth speaker. I'll test it with my phone tomorrow, it's supposed to be available to allow me to answer my phone as it has a microphone in it, too. It seems well made. What I like the most is that the white sounds don't have an apparent loop. This seems to be a very handy sound machine that is super portable. Thank you, ASTI !!  P. S. One person commented on the short length of the cord that came with it.  Because it has a very common micro USB port, I literally hv dozens of cords that will fit it: all different lengths. I suspect there is one somewhere that might work for your situation?!? As for the battery life, I hvn't had that long yet...... But I'm loving it, right now!
