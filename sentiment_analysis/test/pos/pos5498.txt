I installed this unit at my vacation home.  Installation was easy, just be sure to label your zone wires from your old unit before transferring.  I did not use the built in display for programming, but it appears simple enough.  The display is handy for checking settings etc., something the competition did not have (selling point).  Also the unit is well made. Nice quality  circuit board with relays to control the zones, as opposed to Solid state relays in the competition. Reason for relays.. Can handle much higher loads and me I like the  "click" sound to help debug any zone issues I may have.  This is a wifi model, though I am using it hardwired and setup of the network settings was a breeze. The web interface is fantastic, all  you will need and then some,  to set up a nice series of programs to control your watering cycles.  Plus it supports master valve control, rain sensors,  flow sensor etc. There is a good write up for port forwarding in the manual  if you would like to access it remotely and not via an IP address.  Overall install time , less then 1 hour.  If you are like me and want a quality / industrial built controller, this is it.. I looked at the others, but just like the huge influx of cheaply made remote controlled T- Stats, so to , is becoming the irrigation controller market.  Better to pass on the  cheap ones and buy a controller that is well made.
