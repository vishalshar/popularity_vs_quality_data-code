OK...so, the sound is very good.  Not a lot of bass but this thing is very small so you can't expect too much bass.  Not as loud as a roar.  I bought this to replace my JBL Flip version 1 that got wet during my last tubing trip.  The flip was much louder (86 db) and sounded better overall, but this thing has MUCH better battery life.  The flip only worked for about 3.5 hours at full blast.  Good quality that is going to be great for background music, but it is not going to blow your socks off.
