More convenient than taping negs to the window and shooting with a digital camera. The lomo app 2.0 still sucks. Use Lightroom Mobile to both scan and edit. Yes, after cropping the results are still too low res to seriously print, but they have just enough resolution to share on the social networks. If you shoot wide exclusively forget about it. Scans of negs shot wider than 50mm don't look as good as shots 50mm and above.
