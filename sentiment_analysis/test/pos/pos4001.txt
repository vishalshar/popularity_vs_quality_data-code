Bought this chair over a another competitor because I favor the look, all the chairs on the market look the same and this one with the checkered design really stood out from the rest. I must say that Im extremely happy with this thing. I am a graphic designer in the day time and a gamer at night and having a good chair is as important for me as having a good mattress for a good night sleep. I work from home and normally spend an average of 8-10 hours on the chair between work and gaming and I was looking for something versatile that can meet both needs and I think this RapidX chair did the trick. On top of that, I have a bad back and the chair is contoured with enough lumbar support to keep me in a comfortable position. The leather-like material feels strong and the padding feels good, like a high quality couch. its hefty, definitely doesnt feel at all cheap. Im going to buy another one when I can spare the cash, my son is a gamer as well and he keeps stealing it. He napped in it with it fully reclined lol.Pros:Easy to assemble - took me 30 minutes by following the instructionsLumbar support and head rest pillow- Its good to have that option. I use them on and offDurableMultiple reclining positions- good for my afternoon power napEasily adjusted for comfortChairs go very low so my son can use to play his PS4 gamesCons:My kid wont get off of it enough for me to really enjoy itI wish it was a bit cheaper but still think it was worth the investmentI will update my review in the next few weeks if anything changes but so far so good- I am happy with my Finish Line!
