This case is really awesome, my 4 year old and 6 year old play games on our new iPad mini and have accidentally dropped it several times and the case protects the iPad mini perfectly. It was fairly cheap, and the handle is perfect for little hands to carry it around. It is durable and thick and the iPad stays in the case and never falls out. Great buy.
