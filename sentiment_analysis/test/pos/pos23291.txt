I'm a huge fan of Rockform and believe you get what you pay for!  This is my third Rockform case and this particular style is a lightweight good fitting case for my iphone 6.  At first I wasn't sure if I'd have any need for the magnetic portion of the case, but I have found I like being able to secure my phone to certain surfaces and it's come in very handy when I'm using my phone for a timer in the kitchen.  I just stick it to the refrigerator and let it go.  I don't have to worry about setting my phone down in kitchen goo or setting it down somewhere and have to chase it down.  Highly recommend Rokform cases.
