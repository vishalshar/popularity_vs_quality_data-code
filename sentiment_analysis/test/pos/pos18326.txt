My dog was diagnosed in 2012 with leishmaniasis, he was on the brink of death. After thousands of dollars later on medication to get him healthy I now use Bixi Immunity to continue to help keep his immune system healthy! There is nothing & mean nothing I wouldn't do for him! I will continue to use this product for him until the day he crosses the rainbow bridge!
