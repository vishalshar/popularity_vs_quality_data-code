I bought this for my elderly mother and she's had no problems using it, seeing the screen (she has horrible vision), hearing calls and she feels more secure with the 5-Star Service GreatCall offers. They check on her daily and she has what amounts to a "panic button" on the phone. And since it's bright red, it's easy for her to find if she needs to get to it fast.This phone is simple, but tailored for the elderly and, while it doesn't have the bells and whistles of my iPhone, is absolutely perfect for my mother and her needs. Keep in mind this is only the phone, you have to buy monthly service from GreatCall, the only network the phone works on. My interactions with them have all been first class, great service and a very clear understanding of how their customers use the phone.
