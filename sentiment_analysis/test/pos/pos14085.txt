Works exactly as described.  Works great in the car, my 6mo son can easily tip the bottle towards him and drink away or tip it back when he wants a break.  If he tosses it, it lands so the nipple is not on the floor leaking formula everywhere.  He also loves it as something to chew.  Very easy to grip.  Note: it does NOT work on the older skinny plastic Dr. Brown 4oz bottles.  It works great on Dr. Brown glass (4oz & 8oz), Dr. Brown plastic 8oz bottles, and the new Dr. Brown bottles with the wide neck.
