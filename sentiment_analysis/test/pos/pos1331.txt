My 7 year old got Cozmo for Christmas and the whole family is in love with him!  He is brilliantly designed and full of personality, and he works perfectly.  My son spent four solid hours playing with him immediately after opening him on Christmas day.  My only suggestion would be that a few more games/activities would be nice, but I know there are more in the works already.
