This is a 5 star product with a 5 star customer service; a rarity nowadays and something that really makes me optimist about all these new small brands emerging from Kickstarter projects. You can fell by the product quality and the communication with the consumer that this is a product they made because they wanted it to exist - for themselves, but knowing they could do a good job on it, for sharing it also. The piece is really well crafted, malleable but solid and looks awesome. I personally had a problem with my order and I had it solved in a way I wasn't expecting. I can't rate the whole experience high enough. The only issue is that it sat the customer service bar too high in mind. so... I might have issues with dealing with the average service from now on :)
