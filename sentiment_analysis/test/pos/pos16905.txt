Bought it for my girlfriend so I can't say I used it but she seems pretty happy with it. Initially, I planned on getting a fitbit or something similar that has an alarm for waking up in the morning but ended up with bellabeat as it looked more girly.Morning alarm was my (selfish) wish as we sleep together but don't wake up at the same time, and it works great! All other tracking features seem to work OK. I asked for a quick feedback (review) from gf and she said that best feature is that it's super cute, and she can wear it on everything.Would recommend to anyone struggling with a gift for a girl, works great and it looks like a piece of jewelry.
