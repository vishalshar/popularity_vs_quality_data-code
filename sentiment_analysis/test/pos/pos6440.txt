My 80 lb. Golden has been a real puller on walks, to the point that I started to wear gloves because my hands were killing me.  I hired a personal pet trainer to come to my house and work with him and tried the martingale collar and just regular harnesses.  Nothing really seemed to work.  He basically would take me for a walk.  HOWEVER, from the moment I put this harness on him he just all of sudden quit pulling.  I was kind of confused how something could work so easily, but it did.  We have been using the Easy Walk harness for a good month now and he has become used to it and will sometimes try to pull more now than at first, but it still is nothing like it was before.  It is an extremely sturdy harness and seems to hold him very secure.  I ordered a size large and it fits good.  Again, my dog is 80 lbs.  and there is room to grow.  I do have the adjustments on the tightest level, so I would say that if you have a dog smaller than 80ish lbs. than maybe go with the medium.
