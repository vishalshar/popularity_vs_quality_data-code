Got both the wide and the standard top. Seals very well around the mouth of the jars. It is not a travel lid or a shaker lid ( I was not expecting them to be). I saw other reviews complaining that the snap top leaks, well, if you shake or tip it over they might. They are not shaker or travel lids ,they are for storing and pouring. That said they are great and meet my expectations. Took 3 weeks to get them but they work.
