We gave this to my daughter on her 5th birthday without the training wheels attatched. My husband and 11 year old put it together in an hour. It is a solid frame, simple, durable bicycle with an ergonomically correct frame. Very happy with this bicycle purchase. We usually purchade our bikes from REI and this is just as good or better quality for a chikd's bike.
