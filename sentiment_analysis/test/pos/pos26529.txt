I was looking for a big, sturdy tumbler for my breakfast smoothie - and this is it! I'm a teacher so I needed a tumbler that could handle the bustle of the classroom, and this lives up to it's claim. The cup doesn't budge if it's knocked into. The only issue I have (and it's a small one) is that I wish it was easier to clean the straw. I love that the straw is nice and sturdy to match the tumbler, but I don't know if there is a tool narrow enough to actually clean it out. This might not be a problem for others but since I use it for smoothies, the leftover residue tends to build up fast. I usually just run it under hot water but that never fully cleans it out. But overall, I am very pleased. I have used this tumbler almost every day for the past 3 months and I'm glad I made this purchase.
