When ordering expansion cards for the Watch Ya Mouth game, make sure you check to verify that it is indeed sold by Amazon and shipped by Amazon. If you don't, you will get a China knock-off with cheap cards that have many misspelled words and duplicated cards. The China cards basically just throw a bunch of words together that make no sense.The original Watch Ya Mouth cards are definitely worth a little more money. In this case the old adage is true....you get what you pay for!
