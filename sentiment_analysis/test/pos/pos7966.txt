So my husband is the biggest germ-a-phobe!!!  He is always wiping down everything, including everyone's cell phones, with sanitizer.  When I saw this, I was like "I've got to get this for my husband for Christmas"!!!  This thing is amazing!  It's a lot bigger than it looks in the pic and this thing is heavy duty great quality.  If you have a germ-a-phobe in your life, this is the perfect gift!!  It also will sanitize just about anything else that will fit inside. We have even used it to sanitize toothbrushes.
