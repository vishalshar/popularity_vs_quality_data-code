I really love them they're very comfortable when I'd use them it doesn't bother my ear very light and it doesn't affect the sound quality I can still listen to my music very clear I will really recommend them to anybody that do their exercise listening to music and don't them to come off of your ears and they have a very reasonable price for all you get I'm going to get some for my wife I was just trying them and they really work
