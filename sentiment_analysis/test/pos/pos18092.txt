Pretty neat. I will say it is quieter than I was expecting and the hot and cold directional finder on the app is junk but it does work pretty well inside of 70 ft even thru walls. App said it was more than fifteen feet away while it was my hand but the beeper does work and the feature where it makes your phone go off is fantastic. Overall not bad but not perfect
