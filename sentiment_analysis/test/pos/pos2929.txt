Okay need to retract my previouse review.I was having video problems due to mynown crappy internet.That has since been fixed.The product it self is amazing, works well and is a must buy to keep and on you fur babies while you are gone.The most impressive thing I have found is the customer support. I sent an email regarding the video and had two responses and a phone call withing 24 hours to help me diagnose and remedy the issue. Very impressed with the tech support!Only Con is the device can be loud when starting upnor diapensing treats, I have shelter dogs who are very skittish, so initially the sound it makes when shooting out a treat scared them, but they are getting over it.
