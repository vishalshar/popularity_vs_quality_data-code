My daughter loves playing with "Mo" and having him take her drawings on adventures. Some of the pens that come with it stained the board and was hard to wipe off with the pouch. The pouch it comes with is convenient but doesn't always wipe well. I find that baby wipes work better. 2 pens are already dried out but I think that's because of the brand Yoobi. We only had it for 3 days before the pens began to run out, however, any dry erase pens would work with this.
