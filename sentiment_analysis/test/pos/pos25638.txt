Shortly after my son turned 1 year old in December, he began to wake up almost nightly with night terrors.  My husband, my mom (who lives with us), and I were so stressed out by them and our poor son was (obviously) having a very hard time.  I came across a blog reviewing the Lully and decided we would give it a try - we were desperate!I'm happy to report that my son's night terrors are pretty much gone!  It did take a good 3 weeks for the us to find just the right settings, such as vibration strength of the Lully pod and the exact time we were to turn it on.  But after we found our groove, almost all night terrors are gone!  My son maybe has had 2-3 since using the Lully.Thank you for this cool product that has made everyone in the house more well rested and happier.
