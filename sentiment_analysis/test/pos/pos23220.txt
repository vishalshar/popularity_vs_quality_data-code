This feeder does indeed work, never having missed a scheduled feeding time for our cat. The fact that it works, seems relatively well constructed, and so far as I can tell, still doesn't have any competition, explains the four stars. I wanted to get that out up front because now I'm about give a list of complaints and suggestions. I get that material costs have to be kept down if this is going to be sold for a reasonable price, though this is at about the upper limit of what I would spend on such an item, but the webcam is really really bad. If you're handy enough you could come up with an Arduino contraption that does the same thing and I think you'd easily find a better webcam component for $10 or less. Beyond that, this device direly needs an app, or at the very least, a local interface in addition to the web portal currently offered. And preferably a local interface that had a documented API to allow for better integration with home automation solutions. It should be noted that there is no sound to go with the video. This is perhaps on purpose as to not become the subject of a link bait news story about how the cat dish can become an eavesdropping device, but no sound by default with the option to enable (even with a long legalese laden "I Agree" style thing) would be nice. As an Internet connected device, it should be able to grab the time on it's own after a power failure. A UPS partially works around this issue, but nevertheless, how difficult or expensive could it be to just bake that in? A nice software addition would be a counter that resets each time you load up the food wheel - perhaps with a warning when the last meal is about to be served. I think for a first generation product of it's kind, it isn't bad, but there's certainly room for improvement.
