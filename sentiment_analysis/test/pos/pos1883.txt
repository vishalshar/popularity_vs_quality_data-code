It does appear to work, for me, anyway...calm produces a similar feeling to meditation, and energy adds a bit of clarity and boost. Device placement is critical for good results (slightly too low and I get pain/headache). Battery life is terrible on my device, however - I can't even complete the 20 minute calm vibe without the module shutting down; 15 total minutes of use at 50-60% seem to be the max before recharge. I've been unable to talk to anyone (left a message) and the email I submitted hasn't received a response after a few days.Update 9/17 - Was able to reach someone on the phone for support, replaced the device through amazon and updated the firmware via the app, and battery life/performance is now inline with specs.  Still experimenting with the programs, but it definitely works.
