Chaga is a great immune modulator, meaning that it'll keep your immune system at where it should be. I believe 1-2 grams of this mushroom extract has the same amount of antioxidants as 1 liter of blueberries do. Four Sigma Foods is THE company to buy from. It tastes great, I can't wait to have one today.... Actually, I'm gonna have one right now :)
