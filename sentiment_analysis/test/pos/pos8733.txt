Purchased this drive from Amazon after reading about it's ability to do transfers at up to 456MB/s with super speed USB 3.0 with a UASP compliant system at MyDigitalSSD web site. After using this drive for many file transfers, both read and write, I am finding that the MyDigitalSSD OTG is indeed achieving their remarkably fast transfer speeds as advertised with my system and I am very impressed! Most 1 or 2 GB files transfer easily within 2-3 seconds, transferring so fast I see the file transfer speed displayed at 456MB/s for just a brief moment before it completes! This portable drive is not only super fast but looks to be very well built and is extremely light and small making for an excellent product. It comes with a 6" USB 3.0 cable as well. Even if your system is not UASP compliant to support these transfer speeds, this is still one well crafted piece of equipment that can handle large file transfers as quickly as your system will permit. Very satisfied and looking forward to when they release a 512GB or 1TB version.
