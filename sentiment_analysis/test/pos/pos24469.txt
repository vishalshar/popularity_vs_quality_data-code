I am extremely pleased with this product!  I ordered it on Amazon Fresh and received it promptly the next morning at my doorstep.  It came with beautiful packaging and was lighter and more compact than I expected.  There were instructions on how to use it but it was intuitive to put on.  The chair I sit on to work isn't very ergonomic so my main concern was that it would be difficult to sit ergonomically in a bad chair, but the BetterBack put me right into the correct posture, was easy to fit to my body, and comfortably supported me while it was on.  Sitting in it felt great (I kept it on for more than 15 minutes, mainly because I forgot I had it on), and my body feels better in general, even after I take it off.  I am looking forward to seeing how longer-term changes in my body shape up as a result of wearing it.  I don't know how it works so well, but it works!
