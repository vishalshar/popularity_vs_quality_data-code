I already am a huge fan of Dream Water's original product, even have had it as a subscribed order. So I was delighted when I had an opportunity to review their new sleep powder. I have always had trouble sleeping and even went to the point of have a terrible tolerance to certain sleep aid medications. Dream Water's products have been the only natural rescue to my sleeping trouble. I have tried replicating the ingredients in pill form, the 5 HTP, Melatonin, the GABA, however it just hasn't been the same as their Dream Water. I don't know what it is, it just works for me. I sleep through the night better, and I don't feel drowsy when I wake up.So this powder, let's start. You don't need to stir it in water, but that is an option for people if they wish. I just rip off the top, and pour the powder straight in my mouth. It tastes a little sweet, it honestly reminded me of taking pixie dust candy. The flavor might not be great for some, but I find it to be fine. I usually take 2 of the original dream waters, and I find myself doing great with taking 2 servings of this as well. (Without a need to increase even after using it extensively.)Extremely handy to take on the go! I can see this as being great for traveling via plane due to it not being a liquid, as well as being lighter in weight. A lot easier to have in my purse if I'm spending the night at a family member's home. The price currently for this product is also cheaper than the liquid, and works just as well in my opinion.I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I love this product so much, that I already have repurchased at full price and plan on continuing to do so.
