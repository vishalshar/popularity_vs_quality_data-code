Kisslink is an amazing router/extender, or I would say by far the best that I have ever used!!!I bought it because I spent a lot of time in the lounge one floor below my apartment, and the public internet connection in my building sucks. I use Kisslink to extend the internet from my own apartment, which works perfectly. Now I can get great connection while enjoying the amenity.Another thing that thats cool about this router is that you dont need to enter any password to get connected. I am always hosting small parties and sleepovers in my place. And now, I guess my guests wouldnt need to ask me the super long case-sensitive password, and just beep the router. HOW AWESOME IS THAT!!!Tiny (see my comparison to my old router) but versatile. I have to 5 star it!!!
