Up front: really cool and innovative product - solves home security & monitoring in a simple-to-use device. Everything controlled with a smartphone. Very easy to set up. High quality device & very impressive app.Been using the device since the weekend and I am very impressed. Fits a huge hole for someone looking for some sort of home security device, but arent interested in the large traditional systems where you need to punch a code in or the alarm sounds.By far the smartphone integration is the best feature - the device is controlled exclusively through the app (I use an android) - you can log in to check out your timeline, take a look at the live camera from anywhere, and even sound the alarm remotely. The device is intelligent and notifies you of any activity when youre not there through your cell phone, like a text message, delivering the video. Very responsive - I tested this out by arming the device and then entering the front door - I received an alert exactly 13 seconds later (!!!!).Huge plus is the lack of a monthly subscription fee. I am exhausted by subscriptions recently - Netflix, MLB, Google Apps, portfolio software - so this is a plus from the consumer standpoint. Back to why I didnt want to sign up with traditional security.Set up was very easy - literally plug and play. Downloading the app leads you to a brief registration phase, and then connect the Canary device to your smartphone via cable. The phone updates the firmware for the Canary, connects the Canary to your wifi, and then links your account and youre good to go. I found a spot in my living room where I could hide the Canary behind a few candles - a few moments later and youre recording live video of the entire room.Video quality is bright & easy to see - looks like a high-quality Youtube video. Clicking on live feed brings up what the device is currently seeing - looks like there is about a 10-second lag between the Canary uploading the video and it relaying to your phone.There appear to be three modes - privacy, disarmed, and armed. Arming the device happens with a click on the app.I tested the device over the weekend - left my house to mow the lawn, then armed the device. Broke into the the house and 13 seconds later and I get a buzz - activity detected. I watch the video and of course its me. The response time - 13 seconds between opening the door and my phone buzzing - is very impressive. The video is stored online after recording, so if an intruder covers up or breaks the device, its too late - the image of them doing so is recorded off into the cloud for easy retrieval.I suppose the only thing that Im worried about is that my pets (two cats) will set the device off early and often. Reading through the FAQs, there is a learning capability in the system, in that it recognizes routine behaviour in time and adjusts for it. Its not clear to me how long this takes.Overall, I like it a lot. Definitely a useful product. Fits a need for me - Im not really interested in a large security system, and the costs/fees associated with it, and for basic entry detection the Canary device is really cool. In summary, the video monitoring is simple & doesnt require a lot of setup or user input. High video quality. The motion sensor definitely picked me up easily when I entered the house, and I received a notice literally 13 seconds later. Connectivity to my phone is the most impressive part of the experience - if I have my cell phone on me 24/7 I can connect at any time to what is going on in my houseIf you find this review helpful, please answer YES to the question "Was this review helpful to you?" below.
