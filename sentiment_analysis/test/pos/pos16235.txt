This will definitely get someone's attention! I would have given it 5 stars but I was not completely satisfied the clip actually hooked to the piece  of the alarm that pulls out so if you hook it onto your purse or something it's easy to accidentally pull the alarm. I think a better design would have been to put a clip on the solid end of the alarm so that when you hook it to something you didn't run the risk of accidentally pulling the alarm.
