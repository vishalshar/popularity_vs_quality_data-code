This was a Christmas gift for a ten year old girl and boy, along with two of its brethren lifted directly from the Dash Robotics site.  After putting the link through Fakespot, there was some anxiety on my part about how well the robots would perform, but that was all put to rest once we tested the product.  The kids absolutely loved their Kamigamis!  I helped my daughter assemble the first one, then she put together Musubi and Inari entirely by herself.  Turning on the robots and linking them to the kids' iPods was a breeze.  The app that controls them is well designed and intuitive to use.  It contains pre-programmed games, like freeze tag and sumo, which we had fun playing together.  The included dance routines were also a big hit.  The robots moved well on various surfaces and are sturdy enough that falls off tables or counter tops didn't damage them.  Steering was a bit tricky, especially on slippery surfaces, but by no means did it detract from the fun of playing with the Kamigamis.  Programming new routines was very easy and provides a good opportunity to think.  We haven't tried to program swarm behavior, but it seems that should be a good fit for the robots.  My only suggestion for improvement is to lower the price point, so that we can add more Kamigamis to our household, along with the ability to control multiples from the same app.  In a nutshell, I was very impressed with how well designed this product is and thrilled to see my kids really enjoying their gift.
