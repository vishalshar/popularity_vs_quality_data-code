I have three dogs, and two will pick at their kibble no matter what you offer them. Though I do not feed tripe exclusively, the addition of a tablespoon to their regular food will keep them gobbling it up! Packed with digestive enzymes, it is one of the best foods a dog can have. The Solid Gold brand offers one of the best prices on tripe.
