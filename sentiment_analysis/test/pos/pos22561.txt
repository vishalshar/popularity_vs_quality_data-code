Like these a lot. Add a lot of stability, raise camera, and weigh 19g per side. Have only flown with them twice, but they don't seem to affect handling and the impact on flight time seems minimal. They also don't seem to affect any sensors. Easy on and off, but they're very secure. You can mount the stock gimbal brace and the polar pro gimbal guard with these in place.
