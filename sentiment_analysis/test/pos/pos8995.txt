This is a great product if you know what to harvest on top. I've had it for about two months now, and it's very minimal cleaning! The seeds the packages come with are great, but small unused seeds tend to fall into the tank underneath, sprout, and decay adding to the amount of decomposing waste products (all supposedly bad for water quality). The only problem with these crops are that they don't last very long, and you would have to plant a new batch every few weeks, after having to clean the grow stones from all the decaying plant matter. If you like growing the seeds for a one time experience, go for it! However, when you're ready to plant a second batch of crops, do so with GREEN ONIONS. The key here is to grow plants that have no small particulates that will fall through your planter pots into the water beneath, so NO SOIL plants are best. GREEN ONIONS are cheap to obtain (buy them from your local grocery store and just cut them at the edge), easy to grow under indoor lighting (I have no windows), and don't need any soil at all! Use the grow stones instead of soil to keep your onions upright in the pots. Your water will stay clean, and all you need to do is trim the green onions on top when they're dying off. They make fast growing root systems, which is what you need to clean and filter the water from underneath. If you get a beta, make sure to spend the extra $5 and buy a mini water heater (buy them at the same time!)You also don't need to be concerned about nitrogen cycling despite what other reviews have said. This is because the set comes with beneficial bacteria that you can mix and pour into the plant pots themselves. These bacteria should theoretically attach to the growing roots and fix the nitrogen in the waste products of your fish. This should create a ready-to-live aquatic biogeochemical cycle for all organisms involved!  Source: A successful lively beta fish that is active and healthy!
