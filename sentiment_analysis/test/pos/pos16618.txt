I already use Seaweed Bath shampoo (Lavender,) so giving The Seaweed Bath Co. Citrus Vanilla Argan Conditioner a try made perfect sense.Some conditioners tend to leave my hair feeling stiff and stringy. Not so with the Seaweed Bath Co. Citrus Vanilla Argan Conditioner. It left my hair feeling clean and soft.Typically, I run out of conditioner long before I run out of shampoo--even if I start both at the same time and the bottles both hold the same amount. I can't explain this. Perhaps, I tend to use more conditioner than shampoo. That must be it. Anyeay, the 13.6 oz size of the bottle helps ensure that this conditioner will last--perhaps even longer than my smaller Seaweed Bath Co. shampoo. At least, I can hope!
