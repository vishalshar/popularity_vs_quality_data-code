Ive done a little testing before my upcoming "survival campout".Pros:  It does light with 1 match.  It does burn in wind.  It will light (at minimum) 1-1 1/2 inch sticks, still mostly green with bark on fire.  Even a small amount does create a decent flame for an extended period of time.  I am comfortable that this is a good product, and works as advertised.Cons:  During testing, it never completely burned up.  I tried multiple times, both in a pile, spread out, etc and never did all the material burn.  The only time it came close, was when we used it inside a very small fire.  Then almost all of it burnt.  Im not sure if that is how it works, or if Im doing something wrong, but that the only con Ive found, and honestly not worth loosing a star over.
