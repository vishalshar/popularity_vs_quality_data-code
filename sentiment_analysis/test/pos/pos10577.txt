Awesome sound from this device!  I was, and still am, amazed....NO comparison to an iPod; the Pono player blows it out of the water.  Crisp, clear, balanced, deep sound - and that is only from several CDs that I ripped to FLAC files using the Pono music library interface.  Can't wait to purchase a couple truly hi-res recordings; I'm certain it will blow my mind.  I've used this device with headphones, a portable Klipsch speaker, and plugged directly into my receiver - all applications are superb.  I do not find the Pono music library klunky, nor to I have any objections to the touch screen.  To me, this was $399 very well spent.8/11/2015 - Downloaded a few (four) hi-res recordings from Ponomusic...wow...the small, but important, sounds ring through...really enjoy this device!!
