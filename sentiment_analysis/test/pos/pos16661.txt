A few hick ups during initial set up. Works very well with the included Matter Control software. Setting it up with Simplify 3D has been an ongoing project (I know I'm not patient enough). Have printed over one 1Kg. reel of PLA, definitely not disappointed. And as an entry point 3D printer, I still don't see anything better. The controller is Arduino based, so hackers are sure to have fun with it. Filament is common PLA, but supports ABS (have not tried, don't care for the fumes) . And it's made in the USA.
