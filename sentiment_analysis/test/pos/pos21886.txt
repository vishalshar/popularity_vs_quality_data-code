Buy one with spare parts... Like JingXiGuoJi. This item worked fine, but required transfer of the old camera and battery.  It was way too difficult, and cheaper replacements with all parts are available. There was no false claim made by this seller,  but I didn't really understand what to buy or not buy until after experiencing the repair.  It was a successful repair,  but could be easier with a different kit.
