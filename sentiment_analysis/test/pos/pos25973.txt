Great printer!This is my first 3d printer and I've been having a great time with it. Setup was amazingly simple. Super super simple. Was up and running in about a half hour. Works well with CURA. Designed and printed several parts.I've now had the printer for about 3 months. It's been good. This thing just kept working. Any time I had problems, it was my own fault, and I was able to adjust to work.Pros:1. Super easy set up.2. Autolevelling3. Removable bed, making prints very easy to remove.4. WiFi enabled and USB5. very very easy to use6. Sexy design.7. Relatively quiet8. It works very consistently9. Good customer serviceCons1. Slower than other printers2. Quality not spectacular (I think it is very good, just not amazing)3. PLA only (I have heard of people printing with other materials, but I haven't messed with that yet)I've printed many things on this. My latest was an NES style case for my raspberry pi. I was able to design and print it quickly. That's just amazing and fun!Advice: Use blue painters tape on the bed. Everything worked consistently the moment I started using it.
