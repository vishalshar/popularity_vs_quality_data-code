This does exactly what I wanted. I can use it as low-temp solder and apply it directly to metal wires to make low resistance joints.This plastic seems somewhat less hard than normal PLA, I have not found brittleness to be a problem.The resistance is hard to measure and seems to vary depending on the voltage potential across the plastic. Measuring the resistance of my first circuit (w/o voltage connected obviously) disappointed me with a really big number; however, when I turned on the power and the LEDs winked on I was not disappointed at all!Filament runs at PLA temperatures and smells mildly of PLA-Waffles. ABS temperatures do not appear to burn the filament. The MSDS for this product (posted on Proto-pasta's website) notes that the conductive polymer could potentially be bad for people HOWEVER it is completely encapsulated in plastic and should remain inaccessible to biology. Combine that with the fact that PLA can biodegrade; store this stuff carefully, keep it dry, discard scraps. This is new technology.So far I have enjoyed using this filament with my new MYNT 3D pen. I have had a prusa mendel for about 2 years but haven't actually run this through the printer yet.The cardboard spool is cool. I didn't expect to like that but it's lightweight and you can easily punch a hole to hook the filament for storage (that way you don't have to cut off a foot of filament like when the end doesn't line up with the pre-cut hole on a plastic spool).
