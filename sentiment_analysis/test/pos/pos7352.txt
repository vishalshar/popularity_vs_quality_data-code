I had tried at least a half-dozen other brands of no-show liner socks to wear with my boat shoes.  All except one slipped down on my heel within a short time.  The one that didn't slip, Bombas, is expensive, costing about $15 a pair with shipping.  So, when I ordered the Galiva socks, I was prepared for another failure.  To my surprise, they work great.  They fit fine, are comfortable, and haven't slipped on my heel so far.  I've washed them once, and hopefully repeated washings won't destroy the silicone heel patch that prevents them from slipping.  I love them, and will be ordering more in the future.
