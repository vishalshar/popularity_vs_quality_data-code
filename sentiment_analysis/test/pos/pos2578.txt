The first one I received would not connect to the app.  My phone showed it under bluetooth settings but the app wouldn't recognize it.  I contacted the company and they responded within 48 hours with a few questions.  I answered them and received a reply a day or so later with my options.  I mailed the defective one back and they sent a new one out.  The new one connected right away and everything seems to be working properly (this is the first day of use.)I am using this with the IFTTT app to trigger my Nest thermostat to help heat the baby's room.  It's on the second floor and the Nest is on the main floor.  So far its triggering like it's supposed to.  Hopefully it continues working as well as it is now.
