Our boys (ages 6 and 9) have had a blast with their YOXO Build It Kit! They were really excited to share the kit with their cousins, who gave them even more great ideas for building (the jackhammer was a huge hit). This toy really supports creativity and imagination, and the kids were able to see how simple shapes can make just about anything. The best part is that they can use everyday materials from around the house (paper towel tubes, cereal boxes) to add to their ideas, or inspire new ones. And, as parents, we appreciate that the YOXO kits don't take up a lot of space, make a lot of noise and are completely recyclable.
