This is actually our third BANDI.  My wife had a smaller version for her older model iPhone and loves being able to take it with her when she's wearing athletic wear (pocketless, of course).  We then upgraded to the Large Pocket Passport Belt, which works perfectly with her iPhone 6S Plus.  She wears it anytime she doesn't have pockets that fit the enormous new iPhone, which is almost daily.  We have now also purchased one for my 90 year old Grandmother so that she can have it on her when she's out gardening on her own, in case she needed to call someone for help, the phone would be nearby.  Can't review from that perspective, as we're not sure she will use it--however, if she does, I'm sure it will be comfortable and will protect both her and the iPhone.
