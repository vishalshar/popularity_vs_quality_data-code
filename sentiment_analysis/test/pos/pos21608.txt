I think someone wrote this is the best thing she has invested. I must agree. There are several fugal ways to do the same thing (like... using dish washing detergent for cleaning with a drop of olive oil, etc.) However, considering the design of inner pot (for washing) and outer pot (for drying), the blotting cloth (good absorbancy) and the cover... I suggest everyone to get this.  You will be so happy to have it.
