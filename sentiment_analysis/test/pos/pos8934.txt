It has allowed me to have one glass of quality wine with dinner, when dining alone. Fairly easy to use but do be careful not to bend the needle. Needles are easy to ruin and expensive to replace. Also, some corks (possibly any composite cork) can fail to seal back up when the needle is withdrawn. Possibly using the finer, optional needle could reduce this problem. Presumably still better than trying to recork, especially without purging with an inert gas like argon.
