My wife loves the way it looks and some of the other 'tracking' that this wearable does, however, the step tracking is all over the place. She mostly wears it on her wrist. We've both had many trackers in the past (Fitbit, Samsung Gear/Gear 2), and notices a REALLY high step count pretty regularly. She works in an office. Wear the other trackers would show that she had made 5k - 8k steps in a 9 hour work day, she now see's 16k for the same level of activity.**UPDATE 12/13/2016**After some troubleshooting with the Bellabeat, we found a setting where it asks how you're wearing it. We found that the setting was set to necklace, instead of bracelet. After making the change, the accuracy was 100X better. I've increased my review from two to four stars. My wife is much happier with the step tracking of this wearable. I've seen many reviews touting the same issue. I would give this five stars, but I think that such a critical setting should be put front and center in the app, so that the wearer can easily change it's setting, based on how it's being worn. For anyone looking for troubleshooting, contact Bellabeat's support, or simply go through the menus and settings closely.
