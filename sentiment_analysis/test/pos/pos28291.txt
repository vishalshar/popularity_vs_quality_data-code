I will give this 4 stars,  however I am switching to a different product to treat my pcos. I just realized that this is only about 10% of the daily dosage recommended for pcos. I will say, I loved the easy packets, there was hardly any taste, and if the dosage was high enough, I wouldn't be switching.
