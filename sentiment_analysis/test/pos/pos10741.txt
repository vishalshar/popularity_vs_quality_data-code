This game is so much better than normal charades being able to act out a character and a scenario makes for an overall great time for everyone. I will never play normal charades again after playing this game it makes a game night a whole lot more fun when you can get everyone involved and that's just what this game does. It's awesome and I recommend it to anyone who just finds charades too boring and dull
