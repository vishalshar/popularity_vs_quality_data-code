Great setup for using your iPhone on a motorcycle. I use my iPhone as a music source and GPS when riding. This setup is secure and quite flexible. It's easy to place and remove the phone and the case is useful on and off the bike. My only gripe is not with the setup per say - I just wish they had a waterproof option. The little silicone "condom" they provide is a joke for a long-term option. I ended up modifying this setup to create a waterproof option:1. Rockform mount2. Added a Rokform Universal Smartphone Mount Adapter to the back of a Hitcase Pro
