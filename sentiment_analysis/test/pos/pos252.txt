Recommended shaving product for anyone tired of that dry face feeling after shaving. Not only does Thrive Shave Oil give a smooth shave, but there's no need for after shave lotion - this covers both needs. Also I l really like the size, especially for travel - saves space and weight in the dopp kit. I just use a few drops, lather it up with warm water, then rub it on my face - no need to cover the whole face with foamy suds - Perhaps that's what causes that drying with shaving can products.
