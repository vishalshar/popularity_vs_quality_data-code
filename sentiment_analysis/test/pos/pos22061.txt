Fantastic purchase. Song is incredibly annoying and still plays even after the card is ripped open. You actually have to cut the wires to stop it. It's like diffusing a bomb. You will not be disappointed. Easy to "set". I mailed it in a small cardboard box with a gift and had no troubles. Will definitely purchase again to torture another poor soul.
