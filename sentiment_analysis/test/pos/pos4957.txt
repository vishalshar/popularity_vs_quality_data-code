I have only had this for a little over a week but am really liking it.  As other reviewers have said; the packaging is very luxe and you feel like you are getting something special.I downloaded apps for both android & apple.  You need to be synched with one device so pick one and use it. Took a few minutes to "find" the tracker but once it was all set up I have had no trouble with it at all.I use the daily alarm- not sure about others saying the vibrating was not noticed.I have it set up for phone calls on my Blu Studio X phone-- that part of things is not working- It would be nice to get that going but I am more interested in the step counting and the sleep measurements.I know people have said its not 100% accurate- I think that may be true but I have had a garmin and several fitbit devices and would say the same about them- to me its an indicator of how active I am not a scientifically proven step validator.Look & Feel- lightweight & stylish- people ask me constantly about it.  I am thinking of getting the white one to be able to change them up or if they come out with different colored bands.Charging: you pop the disc out of the band and just place it on the charging disc- once it stops flashing (charger) its done. You can see your charge in the app to know when to re-charge.  I have only charged it once because I knew I was going away so don't really know how long it would last- I think it lasts longer since you are not constantly pressing buttons to look at steps. The app is easy to set up and gives you daily fitness tips- nothing fancy just your info -nicely displayed and intuitive.The only concern I have is the prongs that hold the disc in the bracelet- they fit quite securely so I hope they do not crack or break-I wear this while showering ,have had no problems but do take care not to have the shower beating right down on it.I have worn an activity tracker for several years now and this one is by far the lightest, interesting design. It stays on through all types of activities and putting on and taking off things where the sleeves are tight. I thought I would miss "seeing" my steps but I always have my phone close by and can check it whenever.Best $$ I have ever spent on something so functional and fashionable! https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Equator-Activity-Sleep-Tracker/dp/B01CHZWCYM
