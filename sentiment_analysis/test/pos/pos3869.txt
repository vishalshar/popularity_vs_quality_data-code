I believe Bluesmart can be a great product one day, and it is not very far from it.Prior to Bluesmart, nearly losing my luggage was interesting.  After a long international flight, I had to change airplanes in Paris, and had to go through security again.  I normally only carry my backpack, and check-in my luggage, but for this trip I brought another small carry on as it was a short trip.  After going through the x-ray, I picked up my backpack and went on to the gate.  After eating breakfast near the gate, when it was time to board, I realized that I didn't have my 2nd carry on bag.  At that time, I started looking for it near the gate area, with no luck.  After several minutes I returned to the x-ray and they had placed it in lost/found there.  It was at that point that I started looking into luggage trackers, etc and that is how I discovered Bluesmart.When I initially received my Bluesmart luggage, I was concerned with the size, however I was able to fit everything I needed for my short trip. As most of you understand, travel can be difficult, and you can never have enough pockets when you travel.  I ended up buying a vest for traveling where you can store passports, etc, but didn't end up liking it because of the weight of all the items you end up carrying on the vest.  I like the front pocket of the Bluesmart, although if the inside compartment is full, there's not much that will fit on the outside pocket.  I understand the need to stay within the airline dimensional restrictions, however volume optimization would go a long way.  Because the app is not quite there yet, I'm not sure if the proximity lock/unlock is working, so I don't know that I would put my passport, phones there (I carry 2 phones, personal and work).I went to Europe for 2 weeks, and because it was a longer trip and I needed to carry more, I did not bring my Bluesmart this time, and as much as I didn't want to, I ended up checking in my larger non-smart luggage, and bringing my backpack to carry my laptop.  My backpack is the standard Swissgear for carrying the laptop, but it doesn't fit many clothes after you add laptop, charger, etc.One suggestion - went I was traveling back from China, the Chinese x-ray employees made it quite difficult on me due to the luggage.  There are regulations on the size of battery you can carry on with you in China, and I didn't have the battery capacity memorized, so I was forced to empty my luggage so we could unzip the inside and look for it there (which we couldn't locate either).  It would definitely be helpful to have a sticker containing the technical specifications, although I think it would be primarily for China as I didn't have that problem in Japan or US.  I will go to Mexico soon, but I don't suspect I will have a problem there.
