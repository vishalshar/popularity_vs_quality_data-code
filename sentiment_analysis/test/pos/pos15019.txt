I've used a lot of these bluetooth trackers and so far, this is my favorite. Yeah, it's a pain that it's hard to open without a special tool, but I just keep that handy with the little carrying case in my "junk" drawer and I'd rather it was hard to open than that it was too easily damaged, or didn't stay together once opened a couple times. There have been a couple times where it didn't seem to pick up my device even when nearby but generally it's been more reliable than some other similar trackers I've used, and the alarm sound is nice and loud. It compares fairly well with Tile which is my very favorite BT tracker in terms of features but with the bonus of having a replaceable battery. My one complaint is that they don't have anything in the device to protect the battery so if they sit for awhile in storage, you may end up with what I got... completely dead batteries that I had to pay to replace in order to even use the tracker in the first place. They should either have a plastic protector in the battery compartment or do what another tracker device Chipolo does and ship it with the extra battery.
