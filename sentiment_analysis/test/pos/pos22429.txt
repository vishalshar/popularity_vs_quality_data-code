Design: I like the fact that it isn't made out of plastic. It gives it a more premium look and obviously will improve durability. My one complaint that cost the rating a star is that there is no way these could be considered Over-Ear. I have tiny ears and the ear pads site right on my ears. It's not even close to going over them. They are just to narrow to fit over ears. The result of this design mistake is that they do tend to get a little uncomfortable after a while. I'm talking about hours and not minutes so if you are in an office environment like me and wearing them all day just plan on taking them off occasionally to give your ears a break.Sound: The sound is impressive. I played a bunch of Dave Matthew songs in FLAC format and the sound separation was amazing. It sounded like the instruments were all around me. These have great base but not overpowering. I also felt like it covered all sound levels throughout the spectrum really well. If I had to compare these to the HD 558's I own I would say these have less sound-stage but still adequate.Final Thoughts: For the money I think these are a steal. They seem well made and sound like high end headphones and not a basic cheap pair. Wish they were truly over the ear for long-term comfort but I guess you can't have it all for $50.
