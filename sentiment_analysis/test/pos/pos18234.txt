Love my new growler, I've experienced no quality issues, and it pours wonderfully.  I ordered the 64, but also am awaiting the 128 Copper version via Kickstarter, and decided that I wanted the smaller 64 version (I assume the 128 will come sometime in the future (hey it's Kickstarter, you're funding a startup so ignore the non-verified purchasers on here, everyone I've supported took a long time to deliver.))  Do make sure your tap lock is on when pressurizing, or you'll be a bit embarrassed after they fill it ;-O
