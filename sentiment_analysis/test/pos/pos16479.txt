I highly recommend this if you want something between a briefcase and a backpack that looks nice but not too formal or too sporty, relatively low profile, and good for work or travel. I got this for my dad - the urban explorer who carries way too many things in his unnecessarily extensive cargo pockets and still looses everything. He LOVES it. He's a big dude, but it fits him just fine, and has plenty of space for him to organize his things, including files and folders for work. He travels a lot too and says this bag has streamlined his packing. It's a smart, ergonomic design, light weight, and the pockets are arranged for comfortable access. Construction and materials look good and sturdy as well (not cheap vinyl and bad sticking). I want one for myself.
