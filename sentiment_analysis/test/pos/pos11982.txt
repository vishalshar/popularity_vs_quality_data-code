My primary goal for purchasing Spire is to improve my overall state of body and mind through better relaxation and focus.  To learn to be more "mindful" of my body, the situations I'm in and the possible conscious techniques for increasing the quantity of less stressful moments.I like the steps and calorie readings.  And overall I think the layout, coloring and general design of the app is absolutely excellent and easy to use... a big "job well done" to the Spire team!  The boost packs are one of the best features of the app and help immeasurably towards reaching my goals with Spire. They walk me through exercises that are focused and effective and will be a long-term learning tool.The "stone" itself is VERY easy to wear and use.  And the charger couldn't be simpler.  One negative might be that the clip on the stone is a bit too strong, but it does slip on easy enough and I don't think it's ever going to fall off.  But removing it takes some effort and I will be careful with certain lighter weight materials so as to not snag or tear them.It's very apparent after using Spire for a few weeks that a tremendous amount of research and effort was put into the design, function and implementation of the device.  The amount of data that is recorded seems a bit overwhelming at times, but I think that's a good thing and over time I'll learn to interpret and use every detail.I highly recommend this product with absolutely no reservations.
