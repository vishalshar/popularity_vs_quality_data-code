Got this to have a set of flat wear at my desk at work. I didn't think it through, as I could have gotten actual tableware for much less, but I really like these. The material is very sturdy, and feels very nice in the hand while eating. The shape of both the handle and the business end of the fork and spoon are just right. The slightly-sharpened edges of the fork for cutting is perfect. I haven't had any need to use the knife yet, but the serrated edge is surprisingly sharp. I can see that it would have no trouble cutting through any kind of meat, even over-cooked steaks. The bottle opener in the choil is a nice touch. Everything fits beautifully in the very nice, very slim case. It all slips into my briefcase very nicely and takes up very little room. I found myself looking for excuses to eat with these rather than my regular flatware, even at home. I will probably end up buying one or two more sets, for picnicking and any other outdoor eating activities. Looking forward to trying other products from Humangear.
