Speaker sounds great, I wanted to be able to stream my Prime music account and that required loading the Beta firmware - very simple process and great support provide by Sugr. I own a Echo and a Dot but have different uses for me (Echo is in kitchen for shopping list and hand free music - Dot is in the garage hooked up to current music system for hands free music while working in the garage). The Sugr Cube was bought to use on the deck at the house and to play music while at events for Havoc Brand Clothing. I was disappointed that I could not direct connect to the speaker (they offer a Bluetooth version for this) but I was able to load a play list to the built in memory to play back at the event - this worked even better in reality as it didn't drain my phone battery and allowed me to use the phone for Square Payments.The volume of this this speaker is great for its size - I was able to file a 40x80 room with sound before opening the door to the public - once everyone arrived I could still clearly hear the speaker in the 10x10 retail space, providing customer with music while shopping the booth at 50% volume.I would recommend this to anyone looking for a portable speaker (Better battery then my Nude Super - M), with alexa (sounds way better then Tap). Thinking about a second speaker to do stereo sound at the next event, because yes it can pair up with another cube.
