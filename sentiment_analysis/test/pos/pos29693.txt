The Glion Dolly is really great for the last leg of a commute. It's much smaller and more portable than a foldable bike so you can store it under a seat. With a max speed of 15 mph and a max range of 15 miles on one charge, it's a pretty reliable way to get to you where you need to. Charge times are also fairly quick (maybe about 3 hours for a full charge). The one major downside to this product is that it really can't handle rolling over a small branch or rock, let alone rough terrain. You'll need to avoid these obstacles or run the risk of falling off the scooter. Overall this is a great item for those who want a more portable way to help with their commute.
