I love Bare Fruit Apple Chips but I thought, well I should try something different so I ordered the sample pack.  I was a really great way to try some of the other dried fruits they offer.  The mango was fantastic, the apricots not so much.  All of the apples were really great.  Will be eating the pear with lunch today but I'm sure they will be great.  The apricots may be good on a salad or something like that but I  personally didn't care for them plain.  Otherwise, great, great product.  I absolutely love the apples (all varieties).
