So far I think it's a great camera and microphone.  The app is needing help. Please invest money in this because it us the reason your product works. It is kind of like having the best wine in the world and the only cup you have has a huge hole.  What is the one thing a user should want to do? Watch video and pause skip to a point. This is a known issue on android.  They know about it and have not fixed it yet. I love the device but the app needs to work at the most basic level or my 4 stars is a 1. I am hopeful that this is quickly resolved.
