As the mother of 3 boys that all play sports I have been waiting for something like this.  I used to throw-out under armour and Nike clothing after one year - now they are able to wear them stink free until they wear out or find something new. The light scent is just enough and really doesn't hang around.  There is no bad odors that come back the minute you start sweating again so I know the clothes are clean. I started using on my workout clothes - now I use it on everything; sheets, towels, khaki's, boxers, etc - the whole load gets clean.
