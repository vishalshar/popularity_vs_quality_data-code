I just used this unit in several cities in Italy, in conjunction with another Skyroam unit we purchased a year ago (from past experience, my family needs two units e.g. when kids want to do different things).Here's my experience:1) 4G coverage.  4G is the primary reason I purchased this unit instead of another Skyroam.  When it worked during our trip, it's really nice.  I used SpeedTest to measure and saw about 10Mbps down, and 3Mbps up.  However, the 4G coverage was really spotty:* Rome: Flip-flopping between 3G and 4G* Florence: Mostly 3G with occasional 4G.  3G only in the Tuscan towns outside of Florence* Venice: Mostly 3G.  Sometimes downgraded to 2G and the device was mostly not usable.* London (transit in Heathrow): Mostly 4G.In general, the coverage was better outdoor, and was really bad indoor e.g. in a restaurant or shop.2) Battery life.  Excellent.  When I used it just as a hotspot, it could last the whole day (about 12 hours of pretty active usage e.g. Google Maps - Skyroam on the other hand would need a battery pack).  When I used it to also charge our phone towards end of day, it would still last (it got down to last bar when I charged it at night).  Charging was relatively fast considering that it's also a battery pack.3) Metering (bandwidth accounting).  This is the area I had the biggest issue.  I ran into the same issue several others here reported -- the metering was overly aggressive.  The first time it hit me was when about 300MB of data was gone in an hour.  I re-checked our iPhones and made sure everything I could think of was turned off (AppStore background refresh, iTunes sync, iCloud sync).  I then purchased another 1GB pack.  0.9GB again was consumed the next day.  I then literally stared at the screen when it had 130MB left, and it's down to 0MB in less than 5 mins when neither my wife nor me were doing anything.  For comparison, when we used SkyRoam that offers unlimited data on 24-hour basis, we hardly used more than 100MB for the whole day.  I suspect that there's some bugs in how GlocalMe meters the usage.4) Weight.  It's not light but it's not too bad, considering that it's also a battery pack (think of it as removing the need to carry yet another battery pack).5) Start-up time.  I noticed that when the 4G connection was readily available, the start-up time was fast.  But in most cases, it took a very long time to start the device.  It's usually stuck in "logging in" (the last phase of starting up).  In comparison, Skyroam start-up time was so much faster (even though it's quite slow).  I suspect there's some bugs here.  To get around this, I usually had to start it while still in hotel room before heading out (I relied on Google Maps a lot).6) Ease-of-use.  Mixed.  On one hand, it's nice that the device has touch screen and can work in conjunction with the App.  But in general, the user interface needs serious upgrade.  The most frustrating thing is that the messages on the screen are clearly not written by/for native speakers (my guess is that they use automated translation), and they tend to confuse the users.  For example, "Account is unusual and has quit code: 8", and "Your account has been in arrearage" (I figured out that the latter means that your account has 0 balance and it's time to top up again).  The other frustrating thing is that I couldn't figure out how to add credit directly from the device.  It seemed like this could only be done on the App with a connection (so make sure you top up enough credit e.g. in hotel).  One more thing we learned -- the balance on screen does not reflect the actual balance you have after top-up.  You just have to "trust" that the device will rollover to use the new data package once the current one is exhausted.All in all, I would rate this 3.5 stars.  I really want to love this device.  It's nice when it works, but it still has some way to go.  I hope that the company takes note and incorporates feedbacks from users.  The good thing is that most of the issues seem to be software-related, and I hope improvements will come in the software updates soon.
