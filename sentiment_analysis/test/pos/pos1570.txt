I love this mug. It is very difficult to tip over. The only way we could knock it over is if the surface it is sitting on isn't very smooth, but on your average table or desk it worked just fine. As a travel mug, I had an iced beverage in the mug? and left it in my car on a warm day. Six hours later I came back and the ice hadn't melted yet. Pretty impressive.
