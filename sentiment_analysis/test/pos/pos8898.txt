I've owned the lock, doorbell, keypad and connect for six months - and while I understand some of the criticisms in the reviews, my experience with the products has been outstanding.  The auto unlock feature works 95+ percent of the time, and it feels like a real luxury to have the door unlock for you as you walk up to it (like that magic that Steve Jobs always talked about).  The few times the auto unlock doesn't work, it usually is a result of me not having gone outside the proscribed geofence in the app (you adjust the area of the geofence in the app, and if you don't go outside that fence, then when you come back to the house it will not auto unlock).  My wife, who was highly skeptical of the idea of installing a smart lock (and generally dislikes technology), is now a strong believer and couldn't imagine going back to a "dumb" lock.For those few instances when the auto unlock doesn't trigger, I would hate to have to pull out my phone, open the app, and unlock the door.  Although this method always works and is a fail-safe, I vastly prefer to have the little keypad - punch in my code, and the lock unlocks for me. The keypad is great because (i) when I leave the house, I don't have to bring keys or my phone with me - I simply hit the red button on the keypad to lock the door when I leave (called the one-touch lock feature, which I use every time I leave the house and is a key part of the experience for me), and (ii) when I come back I punch in my code and the door unlocks.  It is also nice to be able to assign unique numbers to people on the fly.  Recently, I was able to assign a unique code from 1,500 miles away to our dog walker, who let herself in without any problem.The user experience around the doorbell has not been as good as the lock and the keypad, but with recent updates its performance has vastly improved.  I thought about purchasing the Ring doorbell to go with the lock, but I wanted one integrated experience at the door, all within one app (and I don't regret that decision at all).  In the first few months that I owned the doorbell, it had a lot of connectivity issues - but I think recent updates have fixed most if not all of those problems.  The most recent update included a motion detection feature which is really cool - any time someone is in front of my door I get a notification on my phone and the doorbell records high definition video of the encounter.  So, I can see various service people coming and going, the babysitter, the dog walker, housekeeper, my kids, and even some sketchy people (most likely door to door salesmen) that you'd never know had approached your house.  For the doorbell to work well, you need a pretty strong internet connection.  I have an airport express wifi extender about 20 feet from the door - and that seems to do the trick.Finally, the August system has been a real curiosity for visitors to our home.  We get lots of questions from people - what is that? How does it work?  It's a real conversation piece which I enjoy having with people.  Most of all, I feel liberated from the necessity of carrying keys in my pocket.  Having lived with the august system for six months, I'm convinced that within the next 5 years, smart locks and smart home entry systems will be as common as smart thermostats and other smart home products.What I'd like to see in the future?  Would love the August lock to communicate with my alarm system, so that when I come home, the alarm knows to automatically disarm.
