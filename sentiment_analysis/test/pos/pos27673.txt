Ok it's been about a month since I purchased 2 of these switches.  I'm not sure why others had problems with these because I've had zero problems with them.  I've set them up to turn on at sunset and turn off at sunrise and they've as intended with no issues.  I had a bit of a learning curve understanding the app but once I got it, boom it was smooth sailing from there.  I'm thinking about purchasing a couple more of these to give the impression someone's home and moving about the house.  Great product and I hope they're as reliable as they are cool!
