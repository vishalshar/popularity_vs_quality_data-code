When I saw this on Shark Tank I knew I had to have one.  I spent 40+ years in the medical field and I realize how much bacteria can be on items you use all the time.  The UV light stays on for 5 minutes then turns off automatically.  I have not done cultures on my phone but I do know UV light kills all bugs and I feel better about using my phone especially when out to eat.  Great product!!
