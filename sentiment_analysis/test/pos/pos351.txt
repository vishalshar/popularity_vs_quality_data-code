We have the Petzi treat cam for about a month now and love it. It was super easy to set up and works great. Telling our dog to "get on your bed" then rewarding him has greatly reduced his jumping up on us when we arrive home. We simply connect to the Petzi when we arrive at home and he runs to his bed waiting for his reward vs jumping up on us. Great device.
