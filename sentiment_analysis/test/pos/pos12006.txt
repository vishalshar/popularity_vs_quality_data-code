This is a great little product! Best used on an empty stomach & it's not as strong as prescription sleep aids of course, but still the best thing I've found on the market to help with sleeplessness. Each bottle comes sealed & you can buy a 4-pack at Target for $8.99. It's a little higher here but Amazon is more dependable having it where the local stores sell out. There's also a coupon inside each box for $1 off. So far I've had a coupon in every 4 pack I've bought & I've been buying these for about 2 yrs. now.
