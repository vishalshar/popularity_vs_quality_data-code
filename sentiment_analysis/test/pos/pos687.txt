I recently switched from the iPhone 4S to the iPhone 5 and had to order a new Rokform case.  I was amazed at the improvements that have made to the latest version of the Rokform case.  In addition to being the best case for car and bike mounting the case provides excellent protection without being too bulky.  My iPhone 4S Rokform case saved my last iPhone several times when I dropped it.  The iPhone 5 case appears to provide even better protection than the iPhone 4S case.  The car mount can be a little stiff for the first few weeks, but after a while it provides the perfect balance between ease of attachment and stability.  I have used dozens of iPhone cases over the years and this case is by far the best.  I couldn't be happier with this product.
