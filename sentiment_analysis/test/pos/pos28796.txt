While everyone is switching to warmer drinks just in time for the fall, I am a cold coffee year round kind of person. My roommates often complain when I leave a mason jar full of coffee grounds and water in the kitchen overnight, and more than a few times it has been thrown out do to it looking unpleasant! However, this little gadget is amazing at making cold brew coffee. I find that Im using much less coffee because I can make enough for me and throw it in the fridge while getting ready for work instead of having to prepare a larger amount 12 hours in advance. I did not add ice to the top section as I knew that I was placing the cup in the fridge to brew. The coffee running through (you can see in the photos Ive posted, albeit a little foggy from the fridge condensation) turned out decently strong and was not bitter to taste. The coffee I chose to test it out with was a pecan maple coffee and you could taste both flavors beautifully.Overall, if you enjoy iced coffee every now and then or need an easy way to transport the cold coffee to your workplace or wherever, I would buy this. The compartments are handy, it seems relatively non-spill and the overall look of the item is nice.
